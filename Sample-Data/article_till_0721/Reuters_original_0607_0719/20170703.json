The benchmark 10-year yield dipped 0.5 basis point to 0.080 percent after rising to a 3-1/2-month high of 0.085 percent late last week as the JGB market tracked a broad rise in yields by its global peers.

The dollar index against a group of six major currencies was 0.1 percent higher at 95.729, crawling off a nine-month trough of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as hawkish comments from central bankers increased expectations that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and Bank of Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy. The dollar added 0.1 percent to 112.435 yen after briefly falling to 111.900 earlier before climbing back quickly. The dip was seen as a knee-jerk reaction to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party suffering a historic defeat in an election in the capital Tokyo on Sunday, signalling potential trouble ahead for the premier.  The Tokyo election won't have a strong market impact, in my view, as there are no opposition parties in Japan that can immediately replace the (ruling) LDP,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The currency market is more focused on monetary policy changes in Europe and other regions. That the BoE and BOC now appear to be in a hurry to normalise monetary policy was a big surprise last week.  The Bank of Japan, still deeply committed to monetary easing, was seen being left behind with its Group of Eight counterparts already on the path towards monetary tightening or seemingly headed towards it.  It would be inevitable for the BOJ to be seen as the odd one out, still sticking to its large-scale easing, and provide strategic incentive for speculators,  said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.  An environment is being set up in which the yen depreciates while others gain.  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.1413 after reaching a near 14-month high of $1.1445 on Friday. Scepticism that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year amid a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data have further boosted the euro. The pound was down 0.2 percent at $1.3003 following an advance on Friday to $1.3030, its strongest since May 23. The Canadian dollar was 0.15 percent weaker at C$1.2985 per dollar. It was still within reach of C$1.2947, its strongest in nine-months, marked on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and a central bank report that further bolstered rate hike expectations. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand is driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, the BOC said in a report on Friday. The Australian dollar was 0.15 percent lower at $0.7678. The currency kept close to a three-month high of $0.7712 scaled on Friday against a wobbly dollar on a combination of higher commodity prices and China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showing strong factory growth. However, Monday's Caixin/Markit PMI private survey that also pointed to firm factory growth in China  - Australia's major trading partner -  drew little reaction from the Aussie.  The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7320 after touching a five-month high of $0.7347 on Friday against a broadly weaker dollar.

The pound was down 0.2 percent at $1.3003 following an advance on Friday to $1.3030, its strongest since May 23. The Canadian dollar was 0.15 percent weaker at C$1.2985 per dollar. It was still within reach of C$1.2947, its strongest in nine-months, marked on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and a central bank report that further bolstered rate hike expectations. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand is driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, the BOC said in a report on Friday. The Australian dollar was 0.15 percent lower at $0.7678. The currency kept close to a three-month high of $0.7712 scaled on Friday against a wobbly dollar on a combination of higher commodity prices and China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showing strong factory growth. However, Monday's Caixin/Markit PMI private survey that also pointed to firm factory growth in China  - Australia's major trading partner -  drew little reaction from the Aussie.  The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7320 after touching a five-month high of $0.7347 on Friday against a broadly weaker dollar.

(BOC, A/Stable) Hong Kong branch's proposed long-term senior unsecured US dollar notes to be issued under its medium-term note (MTN) programme. The notes will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity structure will be finalised upon settlement. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to the information already received. Fitch first rated BOC's MTN programme at 'A'/'F1' on 9 December 2013, which was subsequently affirmed on 23 May 2017. The programme's size was increased from USD20 billion to USD30 billion on 7 April 2017 to meet the bank's funding needs. KEY RATING DRIVERS BOC's Hong Kong branch is part of the same legal entity as BOC. Therefore, the notes to be issued under the MTN programme represent BOC's direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are rated in line with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A'/Stable. The bank's IDR is underpinned by the agency's expectations of an extremely high probability of support from the Chinese government in the event of stress. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change to the proposed notes' rating will be correlated directly with changes in BOC's IDR, which will in turn reflect any shift in the perceived willingness or ability of the government to support the bank in a full and timely manner.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its July policy meeting on Tuesday and is almost certain to keep rates at 1.5 percent, where they have been since August last year. All eyes will be on the post-meeting statement for any hint of hawkishness given central banks in Europe and Canada had surprised recently by talking of the need for tighter policies. That change in tune led the futures market to abandon any thought of another easing in Australia and instead  imply a one-in-ten chance of a hike in rates by Christmas. Economists, though, remain much more circumspect and dovish. A Reuters poll of 50 analysts found all but one expected rates to stay steady this week and most saw no move until late 2018.   In our view the RBA is unlikely to be hawkish given still elevated labor market slack and subdued inflation,  said Tapas Strickland, an economist at NAB.  Nevertheless, the Statement could well read more positively given May's stellar labor figures and the market might well infer a hawkish tilt even if it isn't,  he added. Employment blew past forecasts to jump 42,000 in May, a third straight month of upbeat outcomes that drove the jobless rate to a four-year trough of 5.5 percent. Leading indicators of labor demand are also healthy with ANZ's measure of job advertisements climbing 2.7 percent in June to its highest since 2011.  We think the strength of employment will be a key factor in stabilizing, and possibly lifting, consumer sentiment,  said David Plank, ANZ's head of Australian economics.  This will be important in ensuring downside risks to the economy don't materialize.  The upbeat tone was echoed by an inaugural series of surveys from CBA and Markit which showed robust activity in both manufacturing and services during June. The run of improving numbers could lead the RBA to upgrade its view of the labor market, which it has been characterizing as no better than  mixed . Yet too cheerful a message could lift the local dollar, which is already at heights considered unhelpful for exports.  It's a conundrum for the RBA which wants to avoid a stronger currency,  said NAB's Strickland. The Aussie stood at $0.7678 on Monday, just off a three-month peak. There have been some calls for the RBA to tighten policy to head off a debt-driven bubble in the housing market. Instead, regulators chose to crack down on bank lending to investors, pushing up mortgage rates for a range of products. The tactic seems to be working. Figures from property consultant CoreLogic on Monday showed home prices rose only 0.8 percent in the June quarter, the smallest increase since late 2015, with Sydney recording a notable slowdown.

The country's oldest newspaper house, owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Financial Review, was midway through spinning off its property listings unit when TPG Capital Management LP and Hellman & Friedman made buyout approaches in May. With neither firm lodging a binding offer by a June 30 deadline, Sydney-headquartered Fairfax said it would now press ahead with a break-up which would see it list its biggest revenue generator, Domain.  It appeared that the complication of our business was such that they didn't want to bid for the whole business,  Fairfax Chairman Nick Falloon told an analyst briefing on Monday morning. Fairfax shares fell as much as 13 percent, hitting their lowest intraday level since March, 92 cents, compared with the higher of the private equity indicative bids, A$1.25. The stock traded at A$5.00 in 2007. Traditional media companies around the world have been in decline as customers seek content more cheaply online and advertisers focus their spending on internet giants like Facebook Inc and Google. Domain however has benefited from a property boom in Sydney and Melbourne. A standalone Domain listing will see it compete more directly with REA Group Ltd, a property classifieds business two-thirds owned by News Corp. Silver Lining REA shares have doubled in two years and Fairfax shareholders have long hoped for similar returns from a Domain listing, with Fairfax keeping up to 70 percent of the unit.   Domain's continuing to grow and ... get closer to REA,  said Reece Birtles, managing director at fund manager Martin Currie Australia, Fairfax's second-biggest shareholder.  The digitization of the traditional newspaper business is removing significant costs, so we think they have a good future.  Fairfax said that while overall revenue fell about 6 percent for the year to June 30, Domain's revenue grew about 10 percent, including an increase of 22 percent in digital revenue. It said it expected to report pre-tax profit between $262 million and A$266 million for the year, in line with analyst expectations and down as much 7.5 percent on the previous year. A Hellman & Friedman spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. TPG confirmed on Sunday that it had abandoned its bid without offering an explanation.  The troubles for Australia's media are not limited to newspapers.

The bilateral talks were aimed at confirming close cooperation among the United States, Japan and South Korea before a Group of 20 summit meeting to be held in Hamburg, Germany, later this week, the spokesman said.  Trump was also scheduled to talk by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the White House said on Saturday.  Trump held a summit with Xi in April. The U.S. president has been focused on trying to work with China to ratchet up pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which are a threat to the United States and allies South Korea and Japan. He met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on Friday, and is slated to hold bilateral meetings with Xi, Abe and Moon at the G20 summit. After the talks with Moon, Trump said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama. He also reiterated that an era of  strategic patience  over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended. Despite the tough rhetoric, it remains unclear how Trump will find a way forward on North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. Trump has recently taken a tougher line with China about Beijing's need to rein-in North Korea.

The country's oldest newspaper house, owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Financial Review, was midway through spinning off its property listings unit when TPG Capital Management LP and Hellman & Friedman made buyout approaches in May. With neither firm lodging a binding offer by a June 30 deadline, Sydney-headquartered Fairfax said it would now press ahead with a break-up which would see it list its biggest revenue generator, Domain.  It appeared that the complication of our business was such that they didn't want to bid for the whole business,  Fairfax Chairman Nick Falloon told an analyst briefing on Monday morning. Fairfax shares fell as much as 13 percent, hitting their lowest intraday level since March, 92 cents, compared with the higher of the private equity indicative bids, A$1.25. The stock traded at A$5.00 in 2007. Traditional media companies around the world have been in decline as customers seek content more cheaply online and advertisers focus their spending on internet giants like Facebook Inc and Google. Domain however has benefited from a property boom in Sydney and Melbourne. A standalone Domain listing will see it compete more directly with REA Group Ltd, a property classifieds business two-thirds owned by News Corp. Silver Lining REA shares have doubled in two years and Fairfax shareholders have long hoped for similar returns from a Domain listing, with Fairfax keeping up to 70 percent of the unit.   Domain's continuing to grow and ... get closer to REA,  said Reece Birtles, managing director at fund manager Martin Currie Australia, Fairfax's second-biggest shareholder.  The digitization of the traditional newspaper business is removing significant costs, so we think they have a good future.  Fairfax said that while overall revenue fell about 6 percent for the year to June 30, Domain's revenue grew about 10 percent, including an increase of 22 percent in digital revenue. It said it expected to report pre-tax profit between $262 million and A$266 million for the year, in line with analyst expectations and down as much 7.5 percent on the previous year. A Hellman & Friedman spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. TPG confirmed on Sunday that it had abandoned its bid without offering an explanation.

Housing is the key cyclical sector in the Chinese economy, and will weigh on growth in the second half of the year and into 2018. There is already evidence that the housing market is slowing. Growth in new residential property sales decelerated to 24.0% yoy (on a trailing 12-month basis) in May 2017, down for the fifth straight month from the 36.2% peak in December 2016. Price gains have also moderated. Secondary home prices in Tier 1 cities rose by 28.7% in 2016, but increased by just 3.6% in the first five months of 2017, and fell for the first time since September 2014 in May. The downturn has been policy driven, with the authorities stepping in to prevent excessive froth in the market. Tightened rules on home purchases and mortgages are curbing buying by speculators and upgraders. Some first-time buyers might also be postponing purchases in the expectation that prices may fall. Meanwhile, the increased focus of the authorities on controlling leverage and limiting financial risks has led to a significant rise in money-market interest rates since last December, and some banks have recently increased mortgage rates. The near-term outlook for China's housing market is closely linked to the domestic credit cycle. As the chart below shows, housing sales move broadly in line with the  credit impulse  - or the change in the flow of new credit (including local government bonds) as a share of GDP. A weaker credit impulse, along with the tightening of home purchase restrictions, is likely to drag down home sales growth further in 2H17. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/credit_impluse_points_to_slower_home_sales _growth?src=embe d  title= Credit Impluse Points to Slower Home Sales Growth  width= 550  height= 647  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > That said, the government will want to avoid causing significant volatility in the market. Home sales dropped by 9% yoy in early 2015, following the last tightening of restrictions, which contributed to a strong release of pent-up demand when policies were subsequently relaxed. We expect a more cautious approach this time, which is likely to result in home sales stalling, but not falling, in 2H17. House prices are likely to decline slightly in 2H17, as demand weakens. We expect prices in Tier 1 cities to hold up better than in lower-tier cities. Prices in Tier 1 cities have risen by almost 90% in the last four years, compared with increases of 10%-25% in lower-tier cities. However, demand in Tier 1 cities remains strong and land supply is tight, which gives the authorities more scope to support the market if the downturn is sharper than expected. In lower-tier cites, demand is weaker and developers' housing inventories are higher. A likely weakening in the housing market is one of the main reasons behind our forecast that GDP growth will slow in 2H17. Investment in housing alone accounts for around 10% of GDP, and most estimates place its contribution to GDP much higher once supporting industries are included. There tends to be a six- to eight-month lag from sales to housing investment growth, which means that the economic impact of the housing market slowdown will continue well into 2018, when we expect GDP growth to slip slightly below 6%.

His homecoming Sunday will be hard to top. Suzuki hit two home runs, including a tiebreaking solo shot in the top of the 12th inning, powering the Braves to a 4-3 victory against the Oakland Athletics and a three-game series sweep. Leading off the 12th, the former Athletic launched John Axford's 3-1, 96 mph fastball into the left-center-field seats for his sixth home run of the season. Suzuki also led off the second inning with a homer.  I want to do good every time, but it gives you a little bit extra adrenaline,  Suzuki said of coming to Oakland.  I got a little bit of cheers in the beginning of the game. I'm definitely very blessed and humbled. This was a great place for me. My family and I, we had a great time here.  The fans embraced me from Day 1, good and bad. To come back here, I definitely had some adrenaline going.  Suzuki hit two home runs in a game for the third time in career. The first two occurrences came with Oakland in 2010 and 2011. Until Sunday, Suzuki had gone homerless against the A's in 12 games. He didn't play in either of the first two games of the series. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at AthleticsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch I told him yesterday, 'I got to break you out or these people are going to kill me,'  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  It was great. Couldn't happen to a better guy.  Braves right-hander Arodys Vizcaino gave up a two-out single to Khris Davis in the bottom of the 12th and walked Yonder Alonso, who was named to the American League All-Star team Sunday for the first time. However, Vizcaino retired Franklin Barreto on a fly ball to record his second save of the season. The Braves took a 3-2 lead in the top of the 11th when Matt Kemp hit an RBI double off the center field fence with two outs, scoring Nick Markakis, who had walked. The A's answered with a run in the bottom of the 11th off closer Jim Johnson (6-1). Johnson issued a leadoff walk to Davis and walked Alonso on five pitches. Barreto struck out, but Bruce Maxwell doubled off the right field fence, scoring Davis to make it 3-3. Jaycob Brugman was intentionally walked, loading the bases for Adam Rosales. Rosales hit a fly ball to shallow center, but Ender Inciarte, who was playing in a few steps, made a spectacular sliding catch. Johnson struck out Rajai Davis to end the inning. Inciarte, who won a Gold Glove last season and was named to the National League All-Star team for the first time Sunday, had three hits, including an RBI double.  As soon as the ball was hit, I reacted quick,  Inciarte said. I had a good jump. The whole way, I knew I was going to get it. I had to.  Davis slugged his team-high 23rd home run, a solo shot in the seventh. The A's lost their fifth straight game overall and their seventh straight at home.  We had one big inning where we had a chance to win it,  Oakland anager Bob Melvin said.  We didn't do much before that. We maximized our opportunity in one inning and we didn't come through, and that cost us.  Braves right-hander Julio Teheran allowed two runs on three hits over 6 1/3 innings in a no-decision, turning in another strong road start. He is 5-0 in eight road games and 1-6 in nine starts at home. Teheran struck out a season-high eight and walked four. A's left-hander Sean Manaea gave up two runs on six hits, including a home run, over 7 1/3 innings in a no-decision. He struck out six and walked two. Axford (0-1) took the loss. The Braves took a 2-0 lead in the top of the second inning. Suzuki launched a leadoff homer, his fifth blast of the season. Manaea got ahead 0-2 in the count but threw an elevated outside fastball just off the plate, and Suzuki sent it into the left field seats.  He's got some power and he's smart, and he knows when to look for a fastball and get the head out, and he did both times,  Melvin said. Danny Santana followed with a walk and stole second. With two outs, Inciarte brought Santana home from third with a double to right on a ground ball down the line that got past first baseman Alonso. The A's (35-47) pulled even with two runs in the seventh. Davis led off with a home run to right-center. With one out, Barreto singled on a pop fly that second baseman Brandon Phillips lost in the sun. Barreto stole second before Teheran walked Maxwell and Brugman, loading the bases. Rosales hit a sacrifice fly off reliever Jason Motte to make it 2-2. The Braves won for the eighth time in their past 11 games and pulled within one game of .500 at 40-41.  We feel like we haven't played our best baseball yet, and that's a good sign because we're still right in the thick of things,  Suzuki said. NOTES: A's RHP Jesse Hahn was optioned to Triple-A Nashville. In each of his past two starts, both losses to Houston, Hahn lasted only two innings. He gave up a combined 16 runs on 15 hits, including three home runs. Oakland recalled RHP Zach Neal from Triple-A Nashville. ... A's 3B Ryon Healy left the game after the bottom of the second inning with upper back spasms and is day-to-day. ... Braves LF Danny Santana, who stole three bases on Saturday, had another steal in the second inning Sunday. ... Oakland SS Marcus Semien (fractured right wrist) will likely be reinstated from the disabled list before the All-Star break, manager Bob Melvin said. Melvin pointed to the Athletics' four-game series at Seattle on July 6-9 as the target for Semien's return. Semien began his rehab assignment with Class A Stockton then moved to Triple-A Nashville on Saturday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-braves-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED73HTCUDI"},

Merrifield had three hits, including two doubles, and stole three bases as the Royals bested the Minnesota Twins 6-2 on Sunday. The Royals took three of four from the Twins in the series. The teams are tied for second in the American League Central with 41-40 records, three games behind Cleveland.  We're playing good baseball right now,  Merrifield said.  We're right in the middle of the hunt. All in all, we're in a pretty good spot.  The Royals had lost seven of their first eight games to the Twins this season.  Huge,  Kansas City starter Travis Wood said of winning the series.  To take three out of four from these guys, who were ahead of us, shows that we're here to play some good ball and keep moving forward.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at RoyalsMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchTwins left-hander Hector Santiago (4-8) was removed after 3 1/3 innings after allowing four runs, four hits, a walk and a hit batter. He has not won since May 3 and his ERA is 5.63. The Royals scored three runs in the third inning and two in the fourth. Alex Gordon was hit by a pitch with one out in the third inning and scored on Merrifield's double into the left-center gap. Merrifield stole third and scored on Eric Hosmer's two-out double to right. Salvador Perez singled to center, scoring Hosmer.  I didn't know they (outfielders) were that far over, for sure,  Santiago said.  You try to pitch, get the guy out, some him soft contact, so I went a little bit slower on the curveball and when it went up, I thought fly ball to right field, but nobody's there so they get a double of it.  It definitely (stinks) and then you make good pitches to Salvy and he hits it off the end of the bat and bloops it over the shortstop, so good piece of hitting on his part and good job by Hosmer to make that adjustment and pull it over there.  Ramon Torres led off the fourth with a walk and scored on Alcides Escobar's double. Gordon singled to right to drive in Escobar. Santiago didn't make it out of the inning.  He couldn't get off the field in the third, and then he walked the leadoff hitter in the fourth,  Molitor said.  I thought we still had a chance, given the state of their bullpen and usage in the doubleheader and I tried to minimize there and keep us in the game as close as we could.  Left-hander Wood, who has making his first start since Sept. 19, 2015, while with the Chicago Cubs, held the Twins scoreless for the first four innings but was removed in the fifth when he faced three batters and retired none as his pitch count ascended.  The fifth inning didn't go the way I wanted it,  Wood said.  You can't walk the leadoff guy there. That's unacceptable.  Byron Buxton led off the inning with a five-pitch walk. Jason Castro and Brian Dozier singled for the first run. Scott Alexander (1-2) replaced Wood, who had thrown a season-high 81 pitches. Alexander gave up a run-producing single to Robbie Groasman. After retiring Joe Mauer on a fielder's choice grounder, Alexander walked the dangerous Miguel Sano, who already had two singles, to load the bases with one out. Alexander got out of the jam when Eduardo Escobar grounded into an inning-ending double play. The Royals tacked on a run in the fifth when Alcides Escobar's single scored Jorge Soler, who led off the inning with a double and stopped at third on Torres' single. Kansas City manager Ned Yost had to squeeze five innings out of four relievers after Wood left. They responded by holding the Twins to two hits and no runs.  The analogy is you get on a horse and ride it until it drops dead,  Yost said.  And that's what I feel like we're doing to the bullpen right now as the result of four games in a short period. That takes a toll.  NOTES: Royals LHP Matt Strahm suffered a torn patellar tendon in his left knee. He will pursue a second opinion. It is undetermined whether surgery will be required. ...

Perry entered the last round a shot behind Kirk Triplett but made his way to the top with steady play in a bogey-free round that put him at 16-under-par and gave him a two-stroke win. The victory was Perry's fourth major title on the Champions Tour. He also won the U.S. Senior Open in 2013. “It's our goal to always win our championship,  Perry told reporters.  This trophy goes back a long way.” Brandt Jobe finished third at nine under while Tom Lehman and Fred Couples were tied at eight under. Perry’s win broke the major dominance of German Bernhard Langer, who had won the year’s first two major titles but finished tied for 18th this week. Perry birdied his first hole of the day and grabbed full command by the par-5 sixth where he made birdie for a two-stroke advantage.     The cushion would grow to as many as four shots, and while Triplett made a nice run to cut the lead to two with two holes to play he could get no closer, finishing the day with a one-over-par 71.     “It was a real struggle for me,  said Triplett.

What was it, they'd won 20 of the last 23 ... after the first two games against us,,  the San Diego Padres right-hander said.  I was pumped up to win this one. I wanted this one. I wanted to shut the door.  And shut the door Chacin did at Petco Park, holding the Dodgers scoreless through five tough innings before turning a five-run lead over to the bullpen. The Dodgers rallied late, but the Padres held on to win 5-3. Manuel Margot and Jose Pirela each drove in a pair of runs with two hits, and Hunter Renfroe went 4-for-4 as the Padres snapped the Dodgers' six-game winning streak against San Diego. The win was only the Padres' second in nine tries against the current National League West leaders.  Chacin worked hard for this one,  Padres manager Andy Green said after the Padres concluded a 5-4 homestand.  He pitched five hard-fought innings. He was always pitching in danger.  It wasn't necessarily pretty. Nine Dodgers reached base against Chacin via four hits, three walks and two hit batters. The Dodgers stranded nine over his five innings, with six of those abandoned in scoring position. Chacin (7-7) used 107 pitches to dodge trouble.  I grinded,  said Chacin.  They are a very good hitting team. I just wanted to keep the door shut.  Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at PadresLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchThe Dodgers didn't score after getting their first two batters on in the second. They didn't score after loading the bases in the third. They didn't score after putting runners in scoring position in the fourth and fifth. It probably didn't hurt that Chacin was pitching at home. He has a 4.52 ERA in 17 starts, but he is 5-2 at in nine starts at Petco Park, and he lowered his home ERA to 1.68 -- the second-best mark in the National League. Meanwhile, the Padres were scoring five runs on eight hits and a walk in 4 2/3 innings off right-handed starter Kenta Maeda (6-4), who faces an uncertain future according to Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. The Padres hadn't led the Dodgers in 32 innings before Margot homered with one out in the bottom of the first. The rookie center fielder drove a full-count pitch 402 feet to center. San Diego then added three runs in the second and one in the fourth off Maeda.  Today, Kenta just wasn't sharp,  Roberts said.  The fastball, there were moments where it was good. But the breaking ball, the slider, the curveball, he just left some pitches up. I think today was just one of those things that he wasn't sharp.  We wanted to see that attack mode we talked about, pitching with a purpose and going hard from the first pitch. I don't know if he didn't feel comfortable out there mechanically, physically. But it just wasn't what we've seen in his last outings.  Right now, we don't know exactly when we're going to next slot him in. I think it's kind of contingent on a couple other guys.  Maeda said,  It's disappointing, and even though I didn't have my stuff, I couldn't battle back. The result didn't really look too good today. I'm hoping I'll get back on the right track.  As you know, I started off on a pretty bad note, and I think I was able to get back on the groove a little bit, so I think it's really important that I have a pretty strong finish at the end. My last few outings I've been able to attack the zone pretty well. I'm going to try to get back to that.  The Padres' second-inning rally started with Erick Aybar getting hit by a Maeda pitch. Carlos Asuaje followed with a single, and rookie catcher Luis Torrens drew a walk to load the bases, bringing up Chacin with none out. The pitcher grounded the ball toward second. The Dodgers turned it into a double play, but Aybar scored to make it 2-0. Pirela and Margot then lined back-to-back, RBI doubles to the gap in left-center to make it 4-0. Torrens opened the fifth with an opposite-field single to right, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Pirela's second straight, two-out, run-scoring hit to make it 5-0. The Dodgers struck for two against the Padres bullpen in the sixth. Yasiel Puig singled with one out against rookie right-hander Phil Maton and moved to second on a walk drawn by pinch hitter Logan Forsythe. Left-hander Ryan Buchter replaced Maton and struck out pinch hitter Enrique Hernandez before Corey Seager delivered a two-run double. Los Angeles then pulled to within two in the seventh on Yasmani Grandal's 11th homer of the season, a 374-foot shot to left off Buchter. Left-handed reliever Brad Hand, the Padres' lone representative on the National League All-Star team, struck out two in a perfect eighth to lower his ERA to 2.47. And Brandon Maurer closed the door in the ninth to pick up his 16th save -- and 11th straight successful conversion.

A spot in Kyoto, another major tourist destination, jumped the second highest, rising 20.6 percent to 3.9 million yen per square meter. Prices rose 15.7 percent in Osaka to 11.8 million yen per square meter, although that was a smaller increase compared with 22.1 percent in 2015 - which was the biggest rise in Japan for that year.

The $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72-45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. It would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. The spending plan won passage in a 81-34 vote. Both bills now head to the Democratic-led Senate, which returns to session on Monday, for concurrence votes. The country's fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third-straight fiscal year on Saturday without a complete budget. A fiscal stalemate between Illinois' governor and Democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state's credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. The pair of decisive House votes set Democrats on a collision course with Rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to House Speaker Michael Madigan.  “The legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago,” Rauner said in a statement. “Instead, they allowed Mike Madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable.” Rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. In order for Rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 House Republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. The measure passed the House with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. In his own statement after the votes, Madigan praised how Republicans and Democrats together took a “crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way.” 'Bring This Madness to an End' The tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full-year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on Friday ordered increased payments on Medicaid provider bills. In giving Democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the legislation to the state Senate, some House Republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next year's elections and delivered a pointed challenge to Rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state’s fiscal health.  I say to the governor, if these bills pass the House and Senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. Have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills,” said State Representative David Harris, who was among 15 Republicans to side with Democrats.  Bring this madness to an end.  Their defiance came after House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, a Rauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent “an exercise in good faith,” given that negotiations involving some of the governor’s non-budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

Yet, even as markets welcome the recovery in factory activity, firms showed a reluctance to restock as business confidence slumped to the lowest for the year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in June, above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. That was well above the 49.5 level forecast by 25 analysts in a Reuters survey, and up from May's reading of 49.6, the first contraction in 11 months. Improved orders helped nudge activity into expansionary territory, even though firms surveyed noted demand still remained relatively subdued both in domestic and international markets. Total new orders rose to 51.0 - the highest level in three months - from the previous month's 50.3, with new export orders also rising. The rate of expansion in production also quickened in June, and the pace of job shedding - which has been persistent since late 2013 - eased to the slowest in three months. Chinese manufacturers' confidence about the 12-month outlook for production fell to the lowest level this year, the survey showed. And while businesses still remained generally optimistic, the overall mood was one of caution, underscoring challenges faced by companies as higher borrowing rates raise the costs of financing. The Caixin readings were echoed by the official PMI on Friday which also showed surprisingly robust growth in China's manufacturing sector, but the official data was still much more bullish compared to the private survey which tends to focus on smaller firms. The divergence suggests that much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, benefiting mainly large state-owned firms, as worsening financing conditions have in particular added to struggling smaller firms' plight. Pressure on Growth Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), forming the bulk of the country's private investors, contribute about 60 percent of China's industrial output and create 80 percent of China's jobs. But many of them are expected to go out of business this year, as profits shrank and bankruptcies rise.      That reinforced analyst views that economic growth is likely to slow in coming quarters given continued government efforts to rein in debt risks through a concerted deleveraging effort.  The June reading was more like a rebound, with an economic downtrend likely to be confirmed later,  Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release. Operationally, firms signaled further strain, highlighted by a sustained increase in backlogs of work, the survey found.  Companies adopted a relatively cautious stance towards their inventories, with both stocks of inputs and finished items declining in the month in a sign firms have been reluctant to actively restock. To make matters worse input prices rose on the back of higher raw material costs, suggesting a renewed pressure on operating margins. While manufacturers were able to pass on part of the higher costs to consumers, the underlying picture was one of trying to grow profits under a challenging economic climate.

Property consultant CoreLogic said its index of home prices for the combined capital cities rose 0.8 percent in June, following a rare 1.1 percent drop in May. Annual growth in prices also accelerated to 9.6 percent, from 8.3 percent the month before, though that was still down from a peak of 12.9 percent in March. The increase for the whole June quarter was also a modest 0.8 percent, the smallest since late 2015, with Sydney recording a notable slowdown. Any moderation will be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which is concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks. The country's main bank watchdog has already tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans and banks have followed by raising rates on some mortgage products. After cutting interest rates to a record low of 1.5 percent last August, the RBA has since warned further easing would only encourage more borrowing by already heavily indebted households.  We are likely to see further tightening and repricing around investment lending and interest only lending over the coming months,  said CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless.  Considering investors comprised just over 55 percent of new mortgage demand across New South Wales, a further slowdown in investment activity is likely to have a more substantial impact on housing demand in Sydney.  Annual price growth in Sydney ran at 12.2 percent in June, down from a top of 18.9 percent in March. Melbourne fared better, with prices up 1.5 percent in the June quarter and 13.7 percent for the year. The inexorable price rise in the major cities has taken homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers and become a political hot potato. The conservative government of Malcolm Turnbull has blamed a lack of supply for the problem, while the opposition Labor Party has pointed the finger at favorable tax treatment for property investment.

Brent crude futures added 6 cents or 0.1 percent to $48.83 per barrel by 0137 GMT, after jumping 5 percent last week for the first gain in six weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $46.19 per barrel after a more than 7 percent gain last week from depressed levels. Traders said U.S. prices were relatively stronger than Brent after U.S. drilling activity fell for the first time since January. Sentiment for the global Brent benchmark was more subdued due to rising output from within the the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  For the first time in 23 weeks, the number of drill rigs operating in the U.S. fell, down 2 to 756,  ANZ bank said on Monday, but added that  this exuberance may be tempered by news over the weekend that Libya oil production hit another record.  Despite the drop, the total rig count was still more than double the 341 rigs in the same week a year ago, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc. The slight cut in U.S. drilling for new production was met by a rise in output from within OPEC in June, up by 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) to an estimated 2017 high of 32.72 million bpd despite the group's pledge to hold back production in an effort to tighten the market. OPEC's high output is largely down to rising production from members Nigeria and Libya, which were exempted from the output cuts, and whose surge in supplies has undermined efforts by other members like Saudi Arabia to restrict supplies.

Big firms also saw the job market at its tightest in 25 years, offering policymakers some hope that companies may finally raise wages, helping broaden an economic recovery. The survey underscores the Bank of Japan's view that the economy is heading for a moderate expansion, though sources say weak price and wage pressures are likely to force it to slash its inflation forecasts later this month. The headline diffusion index (DI) measuring big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 17 in June, the BOJ's quarterly  tankan  survey showed on Monday, its third straight quarter of improvement and up from plus 12 in the previous survey in March. This exceeded a median market forecast of plus 15 and was the highest since March 2014, as automakers and machinery firms benefited from robust demand in Asia.  Taken together, the survey backs up the BOJ's optimism on the economy,  said Yuichiro Nagai, an economist at Barclays Securities. Related CoverageJapan June final manufacturing PMI 52.4 vs flash 52.0, final 53.1 in May But a gap remains between a strong economy and tepid inflation. If the BOJ revises down its price forecasts at the upcoming meeting, investors will recognize that an exit from ultra-loose monetary policy will be some time away.  Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index stood at plus 23, up from plus 20 in March and matching a median market, the tankan showed. It was the second straight quarter of improvement and the highest level since December 2015. Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen slightly three months ahead, the survey showed, underscoring their concern on overseas economic uncertainties. The tankan will be among factors the BOJ's nine-member board will scrutinize when it meets July 19-20 to review monetary policy and its quarterly growth and inflation estimates. A separate survey showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at a slightly slower pace in June, though an upward revision to export orders suggests the factory sector remains on a firm footing. Shortage of Employees, Capacity     Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and a boost from private consumption, prompting the BOJ to upgrade its economic assessment in April. But consumer inflation remains subdued as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households, underscoring the scale of the challenge the BOJ faces in achieving its ambitious 2 percent target. While companies remain wary of boosting wages or capital expenditure, there are signs of change as they face capacity shortages. An index measuring big manufacturers' production capacity showed more of them now feel they face a shortage, rather than an excess, of facilities to produce goods. Big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 8.0 percent in the current fiscal year to March 2018, exceeding market forecasts for a 7.4 percent rise, the survey showed. An index measuring job conditions showed big firms saw the labor market at the tightest since 1992, the tankan showed, reinforcing views a shortage of employees was among the key concerns for many companies. Japanese companies plan to increase hiring of new graduates by 8.1 percent in the next fiscal year beginning in April 2018, which would be the eighth straight year of gains, the tankan showed. The tankan's sentiment diffusion indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists. Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-tankan-idUSKBN19N0ZQ"},

India, like other nuclear nations, has been closely watching the fate of Japanese-owned Westinghouse, which filed for Chapter 11 in March after an estimated $13 billion of cost overruns at two U.S. projects, casting a shadow over the nuclear industry. There has been debate over potential U.S. support for the reactor maker since owner Toshiba (6502.T), the laptop-to-chips conglomerate, announced the blow-out at Westinghouse last year. Some form of U.S. backing or involvement, industry experts say, could avoid a Chinese or Russian buyer unpalatable to Washington, which would prefer to keep Westinghouse's advanced nuclear technology out of the hands of its foreign rivals. The White House declined comment.  We were told that, by the end of the year, Westinghouse would really rework its situation and really be back in business,  India's foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told a briefing, referring to an exit from bankruptcy. Civil nuclear cooperation has been a cornerstone of U.S.-India relations, and the proposed construction of six Westinghouse AP1000 reactors in India's Andhra Pradesh, announced in 2016, crowned more than a decade of diplomatic efforts. The achievement was left in limbo by Westinghouse's troubles.   Graphic on nuclear power plants in India: tmsnrt.rs/2tGjv8e The project, however, found specific mention in the Indian government's joint communique from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington a week ago. (bit.ly/2tsyEdb) The two leaders  looked forward to conclusion of contractual agreements between Westinghouse Electric Company and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for six nuclear reactors in India and also related project financing,  the communique said. Sources familiar with the matter said the statement was backed by U.S. guidance that Westinghouse would be sold to a U.S. investor after emerging from Chapter 11 proceedings, in turn paving the way to close the reactor deal in 2018. Elaborating, one industry source with direct knowledge of Westinghouse's talks with India said:  Both sides are engaged and once Westinghouse comes out of bankruptcy we would look to conclude the contract.  The source, who was not authorized to speak to media, requested anonymity. A diplomat involved in preparations for the Modi-Trump meeting corroborated this timeline, saying:  The bankruptcy is on track and should wrap up by year end.   Massively Important  Westinghouse and India's Department of Atomic Energy did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India could not be reached for comment.

Georgia Power/Handout viaFile PhotoToshiba said it wasn't in a position to predict when Westinghouse would emerge from Chapter 11. Because the bankruptcy court has not yet approved a restructuring plan, no decision has been taken on searching for a buyer, it said. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whom diplomats say plans to lead a business delegation to India in October, last week left the door open to a potential deal.  This is a lot bigger issue than just allowing the United States a couple of plants in the southern part of the United States,  he told reporters.  This is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America's allies.  Perry declined to elaborate on potential acquirers. FILE PHOTO: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs U.S. President Donald Trump as they give joint statements in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBut former Westinghouse executives have told Reuters that they have been approached by private equity funds to help them assess a possible deal to buy the company.  Paving the way for a deal, Toshiba has agreed on a liability cap on one of the U.S. projects, the unfinished Vogtle power plant in Georgia that is being led by Southern Co (SO.N). If a similar agreement can be reached for the VC Summer plant in South Carolina, which is co-owned by SCANA Corp (SCG.N), that would clear the path to an exit from Chapter 11, say people familiar with the matter.  The administration is hoping that the reconfigured company will be back in operation later this year - with a U.S. buyer - and the deal with India can be closed next year,  said Washington-based analyst Ashley Tellis, an authority on nuclear policy and former Republican official. Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was instrumental in negotiating a civil nuclear accord with India during the George W. Bush administration although, more than a decade on, it has yet to yield actual nuclear deals. Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, helped lay the ground for the talks on the civil nuclear accord. He would play a  critical role  in bringing the project to completion, added Tellis. Ahead of Modi's visit, a U.S. official had said the United States was  looking forward to U.S.-built nuclear reactors contributing to India's energy security .    We very much support continued negotiations between Westinghouse and its Indian partners, recognizing that deals on this scale can take time,  the official said.     Westinghouse has said it will concentrate on reactors only - and not construction - meaning it would require partners for its Indian and other projects. In India, its favored partner would be Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS), industry sources say.  We are capable of doing this, but of course the technology transfer has to happen,  said S.N. Roy, head of L&T;'s nuclear business, who confirmed L&T; had been approached by Westinghouse about being the general contractor.

He just went over it. Marte's lined a single to deep left-center field in the bottom of the ninth inning drove in Brandon Drury with the winning run in the Diamondbacks' 4-3 walk-off victory over the Colorado Rockies at Chase Field on Sunday, extending Arizona's franchise record start.  In that situation, you don't try to do too much,  said Marte, who was promoted from Triple-A Reno for the first time this season on Thursday after shortstop Nick Ahmed suffered a fractured wrist when he was hit by a pitch the day before.  Just put the ball in play and see what happens. I'm not scared. I do the best I can. I'm just coming here to help my team win.  Drury singled with one out the ninth inning off Adam Ottavino (1-3). Chris Iannetta doubled to put runners on second and third before Chris Rusin entered and the Rockies went to a five-man infield. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DiamondbacksColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchMarte's liner one-hopped the fence in left-center field for his first career walk-off hit, the Diamondbacks' sixth walkoff of the season.  A great moment for him, just getting called up,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  You always look for little push moments to help you move on to the next day. A bunch of people created that moment.  Chris Owings hit a two-run homer and Taijuan Walker gave up two runs (one earned) in seven innings as the Diamondbacks (52-31) remained one game ahead of the franchise record pace set in 2001. Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado had two hits and an RBI and DJ LeMahieu had two hits for Colorado (48-36), which has lost 10 of 11 and was 1-8 on a road trip to San Francisco, the Dodgers and Arizona. Colorado tied the score in the ninth inning on singles Ryan Hanigan, pinch-hitter Troy Wolters and Blackmon against Arizona closer Fernando Rodney (3-2). Rodney had not given up a hit since May 26 and had not given up an earned run since April 29. He has converted 21 of 25 save chances. Although he blew the save opportunity, he was credited with the win. Drury and Marte had two hits apiece for Arizona, which is 32-13 at home, the second-best home record in the majors behind NL West leader the Dodgers.  Right now, the offense is not clicking,  Colorado manager Bud Black said.  So am I concerned at the moment? I guess you can say, yes. But long term I know we are going to come out of it like good teams do. Like good offensive teams do.  We have good offensive players and collectively we are not doing it. Also on this trip we have not pitched well either.  Colorado's Ian Desmond walked with one out in the fourth inning and took second on an infield error before scoring on Trevor Story's single to center field to break a scoreless tie. Walker got out of the inning on a double play. Paul Goldschmidt walked to open the fourth inning against German Marquez and scored on Owings' one-out homer, his 12th home run of the season, for a 2-1 lead. Owings' previous career high for homers was six in 2014. The Rockies tied it at 2 in the fifth inning on consecutive singles by Blackmon, LeMahieu and Arenado. Walker got another double play grounder to end that threat. Marquez gave up three runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked three. NOTES: Arizona has four All-Stars -- 1B Paul Goldschmidt, 3B Jake Lamb, RHP Zack Greinke and LHP Robbie Ray. All were selected in the votes of players and managers. Colorado had four All-Stars -- 3B Nolan Arenado, CF Charlie Blackmon, 2B DJ LeMahieu and LHP Greg Holland. Arenado and Blackmon were voted in by the fans. ... Colorado LF Ian Desmond was removed from game with right leg cramp suffered while catching a Brandon Drury line drive for the second out in the fourth inning. The play before, Desmond had extended far over the left field fence in an attempt to catch RF Chris Owings' homer. ... Arizona OF Yasmany Tomas (groin/hip) suffered a setback when he was forced to leave a rehab game Saturday when feeling discomfort while sliding into second base on a double. ... Colorado has seven games remaining against Arizona and the Dodgers, the top two teams in the NL West. Arizona has 12 left against the Dodgers and will begin a three-game series on Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-diamondbacks-writethru-idUSMTZED73HOFIAZ"},

The industry's capitalisation in also likely to increase in 2017 due to capital injections. The profitability of Indonesia's reinsurance industry has been strong over the previous few years, recording a five-year average return on equity of 23%, due to local capacity optimisation, as reflected in a lower combined ratio of 83% in 2016 (2015: 91%). Fitch expects profitability to increase further following more efficient underwriting practices and increased reliance on underwriting activity. The agency also expects the industry's retention ratio to increase in 2017, as reinsurers receive more capital from parent companies. The industry's mitigation of catastrophe exposure has also improved, with most Indonesian reinsurers able to cover a return period of around 400-years, more that the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia's requirement of 250 years.

Assets under management at credit opportunities funds, which invest mostly in bonds with domestic ratings below Triple A, rose 65 percent to 1.09 trillion rupees ($17.1 billion) in the year to the end of April, according to data from Crisil. They increased further to a record 1.14 trillion rupees in May.  In the current scenario of low interest rates, the rise in appetite for credit opportunities funds can be attributed to the search for higher yields,  said Jiju Vidyadharan, director of funds and fixed income research at Crisil. Bonds that Crisil rates A currently yield 180 basis points more than AAA rated instruments.  A structural decline in term structure of interest rates in other asset classes such as bank fixed deposits, government bonds and tax-free bonds may have also contributed to an increase in the risk appetite,  said Dhawal Dalal, chief investment officer for fixed income at Edelweiss Asset Management. At the end of May, credit opportunities funds had allocated 47 percent of their portfolios to paper rated AA, 25 percent to A and below, 21 percent to AAA/A1+ and the rest to cash or unrated bonds, according to Value Research. The growth in credit funds has helped lower-rated companies tap the debt market at a time when banks, saddled with stressed assets, are cautious to lend.  Of late, debt capital markets have been taking up the space vacated by banks in terms of lending, especially in cases of highly rated transactions both in the plain vanilla and structured space,  said Amit Tripathi, chief investment officer for fixed income at Reliance Mutual Fund. Debt private placements of AA rated issuers nearly tripled to 867 billion rupees and those of A+ rated issuers nearly doubled to 248 billion rupees in the year to March from a year earlier, according to Prime Database. New Risks Investors have put so much money into credit funds that they could be hit hard in the event of sharp rating downgrades, analysts and regulators worry. On Thursday, Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman Ajay Tyagi cautioned that Indian mutual funds needed to improve their due diligence before investing in corporate bonds and not rely exclusively on credit ratings.  Care should be taken that non-performing loans do not get shifted to mutual fund portfolios by way of transfer of debt,  he said. There are plenty of recent examples of investors losing money because of credit risks. In May, a downgrade of IDBI Bank's debt instruments impacted the funds holdings its bonds. In February, Taurus Mutual Funds debt portfolios fell sharply after Ballarpur Industries was downgraded. Last year, Franklin Templeton Asset Management sold its entire holdings of Jindal Steel and Power at a loss following ratings downgrades. In 2015, a JP Morgan mutual fund suffered losses because of its holdings in Amtek Auto debt. The car components maker was finally forced into insolvency proceedings by the Reserve Bank of India two weeks ago. Some fund managers acknowledge the need for caution.  While markets in India provide adequate tools as well as underlying liquidity to manage duration risk, they don’t as yet on credit risk,  said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Asset Management. Credit opportunities funds have grown very strongly over the past couple of years, presumably because investors were attracted by the relative stability of their returns compared to duration-oriented funds, Choudhary said.  However, unless this is backed by a reasonable understanding of how credit risk works, and consequent deviation in returns that can occur versus expectations down the line, there is a risk that some investors may be over-allocating,  he said. Reliance Mutual Fund's Tripathi argues that diversification can mitigate some of the risks, as long as investors do their homework.  Rigorous credit evaluation is the best way to avoid these risks,  said Reliance Mutual Fund's Tripathi.  Some of the residual risks and exit options can be managed by adequate covenanting of various financial and operating parameters.  Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer for debt at Kotak Mutual Fund, took a more bullish tone.  Risk will always be there, we might see one or two freak cases every few years, but downgrades on bonds do not lead to default for investors.

We expect a rise in property, credit guarantee and engineering insurance following a larger government budget for infrastructure. This is despite slower growth of non-life premiums in 1Q17. The loss ratio for non-life improved following lower expense claims for property and motor vehicles in 2016. Fitch expects this lower trend to continue along with manageable protection from reinsurance coverage and expected growth in non-life premiums. Moreover, we estimate that motor premiums will not be significantly hurt by the tariff hike effective from April 2017, since over 70% of vehicle sales and a large proportion of motorbike sales are sold through financing schemes, whereas vehicle financing requires the buyer to take an insurance package. Fitch believes the life sector will continue to dominate total industry premiums. Bancassurance's share of life premiums overtook that of agents in 2016, and we believe bancassurance still holds great potential as the most effective distribution channel - taking into account its customer base, convenience and competitive pricing. Expansion to other channels should also continue, such as e-commerce which was up by 17.7% in 2016.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. shale firms are drilling themselves into a deep hole despite warnings from industry leaders about the risk of flooding the market with too much crude. Drilling and production are rising. Prices are declining. Companies are barely breaking even or losing money. Costs are starting to rise. And share prices are sliding. Current oil prices are not sustainable according to Harold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, said in an interview on June 28. Prices need to be above $50 per barrel to be sustainable and below $40 would force producers to idle rigs, Hamm said ( Harold Hamm warns oil prices below $40 will idle U.S. drilling , CNBC, June 28).  While this period of adjustment is going on, drillers don't want to drill themselves into oblivion. Back up, and be prudent and use some discipline,  he urged rival chief executives. Many of Continental's leases are in North Dakota's Bakken and Oklahoma, where wells are typically more expensive to drill and yield less oil than some other shale plays. The resurgence in shale drilling over the last year has been concentrated in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where costs are much lower and yields higher. There are now almost 370 rigs drilling for oil in the Permian compared with 50 in the Bakken, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes. The number of rigs drilling in the Permian has almost tripled since the end of April 2016, and the Permian now accounts for almost half of the rigs drilling for oil in the United States. But even in the Permian, shale firms have struggled to make money with oil prices stuck below $50, raising questions about the sustainability of the drilling boom. Many shale drillers claim they can drill wells profitability even with benchmark WTI prices below $50 as a result of significant cost reductions and improvements in efficiency. But most shale firms were still losing money or at best breaking even in the first quarter of 2017, even before the renewed slump in prices. Pioneer Resources says it has the largest acreage in the prolific Spraberry/Wolfcamp section of the Permian and low average royalty and acreage costs. Pioneer has been praised by equity analysts for its active hedging programme that aims to protect cash flow from short-term volatility in oil prices. But the company reported losses (negative net income) of $273 million in 2015 and $556 million in 2016. Pioneer reported a further loss of $42 million in the first quarter of 2017, despite the substantial rise in oil prices compared the same period a year earlier. Continental lost $354 million in 2015 and $400 million in 2016 before just about breaking even with net income of less than $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. EOG Resources, another prominent producer, reported a loss of $4.5 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2016 before turning a small profit of $29 million in first quarter 2017. Since the first quarter, WTI prices have fallen by more than $3.50 per barrel, or 7 percent, from an average of $51.78 in January-March to just $48.14 in April-June, intensifying pressure on shale producers even further. Many shale firms have hedging programmes that should protect them from the decline in prices in the short term, but most have hedged only a small proportion of next year's production. The current calendar strip allows producers to lock in WTI prices at just $50 for 2018, so most are waiting for a renewed rise in forward prices. But every week they wait, their hedging cover declines by around 2 percent, assuming they have an average hedge maturity of 12 months. In the meantime, producers are braced for cost inflation, with the major oilfield services firms pressing for price increases by the end of the year and into 2018. Since WTI prices peaked in late February, shale producers have added more than 150 extra rigs drilling for oil. The rig count is up by 430 over the last 12 months even though WTI prices are now $3 per barrel lower. But share prices for all the major producers are sliding. Pioneer's share price is down almost 15 percent since the start of the year. Continental is down 39 percent. EOG has fallen 13 percent. Many shale producers seem to be relying on OPEC to bail them out by cutting its own output further to drive WTI prices back above $50 per barrel. But it not be rational for OPEC to cut output if the only consequence was to encourage continued growth in U.S. shale. Key OPEC producers appear unenthusiastic about further cuts. If something cannot go on forever, it will stop. The slide in oil prices over the last four months is sending a signal to shale firms about the need to moderate drilling and production programmes. Either the drilling boom moderates very soon, or WTI prices are likely to fall below $40 per barrel to make it stop.

Agricultural Development Bank of China and China Development Bank, both rated A1/AA– (Moody's/S&P;), will sell renminbi notes of a combined 36 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) to onshore and offshore investors under the new  Bond Connect  scheme. The two offerings start today, although the CDB deal will run for two days, and are intended to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1. Bankers and investors, however, are still not clear how the offshore element of the deals will work, given that the landmark Bond Connect trading link is not yet up and running.  We still have lots of questions on the operation and lots of logistics need to be cleared,  said one banker involved in the two deals. Bond Connect promises to give offshore investors direct access to China's interbank bond market without the need to open custody and bank accounts on the mainland. Hong Kong and Chinese regulators did not set an official start date when they approved the link in May, but market participants have been working towards a launch on July 3, the first working day after the anniversary celebrations. Guidelines for the initiative arrived in early June, giving traders just a month to prepare for the launch. Late last week, underwriters were still trying to figure out their roles and investors were scrambling to check their eligibility under the scheme. One offshore investor, who had been asked to support the two pilot deals, told IFR the application had been unexpectedly rejected last week because the institution had already opened an onshore account. When asked last Thursday in Hong Kong if the path had been cleared for offshore investors to participate in onshore primary issues, Jimmy Jim, co-head of global markets department at ICBC (Asia), said the changes involved made Bond Connect a  revolution .  There are certain rules yet to be announced, so I don't have any inside information on that.  ICBC (Asia) is one of eight cross-border coordinators on the ABDC deal and one of 10 on the CDB offering. PILOT DEALS In the first phase, Bond Connect will allow foreign and Hong Kong investors to buy onshore bonds in the primary or secondary markets, under the so-called northbound trading link. Only new issues sold with a prospectus in both Chinese and English will be available to offshore investors. The first batch of primary issuers will be well-known Chinese borrowers already with international ratings, according to market sources. Beside the two policy banks, state-owned enterprises China Three Gorges and Aluminum Corporation of China are also among the first batch of issuers. One or two Panda bond offerings may also be included, sources have said. ADBC, which tapped the Dim Sum bond market in its previous offshore bond deal in 2014, is planning two rounds of tenders for the new offering, the first for both offshore and onshore investors on Monday morning and the second for offshore investors only on Monday afternoon. ADBC aims to raise up to 16 billion yuan from one-year, three-year and five-year notes. CDB, a frequent issuer in both renminbi and US dollars, at first did not make any special arrangements for offshore investors, but last Friday said it would add a day of marketing for offshore investors on Monday. The CDB issue will be split into 5 billion yuan one-year, 5 billion yuan three-year and 10 billion yuan 10-year tranches, to be priced on Tuesday. Both issuers will auction the notes through a public tender on the People's Bank of China's onshore issuance system. ADBC and CDB have each employed a large group of cross-border coordinators for their issues, in addition to onshore syndicate groups of 82 and 38 members, respectively. However, cross-border coordinators involved are not so sure about their jobs.  I think our role is to introduce offshore investors to the second round of the tender for ADBC in the afternoon,  said one of the cross-border advisers. The banker said the pricing for ADBC's notes should be decided after the first-round auction on Monday morning, but she did not know when the allocations would be confirmed. Another banker involved in the two deals said he was still waiting for clarification over his bank's role. OFFSHORE INTEREST? Despite the fanfare around the launch of Bond Connect, overseas appetite for renminbi bonds is likely to be limited. Foreign investors have been slow to take advantage of new rules allowing direct access to the onshore Chinese market, given expectations of further renminbi weakness and rising domestic yields. Market participants say recent signs of currency stabilisation, as well as higher yields and much better liquidity in the onshore market than in the offshore Dim Sum arena, will help rekindle international interest in onshore renminbi bonds.  In general we see strong value in the onshore renminbi- denominated Chinese government bonds and policy bank bonds as we see their bonds yields are too high relative to the benign inflation in China,  said Ken Hu, CIO for Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco. He cautioned, however, that the scheme may cause some  teething problems  for the international custodian banks as the operational details were only recently released. Analysts say it will take more time for foreign investors to get comfortable with the new framework.  I suppose the offshore demand (for the policy bank notes) will be primarily from offshore Chinese investors,  said a credit analyst at a foreign bank, one of the 20 onshore market makers under the Bond Connect scheme.  The schedule is so tight, but applications take time. So, why should foreign investors rush? Why not wait until everything is sorted out?  International investors still have questions about mutual supervision, withholding tax, beneficial ownership and the treatment of the scheme under European UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) regulations, analysts say. It is also not yet clear whether entities that already have access to Chinese bonds through QFII quotas or onshore accounts are eligible under Bond Connect.  The background for the Bond Connect is very much to diversify the investor base (for onshore bonds). In that sense, it is an issue for Bond Connect to look at how to avoid the duplication of the investor base,  said Jim of ICBC (Asia). The rush to market, however, underlines China's determination to attract global investment into its domestic bond market.  Every reform here starts with a pilot programme,  said a DCM banker.

Kang, a two-times U.S. Women’s Amateur champion, took longer to win as a pro than many expected but finally closed the deal with a three-under-par 68 for a one-shot victory over Canadian Brooke Henderson at Olympia Fields. K.S. Kang was unable to witness his daughter's victory, however, having died of cancer in late 2013 near the end of her second year on the LPGA Tour.  If I could wish anything, I would wish that my dad saw me win,  an emotional Kang told reporters, tearfully revealing a tattoo with the word ‘dad’ in Korean on the outside of her right hand.  It’s been a really difficult road for me the past four or five years, and it’s life, though. You have to pick yourself up and keep working hard at it and then believe in what you’re doing and not letting yourself down.  California-born Kang broke clear with four consecutive birdies from the 11th hole as her putter caught fire, but fell back into a tie with Henderson after bogeying the par-three 17th, where she found a bunker with her tee shot. But Kang held her nerve at the par-five 18th, hitting two near-perfect shots to the heart of the green before two-putting to cap her victory with a closing birdie.

I took some extra time trying to read and get (the pace) right,  said Henderson, whose ball hit a couple of bumps en route to the hole and lost speed quicker than it might have with a smooth roll.

I really wanted to do it again and I gave myself the best opportunity to do that.  South Korean Chella Choi, who started the final round tied with Kang, carded 71 to finish third on 10-under. Earlier, a freight train rumbled past barely 50 yards from the first tee as Kang and Choi started the final round, a modest crowd of perhaps 200 people following the leaders, many more preferring to watch former child prodigy Michelle Wie. Four hours later Kang had center stage, and her thoughts were with her parents.  I’m sure my dad was with me every step of the way like he usually is and I just am so glad that my mum was right outside the ropes,  the 24-year-old said.

The dollar index against a group of six major currencies was 0.05 percent higher at 95.675, crawling off a nine-month trough of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as hawkish comments from central bankers increased expectations that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and Bank of Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy. The dollar was little changed at 112.290 yen after briefly falling to 111.900 earlier before climbing back quickly. The dip was seen as a knee-jerk reaction to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party suffering an historic defeat in an election in the capital Tokyo on Sunday, signalling potential trouble ahead for the premier.  The Tokyo election won't have a strong market impact, in my view, as there are no opposition parties in Japan that can immediately replace the (ruling) LDP,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The currency market is more focused on monetary policy changes in Europe and other regions. That the BoE and BOC now appear to be in a hurry to normalise monetary policy was a big surprise last week.  The euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.1422 after reaching a near 14-month high of $1.1445 on Friday. Scepticism that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year amid a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data have further boosted the euro. The pound was down 0.1 percent at $1.3015 following an advance on Friday to $1.3030, its strongest since May 23. The Canadian dollar was 0.1 percent weaker at C$1.2979 per dollar. It was still within reach of C$1.2947, its strongest in nine-months, marked on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and a central bank report that further bolstered rate hike expectations. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand is driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, the BOC said in a report on Friday. The Australian and New Zealand dollars were little changed at $0.7691 and $0.7329, respectively.

With 60 percent of votes counted, investor favorite Pinera, 67, a billionaire who governed Chile from 2010 to 2014, had 57 percent of Alianza votes cast, the country's electoral service Servel said. That represented a decisive win over right-wing populist Manuel Jose Ossandon and the more socially liberal Felipe Kast, who had 29 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Chile's relatively minor left-wing Frente Amplio coalition also held its primaries on Sunday, with journalist Beatriz Sanchez easily beating sociologist Alberto Mayol as expected. Sunday's results narrow Chile's presidential field to four major candidates and Pinera's win will be welcome by the business community in one of South America's most stable and affluent countries. Investors blame a flurry of economic reforms by center-left President Michelle Bachelet for sowing uncertainty, and they see Pinera as the best alternative to boost growth.

His administration's responses were often seen as out of touch and social groups continue to oppose him.  According to the most recent poll by pollster CEP, released in June, Pinera leads the November election with around 24 percent of the vote. Leftist journalist Alejandro Guillier of the center-left Nueva Mayoria bloc, which did not participate in primaries, is in second place with 13 percent. Slideshow (2 Images)Sanchez followed with 5 percent, while Carolina Goic of the centrist Christian Democratic Party, which also skipped primaries, is trailing with 2 percent. Bachelet is not allowed to seek re-relection, as Chile's constitution bans presidents from seeking consecutive terms.  If no candidate receives 50 percent in the first round in November as is likely, the election will go to a run-off in December. A runoff is seen as much tighter, particularly if the now fractured left unifies around one candidate. Turnout was considered moderate given that Chile's national soccer team played Germany in the Confederations Cup finals while the polls were open. Chile lost 1-0.

Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at AngelsPaxton was aware of the perfect game but not thinking about it.  There was a lot of game left at that point,  he said. That was no understatement. Leading 2-0, Paxton tired in the seventh, walking two and giving up a run-scoring single to Yunel Escobar. He exited for Cishek, who got Andrelton Simmons to hit his first pitch for a double-play comebacker to end the threat. In the eighth, Segura singled and Ben Gamel walked to put two on for Cano, who slugged a slider from reliever Keynan Middleton off the foul pole in right field for his 17th homer of the season. The Angels rallied against Nick Vincent in bottom of the eighth, greeting him with four straight singles by Martin Maldonado, Luis Valbuena, pinch-hitter Nick Franklin and Ben Revere, making it 5-2 with the bases loaded and no outs. That's when Heredia stepped up. Cameron Maybin slugged a line drive to dead center that was over Heredia's head, but the second-year import from Cuba reached over his head to make the catch with his back to the infield, turning a potential game-tying extra-base hit into an out.  He really has a feel for the wall,  Servais said.  It was a great play that turned the game around.  Segura said,  The guy is unbelievable. You don't see many center fielders making plays like that, having to jump in front of the wall. He made it look easy.  The Angels' Jesse Chavez (5-9) took the loss after giving up two runs and four hits in five innings.  He kept us in the game but made a lot of pitches,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  Keynan tried to hit the corner against Cano but left it out over the plate. We competed and they made a lot of big plays.  A run scored on Maybin's fly, but reliever Marc Rzepczynski got Kole Calhoun to pop out, and Diaz retired Albert Pujols on a groundout to end the rally. Diaz worked a 1-2-3 ninth for the save. Paxton has been aces against the Angels with a 4-2 record and 2.04 ERA in his nine career starts, allowing three runs or less in each game. The Mariners scored runs in the third and fifth innings with the same combination of hitters. A walk, single by Boog Powell and an RBI single by Segura gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead in the third. Powell, just recalled from Triple-A Tacoma, singled with one out in the fifth and scored from first on Segura's line-drive double to the wall in left center. NOTES: CF Mike Trout won't travel with the Angels to Minnesota for their three-game series, but he will work out with the club's Class A Inland Empire farm team on Monday and Tuesday. He will be re-evaluated after Tuesday's workout and could make a rehab start with Inland Empire and possibly be activated for the Angels' last series before the All-Star break on July 7-9 at Texas. ... Angels RHP Matt Shoemaker is expected to make a start before the All-Star break. He threw a bullpen workout Saturday and reported no pain in his strained forearm. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz was not in the lineup after injuring his right knee sliding into second base early in Saturday's 4-0 loss to the Angels. Cruz ranks second in the American League in RBIs (59) but has gone 22 games without hitting a home run, the last coming June 4. ... The Mariners recalled OF Boog Powell from Triple-A Tacoma and sent RHP Max Povse back to Tacoma. Powell had two hits.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED73HKEI8Z"},

Stanley and Howell III, paired together in the final round, shot matching four-under-par 66s to reach the top of the leaderboard at seven under. Playing the par-4 18th hole in their playoff, each missed the green with their second shot but after Howell III misfired on a 10-foot par putt, Stanley calmly sank his short attempt to claim his second career PGA Tour triumph.  It means a lot, it's hard to put into words right now,  said an emotional Stanley, whose previous victory came at the Phoenix Open in 2012.  (This win) is confirmation we’ve been working on the right things, and if anything will make me a little bit hungrier to get to work.  The TPC Potomac in Maryland was softened by rain and endured a five-minute storm delay late in the day, making the final round a scramble that featured several contenders and some costly mistakes.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY SportsWorld number nine Rickie Fowler fired a 65 and finished tied for third at five under alongside Scotland's Martin Laird. Fowler shot nine birdies but his chances were undone by a double bogey on the reachable par-4 14th, one of the easiest holes on the course. Slideshow (10 Images) Fourteen cost me a good shot to get in good position in the clubhouse,  Fowler said.  There are a couple swings I’d like to have back.  Overnight leader David Lingmerth stumbled home with a three-over 73 to finish in a group of weight players sharing fifth place at four under. Howell III was returning from a rib injury that kept him out of tournament action for more than two months and his 16th career second place earned him a spot in this month's British Open in Southport.  I'm excited to be back, it's a wonderful event,  Howell III said.  It was a long nine weeks, it's great to be healthy.

Correa had a career-high-tying four hits, Gurriel chipped in with his second consecutive three-hit game and a weary bullpen worked wonders in the Astros' 8-1 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday at Minute Maid Park. Correa recorded two singles and a pair of doubles, including one with two outs in the fourth inning that plated two runs, and Gurriel fell a triple shy of the cycle as the Astros (56-27) claimed the rubber match of the three-game series. Gurriel scored three runs and clubbed his 10th homer of the season and second of the series in the seventh. He became the eighth Houston player to reach double figures in home runs by the All-Star break, a club record.  When he's swinging the bat like he has recently, it's pretty scary to have that good a hitter that low in the order,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Gurriel, who closed the series 6-for-12 with four runs and six RBIs.  He's dangerous, and when he gets hot, as we can see, he can put some really good swings on balls. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AstrosNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch It's a great advantage for us because you don't have an inning where you can breathe as a pitcher when you face us, and I think we're demonstrating that time and time again.  Astros right-hander Mike Fiers labored with his control and efficiency, needing 105 pitches to complete four scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and posted seven strikeouts but issued four walks and subsequently put the onus on an overworked bullpen to keep the Yankees (43-37) at bay over the final five innings. The relievers obliged. Right-handers Chris Devenski (5-3) and Michael Feliz combined to work three perfect innings with five strikeouts. Right-hander James Hoyt surrendered hits to Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez in the eighth, snapping a string of 15 consecutive batters retired, but rallied with a pair of flyouts to right for a scoreless frame.  Yeah it's been tough, but at the end of the day we've got to go out there and do our job,  Devenski said of the heavy workload.  And find a way to get it done.  The Yankees averted the shutout, which would have been their first this season, when Chris Carter followed a leadoff double by Chase Headley with an RBI single off Astros southpaw Ashur Tolliver in the ninth. Dayan Diaz, fresh off his first career win on Saturday, induced a double play before striking out Brett Gardner. In the second inning, Houston third baseman Marwin Gonzalez broke the scoreless tie with a two-run homer, his career-high 14th, off Yankees starter Luis Severino (5-4). Correa upped the lead to 5-0 with his double in the fourth before adding an RBI single in the sixth inning that plated George Springer and built the lead to 6-0. Severino allowed six runs on nine hits and one walk over 5 1/3 innings.  It's difficult,  Severino said.  Right now, that's the hottest team in baseball. You have to command your pitches. It'd be easier if my fastball command was there and my slider was working.  The Astros completed the season series against the Yankees by winning five of seven games. The Yankees finished 3-4 on their road trip.  We're in a frustrating part of our year, but I think this week is really important for us at home to turn things around and win some games we're supposed to,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. NOTES: Yankees RHP Adam Warren threw a simulated game on Sunday and is expected to be reinstated from the 10-day disabled list on Tuesday when the Yankees host the Toronto Blue Jays. Warren landed on the DL on June 16 with right shoulder inflammation. ... The Astros recalled LHP Ashur Tolliver from Triple-A Fresno for the purpose of having an additional arm for their exhausted bullpen. Houston had nine relievers listed on their roster. ...

Chicago White Sox reliever Tommy Kahnle thinks the adage can apply to pitchers, too. Kahnle comprised the middle leg of a resilient bullpen relay on Sunday afternoon, helping keep the White Sox afloat between early defensive struggles and late heroics from second baseman Yolmer Sanchez. While Sanchez's two-run homer with two outs in the eighth inning provided the go-ahead runs in Chicago's 6-5 win over the Texas Rangers, the relief corps put the White Sox in striking distance. Right-handers Anthony Swarzak, Kahnle and David Robertson combined on 4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief of staff ace Jose Quintana, scattering three hits, seven strikeouts and one intentional walk.  Once everybody is on a roll, there's no telling how good we're going to be to pitch the rest of the way,  Kahnle said.  But I feel like it's definitely contagious if we feed off of each other.  Chicago (36-45) overcame four errors that contributed to Texas wiping out a 4-1 deficit after three innings. Designated hitter Jonathan Lucroy's soft two-run single in the fifth inning gave the Rangers (40-42) a 5-4 lead. Tyson Ross buoyed Texas with five innings of four-run ball, spacing four hits, five walks and three strikeouts. The Rangers walked seven batters in the game. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at White SoxTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchRelievers Ernesto Frieri and Matt Bush worked scoreless innings before Chicago capitalized against right-hander Jose Leclerc (1-2). Sanchez said he knew he made contact with the barrel of the bat when he connected with Leclerc's 1-2 slider. The ball landed in the right-field stands, delighting most in a crowd of 26,206 that saw the White Sox win the rubber match of a three-game weekend series.  We never quit,  Sanchez said through a team interpreter.  We never quit, and we try to fight every single inning. It doesn't matter the run differential in that particular moment in the game.  Texas snapped Quintana's scoreless-innings streak at 19 2/3 innings with an unearned run in the third inning. Successive White Sox errors -- from first baseman Todd Frazier and Sanchez -- and an infield single from Shin-Soo Choo loaded the bases for Elvis Andrus. Andrus hit a grounder to third baseman Matt Davidson, who threw to Sanchez to force Choo at second base. But Sanchez was unable to throw to first base, the result of runner's interference on Choo, umpires initially ruled. Texas won a replay challenge to overturn the call, however, transforming an inning-ending double play to an RBI groundout for Andrus. Quintana threw 27 of his 96 pitches in the inning. He spaced five runs (three earned), six hits, five strikeouts and two walks in 4 1/3 innings. He allowed a solo home run to Mike Napoli leading off the fourth.  Quintana has been a premium pitcher in this league for a couple years now,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  Even though we were able to scratch some runs across the board, we did have some opportunities.  The White Sox built confidence after stifling the Rangers' scoring chances.  Whatever we screwed up for the first four or five innings, the reality is we play nine innings, and you start to try to make adjustments,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. Although the Rangers have had a winning record just three times in the past 38 days and have not been less than 10 games behind first-place Houston since May 26, optimism still is prevalent at the season's midpoint. Referencing the bullpen, Banister said,  We're going to continue to find guys.  Texas trailed Houston by seven games in early July 2015 before ultimately rallying to win the American League West.  There's still a lot of games left,  Choo said.  In 2015, we were in the same situation with Houston. They were a lot of games ahead of us and we caught them. Now they're ahead of us, so we have to catch up. But if we just play the right baseball, if we take care of just us, we know we'll be in a good position.  Andrus and Choo had two hits apiece for the Rangers. Melky Cabrera opened the scoring in the first inning for the White Sox, hitting a solo home run. Robertson (4-2) pitched the final 1 2/3 innings, scattering two hits and two strikeouts. Robertson fanned Carlos Gomez swinging with the bases loaded to end the game after the White Sox intentionally walked Adrian Beltre. White Sox catcher Kevan Smith corralled a dropped third strike to end the game, diving back to home plate. The ensuing celebration in the White Sox dugout also was infectious.  I was right at the top step watching,  Kahnle said.  It was pretty funny because you hardly ever see a game end that way.  NOTES: Rangers C Robinson Chirinos stole his first career base in the fourth inning. ... 2B Pete Kozma started for the Rangers while Rougned Odor enjoyed his first day off this season.  It's time,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  There was a day that made sense. Today's the day. Gives us six potential off days through the All-Star break in a fairly short period of time.  ... Chicago finished 4-6 during a 10-game homestand. The White Sox are scheduled to host Tampa Bay, Cleveland and San Francisco in another 10-game homestand Sept. 1-10.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED72HIGJYT"},

Property consultant CoreLogic said its index of home prices for the combined capital cities rose 0.8 percent in June, following a rare 1.1 percent drop in May. Annual growth in prices also accelerated to 9.6 percent, from 8.3 percent the month before, though that was still down from a peak of 12.9 percent in March. The increase for the whole June quarter was also a modest 0.8 percent, the smallest since late 2015, with Sydney recording a notable slowdown. Any moderation will be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which is concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks. The country's main bank watchdog has already tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans and banks have followed by raising rates on some mortgage products. After cutting interest rates to a record low of 1.5 percent last August, the RBA has since warned further easing would only encourage more borrowing by already heavily indebted households.  We are likely to see further tightening and repricing around investment lending and interest only lending over the coming months,  said CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless.  Considering investors comprised just over 55 percent of new mortgage demand across New South Wales, a further slowdown in investment activity is likely to have a more substantial impact on housing demand in Sydney.  Annual price growth in Sydney ran at 12.2 percent in June, down from a top of 18.9 percent in March. Melbourne fared better, with prices up 1.5 percent in the June quarter and 13.7 percent for the year. The inexorable price rise in the major cities has taken homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers and become a political hot potato. The conservative government of Malcolm Turnbull has blamed a lack of supply for the problem, while the opposition Labor Party has pointed the finger at favourable tax treatment for property investment.

Marcell Ozuna hit two home runs and Derek Deitrich added a third as the Marlins pounded out 17 hits in a 10-3 rout of the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. Dan Straily (6-4) held the Brewers to three runs, five hits and a walk in six innings. He remained perfect against Milwaukee, improving to 4-0 with a 2.12 ERA in six career appearances (four starts), and 3-0 with a 2.84 ERA in four career starts at Miller Park.  I thought he kind of got better as the day went on,  Miami manager Don Mattingly said.  He's given up some homers, over the course of his career, because every time I do the matchups I see guys with a homer ... but it's a lot of solos, and not where he's getting himself in a lot of trouble and homers, it's not getting the ball where he wants and it costs him one. He did a nice job today.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BrewersMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchBrewers right-hander Junior Guerra struck out seven but battled his command and couldn't get past the fourth inning for a second consecutive start. He gave up four runs, eight hits and three walks to drop his third consecutive decision.  I feel like right now my velocity is off,  Guerra said.  I've always had good velocity and I can just go after hitters. I haven't been able to do that, so I've been relying more on my off-speed a lot more. I feel like if I get that back a bit more, I'll be back to the Junior Guerra I was last year. I feel like that would help me a lot.  Guerra (1-3) worked around trouble in the first two innings, but with a 1-0 lead thanks to Domingo Santana's sacrifice fly in the first, he served up a three-run homer to Ozuna in the third. Milwaukee got one run back in the bottom of the inning when Eric Thames crushed a 1-2 offering from Straily for his 21st home run of the season but his first since June 17. The Marlins opened the fifth with back-to-back singles against Guerra and made it 4-2 when Justin Bour chased Guerra with an RBI double. Straily had retired four of five batters before Orlando Arcia led off the fifth with his second home run in as many games and eighth of the year. But the Marlins restored their two-run cushion in the sixth on Christian Yelich's RBI single before Dietrich opened the seventh with a leadoff home run against Rob Scahill.  We did a nice job getting out of jams for the first five innings and staying within striking distance,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  Even through the sixth, Rob got out of a jam in the sixth. But there were just too many runners and eventually they broke through.  Home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt made Brewers second baseman Jonathan Villar switch bats for having too much pine tar in the seventh inning, then did the same in the eighth with Ozuna up to the plate. Ozuna ditched his lumber, borrowed one from Giancarlo Stanton and slugged his second homer of the afternoon.  The bat boy brought me Stanton's bat, Giancarlo's bat, and I said, 'Hey, can I use it?' he says, 'Yeah,'  Ozuna said.  Maybe I swung harder.  J.T. Realmuto broke the game open with a two-run single later in the inning and Martin Prado drove in Miami's 10th run with a ninth-inning double. NOTES: SS Orlando Arcia finished with two hits and homered for the second time in as many games. In his last 41 games, Arcia has batted .359 (52-for-145) with four home runs and 12 RBIs, raising his season average from .208 to .289 in the process. ... Miami LF Marcell Ozuna's two home runs marked his fourth career multi-homer game. ... The Marlins head to St. Louis on Monday to open a four-game series against the Cardinals behind LHP Jeff Locke (0-4, 5.52 ERA). Milwaukee will open a three-game interleague set against the Baltimore Orioles at Miller Park. The Brewers have yet to name a starter for that game. It was supposed to be RHP Chase Anderson, but he will miss 4-6 weeks after suffering a strained oblique in his last outing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-marlins-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED72HI1JYI"},

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the demands were made to be rejected, adding that the Arab ultimatum was aimed not at tackling terrorism but at curtailing his country's sovereignty. State news agency QNA reported that he would inform the ruler of Kuwait, a neutral Gulf Arab country seeking to mediate in the spat, of Qatar's response on Monday. Sheikh Mohammed earlier told reporters in Rome that Doha remained ready to discuss the grievances of its Arab neighbors.  This list of demands is made to be rejected. It's not meant to be accepted or ... to be negotiated,  Sheikh Mohammed said.  The state of Qatar instead of rejecting it as a principle, we are willing to engage in (dialogue), providing the proper conditions for further dialogue.   He added that no one had the right to issue an ultimatum to a sovereign country.  The feud erupted last month when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and travel ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being an ally of regional foe Iran, charges that Doha denies. The countries have threatened further sanctions against Qatar if it does not comply with their list of 13 demands presented to Doha through Kuwait 10 days ago. The demands include closing a Turkish military base in Qatar and shutting the Al Jazeera pan-Arab television network, which Doha also rejected.  Foreign ministers from the four countries will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Qatar, Egypt said on Sunday. Related CoverageSaudi Arabia and allies give Qatar two more days to accept demands At the invitation of Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, there will be a quartet meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in Cairo on Wednesday July 5 to follow up on the developing situation regarding relations with Qatar,  Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said in a statement. A State Department official said on Sunday that the United States encourages  all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions. We are not going to get ahead of those discussions. We fully support Kuwaiti mediation.   Qatar's Gulf critics accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected the accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. Fresh Penalties Gulf countries have insisted the demands were non- negotiable. The UAE ambassador to Russia has said that Qatar could face fresh sanctions if it does not comply with the demands.  A man writes on a painting depicting Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani in Doha, Qatar, July 2, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonGulf states could ask their trading partners to choose between working with them or with Doha, he said in a newspaper interview last week. They have not specified what further sanctions they could impose on Doha, but commercial bankers in the region believe that Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits and interbank loans from Qatar.  A more serious sanction would be to ban investors from holding Qatari assets, but authorities have given no sign of doing this. Qatar's stock market fell sharply on Sunday. The Qatari stock index .QSI sank as much as 3.1 percent in thin trade, bringing its losses to 11.9 percent since June 5, when Saudi and the other countries cut diplomatic and trade ties. The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, played down the chances of an escalation, saying  the alternative is not escalation but parting ways , suggesting Qatar may be forced out of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Slideshow (4 Images)The Western-backed body was formed in 1981 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Speaking in Washington last week, the Qatari foreign minister said the GCC was set up to guard against external threats.   When the threat is coming from inside the GCC, there is a suspicion about the sustainability of the organization,  Sheikh Mohammed told reporters.  David and Goliath  Qataris appeared defiant on Sunday, with newspapers decrying a  siege  and sharing on social media a cartoon of David and Goliath to illustrate Qatar's struggle with its larger neighbors. A Qatari artist whose portrait of Qatar's emir has been draped from skyscrapers and affixed to car windows across the capital signed T-shirts for Qataris at a museum on Saturday.  As you see, the photo is now all over, it's a sign of loyalty to the emir and love for the country,  he said.  Saudi Arabia's permanent representative to the United Nations, Abdullah bin Yahiya al-Moallemi, said on Twitter that Qatar had failed to take opportunities offered by its neighbors in the past to stop supporting terrorism.  Qatar had insisted on shaking the security of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and interfering in the affairs of countries in the region,  Moallemi said. The crisis has hit travel, food imports and ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf and sown confusion among businesses, while pushing Qatar closer to Iran and Turkey. But it has not hit energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas and home to the region's biggest U.S. military base. The rift opened days after U.S. President Donald Trump met Arab leaders in Riyadh and called for unity against regional threats such as Iran and hardline Islamist militant groups.

The Thai, who stands 5-foot, 1-inch tall (1.55 metres), lives in the shadow of sibling Ariya, who has racked up six LPGA victories over the past 14 months and briefly snatched the world number one ranking. Moriya has been making strong progress of her own recently, however, with four straight top-10 finishes entering the Women's PGA, including a tie for second last week. Only two strokes from the halfway lead here, Moriya’s weekend challenge never really left the launch pad, a closing 73 on Sunday leaving her tied for 20th at three-under 281, 10 strokes behind winner Danielle Kang.

The agency believes the closure of the stores by its master franchiser PT Modern Internasional Tbk (Modern Internasional) underscores the risk of evolving regulation and the importance of a solid business model for a retailer's credit profile. Modern Internasional said it will close all the 7-Eleven stores under its management by 30 June 2017 due to a lack of resources to fund its store operations. The announcement was made a few weeks after the deal to sell the subsidiary that operates the 7-Eleven chain to PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Tbk fell apart. Modern Internasional's business model for the 7-Eleven chain in Indonesia was undermined by unfavourable regulatory developments. The company closed around 25 stores in 2016 (2015: around 20 stores), leaving the company with 161 stores (2015: more than 185 stores). This followed regulation issued by the Ministry of Industry in April 2015 that banned the sales of alcoholic drinks in small, modern retail formats, which used to make up about 15% of Modern Internasional's sales. The store closures eventually resulted in a 28% decline in sales and EBITDA losses in 2016, making the company's leverage profile unsustainable. Fitch believes the problem was exacerbated by the lack of clear differentiation between the 7-Eleven convenience stores and fast-food and medium-sized restaurants in Indonesia. The business model and risks of the 7-Eleven stores were similar to that of restaurants, as the chain offered ready-to-eat food and beverages with seating and free Wi-Fi. As a result, the chain faced strong competition from fast-food restaurants and traditional food vendors, which are still highly popular among Indonesian consumers. This business risk profile is significantly different from that of other mini markets and convenience stores, such as Alfamart and Indomaret, which put greater emphasis on groceries and have a bigger network across the country. The 7-Eleven stores also had higher rental expenses than other convenience stores because the chain offered seating space, which required larger store areas. In addition, most of the 7-Eleven stores in Jakarta were located in prime areas that commanded high rental rates and exposed the company to steep rental revisions when leases expired. Modern Internasional's rental expenses increased by around 28% in 2016 despite the large number of store closures in 2016 and 2015.

India, like other nuclear nations, has been closely watching the fate of Japanese-owned Westinghouse, which filed for Chapter 11 in March after an estimated $13 billion of cost overruns at two U.S. projects, casting a shadow over the nuclear industry. There has been debate over potential U.S. support for the reactor maker since owner Toshiba (6502.T), the laptop-to-chips conglomerate, announced the blow-out at Westinghouse last year. Some form of U.S. backing or involvement, industry experts say, could avoid a Chinese or Russian buyer unpalatable to Washington, which would prefer to keep Westinghouse's advanced nuclear technology out of the hands of its foreign rivals. The White House declined comment.  We were told that, by the end of the year, Westinghouse would really rework its situation and really be back in business,  India's foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told a briefing, referring to an exit from bankruptcy. Civil nuclear cooperation has been a cornerstone of U.S.-India relations, and the proposed construction of six Westinghouse AP1000 reactors in India's Andhra Pradesh, announced in 2016, crowned more than a decade of diplomatic efforts. The achievement was left in limbo by Westinghouse's troubles.   Graphic on nuclear power plants in India: tmsnrt.rs/2tGjv8e The project, however, found specific mention in the Indian government's joint communique from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington a week ago. (bit.ly/2tsyEdb) The two leaders  looked forward to conclusion of contractual agreements between Westinghouse Electric Company and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for six nuclear reactors in India and also related project financing,  the communique said. Sources familiar with the matter said the statement was backed by U.S. guidance that Westinghouse would be sold to a U.S. investor after emerging from Chapter 11 proceedings, in turn paving the way to close the reactor deal in 2018. Elaborating, one industry source with direct knowledge of Westinghouse's talks with India said:  Both sides are engaged and once Westinghouse comes out of bankruptcy we would look to conclude the contract.  The source, who was not authorized to speak to media, requested anonymity. A diplomat involved in preparations for the Modi-Trump meeting corroborated this timeline, saying:  The bankruptcy is on track and should wrap up by year end.   Massively Important  Westinghouse and India's Department of Atomic Energy did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India could not be reached for comment.

Georgia Power/Handout viaFile PhotoToshiba said it wasn't in a position to predict when Westinghouse would emerge from Chapter 11. Because the bankruptcy court has not yet approved a restructuring plan, no decision has been taken on searching for a buyer, it said. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whom diplomats say plans to lead a business delegation to India in October, last week left the door open to a potential deal.  This is a lot bigger issue than just allowing the United States a couple of plants in the southern part of the United States,  he told reporters.  This is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America's allies.  Perry declined to elaborate on potential acquirers. FILE PHOTO: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs U.S. President Donald Trump as they give joint statements in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBut former Westinghouse executives have told Reuters that they have been approached by private equity funds to help them assess a possible deal to buy the company.  Paving the way for a deal, Toshiba has agreed on a liability cap on one of the U.S. projects, the unfinished Vogtle power plant in Georgia that is being led by Southern Co (SO.N). If a similar agreement can be reached for the VC Summer plant in South Carolina, which is co-owned by SCANA Corp (SCG.N), that would clear the path to an exit from Chapter 11, say people familiar with the matter.  The administration is hoping that the reconfigured company will be back in operation later this year - with a U.S. buyer - and the deal with India can be closed next year,  said Washington-based analyst Ashley Tellis, an authority on nuclear policy and former Republican official. Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was instrumental in negotiating a civil nuclear accord with India during the George W. Bush administration although, more than a decade on, it has yet to yield actual nuclear deals. Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, helped lay the ground for the talks on the civil nuclear accord. He would play a  critical role  in bringing the project to completion, added Tellis. Ahead of Modi's visit, a U.S. official had said the United States was  looking forward to U.S.-built nuclear reactors contributing to India's energy security .    We very much support continued negotiations between Westinghouse and its Indian partners, recognizing that deals on this scale can take time,  the official said.     Westinghouse has said it will concentrate on reactors only - and not construction - meaning it would require partners for its Indian and other projects. In India, its favored partner would be Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS), industry sources say.  We are capable of doing this, but of course the technology transfer has to happen,  said S.N. Roy, head of L&T;'s nuclear business, who confirmed L&T; had been approached by Westinghouse about being the general contractor.

Ryu carded a one-ver-par 72 to finish equal 14th at four-under 280, nine strokes behind American winner Danielle Kang at Olympia Fields. It was a disappointing end to a week that started with her caddie Tom Watson being presented with the ceremonial number one green bib on the first tee on Thursday. Ryu said her new status at the top of the women’s game did not make her feel any different once she had teed off.   Before the tournament I thought it definitely was going to be different but as soon as I started the tournament everything felt the same,” she told Reuters.  A lot of people cheering for me, (saying) congratulations number one, that was the only special part.  Her gallery on Sunday was the biggest of the week, if only because she was paired with American Michelle Wie, who finished tied for 20th and is still the biggest attraction for U.S. fans. Despite her late fade, Ryu spoke confidently about the state of her game heading into the next major, the U.S. Women’s Open at Trump National in Bedminster, New Jersey in two weeks' time. “I could not see any bad side about my game,” she said. “I think it (was) just really unlucky, so if I have some good rest next week I think I’m going to be ready for another major.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-pgachamp-ryu-idUSKBN19N0XT"},

The Cleveland third baseman homered twice and knocked in four runs and the Indians held off the Detroit Tigers 11-8 on Sunday afternoon at Comerica Park. Ramirez, who has three multi-homer games, reached base four times and scored four runs. He hit his homers from opposite sides of the plate for the second time this season, the first player in franchise history to accomplish that feat. Ramirez is batting .325 with 15 homers and 42 RBIs and leads the club with 59 runs scored.  It's been fun to watch,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  It's both sides of the plate and he gets so dangerous when he's in one of these (grooves). It's not just getting singles, he's hitting the ball a long way. There's a reason he's hitting behind (cleanup hitter Edwin) Encarnacion, because that's how dangerous he is.  Losing pitcher Justin Verlander (5-5) surrendered seven runs on nine hits in 3 1/3 innings. He didn't record a strikeout for the first time since May 4, 2007. The streak lasted 331 games and had been the majors' longest active streak. The strikeout streak was tied for the sixth longest since 1913. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at TigersCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch He's one of the most competitive pitchers you're ever going to see and we made him work for everything,  Francona said. Carlos Santana doubled twice and drove in three runs, Lonnie Chisenhall hit a two-run homer and Encarnacion scored twice and knocked in two runs for Cleveland (44-37). Mike Clevinger (4-3) overcame early wildness to record the win. He allowed one run on two hits with a career-high-tying five walks and seven strikeouts in six innings. Cody Allen got the last out to notch his 16th save after the Tigers scored six ninth-inning runs.  I'm glad we were up nine instead of six,  Francona said.  How many times do you give up six in the ninth and win? It's not going to put a damper on the day because we came out with good energy and played a good game. It's a little frustrating when you're just trying to get guys some work and all of a sudden you've got to get Cody up.  The Tigers lost the series 2-1 and dropped eight games behind the Indians in the American League Central Division.  There's a whole bunch of feelings that happen when you don't pitch well,  Verlander said.  Yeah, you want to pitch well for the team. You want to pitch well for yourself. You want to pitch well for everybody. You just want to win. My teammates came in after the game and during the game and said, 'Hey man, just don't worry about it. Spit it out, and get ready for the next one.' That's the kind of camaraderie we have in here.  James McCann drove in four runs and hit a three-run homer in the ninth, for Detroit (36-45). Chisenhall put the Indians on top with his two-run shot in the second. The Indians made it 4-0 in the third. Verlander got two outs before Ramirez drilled a 1-2 offering over the right-field wall. Chisenhall then walked and scored on Santana's double.  My body feels great, my arm feels great. Just one of those days,  Verlander said.  A couple of pitches, I went back and looked at (the video). I thought they may have caught too much plate or were a little up. But the curveball to Chisenhall was actually a decent pitch and the slider to Ramirez was on the black and in. Sometimes, you have to tip your cap.  Detroit scored its first run on J.D. Martinez's RBI double in the bottom of the inning. Ramirez's second homer, a three-run blast, came off reliever Chad Bell in the fourth. Verlander's day ended one batter earlier when Encarnacion smacked a run-scoring single. Encarnacion's RBI triple and Santana's two-run double in the sixth upped Cleveland's lead to 11-1. NOTES: Detroit LF Justin Upton missed his third consecutive game because of right side soreness. Upton suffered the injury in the batting cage prior to Saturday's doubleheader. He leads the club in homers (15) and RBIs (52). ... Indiana RHP Danny Salazar made a rehab start with Triple-A Akron on Saturday. He threw 48 pitches in the 1 2/3-inning stint and allowed three runs on three hits with two walks and three strikeouts. Salazar was placed on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to June 4 with right shoulder soreness. ... Tigers 2B Ian Kinsler got the day off. He had appeared in every game since June 6. ...

It has been a mostly miserable season, but suddenly the wins are pouring in. Belt drove in three runs Sunday as the Giants erased a two-run deficit to gain a weekend sweep with a 5-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. Belt was 3-for-4 with his 16th homer and an RBI single as San Francisco (33-51) won its sixth in a row and got its second straight series sweep. The Giants' last sweep in Pittsburgh was April 29-May 1, 2005.  I think there's a confidence and expectation to win now, whereas before I don't think we had that,  Belt said.  It actually might have been the opposite. Not sure what triggered it, but this is the way we feel we should've been playing the whole time. This is how our team should be playing.  San Francisco starter Jeff Samardzija (4-9) allowed two runs, both on Jordy Mercer's fourth-inning homer, and six hits in six innings with five strikeouts and no walks. In his past 11 starts, Samardzija has walked just four while striking out 87. He has held opponents to three runs or fewer in nine of his past 10 starts. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PiratesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatch We're going out there and I don't think we're looking it as a whole right now,  Samardzija said.  I think we're looking at it as a game-by-game moving forward. I just think we need to go out every day and set a tone with the way we start. ... You can just do yourself a favor and try to go out and have fun.  Sam Dyson pitched a perfect ninth for his second save. Tony Watson (4-2) took the loss for Pittsburgh (37-45). He gave up a run and three hits in the seventh. Trevor Williams, making his first career start against the Giants, got his fifth straight no-decision. In six-plus innings, he gave up two runs and three hits with three strikeouts and two walks. Pittsburgh had a runner in each of the first three innings before taking a 2-0 lead in the fourth. Mercer's eighth homer, into the left-field bleachers, followed Gregory Polanco's one-out double. It was the 17th homer off Samardzija this season. The Giants chased Williams in the seventh after Hunter Pence led off with a walk and went to third on Buster Posey's double to the left-field corner.  I pulled a few pitches to Pence,  Williams said.  Posey, I made a good pitch, really similar to the strikeout that he had his first at-bat. He's a good hitter.  Getting the two runners seemed to ignite San Francisco.  We couldn't get anything generated, then finally the leadoff walk seemed to get things going,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. And left Williams feeling bad about what he handed over to Watson.  Second and third, no outs, is not a fun situation to come in as a reliever,  Williams said. Belt singled on Watson's first pitch, driving in Pence to make it 2-1, and Brandon Crawford followed with an RBI single to tie it. Belt scored on pinch-hitter Kelby Tomlinson's sacrifice fly for a 3-2 Giants lead, drawing boos toward Watson from the home crowd.  Your other option is to give Trevor the opportunity to get through it, and it he doesn't have a lot of experience pitching through a jam in the seventh,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  With those left-handers coming up, something Tony's been able to (handle), he's been in a good place. We weren't able to get it done.  In the eighth, Belt sent a two-out, two-run homer into the right-field stands off Edgar Santana to boost the lead to 5-2. John Jaso hit his seventh homer of the season to right -- and just his second career home run off a left-hander, Steve Okert -- to pull the Pirates within 5-3 in the eighth. NOTES: Pittsburgh OF Starling Marte, serving an 80-game suspension for a violation involving performance-enhancers, was 0-for-3 with a strikeout and reached on an error in five innings in his first rehab game with High-A Bradenton. Marte, who is eligible to return July 18, will play left field, manager Clint Hurdle said. ... CF Andrew McCutchen, 2B Josh Harrison and 3B David Freese, all Pittsburgh regulars, were out of the starting lineup for rest purposes. ...

Â ÂPivetta bounced back from the shortest start of his career by earning the win with seven innings of one-hit ball as the Phillies routed the New York Mets 7-1 to salvage the finale of a three-game series at Citi Field. Â ÂPivetta (2-4) carried a no-hitter into the fifth inning, when he gave up a one-out homer to T.J. Rivera. He lasted seven innings for the second time in 10 starts. He finished the game with 52 innings pitched, two more than the maximum allowed to maintain rookie eligibility in future seasons, while walking four and striking out four.Â Â ÂAfterward, Pivetta said he wasn't thinking about a no-hitter as the game reached the middle innings. Â  I knew that there were no hits in the first inning, second inning, third inning, fourth inning -- not hard to know that, it's right there on the scoreboard,  Pivetta said with a grin.  I was just focused on getting a quality start in (and) helping my team win. I hung a breaking ball and he hit it out. That's why those things are so hard to do, because it's one thing. Those guys are so good at their job. You have to be perfect to do anything.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MetsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchÂ ÂPivetta was decidedly imperfect in his previous start last Monday, when he took the loss after allowing a career-high six runs in 2 2/3 innings as the Phillies fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1. Â Â A veteran pitcher will have a bad start now and then -- they know what to do, or know how to cope with it, because they have to wait for five more days,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  A young pitcher needs to learn how to do that. And he certainly showed that he learned something from his last outing.  Â ÂPivetta said a talk in the outfield during a batting practice session earlier this week with fellow rookie pitcher Mark Leiter Jr. helped him refocus. Â Â There wasn't a whole lot of emphasis on (the poor start),  Pivetta said.  Just, you're a professional, go out there and do better than you did last time.  Â ÂThe Phillies produced all the offense they needed during an unusual four-run second inning. Mets right-hander Rafael Montero opened the inning by giving up three hits in as many pitches to Tommy Joseph (single), Nick Williams (single) and Maikel Franco (two-run double). Franco advanced to third on a bunt by Ty Kelly and scored on Andrew Knapp's single. Â ÂKnapp advanced on a sacrifice by Pivetta before scoring all the way from second on a wild pitch that Mets catcher Rene Rivera had a hard time retrieving. The race home highlighted an active week on the base paths for the rookie catcher, who recorded his first career stolen base and tripleÂ on FridayÂ and added an infield single laterÂ Sunday. Â Â The way we've been playing, we need all the bases we can get,  Knapp said of the Phillies (27-53), who avoided being swept for the 11th time this season. Â ÂThe Phillies added three runs in the eighth on a pinch-hit RBI single by Brock Stassi and a two-run single by Daniel Nava, who finished with three hits. Â ÂMatt Reynolds singled in the eighth for the other hit by the Mets (38-43), who lost for just the second time in nine games.Â ÂÂMontero (1-5) allowed four runs, eight hits and two walks while striking out six in 6 1/3 innings.Â Â Â We didn't get any hits,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  (Montero) gave us a chance to get back in that game. We just didn't do it.  Â ÂOutside of the second inning, the Phillies got just two runners into scoring position against Montero. Â Â I had one bad inning where I looked bad,  Montero said through an interpreter.  After that, I did the adjustments and I ended well.  Â ÂNOTES: Mets OF Curtis Granderson (hip) did not play. Granderson, one of just four Mets Opening Day starters to avoid the disabled list this season, said he still felt sore while warming up for a possible pinch-hitting appearance. He is day-to-day. ...

In Maine, a bipartisan budget committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the state's $7.055 billion, two-year budget. At New Jersey’s statehouse in Trenton, there was little evidence of progress in resolving a fight over a health insurance bill that Republican Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the state’s budget.  Maine state police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue planned to operate during the shutdown, the state's first since 1991, but the majority of 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. New Jersey residents were not so lucky. With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing, the shutdown there included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jersey’s few free public beaches, and all other state parks.  Although he beach park was closed to the public, Christie took a state helicopter on Saturday to a gubernatorial residence there to be with family and said he would go back on Sunday night.   That's just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you have can have a residence there,  he said when pressed on the issue.  At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, the governor said he had not spoken since Friday to Democratic holdouts.  The impasse could mean a furlough for 30,000 to 35,000 state employees on Monday. In Maine, the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure voters approved in November for a 3 percent income tax hike on residents earning more than $200,000 a year. It also contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. A New Jersey State Park Police officer informs people that Liberty State Park is closed during a partial state government shutdown in Jersey City, New Jersey U.S., July 3, 2017.Brendan McDermidLePage has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. A six-member bipartisan House-Senate budget panel huddled into the evening on Sunday seeking to reach a deal that would win the two-thirds vote needed for passage of an emergency budget bill in both legislative chambers. Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon, said a new compromise could be ready for a vote as early as Monday morning, about the time state employees planned to protest the shutdown at the capitol. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Slideshow (5 Images)Health Insurance Stalemate At the center of New Jersey's stalemate was a plan by Christie to shake up the state’s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, which he said lacked sufficient transparency and spent too much on salaries.  He threatened to cut $150 million in school funding and other items unless lawmakers adopt his proposal, which would redirect some of Horizon's reserves to drug addiction treatment and other services. Christie offered to hear Democrats' proposals for breaking the impasse, saying: “It should end today,” but acknowledged a settlement was unlikely so soon. Christie, a former presidential contender whose reputation was tarnished by the Bridgegate traffic scandal involving some of his closest aides, ranks as the least popular governor in state history.

But given the currency's fall, the new minimum monthly wage of 97,532 bolivars is effectively down 17 percent in dollar terms since the last increase in May.     The currency's fall -- of 99.7 percent since Maduro was elected president in April 2013 -- has exacerbated a brutal economic crisis that has millions struggling to find or afford food.     A thousand dollars bought in local currency when Maduro was elected would be worth just $3 today.     Maduro's leftist government blames speculators and the opposition for the problems.      Following the immoral campaign that fixes prices through a false dollar abroad ... we are going to put the handcuffs on ... the whole campaign of speculation,  said Maduro on state television, adding that the rise would be effective retroactively from July 1.     The monthly salary is accompanied by a food ticket, the value of which also went up to 153,000 bolivars per month --bringing the total to just over $30 a month at the black market rate.     Maduro often describes the salary increases as a  world record,  while critics see it as a stark indicator of economic mismanagement.

Votto went 1-for-3 against Arrieta with a strikeout but managed to do something against him no other Reds batter could -- get a hit. Arrieta allowed only a single by Votto through seven innings, Ian Happ homered twice and Anthony Rizzo added a solo shot, helping the Chicago Cubs avoid a sweep with a 6-2 victory over the Cincinnatio Reds. Arrieta, pitching in Great American Ball Park where he hurled a no-hitter on April 21, 2016, looked unhittable at times during his seven frames. He retired 10 straight in one stretch and 19 of the final 20 batters he faced.  Votto did not have good at-bats against him, that tells me his stuff was very good,  Maddon said.  That was as good as we've seen Jake in a bit. If he keeps pitching with that command, the confidence is going to come up. I was just watching their hitters react.  The Cubs' offensive star was Happ, who, while starring at the University of Cincinnati, regularly attended games at Great American Ball Park and even played there once against the University of Louisville in 2013. On Sunday, Happ went 3-for-4 with two homers and tied a career high with four RBIs. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at RedsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch I feel good about how I've been swinging the bat the past couple weeks,  Happ said.  I've had some pretty good ABs. I'm just trying to go out there and play good baseball and compete every day.  The victory helped Chicago (41-41) avoid its first three-game sweep in Cincinnati since 1996. The Cubs have beaten the Reds in 24 of the past 31 meetings.  Two thumbs up,  Maddon said when asked about going 5-6 on the road trip.  The hitting has fluctuated. The pitching has fluctuated. Everybody's doing their part which is why we're .500. But, we're getting guys back (healthy). Impressed with how we continue to fight.  Cubs second baseman Javier Baez, who entered Sunday's game 1-for-16, went 3-for-4 with two doubles and an RBI. Votto's two-out single in the first inning was the only hit allowed by Arrieta (8-6), who had two walks and six strikeouts in 100 pitches. Arrieta credited an improved changeup on Sunday that helped him avoid the command issues he has experienced throughout the season.  Getting more comfortable with it,  Arrieta said.  It's opening up some doors, allowing me to do some more things. It's a big pitch for me. The two walks, I'm OK with that, as long as I can swing things back in my favor with some quick outs.  Votto's two-run single in the eighth -- his 1,499th career hit -- off Koji Uehara, made the score 6-2 and raised his average to a season-high .317. But the Reds couldn't mount a rally. In the second, Happ launched a 2-2 pitch from Reds starter Tim Adleman to deep center, putting the Cubs ahead 2-0. Adleman (5-5) allowed three earned runs, six hits and two homers in five innings. In the fourth inning, Happ clubbed his 12th homer for his second career multi-home run game. He is only the third Cubs player in the past 100 seasons to have at least 11 homers in his first 45 games. Happ had a large contingent of family and friends in attendance throughout this weekend's series.  This is home away from home, via Pittsburgh,  Maddon said.  He really dropped the barrel a couple times. He can do a lot of things for us.  Happ added a broken-bat single off Blake Wood to drive in a run in the sixth to make the score 4-0. It was the third time this season he has had four RBIs in a game.  I really like the opposite-field single, scoring a run, we need more of that,  Maddon said.  He had a wonderful day, obviously.  Rizzo's towering solo home run in the seventh off Austin Brice made the score 5-0. Rizzo's 19th homer of the season landed on the roof of the home bullpen in right field.  They were just better today,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  Arrieta was really good. He didn't give us much. We only hit a couple balls on the barrel. This homestand (winning) four out of six works. That has to be our mantra for the rest of the year -- we have to pitch better.

Chile, playing with their trademark high octane style and driven forward by another relentless display by Arturo Vidal, dominated the match but were let down by poor finishing. A dramatic game featured missed chances, defensive howlers, scuffles and two video reviews, one producing a highly controversial outcome in the second half. Chile defender Gonzalo Jara elbowed Timo Werner by the touchline and Serbian referee Milorad Mazic, alerted by the video assistants, let him off with a yellow card instead of a red.

The Orioles reinforced that trust with a stellar performance against an American League East rival. Kevin Gausman threw seven scoreless innings, Manny Machado had a three-run homer and Baltimore avoided a three-game sweep with a 7-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday.  That was fun to watch,  Showalter said about Gausman.  That was impressive. I thought the seventh inning was the most impressive inning he had. You could tell he was going to carry good stuff. The secondary stuff was really good today. It was probably the best secondary stuff he's had this year.  Mark Trumbo also homered for Baltimore, which plays seven straight road games heading into the All-Star break. Tampa Bay still managed its first series win at Camden Yards in two years. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at OriolesTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchGausman (5-7) appears to have put some of his early season struggles behind him. He did not allow a hit until Logan Morrison managed a two-out single in the fourth inning. Gausman allowed just two hits with a season-tying high nine strikeouts and two walks. He has given up three runs in his past 18 innings, including another 5 1/3 shutout innings Tuesday against the Toronto Blue Jays.  I think you only get confidence from success,  Gausman said.  You got to have that first. Feel like I'm throwing the ball well right now and just got to keep it going. Like you said, I had a great second half last year, so obviously looking forward to that and knowing I'm the type of guy that gets better as the season goes on. That's always good.  Tampa Bay catcher Jesus Sucre ended the shutout bid with a solo homer in the eighth off Mychal Givens. Rays manager Kevin Cash fractured his left ankle running near Camden Yards early Sunday morning but did not miss the game.  I was crossing the railroad track and I looked up and stepped into the track, I rolled it,  Cash said. Tampa Bay starter Alex Cobb entered the game 4-1 with a 2.00 ERA in nine starts against the Orioles. This time, though, Baltimore took advantage of some miscues to open a 4-0 lead in the third. Cobb (6-6) hit shortstop Ruben Tejada on the shoulder to put runners on first and second. After a sacrifice bunt by Joey Rickard advanced both players, Cobb had a throwing error on a grounder by Seth Smith that allowed the first run to score. Machado followed with a three-run shot to left.  Any time you are on the mound, you are trying to win the ballgame,  Cobb said.  There are some things you don't know what goes on to keep the game close. You don't have that big inning and you give your team a chance to win late in the game. But we're fortunate to walk out of here with two out of three.  We need to win series and ultimately try to get to that 90-win mark and get into the playoffs.  Trumbo led off the fourth with a towering homer that boosted the lead to 5-0. A two-run double by Smith increased the lead to 7-0 in the seventh and ended the day for Cobb, who finished with six earned runs and six hits with three strikeouts and a walk. The Rays simply could not respond against Gausman.  That's about as well-pitched of a game that we've had against us this year or at least in a long time,  Cash said.  Gausman was throwing 96, 98 miles per hour, spotting his fastball, showed a really good splitter and the occasional slider. I mean he made it really tough, so you're not going to piece together a lot of big innings when you're facing that kind of stuff and that type of command.

Troops tied white banners and Iraqi flags to lamp posts and damaged buildings including the Hadba minaret, which the jihadists blew up in June along with the adjoining Grand al-Nuri Mosque, as air strikes and mortars rained down nearby. It was from al-Nuri's pulpit that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared his caliphate three years ago. Authorities are planning a week of nationwide celebrations, according to a government statement, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is expected to visit Mosul to formally declare victory. Mosul's fall would mark the effective end of the Iraqi half of the caliphate which Islamic State declared three years ago in parts of Iraq and Syria. The group still controls territory west and south of Mosul, where tens of thousands of civilians live. Soldiers from the elite Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) retook the Makawi district of Mosul's Old City on Sunday, a military statement said, a few blocks from the western banks of the Tigris. Reaching the river will give Iraqi forces control over the entire city and is expected by the end of this week. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the offensive, which Iraq's army and militarized police are also fighting in a multi-pronged attack. Federal police chief Lieutenant General Raed Shakir Jawdat said his forces had completed their mission in southern parts of the Old City on Saturday and those areas still needed to be cleared of explosives and corpses from two weeks of fighting.

Slideshow (15 Images)Nearly nine months of grinding urban warfare have displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Thousands of residents are believed to be trapped in the Old City with little food, water, medicine and no access to health services, according to those who managed to flee. After CTS units captured the al-Nuri mosque complex on Thursday, Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's caliphate, which he called  a state of falsehood . Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding on the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The group has moved its remaining command and control structures to Mayadin, in eastern Syria, U.S. intelligence sources said last month, without indicating if Baghdadi was also hiding in the same area. Baghdadi has often been reported killed or wounded. Russia said on June 17 its forces might have killed him in an air strike in Syria. But Washington says it has no information to corroborate such reports and Iraqi officials are also skeptical.

With negotiations underway, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European union is determined to bolster the government's engagement with the business community on Brexit,  a government source said on Sunday.  That is why he recently announced an intention to coordinate activity with the prime minister, chancellor and business secretary to ensure we tap into the wealth of specialist knowledge from businesses up and down the country.  May's authority has been weakened since she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, only for her Conservative Party to lose its outright majority in parliament.

Ricky Hampton, 25, from Memphis, Tennessee, who performs under the name Finesse 2 Tymes, is a  person of interest  in the shooting at Little Rock's Power Ultra Lounge, Lieutenant Steven McClanahan, a spokesman for the Little Rock police, said.  Hampton was arrested on Sunday outside the Side Effects club in Birmingham, Alabama, on charges of aggravated assault with a gun, Cliff LaBarge, a U.S. Marshals Service spokesman, said in an email.  The performer was taken into custody on arrest warrants out of Forest City, Arkansas, Little Rock police said in a Twitter message. Little Rock police were questioning numerous people of interest in an effort to piece together a  complicated  series of events that unfolded at the Power Ultra Lounge, McClanahan said. Police are waiting for Hampton to be returned to Little Rock so he can be questioned, he said. No arrests have been made yet in the incident, which occurred early Saturday morning and left 25 people with gunshot wounds and three others injured as clubgoers scrambled for the exits. Hampton and another man were arrested in Alabama by members of the U.S. Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after they pulled up to the Side Effects club in a Mercedes and exited the car, LaBarge said, adding that officers seized three weapons found in the car. A promotional page for Hampton's performance shows a young man looking down the sight of what appears to be a gun, with the barrel pointed at the viewer. Little Rock police said on Saturday that the shooting might have stemmed from a running dispute between rival gangs.  A bystander's video broadcast by local media showed the crowded club at the moment gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of people screaming in the dark. McClanahan, the police spokesman, urged anyone with additional video footage taken inside the club to step forward.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said the melee highlighted a spike in violent crime in the state's largest city and called for steps to reverse the trend. Little Rock police are investigating about a dozen drive-by shootings in the past week, local media reported, including an incident in which a 7-year-old boy was wounded.

The British team had four riders in the top eight of Saturday’s opening time trial, with Geraint Thomas taking the race leader’s yellow jersey.    Little bubble pads were seen on the upper arms on the jerseys of several Team Sky riders, including that of defending champion Chris Froome. International Cycling Union (UCI) regulations state: “Garments must not be adapted in any way such that they diverge from their use purely as clothing. The addition of any non-essential element or device to clothing is prohibited.”“It is an actual part of the jersey, it was not added,” race jury president Philippe Marien told Reuters on Sunday.     “We summoned the team’s sports directors to check the jerseys. Nothing was added to them,” said Marien. Related CoverageSky time-trial suit only had 'placebo effect', says LeMondSome teams, however, were not happy with the jury's view. Reuters learnt that at least two rival teams had complained about the Team Sky jerseys ahead of Sunday’s 203.5-km ride to Liege.  It's enhanced aerodynamics and the regulations forbid it,  said Frederic Grappe, performance director at the FDJ team.  According to studies, the estimated gain is about four to seven percent.

Asked by a reporter if he had used the jersey before Saturday and what effect it had had on his performance, Thomas replied with sarcasm, saying:  You can borrow the suit if you want, see what time you do.

We will have control, we can decide the terms of access,  Gove told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday.

U.S. fund investors put the most money into overseas equities since the second quarter in 2015, with more than half of the $90 billion outflows for the first half coming in the second quarter, according to preliminary Lipper data. The MSCI Emerging market index has risen 17 percent year-to-date compared with a 4.9 percent rise for Europe's Stoxx 600 index and the S&P; 500 index's 8.0 percent gain. Since emerging market central banks have been lowering interest rates and their currencies have been falling in recent years this is now helping to boost economic growth, according to Northwestern Mutual's Chief Investment Strategist, Brent Schutte. But still the emerging market index is roughly 25 percent off its all-time high reached in 2007 while the Stoxx 600 is 8.0 percent off its record high. In comparison the S&P; 500 is just 1.0 percent below its latest record, reached in June 2017. The overseas indexes could reach new record highs over the next two years, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago citing improving growth.  Finally the recovery has really picked up in the rest of the world. It's moving along faster than the U.S. because it's trailed. The U.S. is further along because the central bank here really was aggressive in quantitative easing first,  said Ablin. For the second quarter, revenue for companies in European markets are expected to grow 5.8 percent compared with 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 index companies and 11.5 percent for emerging markets in the Asia Pacific Region, according to Reuters data. Earnings estimates for European companies for the period stand out with a 13.5 percent jump seen compared with 8.0 percent growth expected for the S&P; 500 and 6.4 percent for emerging markets. Northwestern Mutual's Schutte said his company is betting that outperformance in emerging market and European stocks should continue and cited a one-two year timeframe for investment in eurozone stocks in particular. His firm started moving money into non-U.S. stocks around February 2016 when it replaced investments in U.S. real estate investment trusts with equities in international developed markets in expectation of improving earnings growth. However, not everybody is convinced that the attraction of European stocks will last as long. John Praveen, chief investment strategist at, Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey was wary of predicting European outperformance beyond the next quarter. Praveen expects strong earnings growth in both Europe and emerging markets this year. But he said potential headwinds in Europe could include a pull back in European Central Bank monetary policy accommodation or uncertainly around a national Italian election, required by the end of the first half of 2018. But for now he said,  Their earnings outlook is stronger and their central bank is still providing quantitative easing liquidity while ours is raising rates and the Fed is starting normalization.

Previously, the highest denomination of Syrian banknote was 1,000 pounds. Assad's father, the late President Hafez al-Assad who died in 2000, appeared on coins and on an older version of the 1,000 pound note, which is still in circulation. Durgham said the new note was put into circulation  in Damascus and a number of the provinces . After years of war estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands of people, Assad appears militarily unassailable thanks in large part to direct military support from his allies Russia and Iran.

Some observers see the initiative of the G5 Sahel bloc - Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad - as forming the basis of an eventual exit strategy for around 4,000 French troops now deployed to the volatile region. But Macron said Paris had no plans to withdraw them. Islamist militant groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized control of Mali's desert north in 2012.  Though they were driven back a year later by a French-led military intervention, they continue to carry out attacks against on U.N. peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets in violence that has spilled across Mali's borders.  Every day we must combat terrorists, thugs, murderers, whose names and faces we must forget, but whom we must steadfastly and with determination eradicate together,  Macron said at the summit in Mali's capital Bamako. During the meeting, leaders of the G5 Sahel countries formally established the new force, which will operate in coordination with French troops and MINUSMA, Mali's struggling U.N. peacekeeping mission. The countries of the G5 Sahel bloc began floating the idea of a regional force as early as 2015, but since taking office in May, Macron has thrown Paris's weight behind the plan, including through a U.N. resolution last month. Related CoverageFrance's Macron vows to 'eradicate' kidnappers of French citizenFrance's Macron hopes Sahel force will be operational within weeks There is urgency because those we're confronting are not going to wait,  said Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.  It's also clear that France alone must not continue to bear the burden of this fight against terrorism.   Underfunded and Overstretched On Sunday, Macron said the force, which is expected to consist of around 5,000 troops, needed to be fully operational by this autumn.  French President Emmanuel Macron speaks during G5 Sahel Summit at the Koulouba Presidential Palace in Bamako, Mali, July 2, 2017.Luc GnagoBut he played down speculation that he was seeking to reduce the burden on France's cross-border Barkhane Operation, saying in a meeting with Mali's French community following the summit that Paris would  remain engaged for as long as it takes .  With its military headquarters in the northern Mali town of Sevare, the G5 Sahel force will focus on border zones - one along the frontier between Niger and Mali, another between Mali and Mauritania, and a third straddling the borders between Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali. Paris considers the Sahel a breeding ground for militants and traffickers who pose a threat to Europe.  Late on Saturday, JNIM, an al Qaeda-linked group, released a video showing six Western hostages abducted in the region in recent years. Slideshow (12 Images)Among them was French citizen Sophie Pétronin, whose kidnappers Macron said France would  put all our energy towards eradicating . While Sunday's summit marked a step forward in the plan to set up the new force, it still faces a number of obstacles.  The European Union has pledged around 50 million euros ($57 million), and Macron said France would contribute around 8 million euros by the end of the year.  Each of the G5 Sahel members will contribute 10 million euros for the force. But President Keita on Sunday estimated the required total budget at 423 million euros.  The G5 Sahel nations - among the world's poorest - are already overstretched.  Chad, Burkina Faso and Niger have deployed around 4,100 soldiers within MINUSMA. Niger and Chad also contribute troops to a similar regional force fighting Nigeria's Boko Haram militants. President Idriss Deby of Chad, which possesses the region's most capable military, has voiced reluctance to further commit his forces unless they receive more international support.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicked off celebrations amid heavy security and some 25,000 people assembled at a large outdoor celebration in front of the national Parliament in Ottawa, where Irish singer Bono and other members of rock band U2 enthralled the audience.  When others build walls, you open doors; when others divide, your arms are open wide; where you lead, others follow,  Bono said. But the bad weather meant a fly-past featuring Canadian warplanes was canceled and later on, an evening concert was delayed by an hour to allow the rain storms to pass. The long-anticipated Canada Day festivities, which included other features such as acrobats, and special citizenship ceremonies across large cities, concluded with fireworks. Trudeau, accompanied by Britain's Prince Charles, shook hands with some of the thousands of revelers who converged on Canada's capital Ottawa.  Canada is a country made strong not in spite of our differences but because of them,  Trudeau told the gathering.  We don't aspire to be a melting pot – indeed, we know true strength and resilience flows through Canadian diversity.  Still, in the run-up to the celebrations, some controversy was stirred at home, particularly among First Nations who noted Canada's history of mistreatment of indigenous people. Activists erected a teepee on Parliament Hill on Thursday in protest. On Saturday, about 100 indigenous protesters marched through Toronto, carrying red flags and with some holding the Canadian national flag upside down. Rubber Duck Some cities celebrated in more unusual ways. Toronto, Canada's largest city, featured a giant rubber duck floating in its harbor, while Calgary planned a  living flag  composed of people wearing red and white. The yellow duck, which cost C$200,000 ($154,273) including the rent, according to the Globe and Mail, drew criticism from some who described it as a waste of taxpayer money. Security was already ramped up in the days ahead of the celebration and partygoers contended with road closures and concrete barriers across entrances into Parliament Hill, located in downtown Ottawa. Heavy downpours prompted Ottawa firefighters to pump water off the grounds on Parliament Hill and the Ottawa Fire Service urged citizens to follow safety instructions. National and local police were also out in force, with security top of mind for many Canadians in the wake of fatal attacks in London, Paris and Germany.

Britain had ruled it before 1867.  Canada 150 years ago was a project, it was an idea to bring together four colonies with very different historical backgrounds,  said Pierre Anctil, history professor at the University of Ottawa.  We should celebrate but we should not be complacent. It's not a finished project,  he added.  Telegenic Pm The nationwide party comes as Canada is enjoying an unusual amount of interest from the rest of the world, largely due to the election of charismatic and selfie-prone leader Trudeau. Slideshow (50 Images) As a society, we must acknowledge and apologize for past wrongs, and chart a path forward for the next 150 years,  Trudeau said in a statement ahead of the official kickoff. Indigenous rights group Idle No More has called for a national day of action on Saturday, telling supporters to hold rallies and take to social media. Events and installations celebrating the sesquicentennial milestone have already been held across the country this year, with the total cost to the federal government reported to be half a billion dollars. Along with fireworks, free museums and outdoor concerts nationwide on Saturday, more than 50 special ceremonies to swear in new citizens were planned across the country.  Twitter users were sharing their favorite Canadian songs and food, along with photos of the preparations under the hashtag Canada150. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla arrived for an official visit on Thursday. The royals began a three-day tour with a trip to the northern territory of Nunavut, home to a large number of First Nations and Inuit people. The bash in Ottawa culminated with a musical fireworks show that is billed as largest-ever such display for Canada Day. It lasted 20 minutes and 17 seconds to commemorate 2017.

Etihad Airways welcomed the decision, and credited a preclearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport where passengers clear U.S. immigration before they land in the United States for  superior security advantages  that had allowed it to satisfy U.S. requirements. Etihad is the only airline that operates direct flights from Abu Dhabi to the United States. In March the United States banned laptops in cabins on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey - to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions. Last week, the United States unveiled security measures for flights to the country designed to prevent the expansion of the ban to more countries that could cause major logistical problems and deter travel. DHS spokesman David Lapan said on Twitter on Sunday that Etihad Airways and Abu Dhabi International Airport  have implemented the required initial enhanced security measures.  Etihad Airways operates 45 flights a week between Abu Dhabi and the United States, the company said. Dubai-based Emirates, the largest international airline by passenger traffic and a rival to Etihad, said in April it was cutting flights on five U.S. routes due to reduced demand, after a travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump and the laptop ban.

Our relationship is more important perhaps than ever before,  McCain told Pakistan TV as he left the meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is exploring hardening its approach toward Islamabad over Pakistan-based militants launching attacks in Afghanistan, two U.S. officials told Reuters last month.   We will not have peace in the region without Pakistan,  McCain, who was accompanied by senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue, said later.  Aziz, who is Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs because PM Nawaz Sharif holds the Foreign Ministry portfolio himself, said that the strategic partnership between Pakistan and the United States was  was critical to achieve peace and stability in the region and beyond .  U.S. officials say they seek greater cooperation with Pakistan, not a rupture in ties, after the review the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan, due in mid-July, where some 8,800 U.S. troops remain to support the Western-backed government.  Experts on America's longest war say militant safe havens in Pakistan have allowed Taliban-linked insurgents a place to plot attacks in Afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives. Critics say Islamabad is not doing enough to crack down on militants such as the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network.  Pakistan argues that it has done a great deal to help the U.S. in tracking down terrorists and points out that it has suffered hundreds of deaths in Islamist militants attacks in response to its crackdowns.  Pakistan last week also reacted sharply when the U.S. State Department on June 26 designated as a terrorist Syed Salahuddin, leader of the largest Kashmiri militant group fighting against Indian rule, accusing the U.S. of acquiescing to the wishes of visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Kashmir, ruled in part by India and Pakistan and claimed in entirety by both, is a hot-button issue between the nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain over the territory.  Aziz made a point on Sunday of mentioning what the foreign ministry called  gross human rights violations by the Indian security forces in Kashmir  and the international community's  silence .

After being faster than his rivals in Saturday's opening time trial, defending champion Froome was sitting comfortably near the front of the peloton when he was brought down as a Katusha rider lost his balance in front of him some 30km from the finish.  I have no injuries thankfully - I’ve just lost a little bit of skin on my backside. That’s the nature of the race,  said Froome. The Briton's Sky team mate Geraint Thomas and last year's runner-up, Frenchman Romain Bardet (AG2R-La Mondiale), were also involved in the pile-up but made it back to the main pack along with three-time champion Froome after a brief chase. Thomas, who was quicker to get back on his back and sustained no injuries, retained the overall leader's yellow jersey at the end of the 203.5-km ride from Duesseldorf in Germany, ahead of Swiss Stefan Kueng (BMC Racing) and Kittel.    When that (a crash in the front) happens there's nowhere to go, said Thomas.  There is no real damage at all, he (Froome) lost a bit of skin, but it's all good. You've got to be super lucky to miss it and avoid it.

I hope I will have a good night’s sleep. I was able to get back up on my bike very quickly, and the whole team surrounded me, so I lost no time. It could have been much worse.     Breakaway riders American Taylor Phinney (Cannondale-Drapac), nearing his best after a serious leg injury in 2014, and Frenchman Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Group Gobert), were given some breathing space as the pile-up slowed down the peloton.

Dar es Salaam is vying with the port of Mombasa in Kenya to become the trade hub for landlocked neighbors such as Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Burundi, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but both ports are hobbled by congestion and inefficiency. The port handled 13.8 million tonnes in 2016 - an increase from 10.4 million in 2011, reflecting an average growth of 9 percent per year, according to the bank. Tanzania wants to lift its capacity to 28 million tonnes a year by 2020.  The project represents the start of an incremental process towards increasing the capacity of the port of Dar es Salaam and strengthening its economic role in the region,  Richard Martin Humphreys, the World Bank's lead transport economist, said in a statement. In a 2014 report, the bank said inefficiencies at the port was costing Tanzania and its neighbors up to $2.6 billion a year.  The statement said ongoing infrastructure investments at the port were expected to improve overall productivity and reduce waiting time to berth from 80 hours to 30 hours.  Enhancing its operational potential will boost trade ... and reduce the current cost of $200-$400 for each additional day of delay for a single consignment,  said Bella Bird, the World Bank's Country Director for Tanzania. The loan is the second batch to be approved by the bank for the expansion of the port this year. Tanzania received $305 million in January. Last month, the country also signed a $154 million contract with the state-run China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to build a roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) terminal to deepen and strengthen seven berths at the port.

The authorities said it was one of three car bombs that were meant to be blown up in crowded areas of the capital on Sunday, the first day back to work from the Eid al-Fitr holiday. Security forces pursued and destroyed the other two. Officials said the bombers had been prevented from reaching their intended targets, otherwise the casualty toll would have been higher. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Damascus was hit by two separate, multiple suicide bomb attacks in March, one of them claimed by Islamic State and the other by the Islamist insurgent alliance Tahrir al-Sham. In a letter to the U.N. secretary general and the head of the security council, the foreign ministry said the blast that killed 20 people in the Bab Touma area near the Old City had also wounded dozens of women and children.  State media said the bomber had been spotted and pursued by the security forces and set off the bomb after he had been encircled in the area.

Footage broadcast by state TV from the blast that caused the fatalities near the Old City showed roads scattered with debris, several badly damaged cars, and another one that had been turned into a pile of twisted metal. Slideshow (17 Images)Footage from another of the blast sites showed what appeared to be the remains of a person and badly damaged vehicles outside a mosque in the Baytara traffic circle near the Old City. On March 15, two suicide bomb attacks in Damascus killed several dozen people, most of them at the Palace of Justice courthouse near the Old City. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. On March 11, a double suicide attack in the capital killed scores of people, most of them Iraqi Shi'ite pilgrims. That attack was claimed by the Tahrir al-Sham alliance of Islamist insurgents, which is spearheaded by a jihadist group formerly known as the Nusra Front. Syrian government forces, which have defeated rebel fighters in several suburbs of Damascus over the last year, are currently battling insurgents in the Jobar and Ain Tarma areas on the capital's eastern outskirts. A rebel group accused the army of using chlorine gas in the fighting on Saturday. The army denied the claim as fabrications.

Illumination and Universal's  Despicable Me 3  is cruising to an easy box office win during a busy holiday weekend. The latest in the franchise is opening to $75.4 million from 4,529 locations -- the widest domestic release ever. That total is lower than earlier estimates, which pegged the film above $80 million (earlier tracking suggested it could land even higher), but nevertheless it remains the weekend's big winner. Steve Carell plays double duty in  Despicable Me 3  as the series' protagonist Gru, and now also his twin brother, Dru. The plot centers on the brothers, as they team up for a criminal heist.  South Park  co-creator Trey Parker joins the franchise to voice the villain. Critics are generally on the movie's side, earning it a 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie earned an A- CinemaScore from audiences, which is lower than the A earned by the first two installments and  Minions.   With these characters that have reached a level of ubiquity in our culture, these movies continue to create this want to see,  said Nick Carpou, Universal's domestic distribution chief, who added,  I think we have the best marketing group in the business.  Despite  Despicable's  rule, perhaps the more interesting stories for the industry reside further down the box office chart. Starting with  Baby Driver,  from Sony's TriStar Pictures, MRC, and Working Title. Edgar Wright's latest also appears to be his biggest box office hit, as it's cruising to $30 million from 3,226 locations -- that's including the $5.7 million head start the movie got by opening early in previews on Tuesday. The movie centers around a character named Baby (Ansel Elgort), who becomes the getaway driver for a kingpin named Doc (Kevin Spacey). Music plays an integral role in the film since Baby suffered a traumatic experience as a child that left him with tinnitus, which he blocks out with music. The rest of the cast includes Lily James, Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx.  Edgar and our partners at MRC and Working Title have made one of the most original and entertaining films in recent memory, and we're so thrilled to see it received as a bonafide hit in a crowded summer season,  said Sony's distribution chief Adrian Smith. FILE PHOTO: Characters in costume pose for photographers at the premiere of  Despicable Me 3  in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 24, 2017.Phil McCarten/File Photo Baby Driver,  like  Get Out  earlier this year and  The Big Sick,  currently showing strong in limited release, is the kind of project that gets Hollywood excited about the chance for original ideas to also be financially viable. Wright's film picked up buzz when it won the Audience Award and positive early reviews at the SXSW Film Festival. The movie's marketing capitalized on its colorful aesthetic and emphasis on music. Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell's  The House,  meanwhile, is having trouble attracting visitors. The R-rated comedy from New Line, Warner Bros., and Village Roadshow is opening to $9 million from 3,134 locations.  The House  is the story of a husband (Ferrell) and wife (Poehler) who start an underground casino to help raise money for their daughter's college fund. Andrew Jay Cohen directed from a script that he wrote with Brendan O'Brien -- the two previously collaborated on the  Neighbors  movies. For the weekend's top five, Paramount's  Transformers: The Last Knight  should land in third with $17 million during its second weekend.  Wonder Woman  continues to be a force for Warner Bros., and is on its way to $15.6 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie has crossed $700 million worldwide and passed  Suicide Squad  and  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  at the domestic box office. And Disney and Pixar's  Cars 3  should take the five slot during its third week with $9.5 million domestically. After a strong start to 2017, a rather slow summer box office overall has brought the year-to-date box office numbers down to about even with last year.  A weak May followed by a June that failed to become the savior of the summer now puts July in the hot seat to deliver the goods and get us out of the summer season doldrums,  said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. Outside of the major release circuit, the arthouse appears to have some juice for the first time this summer with strong numbers from  The Little Hours,   The Beguiled,  and  The Big Sick.  Gunpowder and Sky's first theatrical release,  Little Hours  posted the highest per screen average from two locations this weekend. The nun-centric religious satire starring Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza should open to $61,560. Meanwhile, Sofia Coppola's  Beguiled  expects to crack the top ten in limited release, after expanding to 674 locations. The Focus Features release should make an estimated $3.3 million over the three-day weekend. And Kumail Nanjiani's semi-autobiographical romantic comedy  Big Sick  expanded to 71 locations, posting a three-day total of $1.67 million. Lionsgate and Amazon Studios are planning to push the film to wide release on July 14.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN19N0SK"},

Sky had four riders in the top eight on Saturday, with Geraint Thomas taking the overall leader's yellow jersey. Little bubble pads were seen on the upper arms on the jerseys of several Sky riders, including that of defending champion Chris Froome. Although the race jury said there was nothing illegal, at least two teams complained, saying there was an obvious gain in aerodynamics.  No way,  American LeMond, on the Tour as an analyst with Eurosport, told Reuters in a daily chat about the race he won in 1986, 1989 and 1990.  They did that in swimming 25 years ago, it's only marketing.   It has a great placebo effect. I doubt very much it gave them an advantage.  Sky's domination was more due to their great shape going into a race they have always favored over any other event.  If you look at Team Sky, they're motivated,  said LeMond. Froome gained time over all his rivals on Saturday, notably on Australian Richie Porte, who had beaten him comprehensively last month at the Criterium du Dauphine.  It looked like Richie Porte went slowly to the turns,  LeMond said. Froome crashed during Sunday's second stage but there was little he could do to avoid crashing to the ground. The Briton was well positioned near the front of the peloton but was taken down when a Katusha rider lost balance ahead of him on a slippery corner.   He was in the front of the group, there's not a lot anybody could do,  said LeMond.  It was fortunate for them that the peloton did slow down.

Steve Carell plays double duty in  Despicable Me 3  as the series' protagonist Gru, and now also his twin brother, Dru. The plot centers on the brothers, as they team up for a criminal heist.  South Park  co-creator Trey Parker joins the franchise to voice the villain. Critics are generally on the movie's side, earning it a 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie earned an A- CinemaScore from audiences, which is lower than the A earned by the first two installments and  Minions.   With these characters that have reached a level of ubiquity in our culture, these movies continue to create this want to see,  said Nick Carpou, Universal's domestic distribution chief, who added,  I think we have the best marketing group in the business.  Despite  Despicable's  rule, perhaps the more interesting stories for the industry reside further down the box office chart. Starting with  Baby Driver,  from Sony's TriStar Pictures, MRC, and Working Title. Edgar Wright's latest also appears to be his biggest box office hit, as it's cruising to $30 million from 3,226 locations -- that's including the $5.7 million head start the movie got by opening early in previews on Tuesday. The movie centers around a character named Baby (Ansel Elgort), who becomes the getaway driver for a kingpin named Doc (Kevin Spacey). Music plays an integral role in the film since Baby suffered a traumatic experience as a child that left him with tinnitus, which he blocks out with music. The rest of the cast includes Lily James, Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx.  Edgar and our partners at MRC and Working Title have made one of the most original and entertaining films in recent memory, and we're so thrilled to see it received as a bonafide hit in a crowded summer season,  said Sony's distribution chief Adrian Smith. FILE PHOTO: Characters in costume pose for photographers at the premiere of  Despicable Me 3  in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 24, 2017.Phil McCarten/File Photo Baby Driver,  like  Get Out  earlier this year and  The Big Sick,  currently showing strong in limited release, is the kind of project that gets Hollywood excited about the chance for original ideas to also be financially viable. Wright's film picked up buzz when it won the Audience Award and positive early reviews at the SXSW Film Festival. The movie's marketing capitalized on its colorful aesthetic and emphasis on music. Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell's  The House,  meanwhile, is having trouble attracting visitors. The R-rated comedy from New Line, Warner Bros., and Village Roadshow is opening to $9 million from 3,134 locations.  The House  is the story of a husband (Ferrell) and wife (Poehler) who start an underground casino to help raise money for their daughter's college fund. Andrew Jay Cohen directed from a script that he wrote with Brendan O'Brien -- the two previously collaborated on the  Neighbors  movies. For the weekend's top five, Paramount's  Transformers: The Last Knight  should land in third with $17 million during its second weekend.  Wonder Woman  continues to be a force for Warner Bros., and is on its way to $15.6 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie has crossed $700 million worldwide and passed  Suicide Squad  and  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  at the domestic box office. And Disney and Pixar's  Cars 3  should take the five slot during its third week with $9.5 million domestically. After a strong start to 2017, a rather slow summer box office overall has brought the year-to-date box office numbers down to about even with last year.  A weak May followed by a June that failed to become the savior of the summer now puts July in the hot seat to deliver the goods and get us out of the summer season doldrums,  said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. Outside of the major release circuit, the arthouse appears to have some juice for the first time this summer with strong numbers from  The Little Hours,   The Beguiled,  and  The Big Sick.  Gunpowder and Sky's first theatrical release,  Little Hours  posted the highest per screen average from two locations this weekend. The nun-centric religious satire starring Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza should open to $61,560. Meanwhile, Sofia Coppola's  Beguiled  expects to crack the top ten in limited release, after expanding to 674 locations. The Focus Features release should make an estimated $3.3 million over the three-day weekend. And Kumail Nanjiani's semi-autobiographical romantic comedy  Big Sick  expanded to 71 locations, posting a three-day total of $1.67 million. Lionsgate and Amazon Studios are planning to push the film to wide release on July 14.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-boxoffice-idUSL1N1JT09E"},

Pollock (quad, groin) hit two homers while playing seven innings Friday at Triple-A Reno, so it would appear his bat is ready to return to the majors. But the Diamondbacks are intent on not rushing him back, probably because he injured a quadriceps early in his rehabilitation assignment, causing him to lose almost a week. He last played on May 14.  He obviously had a very good day,  manager Torey Lovullo.  He's going to play again (Saturday) night, so he's going back to back days, and then we'll see where we're at. ... But we need to get through this back-to-back.  1B Paul Goldschmidt's production was a big plus during a recent run of 13 wins in 15 games. But when he went cold on the Diamondbacks' 10-game homestand that ends Sunday, so did his team. Since taking a day off Monday against the Phillies, Goldschmidt is 2-for-18 with seven strikeouts and has looked to be susceptible to sliders and other breaking pitches down and away. Overall on the homestand, Goldschmidt is 5-for-28 with one homer, two RBIS, five walks and eight strikeouts. But his triple in the fourth Saturday keyed a two-run inning against the Rockies, and the Diamondbacks went on to win 6-2 and halt their three-game losing streak. RHP Zack Greinke will miss pitching next week against the Dodgers, his former team, in a key three-game series starting Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.  I believe in all of our starters,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  When I get up, I think, OK, Zack (Greinke) is pitching today or Zack Godley or Patrick Corbin. It's a nice, comfortable feeling. Driving to the ballpark, I can't wait to see what this game will bring.  RHP Fernando Rodney enjoyed an exceptional May, giving up only one run and two hits in 9 2/3 innings over 10 games, saving seven of them. But, remarkably, his June was even better -- not only did he not give up a run in nine innings over nine games, he didn't give up a hit. Rodney is the fourth pitcher in major league history to face at 28 batters in a single month and not allow a hit, joining Edwar Ramirez (37 batters, 2008), Bryan Harvey (33 batters, 1989) and Sparky Lyle (29 batters, 1970).

Molitor said  it's tough  to send a player to the minors after a solid outing. He's very likeable. He's done a good job here. I think he's learned a little bit how his stuff plays and what he needs to do better. Hopefully he'll take this window to try to touch on some of those things.

You guys have watched him,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  You've seen him when he's done really well and when he's scuffled. He can be his own worst enemy as far as putting himself in bad spots by giving free passes and those type of things. He's had some better outings of late. I thought his couple when he came up here were decent. But then, you know, like the other night when he walked the first two guys in a one-run game. There's still some of those things that he's got to figure out to give himself the best chance. Make guys swing the bat. His stuff's good. So, we'll see how he does this time around.

In Maine, a bipartisan legislative committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the state's $7.055 billion, two-year budget. In New Jersey, the legislature was due to reconvene to resolve a political fight over a controversial bill that Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the state’s budget. After House Republicans in Maine voted to reject a compromise deal on Saturday, the Bangor Daily News reported that Republican Minority Leader Ken Fredette presented a $7.1 billion plan he said could get the governor's approval, but some Democrats noted that was costlier than the rejected compromise. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday.  The Speaker thinks it is unconscionable that Maine doesn't have a budget, especially leading into the holiday weekend,  Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon, said Sunday morning. If the budget committee meeting on Sunday in Augusta agrees on a deal, the measure would go to the full legislature. LePage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. The stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. But it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, Casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will operate during the current shutdown, the state's first since 1991. New Jersey residents were not so lucky. With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing, the shutdown included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jersey’s few free public beaches, and all other state parks. Christie was unapologetic when he told reporters he and his family would spend Saturday night at one of the governor’s residences at the shuttered beach park.  That's just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you can have a residence there,  he said, when pressed. At the center of the budget stalemate is a controversial plan that would shake up the state’s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. Christie says the insurer is not transparent and that a few staff make key decisions in return for high salaries. The proposal would force Horizon to spend some of its reserves on drug addiction and other services. He has threatened to strike out $150 million in school funding and other items from the budget if the legislature failed to approve the plan. Christie, a former presidential contender whose reputation was tarnished by the Bridgegate traffic scandal involving some of his closest aides, is already the least popular governor in state history. He is in the last months of his second and final term. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto and other Democrats say the Horizon bill, introduced only on Thursday, is “bad public policy.” Prieto said he would vote on the Horizon bill after the budget passed. Christie blamed Prieto for the shutdown, and the pair traded barbed comments on Twitter but did not meet in person.

In her weekly podcast, Merkel said this year's G20 summit will delve into issues championed by protesters such as distribution of wealth and consumption of resources - alongside related issues like climate change, free markets, consumer protection and upholding social standards. Hamburg police said 10,000 demonstrators marched peacefully in the rain in Hamburg on Sunday in a prelude to the July 7-8 gathering, where 21,000 police from across Germany will protect the meetings of the world's 20 largest economies. It was the first of 30 registered demonstrations this week. Some carried banners reading  Fight poverty ,  stop coal  and  Planet earth first . German authorities are bracing for trouble, worried the protests could turn violent as they did outside a G8 summit in Genoa, Italy in 2001 when one person was shot dead and hundreds injured.  It's not only going to be about (economic) growth but rather sustainable growth,  Merkel said.  We've got to have a 'win-win' situation for everyone. The issues obviously revolve around: how do we achieve inclusive or sustainable growth?  Merkel, seeking a fourth term in a Sept. 24 election, outlined the issues as:  What are we doing with our resources? What are the rules for distribution of wealth? How many people are taking part? And how many countries are able to profit from that?  People with giant balloons take part in protests ahead of the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 2, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeWithout mentioning the protests that have German security officials worried about possible acts of sabotage this week in the country's second-largest city, Merkel noted that these non-traditional issues were forced onto the G20 agenda.  If we simply try to carry on as we have in the past, the worldwide developments will definitely not be sustainable and inclusive,  she said.  We need the climate protection agreement, open markets and improved trade agreements in which consumer protection, social and environmental standards are upheld.  In a speech to parliament last week, Merkel promised to fight for free trade and press on with multilateral efforts to combat climate change at the summit, challenging the  America First  policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. Slideshow (18 Images)The G20 meeting follows a G7 summit in Sicily a month ago that exposed deep divisions between other Western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. Trump later announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. The German Federal Crime Office warned that violent G20 opponents could carry out arson and sabotage at infrastructure targets such as the Hamburg harbor and airport, newspaper Welt am Sonntag said on Sunday.

Hundreds of mourners turned out to attend the non-religious ceremony in Madrid for Timoteo Mendieta, a trade unionist shot in the months following the Spanish Civil War and buried in a mass grave in a Guadalajara cemetery. The search for Timoteo Mendieta's remains marks the first instance of graves being dug on the orders of an Argentine judge in a lawsuit seeking redress for crimes committed during the 1936-1939 civil war and the almost four-decade dictatorship of General Francisco Franco that followed.  (Burying Timoteo) means the end of a cycle and the end of a tremendous battle against the Spanish state, which has been, I would say, very cruel to families who have relatives in mass graves,  Francisco Vargas Medienta, grandson of Timoteo, said after the funeral. Attending the ceremony accompanied by her three children, Ascensión Mendieta held a bouquet of flowers decorated in the red, purple and gold of the Second Spanish Republic, which was overthrown by the forces loyal to Franco. Among those paying their respects were relatives of victims of the Franco regime, several of them currently in the process of fighting their own legal battles to obtain exhumation orders to search for murdered family members. In the Guadalajara cemetery mass graves alone, there are an estimated 800 victims of political violence, according to the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), a non-profit group that works to recognize victims of the war. Following the Guadalajara exhumation, around 100families of victims believed to be buried there requested help to identify remains. Ascension Mendieta (C), daughter of Timoteo Mendieta, who was shot in 1939 by forces of dictator Francisco Franco, leaves with her grandson Sergio after the burial of her father after he was exhumed from a mass grave in Guadalajara's cemetery by the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory(ARMH), in Madrid, Spain July 2, 2017.Juan MedinaIn an effort to smooth a 1977 transition to democracy, Spain passed an amnesty law pardoning political crimes committed in the past – the so-called  Pact of Forgetting . Some exhumations began in 2000, though the resting place for many victims are still unknown. The ARMH has documented114,226 cases of men and women buried in mass graves around Spain. Slideshow (10 Images) There are at least 3,000 mass graves. We're not even sure exactly how many, but it's a lot,  said Emilio Silva, head of the ARMH. Ascensión Mendieta – who was 13 when she unwittingly opened the door to the men who took her father away - has repeatedly said she hopes the case of Timoteo serves to highlight the large numbers of remains still unidentified. Francisco Vargas Mendieta said that the experience left his mother, and many like her, emotionally scarred, and that activists would continue working to identify the dead.  My mother has always lived with this wound,  Vargas said.  And there are many people like her even now. We are not going to stop until the maximum number of people possible are able to take flowers to those who were executed, or until these people receive a dignified burial.  Historians estimate as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians were killed on the Republican and Nationalist sides in the war. After it ended, tens of thousands of Franco's enemies were killed or imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent.

In her weekly podcast, Merkel said this year's G20 summit will delve into issues championed by protesters such as distribution of wealth and consumption of resources - alongside related issues like climate change, free markets, consumer protection and upholding social standards. Hamburg police said 10,000 demonstrators marched peacefully in the rain in Hamburg on Sunday in a prelude to the July 7-8 gathering, where 21,000 police from across Germany will protect the meetings of the world's 20 largest economies. It was the first of 30 registered demonstrations this week. Some carried banners reading  Fight poverty ,  stop coal  and  Planet earth first . German authorities are bracing for trouble, worried the protests could turn violent as they did outside a G8 summit in Genoa, Italy in 2001 when one person was shot dead and hundreds injured.  It's not only going to be about (economic) growth but rather sustainable growth,  Merkel said.  We've got to have a 'win-win' situation for everyone. The issues obviously revolve around: how do we achieve inclusive or sustainable growth?  Merkel, seeking a fourth term in a Sept. 24 election, outlined the issues as:  What are we doing with our resources? What are the rules for distribution of wealth? How many people are taking part? And how many countries are able to profit from that?  People with giant balloons take part in protests ahead of the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 2, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeWithout mentioning the protests that have German security officials worried about possible acts of sabotage this week in the country's second-largest city, Merkel noted that these non-traditional issues were forced onto the G20 agenda.  If we simply try to carry on as we have in the past, the worldwide developments will definitely not be sustainable and inclusive,  she said.  We need the climate protection agreement, open markets and improved trade agreements in which consumer protection, social and environmental standards are upheld.  In a speech to parliament last week, Merkel promised to fight for free trade and press on with multilateral efforts to combat climate change at the summit, challenging the  America First  policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. Slideshow (18 Images)The G20 meeting follows a G7 summit in Sicily a month ago that exposed deep divisions between other Western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. Trump later announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. The German Federal Crime Office warned that violent G20 opponents could carry out arson and sabotage at infrastructure targets such as the Hamburg harbor and airport, newspaper Welt am Sonntag said on Sunday.

In Buenos Aires province, Argentina's most populous, government-aligned candidates would take 28.5 percent of the vote, while Fernandez-aligned candidates would take 27.8 percent, according to the poll, which was carried out by the consultancy Management & Fit. The figures put the two lists within the poll's margin of error, Clarin said, though the newspaper did not specify the margin of error. The poll had 2,000 respondents. Fernandez, who was president between 2007 and 2015, formed a new party independent of Peronism, Argentina's dominant political movement, before announcing her bid for a Senate seat last month. Although the October election is not expected to fundamentally change the balance of power in Congress, where no party has a majority, it has symbolic power for center-right President Mauricio Macri, particularly in Buenos Aires province, which is home to a quarter of the electorate. Macri's allies need a strong showing against Fernandez to convince investors he could win a second term and execute an ambitious agenda of economic reform.  Macri, scion of one of Argentina's wealthiest families, eked out a surprise win in the province in 2015, launching him to the presidency and interrupting over a decade of populist, left-wing rule. But he has cut popular energy and transportation subsidies to get Argentina's finances in order, earning some enemies in low-income towns. In the poll, the 1Pais party of relatively moderate ex-presidential candidate Sergio Massa had 24.1 percent of voters in the province, putting it in third place.

Konta, who will be seeded sixth, hurt her back and banged her head as she tumbled on the grass during last week's quarter-final win over Angelique Kerber at the Aegon International in Eastbourne.  A shaken Konta pulled out of last Friday's semi-final, raising doubts over her participation at Wimbledon, which starts on Monday. However, the 26-year-old said on Sunday that she had recovered well and, like fellow Briton Andy Murray, intends to forget her injury problems and take her place in the draw.  I'm definitely recovering really well,  she told a news conference.  I practiced today. I felt good. I'm definitely looking forward to playing my first round. Like Andy, I'd like to think that I'm fit enough to play seven matches but I'm going to be taking it one at a time.

Slideshow (2 Images) Well, I know she does enjoy the grass. She's a Wimbledon champion in doubles here on the grass, so she definitely can play on this surface. Actually, the first time I played her, I lost to her on the grass.  I'm definitely going into the match knowing that she will be playing very comfortably on the surface, she will definitely look to make things difficult for me.  With no Serena Williams or obvious favorite in a wide-open draw, Konta will face extra pressure this year as the home crowd  urge her to emulate Murray's recent success in the men's tournament.  I know there's, I guess, more attention, and there's more interest in my performance, but that's also a good thing. It means we're talking more about women's tennis in this country,  said Konta, who was born to Hungarian parents in Sydney and moved to Britain at the age of 14.

Dar es Salaam is vying with the port of Mombasa in Kenya to become the trade hub for landlocked neighbors such as Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Burundi, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but both ports are hobbled by congestion and inefficiency. The port handled 13.8 million tonnes in 2016 - an increase from 10.4 million in 2011, reflecting an average growth of 9 percent per year, according to the bank. Tanzania wants to lift its capacity to 28 million tonnes a year by 2020.  The project represents the start of an incremental process towards increasing the capacity of the port of Dar es Salaam and strengthening its economic role in the region,  Richard Martin Humphreys, the World Bank's lead transport economist, said in a statement. In a 2014 report, the bank said inefficiencies at the port was costing Tanzania and its neighbors up to $2.6 billion a year.  The statement said ongoing infrastructure investments at the port were expected to improve overall productivity and reduce waiting time to berth from 80 hours to 30 hours.  Enhancing its operational potential will boost trade ... and reduce the current cost of $200-$400 for each additional day of delay for a single consignment,  said Bella Bird, the World Bank's Country Director for Tanzania. The loan is the second batch to be approved by the bank for the expansion of the port this year. Tanzania received $305 million in January. Last month, the country also signed a $154 million contract with the state-run China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to build a roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) terminal to deepen and strengthen seven berths at the port.

Folger, a rookie who started fifth, became the first German to stand on the podium in his home grand prix in the MotoGP era with his first top-three finish since graduating from the Moto2 class. Dani Pedrosa, Marquez's team mate and compatriot, finished a distant third. The win was triple champion Marquez's second of the season and sent him clear at the top with 129 points, five ahead of Yamaha's Maverick Vinales, who finished fourth and is on 124 after nine races. Italian Andrea Dovizioso, the previous leader, slipped to third on 123 points after crossing the line in eighth place. Compatriot Valentino Rossi, who finished fifth, is fourth overall on 119 points.   It was a really fast race, the rhythm was incredible,  said Marquez.  I was pushing but he (Folger) was just following me.  I'm really happy to go now on the summer holidays leading the championship,  added the Spaniard, who was 37 points adrift  three races ago. The next race is at Brno in the Czech Republic on Aug. 6. Marquez's run of success at the Sachsenring, near Chemnitz,  started in 2010 when he was in the 125cc category. He won in Moto2 in 2011 and 2012 before his streak of five victories in MotoGP. He led into turn one on Sunday, with Pedrosa slotting in behind but Folger stayed in touch and moved up to third before then passing Pedrosa.

The verdicts can again be appealed. The case involves 156 people on trial and is known as the  Kerdasa incident  in reference to the pro-Muslim Brotherhood neighborhood where the violence took place in the Giza province adjacent to Cairo. Islamist gunmen fired rocket propelled grenades at a police station in Kerdasa on Aug. 14, 2013, and slit a policeman's throat before burning the building down, hours after security forces violently dispersed two protest camps, killing hundreds.  The crimes the defendants are accused of were committed by a group charged with carrying them out,  said Judge Sherine Fahmy before reading out the verdict.  Some committed murder themselves, others stole, or burned, some guarded the road so the assailants could commit their crimes, and some blocked the roads to prevent help from coming, some incited citizens against the military and police using mosque speakers and microphones on the streets. If it were not for all of that, these crimes would not have been committed.  The court also sentenced 80 people to life in prison and 34 to 15 years in jail. One minor was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 21 people were acquitted. A different court had initially sentenced 183 people to death, including 28 in absentia, and a minor to jail for 10 years in 2015 for the murder of 11 policemen. Those sentenced in absentia are automatically retried if they hand themselves in. The defendants appealed and the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest criminal and civil court, ordered a retrial of the 156 who are in custody. Egypt's legal system allows the defendants a second and final appeal following Sunday's verdict. Egypt's military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Sisi was elected president a year later.

The government will on Monday begin a two-year process to leave the London Fisheries Convention, an agreement dating from 1964, before Britain joined the European Union, that allows vessels from France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands to fish in British waters.  We will have control, we can decide the terms of access,  Gove told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday. Gove, a prominent leave campaigners in the EU referendum, also said that once Britain left the trading bloc, it would be able to extend control of its waters to 200 miles, or to the median line between Britain and France or Britain and Ireland. He said that leaving the London Fisheries Convention meant that for the first time in more than 50 years, Britain would be able to decide who could access its waters.  This is a historic first step towards building a new domestic fishing policy as we leave the European Union - one which leads to a more competitive, profitable and sustainable industry for the whole of the UK,  he said. The government said an estimated 10,000 tonnes of fish was caught by vessels from France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands in 2015 within 12 nautical miles of the British coast. Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine Michael Creed said the move was  unwelcome and unhelpful , but not surprising at the start of Brexit negotiations, including the common fisheries policy.  The Irish fishing fleet has access to parts of the UK six-12 mile zone, as has the UK fleet to parts of the Irish zone,  he said.  These access rights were incorporated into the EU Common Fisheries Policy when we joined the EU.  The European Commission said it  took note , but also felt the convention had been superseded by EU law, the BBC reported.

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at the weekend that the demands were made to be rejected. He insisted Qatar would not close a Turkish military base or shut Doha-based satellite channel Al Jazeera. The four Arab states have warned they may impose further sanctions if Qatar does not comply; they did not give details, but bankers believe, for example, that Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits from Qatar. Doha's stock index retreated 2.3 percent to 8,822 points, erasing most of the 2.9 percent gains it made on June 22, its last trading before it closed for a week-long Eid al-Fitr holiday. In the final hour of trade on Sunday the index hit an 18-month intra-day low as local traders - which made up a little under three-fifths of the daily traded value on Sunday - were net sellers by a tiny margin for the first time since the crisis erupted on June 5. Foreign funds, however, took advantage of the recent price dips and were net buyers by a wide margin for a second consecutive session. This suggested some funds are willing to bear the heightened geopolitical risk because some companies offer attractive dividend yields. Nevertheless, on Sunday 43 shares dropped and only two rose. Qatar Islamic Bank lost 5.8 percent. The index is now down 11.1 percent since June 5. Kuwait's stock index lost 2.2 percent to 6,613 points in very thin trade, heading towards its immediate technical support at the mid-May low of 6,545 points. Telecommunications operator Zain lost 1.7 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi's index rose 0.4 percent on the back of strong gains in some large cap banking shares;  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank climbed 2.6 percent. In neighbouring Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank fell 1.2 percent, helping take the index 0.3 percent lower. Outperformers Saudi Arabia's index extended its strong winning streak for a third session after being shut for a week for Eid al-Fitr and added 0.8 percent. Daily traded volumes shrank by about a half from the average of the previous two sessions. The index is now up 6.2 percent since June 20 when index compiler MSCI said it would add Riyadh on a watch list for an emerging market upgrade. The rally has also been supported by the announcement that the kingdom made the architect of the economic reforms, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, next in line to be king at around the same. Shares of heavyweight National Commercial Bank jumped 6.3 percent on Sunday to a fresh 21-month peak. The majority government owned lender is expected to benefit both from MSCI's decision and the expectation that the ambitious economic agenda may translate to higher future earnings. Petrochemical shares were also strong with Saudi Kayan Petrochemical adding 1.9 percent. In Egypt, the index rose 0.7 percent as shares of private equity firm Qalaa Holdings, the most heavily traded stock, climbed 3.8 percent.

At the same time the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ramped-up its support for Zuma, saying members of its parliamentary caucus who defied the party line were  suicide bombers  who would face punishment if they voted with the opposition. Zuma has survived four no-confidence votes during his eight years in power owing to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority, although cracks in unity have begun to appear with a number of allies threatening to break ranks. The assembly's speaker has yet to decide whether the latest ballot will be held in secret after the country's top court ruled in June that secret votes may be held for motions of no confidence.  Zuma's critics want the no-confidence vote to be anonymous hoping it will embolden lawmakers from his party to support his ouster by shielding them from pressure. Zuma's administration has been beset by scandals and criticized for failing to address serious economic problems, with calls for his resignation sharpening after he fired the finance minister in March, triggering a double downgrade of the country's debt to  junk . On Sunday, however, police minister and head of the ANC's sub-committee on organization, Fikile Mbalula, described party lawmakers thinking of voting Zuma out as  suicide bombers .        Members of the ANC have no right to represent their own jackets in parliament. They represent the organization. They are suicide bombers (if they vote against Zuma),  Mbalula told reporters at a media conference.  The ANC will apply disciplinary procedures for those want to vote using their so-called conscience,  Mbalula said.

The film bore the name of Al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group JNIM. Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the footage, or when or where it was taken.

Islamist militant groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized Mali’s desert north in 2012.  A military intervention by former colonial power France drove them out of major cities a year later, but they continue to attack U.N. peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets. The violence has spilled over into neighboring countries in West Africa’s arid Sahel region and Paris has deployed thousands of French troops to combat Islamists under a cross-border operation known as Barkhane.

In an editorial article published in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kganyago said the recent recommendation by an anti-graft agency for the central bank to focus on growth misunderstood the dangers of persistently high consumer prices.  The past half-century is littered with examples of painful recessions caused by the need to reduce runaway inflation created by authorities trying to create growth by printing money,  Kganyago said. Credit downgrades by two of the top three ratings agencies, based on the economic and political turmoil, have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa, which has just suffered two quarters of economic contraction. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set-off a political row this month when she called for an overhaul of the bank's mandate - to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency - rattling investors and hitting the rand hard. The bank has since filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. On Friday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba echoed parliament's and the ruling party's denouncement of the recommendation, accusing the agency of overstepping the mark. The bank aims to keep price-growth below 6 percent, currently at 5.4 percent, and since early 2014 has lifted benchmark interest rates by 200 basis points in a bid to cool inflation and encourage long-term investment.

Aldi and its German discounter rival Lidl have become giants in European retail, upending Britain's grocery retail market, and are challenging U.S. retailers as well. Aldi North's sister chain Aldi South announced plans last month to invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. store base to 2,500 by 2022, raising the stakes for rivals caught in a price war. Bild am Sonntag said on Sunday that Aldi North planned to finance its multi-billion-euro investment from existing cash rather than by taking on debt. But the paper said the project still needed the approval of one of the three foundations that control the company, which has been the subject of a family feud. Aldi North was not immediately available for comment. German brothers Karl and Theodor Albrecht pioneered the discount store concept, setting up two sister businesses serving north and south Germany in 1962 and then expanding to much of Europe as well as the United States and Australia. Theodor had placed control of Aldi North in the hands of three foundations, all of which must approve any strategic decisions. Aldi North most recently said it had just over 4,800 stores in Europe, in addition to more than 460 more upmarket Trader Joe's stores it operates in the United States.

Chicago, which had won six in a row over the Rangers at home prior to Saturday, dropped to 3-6 on its homestand as it manged just four hits against two Texas pitchers. Jose Abreu's two-run homer was one of those four hits and he has gone deep in each of the first two games of the series, all after slugging his first 13 long balls of the season on the road. White Sox right fielder Avisail Garcia (knee) was out of the lineup for the third straight game but told reporters he hopes to play Sunday.

He gave up a run and two hits in six innings at Cleveland his last time out, striking out five in the no-decision. The 30-year-old, who is 8-3 with a 1.85 ERA in his career in July, has won all three of his games (two starts) against the White Sox in his career while allowing just three earned runs in 16 1/3 innings. Quintana fell to 2-8 with a 5.30 ERA after a rocky outing at Cleveland on June 11, but has rebounded to go 2-0 with a 0.90 mark over a three-start turnaround. His last two opponents - Minnesota and the New York Yankees - have failed to score while amassing seven hits in 13 innings against the Colombia native. Quintana blanked the Rangers over seven frames in their one meeting last year but may need to be careful with outfielder Shin-Soo Choo, who is 6-for-12 with five doubles against him. Walk-Offs 1.

Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL,  he wrote on Twitter.  What are they trying to hide?  More than 20 states, including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, have declined to provide some or all of the information, saying it was unnecessary and violated privacy.  This commission was formed to try to find basis for the lie that President Trump put forward that has no foundation,  Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told Reuters previously in an interview. The Republican president has made unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last November's election. Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, created in May, sent a letter to 50 states asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories.

Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson said in a statement on Friday that while certain voter information is available to the public, the media, and any other person who requests the information,  the information is restricted to name, address and congressional district assignment.  Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann had said in a statement that he did not see the letter but would rebuff the commission.  They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,  he said. Trump won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. He has claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for voter fraud. Civil rights activists say the commission will encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers to voting, such as requiring identity cards to vote.

In her weekly podcast, the German chancellor said this year's G20 summit will delve into issues championed by protesters such as distribution of wealth and consumption of resources - alongside related issues like climate change, free markets, consumer protection and upholding social standards. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched against the meeting in the rain in Hamburg on Sunday in a prelude to the July 7-8 gathering, where 21,000 police from across Germany will protect the meetings of the world's 20 largest economies.  It's not only going to be about (economic) growth but rather sustainable growth,  Merkel said.  We've got to have a 'win-win' situation for everyone. The issues obviously revolve around: how do we achieve inclusive or sustainable growth?  Merkel, seeking a fourth term in a Sept. 24 election, outlined the issues as:  What are we doing with our resources? What are the rules for distribution of wealth? How many people are taking part? And how many countries are able to profit from that?  Without mentioning the protests that have German security officials worried about possible acts of sabotage this week in the country's second-largest city, Merkel noted that these non-traditional issues were forced onto the G20 agenda.  If we simply try to carry on as we have in the past, the worldwide developments will definitely not be sustainable and inclusive,  she said.  We need the climate protection agreement, open markets and improved trade agreements in which consumer protection, social and environmental standards are upheld.  In a speech to parliament last week, Merkel promised to fight for free trade and press on with multilateral efforts to combat climate change at the summit, challenging the  America First  policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. The G20 meeting follows a G7 summit in Sicily a month ago that exposed deep divisions between other Western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. Trump later announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. German authorities are bracing for trouble in Hamburg, worried that the protests could turn violent as they did outside a G8 summit in Genoa, Italy in 2001 when one person was shot dead and hundreds injured. The German Federal Crime Office warned that violent G20 opponents could carry out arson and sabotage at infrastructure targets such as the Hamburg harbour and airport, newspaper Welt am Sonntag said on Sunday.  New and creative forms of attack have to be watched out for,  the report said. It added Hamburg police are bracing for attempts by activists to disrupt electrical power in Hamburg. Sunday's demonstration was organised by a group called  Protest Wave G20 , with 50,000 to 100,000 protesters expected on an afternoon march through the city centre. Other demonstrations this week are called  Welcome to Hell  and  G20 Not Welcome .

In an editorial article published in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kganyago said the recent recommendation by an anti-graft agency for the central bank to focus on growth misunderstood the dangers of persistently high consumer prices.  The past half-century is littered with examples of painful recessions caused by the need to reduce runaway inflation created by authorities trying to create growth by printing money,  Kganyago said. Credit downgrades by two of the top three ratings agencies, based on the economic and political turmoil, have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa, which has just suffered two quarters of economic contraction. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set-off a political row this month when she called for an overhaul of the bank's mandate - to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency - rattling investors and hitting the rand hard. The bank has since filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. On Friday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba echoed parliament's and the ruling party's denouncement of the recommendation, accusing the agency of overstepping the mark. The bank aims to keep price-growth below 6 percent, currently at 5.4 percent, and since early 2014 has lifted benchmark interest rates by 200 basis points in a bid to cool inflation and encourage long-term investment.

Aldi and its German discounter rival Lidl have become giants in European retail, upending Britain's grocery retail market, and are challenging U.S. retailers as well. Aldi North's sister chain Aldi South announced plans last month to invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. store base to 2,500 by 2022, raising the stakes for rivals caught in a price war. Bild am Sonntag said on Sunday that Aldi North planned to finance its multi-billion-euro investment from existing cash rather than by taking on debt. But the paper said the project still needed the approval of one of the three foundations that control the company, which has been the subject of a family feud. Aldi North was not immediately available for comment. German brothers Karl and Theodor Albrecht pioneered the discount store concept, setting up two sister businesses serving north and south Germany in 1962 and then expanding to much of Europe as well as the United States and Australia. Theodor had placed control of Aldi North in the hands of three foundations, all of which must approve any strategic decisions. Aldi North most recently said it had just over 4,800 stores in Europe, in addition to more than 460 more upmarket Trader Joe's stores it operates in the United States.

The transport ministry said it had set a tariff range for online car-hailing services of 3,500-6,000 rupiah ($0.26-$0.45) per kilometre for the islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra. For Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua, the range is 3,700-6,500 rupiah per kilometre. The regulation kicked in on July 1 and will be evaluated in the next six months, the ministry said in a statement.  There has to be a balance between conventional and online transport, so that has to be regulated,  Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, director-general of land transport at the ministry, told Reuters by phone. Indonesia's two biggest established taxi operators are PT Blue Bird Tbk and PT Express Transindo Utama Tbk , whose shares have fallen on investor concerns about competition from the cheaper ride-hailing services. Drivers of Blue Bird and Express have called for a ban on ride-hailing services, claiming they were subject to less stringent requirements than conventional taxis.

Militants killed Aydin Ahi, deputy head of the AKP in the Ozalp district of Van province on Saturday night, the governor's office said.

Several dozen soccer officials, including some from FIFA, were indicted in the United States in 2015 on corruption-related charges.

Blatter and ex-UEFA president Michel Platini were banned from all official soccer-related duties in 2015, initially for eight years, over a 2 million Swiss franc ($2 million) payment FIFA made to Platini in 2011, with Blatter’s approval, for work done a decade earlier. Blatter's ban was later reduced to six years. Blatter, meanwhile, said he was sure that Russia would play in the World Cup in 2018, despite doping allegations.  FIFA is still investigating claims that footballers were among the Russian athletes who were involved in or benefited from an elaborate state-sponsored doping scheme, it said last week.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia initially agreed late last year to reduce their total oil output by almost 1.8 million bpd in the first half of 2017 to boost the price of crude, a key source of revenue.     The deal was extended until the end of March 2018 as global oil stockpiles are still brimming.     Russia pledged to cut 300,000 bpd. This compares to output of more than 11.2 million bpd in October last year, taken as the baseline for the global deal.     In tonnes, oil output reached 44.801 million, versus 46.298 million in May.     Russian oil pipeline exports in June stood at 4.131 million bpd, down from 4.518 million bpd in May.      Almost all Russian oil majors cut or froze their output last month, except for the country's largest producer, Rosneft          , which increased production by 0.2 percent.      Production at Gazprom Neft           declined by 0.9 percent, and output at Slavneft fell by 2.2 percent.     For the first six months of the year, Russian oil output rose 1.4 percent, year-on-year, to an average of 11.02 million bpd.      In OPEC, oil output rose in June by 280,000 bpd to a 2017 high, a Reuters survey found, as a further recovery in supply from the two member countries exempt from the production-cutting deal offset strong compliance by their peers.                  High compliance by Gulf producers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait helped keep OPEC's adherence with its supply curbs at a historically high 92 percent in June, compared with 95 percent in May, the survey found.      The recovery adds to the challenge the OPEC-led effort to support the market is facing from a persistent inventory glut. If the recovery lasts, calls could grow within OPEC for the exempt countries to be brought into the production deal.

The bout ended with the fighters in a clinch on the ropes and although Pacquiao gave a little shuffle and a grin to show he had plenty left in the tank, his fate was in the hands of the judges.  Slideshow (10 Images) Very tough. I didn't expect that tough,  said Pacquiao, whose record now reads 59-7-2.  It's okay, it's part of the game. That's the decision of the judges, I respect that.  Pacquiao, who had hoped for an impressive victory to fire talk of another fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr, said he would  absolutely  return for the contracted rematch against Horn.  An emotional Horn brandished a walking stick as he also called out the undefeated Mayweather, who has come out of retirement at 40 years of age for a 12-round crossover boxing match against mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor.  This is no joke, which one does he want? The walking stick or the gloves?  the Queenslander said. The loss stunned people in the Philippines, where Pacquiao, now a high-profile senator, has long been a national hero. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s spokesman, Ernesto Abella, said the loss  would not diminish the honors he bestowed to the people and to the flag .  Nothing will change: Senator Manny Pacquiao will remain our People’s Champ,  Abella said.

Some of the tens of thousands of cubic meters were diverted to another pool, but much of the wastewater made its way to a river bed that snakes through the desert, causing  severe ecological damage , the ministry said.

The company cannot estimate the full impact of the incident at the Rotem factory, including the environmental and financial impact, and whether it will lead to legal proceedings,  it said in a statement. The ministry said it ordered ICL to stop using a series of evaporation pools at the factory and it was considering opening a criminal investigation into the incident. ICL, controlled by holding company Israel Corp, produces about a third of the world's bromine and is the sixth-largest potash producer. The Rotem factory manufactures phosphate-based products, leading to downstream derivatives such as phosphoric acids, fertilisers, specialty chemicals and phosphate salts.

The Soviet-built Liaoning, whose home port is in northern China, entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Saturday and was sailing just west of the middle of the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement. Taiwan military jets and ships were deployed in response to monitor the fleet's passage, the ministry said. Nothing abnormal had been detected as the Chinese battle group headed southwest and was expected to leave Taiwan's ADIZ by Sunday evening, the ministry said.

Alberto Zerain Berasategi from Spain and Mariano Galvan from Argentina were last heard from on 23 June while at the 6,100 meter base of Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth-highest mountain, said Karrar Haidri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan.   The spot they were believed to be in has been struck by a large avalanche and the helicopter rescue officials have said (survival) appears unlikely,  Haidari said.  Haidari confirmed that search and rescue operations were called off on Saturday.  Both men were experienced climbers with Zerain being part of an elite club to have scaled the world's two tallest mountains, Everest and K2.  Galvan climbed Everest in 2012 but an attempt to climb K2 alone and without supplemental oxygen ended at 7,300 meters. Muhammmad Iqbal, owner of Summit Karakorum, the tour company that arranged the climbing expedition, said the last helicopter search found no trace of the men, adding that another climbing team started its ascent of 8,126 meter Nanga Parbat on Sunday.  Pakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) and is home to the world's second-tallest mountain, K2, as well as three others which are among the world's 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters. Nanga Parbat was the scene of an attack in 2013, when gunmen dressed as police officers shot 10 foreign mountaineers and a local guide at the 4,200-metre base camp. The killings were claimed by both the Pakistani Taliban and a smaller group of Islamist militants. Since that attack, the number of expeditions has dwindled, wrecking communities dependent on climbing tourism for income and depriving Pakistan's economy of much-needed dollars.

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at the weekend that the demands were made to be rejected. He insisted Qatar would not close a Turkish military base or shut Doha-based satellite channel Al Jazeera. The four Arab states have warned they may impose further sanctions if Qatar does not comply; they did not give details, but bankers believe, for example, that Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits from Qatar. Doha's stock index was down 2.0 percent after 45 minutes of trade as all 18 companies with a value above $1 billion dropped. Constituents of the MSCI emerging market index were some of the worst performers, with Vodafone Qatar down 4.1 percent.

It had risen sharply between June 20 and 22 on news that international index compiler MSCI had placed Riyadh on a watch list for upgrade to emerging market status and that the architect of Saudi economic reforms, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was named crown prince. Some of the recent top performers fell because of profit- taking on Sunday, with property developer Emaar the Economic City dropping 2.4 percent.

But reports of problems at voting booths and allegations of ballot fraud have soured the mood among some in a country which has a history of electoral violence and corruption. “There has clearly been problems ... but to be fair, in our observation, the government has endeavored to address these,” Sir Anand Satyanand, chairman of the Commonwealth observer group, told Reuters by phone.

The rupee retreated from recent highs tracking emerging market currencies as hawkish comments by global central bankers triggered a risk-off sentiment. GST-related uncertainties, a dovish Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy stance and overvalued equities markets would lead to further weakness in the rupee towards 65 per dollar as overseas capital flows out. Crude oil prices were up about 5 percent after data showed a drop in U.S. oil production, which reversed the bearish sentiment. Crude prices had hit a 10-month low the previous week. Worries of oversupply have led to a 16 percent drop in prices of Brent crude this year despite OPEC members and major producers promising to curb production.

One of our biggest struggles is left-handed curveballs,  San Diego manager Andy Green said.  And he's got one of the best left-handed curveballs in the game.  Game, set and match. And if Hill shutting them out for seven innings wasn't embarrassing enough for the Padres, San Diego's pitching staff was again ravaged by Dodgers hitters in an 8-0 victory at Petco Park that extended Los Angeles' domination of the Padres this season. The Dodgers are 7-1 against their National League West Division rivals this season and have outscored San Diego 63-18 -- a big chunk of their major league-leading run differential of plus-155. Chris Taylor hit Los Angeles' second grand slam in as many games after Austin Barnes connected Friday night, and Corey Seager and Justin Turner connected on back-to-back homers in the fourth Saturday. Hill (5-4) gave up four hits and a walk with a career high-equaling 11 strikeouts and drove in the Dodgers' first run in the first two-hit game of his career. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at PadresLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchEverywhere you looked, a Dodger was having a big night. Former Padre Logan Forsythe had four hits for the second straight night and reached base nine straight times before San Diego left-handed reliever Ryan Buchter struck him out in the eighth. Seager had three hits, including his 13th home run, in his second start since tweaking his hamstring June 23. Hill and Taylor each had two of Los Angeles' 14 hits. For Taylor, the slam was his league-leading third of the season.  I don't think I do anything different with the bases loaded,  Taylor said.  I try not to do too much and put the ball in play. I've run into a couple. Coincidence? I don't know.   There are a lot of guys in here with really good swings,  said Turner of the Dodgers offense.  We take good at-bats and we swing at good pitches. Usually, the chances of doing some damage are pretty good.  Then he turned to Hill's two hits.  His at-bats are sheer entertainment,  Turner said of Hill.  You can't take your eyes off him. Guys in the dugout are laughing. He looks like a big Little Leaguer up there having fun.  Left-hander Dillon Overton suffered the loss in his first start with San Diego. Overton gave up four runs on nine hits and two walks in 4 2/3 innings.  It wasn't the outcome we were expecting,  said Overton, who was signed off waivers from Seattle on June 19 by the starter-strapped Padres.  I just wanted to give us a chance to win. But change is good. I'm excited to be here.  The Dodgers scored their first two runs off Overton on infield hits. Taylor drew a walk to open the game, advanced to second on a Seager single and, after two outs, reached third when Overton hit Barnes, who Friday night drove in seven runs with a pair of homers, including his first grand slam. Forsythe then chopped a dribbler up the third base line and reached first ahead of third baseman Chase d'Arnaud's throw with Taylor scoring. Barnes led off the Dodgers fourth with a walk, but ran through a stop sign and was thrown out at the plate -- on a perfect relay from left fielder Jose Pirela to shortstop Erick Aybar to catcher Austin Hedges -- trying to score from first on Forsythe's double down the line. Forsythe moved to third on an infield out and scored on Hill's first hit of the season, a grounder that Aybar couldn't cleanly field behind second. Seager and Turner then opened the fifth with the sixth set of back-to-back homers by the Dodgers this season. Seager hit a 438-foot drive to right and Turner pulled a 356-foot drive to left. Overton's night ended after Forsythe's two-out double in the fifth. Taylor hit his third grand slam of the season in the seventh to double the run count. The lone bright spot for the Padres was center fielder Manuel Margot, who had two hits and drew a walk off Hill and stole two bases. NOTES: Dodgers manager Dave Roberts missed Saturday night's game, serving a one-game suspension for his role in Friday night's dust-up with Padres' manager Andy Green. Green and Dodgers' pitcher Alex Wood, who triggered the events by threatening Jose Pirela, were also fined. Bench coach Bob Geren was the Dodgers interim manager in Roberts' absence. ... The Padres optioned RHP Jose Valdez to Triple-A El Paso to make room for Saturday night's starter LHP Dillon Overton on the 25-man roster. ... The Dodgers had a major league-leading 53 homers in June, which is also the highest total for any month in franchise history. The Dodgers were 21-7 in June, tying the franchise record for wins in the month and setting the record for the highest June winning percentage (.750) in franchise history. ... The Dodgers on Saturday recalled RHP Josh Fields from Triple-A Oklahoma City and optioned INF Mike Freeman to Oklahoma City. ...

Olmert was found guilty in 2014 of accepting bribes from real estate developers when he was Jerusalem's mayor, before his 2006-09 term as prime minister and head of a centrist political party. On Sunday, a parole board decided to cut short his 27-month term, a common practice in Israel for prisoners who have not committed violent crimes. Olmert, accompanied by a government bodyguard, made no comment to reporters as he left. The corruption allegations led to Olmert's resignation as prime minister in September 2008. He stayed in office in a caretaker capacity until a February 2009 election brought right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu to power. During his time as Israel's leader, he claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians on securing a peace deal, offering an Israeli withdrawal from much of the occupied West Bank. But no agreement was reached.

Olmert's term was ultimately lengthened to 27 months after he was convicted in a separate case involving cash payments from a U.S. businessman. Leaving prison for his home in Tel Aviv dressed in a black tee shirt and black trousers, Olmert looked gaunt, 12 days after being treated in hospital for what Israeli media reported were chest pains. He was returned to prison several days before the parole hearing. Any attempt at a political comeback seems unlikely. A court found that his crimes entailed  moral turpitude , which under Israeli law would preclude Olmert from running for public office for seven years after his release, when he will be 78.

Greinke was dominating for much of his seven-inning outing, allowing three hits, and the Arizona Diamondbacks turned all three of their triples into runs while beating the Colorado Rockies 6-2 on Saturday night.  He was impressive wasn't he?  Arizona reliever Archie Bradley said of Greinke.  Sometimes it looks like he's a man among boys out there.  All but one of the Diamondbacks' eight hits went for extra bases, with David Peralta contributing two doubles and driving in two runs. Arizona also took advantage of a pair of costly Rockies errors while opening up a 6-2 lead with a three-run seventh, and Colorado went on to lose its ninth in 10 games. Before the game, Arizona manager Torey Luvollo said Greinke was his ace, and he expected him to pitch like one as his team tried to end its three-game losing streak. No doubt this is what Lovullo was expecting. Greinke (10-4), improving to 8-0 in 10 starts at Chase Field this season, limited the Rockies to a lone infield single -- by Mike Tauchman in the third -- until Nolan Arenado singled and scored on Trevor Story's two-run homer, his 11th, into the left-field seats in the seventh. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DiamondbacksColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch I felt they had to work for their two runs. But just because I'm making good pitches doesn't mean it's going to be a shutout,  Grienke said.  I think they did a good job of getting their two runs.  Greinke was dominating until the seventh, repeatedly throwing first-pitch strikes while retiring all but one of the first 20 Colorado batters. He struck out eight and walked none, and he joked afterward he should have walked Story in the seventh. He also had Arizona's only single of the game, in the fifth.  That was as good as I've seen him (until the 7th) ... he was dealing, had his fastball location, a tight slider, the curveball, that split change -- all four pitches were working for sure,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  He was on tonight. There wasn't much hard impact.  As soon as Colorado's offense got it back into the game, its defense took it out of it. Story, the shortstop, then mishandled Rey Fuentes' grounder for an error in the bottom of the inning, and Jeff Mathis tripled to left. Pinch hitter Ketel Marte then lifted a sacrifice fly that left fielder Tauchman dropped for a two-base error, and Peralta followed a batter later with his second double in as many at-bats off starter Tyler Chatwood (6-9). Story, who hadn't homered since June 18, is one of the few Rockies with much success against Greinke, going 8-of-21 against him with four homers and nine RBIs.  He can hit it, that's for sure,  Greinke said.  It was a good job of hitting.  Chatwood fell behind quickly in the first but went on to pitch 6 1/3 innings, allowing six runs, four earned, and seven hits.  I don't think my line reflected how I pitched, but that happens sometimes,  Chatwood said.  I don't think I threw the ball that bad. There was a lot of soft contact. (But) he (Greinke) is one of the best in the game, so you've got to keep runs to a minimum.  Bradley, Andrew Chafin and Fernando Rodney finished up for Arizona, with Rodney getting the final two outs with two men on base for his 21st save. The Diamondbacks, who lost their last three after winning 13 of 15, needed only three pitches to jump into a 1-0 lead in the first against Chatwood. Daniel Descalso tripled down the right-field line and scored when Peralta grounded out to third. That made the Diamondbacks 2-for-28 with runners in scoring position over a four-game span, but that number would soon improve. Paul Goldschmidt gave the Diamondbacks their second leadoff triple in a span of four innings in the fourth, only his fifth hit in 28 at-bats during the Arizona homestand that ends Sunday. Goldschmidt held at third as Jake Lamb grounded out to first, but Chad Owings -- who homered twice during a 6-3 Colorado victoryFriday night -- followed one batter later with a line-drive double to right. After Owings moved up on Brandon Drury's grounder, he scored when Chatwood's curve ball to Fuentes bounced off home plate and deflected past catcher Tony Wolters for a wild pitch. The Diamondbacks had a chance to increase their lead in the fifth, but Goldschmidt bounced out to first with runners on second and third following Peralta's two-out double. While Chatwood was laboring, Greinke was cruising, throwing a first-pitch strike to 12 of the first 13 batters he faced. NOTES: Rockies 2B DJ LeMahieu (strained right groin) remained out of the lineup. ... Arizona OF A.J. Pollock (quad, groin) hit two homers Friday while rehabilitating at Triple-A Reno, but the Diamondbacks will wait at least another day before bringing him back. ...

Trading will initially be  Northbound , so mainland investors will be not yet be able to buy and sell Hong Kong-listed debt. The announcement coincides with the 20th anniversary of the resumption of Chinese rule in Hong Kong, and marks China's latest measure to open up its capital markets. The Bond Connect follows similar stock-trading programmes between the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and their Hong Kong counterpart. Standard Chartered's John Tan, head of financial markets for Greater China and north Asia, said China's $9 trillion bond market is the world's third-largest yet is relatively undersold to foreign investors.  The launch of the Bond Connect marks the strong commitment of the Chinese government to further open up its markets,  Tan said in emailed comments.  We are positive that the scheme will be well-received by the market and report good momentum when it is launched.  The Bond Connect means more global debt indices will include Chinese bonds in the foreseeable future, Tan said. To mark the launch of Bond Connect, the China Development Bank said it planned to issue up to 20 billion yuan ($2.95 billion) worth of one-year, three-year and 10-year fixed-rate bonds for tender beginning on Monday. High Growth Potential In a joint statement on Sunday, the People's Bank of China and Hong Kong Monetary Authority said they have agreed the principles of cross-boundary supervisory cooperation.  For Northbound trading, the relevant regulations, policies and operational and supervisory arrangements have been finalised, technical systems are ready, and market promotion as well as on-boarding are both under way,  they said. Xie Xiaoli, head of international business at Ping An Asset Management, said the Bond Connect increases the convenience of investing in China's bond market, and it will be a gradual process for foreign capital to flow into China's bond market.  At the moment, the size of foreign investors' investment in domestic bond market is about 830 billion yuan, accounting for less than 2 percent of market share,  Xie said. The low proportion indicates high growth potential, she said.  Our initial estimation of the capital increase is about $250 billion once the China bond market is incorporated into global bond indices,  Xie said. Access to China's bond market through the programme will be restricted to overseas institutional investors such as banks, insurers, brokerages and investment funds. Trades will not be subject to quotas.

The veteran right-hander praised center fielder Cameron Maybin for a fistful of fine defensive plays, third baseman Yunel Escobar for grabbing two line drives and catcher Martin Maldonado for calling an exquisite game. But his own effort was extra special. He pitched a complete-game, three-hit shutout against the Seattle Mariners in the Angels' 4-0 victory. He walked one, struck out seven, faced three batters over the minimum and let just one runner reach second base. It was his second consecutive gem, coming less than a week after he threw 6 1/3 shutout innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers and snapped their streak of 17 straight games with a homer. These two gems come on the heels of a tough run that saw Nolasco lose seven straight decisions. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at AngelsSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch I've felt pretty good for a while,  Nolasco (4-9) said when asked about the difference.  I tried to pitch with two strikes from the start and take advantage of their aggressiveness.  Any time you see the ninth inning, it's huge. But in any complete game, you need luck. There were a lot of good plays behind me.  Especially from Maybin. He threw Nelson Cruz out trying to turn a single into a double in the second inning. He bounced off the center-field wall to snatch a line drive by Mitch Haniger in the third, and two batters later made a sliding catch of a sinking line drive by Carlos Ruiz. Nolasco got better as the game went on. Five of the strikeouts came in the last four innings and he induced nine ground-ball outs, a nice number for someone who is a fly-ball pitcher and has been hurt by home runs this season.  It was a terrific effort,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  Lot of ground balls, got ahead of a lot of hitters. They hit the ball hard a few times, but his command got better as the game went on.  I didn't think it was a risk (letting him go nine). His pitch count wasn't excessive. There were no red flags.   We hit a lot of balls hard, some right at a guy and sometimes they chased them down,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  We were a little impatient later in the game.  Shortstop Andrelton Simmons hit his ninth home run of the season in the second inning and Maybin singled in a run in the third to give Nolasco a 2-0 lead. Mariners starter Sam Gaviglio (5-4) allowed five hits and a walk in 6 1/3 innings. He retired 10 straight at one point. The Angels added two runs in the seventh. Escobar singled and Luis Valbuena doubled. Seattle reliever Marc Rzepczynski walked Maldonado intentionally to load the bases, then threw a wild pitch to score Escobar. Ben Revere grounded out to score Valbuena and make it 4-0. It was Nolasco's 12th career complete game and his sixth shutout.  It was a good day for the bullpen,  he said with a grin. To put the complete game in perspective, there have been just 33 in 2017, with half of the season already gone.

Twins right-hander Felix Jorge, who was making his major league debut after going 8-1 with a 3.26 ERA with Double-A Chattanooga, gave up three runs, seven hits and a walk in five innings plus one batter. He acknowledged he was nervous. Related CoverageMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch I just concentrate on just me and the catcher,  Jorge said.  I didn't try to look around. There were a lot of people. I just tried to concentrate on looking at the catcher and throwing what he wanted and just me and him.  The Royals tightened it with a three-run sixth that included a two-run Jorge Soler homer off Buddy Boshers. Escobar's two-out double scored Moss with the final run of the inning. A Whit Merrifield error, a walk and two hits gifted the Twins with three runs in the ninth. Sano, who homered in the first game, blasted a three-run homer in a four-run fifth inning. Sano has 23 RBIs in 10 games against Kansas City.  I hadn't realized that,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  I saw a note about his production against this team. A lot of those games were early when he got off to such a good start, but, you know, a big day today as far as the production.  I think he's getting smarter about how to get back on track, you know, going through a stretch. It looks like he tries to slow down, tries to swing at strikes a little better, and when he does he's getting better results.  Rosario led off the fifth with a single and scored on Castro's double to right. Mauer walked on four Hammel pitches. That prompted a mound visit from pitching coach Dave Eiland, who probably did not tell Hammel,  let's throw your next pitch right down the middle and see how far Sano can hit it.  Sano demolished Hammel's first pitch fastball far over the left-center field fence, an estimated 450 feet, with Mauer and Castro along for the ride to give the Twins a 4-1 advantage.  I was trying to go down and away with a heater there and basically just left it out in the middle,  Hammel said.  I was committed to him swinging there. You get a swing early there you can get a double play ball. But it wasn't meant to be.  Sano said he does not get too many first-pitch fastballs.  But I saw that one and I thought I made good contact,  Sano said. In a battle of the Jorges in the first inning, Bonifacio doubled against Felix Jorge. Bonifacio soon scored on Eric Hosmer's two-out, opposite field home run, his 11th homer of the season. Hosmer parked a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats, an estimated 388 feet. Robbie Grossman led off the game with a double against Hammel, but that was as far as he went. Hammel retired Mauer on a fly ball to left and struck out Sano and Max Kepler to strand Grossman. Kepler doubled with one out in the fourth, but Hammel retired the next two hitters. Hammel, however, could not prevent the damage in the fifth.  I thought he threw the ball great the first four innings,  Royals manager Ned Yost said. NOTES: The Royals placed LHP Matt Strahm on the disabled list before the second game. He left in the opener with left knee inflammation. They recalled RHP Miguel Almonte from Triple-A Omaha. Almonte pitched a scoreless eighth inning in Game 2. ... The Twins summoned RHP Ryan Pressly from Triple-A Rochester. They optioned rookie RHP Alan Busenitz to their International League farm club. ... Red Sox manager John Farrell, Luke's dad, made it to Kansas City for his debut. ... Royals LHP Travis Wood and Twins LHP Hector Santiago are the Sunday probables. ... LF Alex Gordon's 24 career home runs against the Twins is the most by a Royal.

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at the weekend that the demands were made to be rejected; he insisted Qatar would not close down a Turkish military base or shut Doha-based satellite channel Al Jazeera. The four Arab states have warned they may impose further sanctions if Qatar does not comply; they did not give details, but bankers believe, for example, that Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain banks may receive official guidance to pull deposits from Qatar. However, equities selling pressure in Qatar may only be moderate. On June 22, the last day on which the market traded before closing for a week-long Eid al-Fitr holiday, foreign funds were net buyers of Qatari shares for the first time since the crisis erupted on June 5. This suggested some funds are willing to bear the heightened geopolitical risk because some companies offer attractive dividend yields, while the market's plunge last month improved valuations. Gulf Cooperation Council investors remained net sellers of Qatari stocks on June 22, as they have been consistently, but their pace of selling has been slowing. Meanwhile Brent oil has risen to $48.77 a barrel, gaining for seven straight sessions. On June 22, when the Saudi index last traded before its week-long Eid break, oil was near $45 a barrel. This could buoy the Saudi market on Sunday. Sentiment towards Riyadh has also been optimistic because index compiler MSCI placed it on a watch list on June 20 for possible upgrade to emerging market status, and since the architect of Saudi economic reforms, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was named crown prince at about the same time. The index closed at an October 2015 high on June 22 and is up 3 percent since the start of the year.

Wow, these guys,  Stenhouse said.  I kept my Talladega car and told them to build a new one. They built a Fifth Third Ford that was really fast. We won the Firecracker 400! This is awesome!  I have been coming here since 2008. I actually came in 2006 one time with Bobby Hamilton Jr. and it is cool to put it in victory lane and get our second win this year. I love it! Thank you to the fans for coming out here. Everyone at NASCAR. What a great weekend. America. 1776. We are the champs!  Stenhouse took his final lead on an overtime restart, getting a push from Michael McDowell. Clint Bowyer, though, got up to second on the final lap to take runner-up honors. Paul Menard finished third, while McDowell held on to finish a career-best fourth. Ryan Newman rounded out the top five.  Wow, what a night,  Bowyer said.  A fun race. Our Mobil 1 Ford was strong. I got shuffled out on that second stage and that bummed me out. I wanted those stage points. It wasn't that big a deal because I knew that we had a hot rod to get back up front.  Man, it's just every man for himself. You're beating and banging Both sides are ground off my car. Good night. This bridesmaid deal (stinks). I want to win. We're in this business to win. That's what Tony and Gene pay me to do. I'm proud of everyone on the Mobil 1 Ford team.  The race was attrition-filled, with the yellow flag waving 14 times, a record for the July race at Daytona. Early-race cautions came mostly as results of blown engines or stages ending, but later cautions came for wrecks, including the 13th caution of the race with less than 10 laps remaining. That wreck resulted in a red flag with six laps remaining after Kyle Larson's car got airborne and Danica Patrick's caught fire.  I was just up front there and doing what I could to stay up front,  Larson said. The 38 (David Ragan) got to my inside and I saw that in my mirror and I kind of felt it a little bit because you can feel the air.  I was just trying to leave him a little bit of room and I just moved up too high and ran across Ricky's nose and I hate that I caused that wreck and I feel pretty bad about. It was going to be an extremely good points day and we hurt that a little bit.  The yellow flag waved for the final time after a restart with three laps remaining in the scheduled distance when Denny Hamlin and Erik Jones spun and sent the race into overtime. More than a quarter of the 40 cars that started the race failed to finish and more than half were involved in at least some degree in an on-track incident. Drivers retiring from the race early included pole sitter Dale Earnhardt Jr. After going two laps down early because of a tire problem, Earnhardt eventually got back on the lead lap and raced back into the top -10 before being a part of a five-car wreck that brought out the ninth caution of the race around lap 106.  As soon as we got our lap back, I knew anything was possible,  Earnhardt said.  We were just kind of drafting right back up there and I think the No, 4 (Harvick) got a flat. I had nowhere to go, but it was fun. We had a pretty strong car. We had some gremlins in there. I'm not sure what was going on with that, but we had the toe-in messed up. That first deal we brushed the wall a couple of laps earlier and I thought everything was OK.  I came through the tri-oval and I had a right front going down and it was trying to spin out, so I was trying to lift, but there was really nothing I could do because there were so many guys behind me. We got into (turn) one and hit the wall. But the guys worked on the car; we got our laps back and was about to have some more fun -- get back up in there and mix it up. Then, that happened with the No. 4.  With the high number cautions that littered the race, pit strategies varied throughout the race. Regulars up front throughout the second half of the race were Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth and series rookie Daniel Suarez, but Kenseth was out of the race after involvement in the wreck that brought the 13th caution. Brad Keselowski, who led 32 laps in dominating the first 40-lap stage of the race, was also among those who retired early. He fell out of the race after spinning and hitting the wall on lap 116. Matt Kenseth was the leader at lap 80, the halfway mark and the end of stage two of the 160-lap race. Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin was second at the end of stage two. After pitting under green on lap 16 because his right-rear wheel was secured by only on lug nut after a previous yellow-flag caution, Hamlin and Jones pitted under green on lap 37 and cycled to the top-two positions when everyone else pitted under yellow after stage one. Hamlin and Jones led laps early in the second stage, and Hamlin was up front for another restart past lap 60. He was joined up front by Kenseth, who had taken the lead by the time a caution came out on lap 70 for a multi-car crash that started with another JGR driver, Kyle Busch, getting turned. Other drivers collected in the wreck included points leaders Kyle Larson and Martin Truex Jr. Earnhardt lost the lead to Chase Elliott on the first lap, and then Keselowski moved into the lead early. Earnhardt was back up front late in the stage, battling Keselowski for the lead. A few laps into the second stage, Earnhardt got into the wall with a flat tire, sustaining significant damage to his car. Larson's car also received damage in the melee, but the race remained green. Blown engines were a theme in the opening stage. The yellow flag waved twice in the first 40 laps, both times for engine issues. Cole Whitt's blown engine resulted in the first caution on lap 10. The yellow waved again on lap 16 for D.J. Kennington's blown engine. Another caution came before lap 60 for Jeffrey Earnhardt's blown engine. Ryan Sieg also blew an engine early, but the race remained green. NOTES: Dale Earnhardt Jr. was fastest in final practice Thursday and in the first round of qualifying before winning the pole Friday. The Earnhardt-Chase Elliott one-two start was a reverse of the Daytona 500 front row, with Elliott on the pole and Earnhardt starting second. ... Brad Keselowski won last year's Coke Zero 400.

First baseman Yuli Gurriel produced a two-run, two-out, two-strike double in the eighth inning to cap a white-knuckle four-run rally and give the Houston Astros a 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday night at Minute Maid Park. Gurriel, whose two-run homer provided Houston (55-27) a short-lived 2-0 lead in the fifth inning, rifled a fastball down the third-base line and into the left-field corner off fellow Cuban countryman Aroldis Chapman, scoring pinch-runner Josh Reddick from third base and Marwin Gonzalez from first to cap the comeback. Chapman entered seeking a four-out save after Yankees right-hander Dellin Betances (3-3) walked three batters and allowed a solo home run to Astros catcher Evan Gattis that cut the Yankees' three-run lead to 6-5 with two outs.  He's one of the best closers in the game right now,  Gurriel said of Chapman.  So, for me to get in that at-bat and get a big hit, it was really important. We're really good friends. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at A'sNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch I was thinking about a fastball because he's the hardest thrower in the big leagues. I knew he was going to throw the fastball, so I was aware of that.  The Yankees (43-36) erased the 2-0 deficit courtesy of Gurriel with a five-run sixth inning for a second consecutive night. Two runs were charged to Astros starter Francis Martes. The big blow came when Didi Gregorius cranked his first career grand slam off Astros right-hander Will Harris to complete the uprising. But the Astros began to chip away against Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery via a Carlos Correa home run, his 17th, in the bottom of the sixth. In the eighth, Jose Altuve, Carlos Beltran and Gonzalez walked while Altuve and Reddick combined for three steals against Betances, who grew increasingly rattled.  We wanted to create some havoc and pressure on them late in the game and we did,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. Diaz (1-0), who was erroneously recalled on Saturday only to return to the ballpark after right-hander David Paulino was suspended 80 games for a performance-enhancing drugs violation, earned the win with a scoreless eighth. Gurriel was 3-for-4 with four RBIs. Astros closer Ken Giles notched his 19th save when Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner was erased trying to scurry back to first base after initially attempting to stretch his two-out single to left into a double. Reddick cut off the ball and made a high throw to Correa, whose leaping grab didn't prevent him from making an accurate toss to Gurriel, who tagged Gardner.  He made a wide turn; he thought he had a chance at second,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  The guy made a good throw. It looked like he would have been out and he didn't get back in time.  The homers to Gurriel, his ninth, and Correa, accounted for all of the scoring against Montgomery, who allowed three runs on five hits over 5 1/3 innings. Martes was sharp and effective through his first five innings. But in the sixth, the Yankees initiated their rally against him and continued it against Harris, and stood poised to make the most of a sparkling debut from right fielder and touted prospect Clint Frazier, who finished 2-for-4 with a homer and two runs.  I would say very eventful,  Frazier said.  It is probably the best taste of baseball I have ever had. It's disappointing to lose, but we have tomorrow. I am glad to be a part of this game.  NOTES: Astros RHP David Paulino was suspended 80 games without pay for violating Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Paulino (2-0, 6.52 ERA in six starts) tested positive for Boldenone, a performance-enhancing substance, and is suspended effective immediately. Houston recalled RHP Dayan Diaz from Triple-A Fresno. Diaz was initially ineligible for recall because he did not spend the requisite 10 days in the minors after he was optioned on June 22. Diaz had been erroneously recalled when the Astros optioned LHP Reymin Guduan to Fresno Friday night. ... The Yankees selected OF Clint Frazier from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and optioned INF Miguel Andujar to the RaidRiders. New York also transferred OF Dustin Fowler to the 60-day disabled list. The Yankees' No. 2 prospect, Frazier batted ninth and played right field while making his major league debut. ... Astros third base coach Gary Pettis will have right knee surgery next week and will be sidelined through the All-Star Game break. Triple-A Fresno manager Tony DeFrancesco will replace Pettis during the Astros' upcoming road trip through Atlanta and Toronto.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED72G0XU5P"},
