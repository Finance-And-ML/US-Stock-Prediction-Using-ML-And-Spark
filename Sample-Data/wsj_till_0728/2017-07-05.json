No-fly zones have long faced opposition from U.S. military officials, who see them as risky and expensive and could potentially drag U.S. forces further into the conflict.But Mr. Tillerson cited progress in efforts between the U.S. and Russia on avoiding accidents between their militaries in Syria as evidence that they could collaborate further. Russia backs the regime of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.\u201cThis cooperation over deconfliction zones process is evidence that our two nations are capable of further progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on the ground cease-fire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance.\u201dThere are multiple \u201cdeconfliction zones\u201d in Syria where U.S. and Russian militaries have been working to avoid mishaps, including one around a base near the Syrian town of Al Tanf close to the Iraqi border. U.S. forces and their allies are operating near the zone.The U.S. has warned Mr. Assad and his forces to steer clear of the area and has alerted the Russian government that it seeks to avoid mishaps but will take defensive action as needed, and American forces have taken several actions against allies of the Syrian government.The U.S. and Russia have been meeting secretly over the past several months to set up a \u201cde-escalation zone\u201d in southwest Syria, where Moscow and Washington would agree to keep their proxies away from each other. If that effort is successful, officials said that the U.S. would look to set up other such zones around Syria to try to wind down the conflict.A no-fly zone would involve a commitment both to refrain from flights in a given area and to shoot down planes that enter secure areas. Officials have said no-fly zones would require increased military resources from the U.S.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s olive branch to Russia on Syria comes amid a recent rise in battlefield confrontations between the Syrian regime and American forces battling Islamic State in Syria, which threaten to widen into a direct clash with the regime.In recent weeks U.S. forces have shot down a Syrian regime warplane as well as two Iranian-made drones viewed as threatening to American forces and Syrian fighters they are working with. The U.S. also has carried out airstrikes on Syrian government forces and their Iranian-backed allies in southern Syria.Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. is committed to fighting Islamic State in Syria but also wants to see stability in Syria once areas are liberated from the hold of the terrorist group.\u201cWhile there are no perfect options for guaranteeing stability, we must explore all possibilities for holding the line against the resurgence of ISIS or other terrorist groups,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cThe United States believes Russia, as a guarantor of the Assad regime and an early entrant into the Syrian conflict, has a responsibility to ensure that the needs of the Syrian people are met and that no faction in Syria illegitimately retakes or occupies areas liberated from ISIS\u2019 or other terrorist groups\u2019 control.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s scheduled meeting Friday with Mr. Putin has drawn international interest, given U.S. findings of Russian interference in the 2016 election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf and the president\u2019s longstanding reluctance to criticize Russia or Mr. Putin.Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday before leaving to join Mr. Trump in Germany, Mr. Tillerson said the Trump administration hoped the meeting would be the start of broader cooperation between Moscow and Washington.\u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning...at this point it\u2019s difficult to say exactly what Russia\u2019s intentions are in this relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important part of this meeting, is to have a good exchange between President Trump and President Putin over what they both see as the nature of this relationship between our two countries.\u201d\u2014Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Tillerson Optimistic On Russia Talks Over Syria War.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 23:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tillerson-says-u-s-is-ready-to-talk-to-russia-about-no-fly-zones-in-syria-1499311723", "news_title": "Tillerson Says U.S. Is Ready to Talk to Russia About No-Fly Zones in Syria ", "keywords": "g-20,meeting,no-fly zones,putin,russia,syria crisis,tillerson,trump,Rex Tillerson,Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "The first name of Jameson Taillon, a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was incorrectly given as James in a Sports article Wednesday about pitching velocity.In some editions Wednesday, the name of Ganeden Inc., which sells probiotics, was misspelled as Ganaden in one reference in a Life & Arts article about foods that contain probiotics.

His son Federico told local media the politician was in stable condition. Photographs showed a seemingly unconscious Mr. De Grazia covered in blood on the lawn on the National Assembly.Another congressman, Jos\u00e9 Guerra, posted photos on social media of what appeared to be a bullet hole in a window of the building. \u201cFortunately, no one was hit,\u201d he said in the post.Scuffles inside the legislature aren\u2019t uncommon in Venezuela, which has bounced from one political crisis to another in recent years. But violence has increased with almost daily street demonstrations calling for Mr. Maduro\u2019s ouster. In the past three months, at least 91 people have been killed amid fears the nation could descend into civil war.Mr. Maduro has stepped up heated rhetoric in recent weeks, implying his government would cling to power by any means necessary. \u201cWe would never give up, and what couldn\u2019t be done with votes, we would do with weapons,\u201d he said at a rally last week.Mr. Maduro\u2019s ruling Socialist Party lost control of congress in late 2015 amid a crippling economic crisis. Since then, the president has sought to neutralize the assembly by stripping it of basic powers.His recent attempts to seize these powers and give them to his allies in the Supreme Court have drawn rare voices of dissent from people in his party, most notably Attorney General Luisa Ortega.Ms. Ortega and the political opposition are now fighting hard to stop a July 30 vote called by Mr. Maduro to elect a new assembly that would be tasked with rewriting Venezuela\u2019s constitution. The effort has drawn the condemnation of international human-rights groups as well as the U.S. and the European Union, all of whom say it is the latest example of the president\u2019s embrace of authoritarian rule.\u201cThis is a coup,\u201d Ms. Ortega said Tuesday of the bid to rewrite the constitution.Mr. Maduro\u2019s allies have sought this week to fire the renegade top prosecutor.

This strategy has been dubbed reviving \u201czombie\u201d charters.Now 216 charters operate in the city and 23 more new charters are left to be issued under the state cap, according to the New York City Charter School Center. The deal means nearly two dozen additional charter schools could be opened without changing state law to lift the cap.Charter advocates have long argued the cap should be eliminated altogether, saying tens of thousands of children are on waitlists for seats. Teachers unions and other critics say most charters don\u2019t serve enough hard-to-teach students and drain resources from the regular public schools.Pro-charter groups have long accused Mayor       Bill de Blasio       of failing to give them as much space in city buildings as they deserve. Mr. de Blasio has said his administration follows the state law, which requires it to offer charters appropriate space for free or help pay rent in private space. One person said the new deal would also streamline the process for getting that rental assistance.Conflict over the charter cap was a sticking point in lawmakers\u2019 drawn-out negotiations over whether to renew mayoral control in New York City.

Ms. Haley didn\u2019t offer details of the planned U.S. resolution, but said it would seek to cut off North Korea from major sources of currency, restrict oil flows, constrain maritime activity, and target senior officials in North Korea.Russia and China united against the U.S. in refuting further sanctions and military actions, sparking a clash between U.S. and Russia diplomats.Russia\u2019s deputy U.N. Ambassador\u00a0Vladimir\u00a0Safronkov forcefully refuted military action or further economic sanctions on North Korea and said both options were \u201cinadmissible\u201d\u00a0and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\u201cWe are against any statement or action that might lead to escalation. We call on all states to act with restraint rather than war mongering,\u201d said Mr. Safronkov.North Korea has bedeviled the Security Council since 2006, when the country conducted a nuclear test and the council passed a resolution mandating it to abandon its military and nuclear program. North Korea has done the opposite, expanding both programs.The latest missile test, of an intercontinental ballistic missile, \u201crequires an escalated diplomatic and economic response,\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cTime is short and action is required. If we act together we can still prevent the world from a catastrophe,\u201d she said.Ms. Haley also said the U.S. would target countries that continued to have trade partnerships with North Korea. She singled out China for constituting 90% of North Korea\u2019s trade. She said she had spoken to Mr. Trump this morning about various options, including targeting trade with North Korea.Enrico Carisch, a North Korea sanctions adviser to U.N. Security Council members, said the council faces a difficult balancing act in punishing North Korea but also offering it enough incentive and reward to enter negotiations.\u201cGiven what it is, we need to focus on existing U.N. sanctions. One way to do that is mobilizing action against institutions and corporations that are directly or indirectly engaged in business with North Korea,\u201d said Mr. Carisch.Diplomats at the council lined up in traditional alliances, with France and the U.K. supporting U.S. calls for a new sanctions resolution and countries such as Bolivia speaking against it.France\u2019s Ambassador Francois Delattre said: \u201cThere is no choice but to be more firm and more united.\u201d U.K. Ambassador       Matthew Rycroft       said: \u201cThis cannot go on as it has been.

U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley warned Wednesday the U.S. is willing to use military force against North Korea \u201cif we must.\u201dMilitary action, according to analysts, could take a number of forms. Most likely among them: a limited airstrike on North Korea\u2019s nuclear infrastructure or missile facilities. How successful such an attack would be in derailing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program would depend in large part on the quality of U.S. and allied intelligence on the nuclear and missile sites. Far less likely, but also possible, would be an attack designed to target the country\u2019s leadership.But any overt military action would run the risk that the North Korean regime would interpret the attack as an existential threat and respond with force that could kill millions of people on the Korean Peninsula, including some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Secretary of Defense       Jim Mattis       has warned that a military solution would be \u201ctragic on an unbelievable scale.\u201d\u201cThe secretary of defense and the commander of U.S. Forces Korea have both stressed the high degree of risk involved in the use of force,\u201d said Patrick Cronin, senior director in the Asia-Pacific security program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because Kim Jong Un has never experienced a military attack, however limited, on his soil, and there is a risk that he would see any use of force as the opening salvo in an attempted regime change in which he would have nothing to lose.\u201dNorth Korea over the years has built up formidable capabilities and created one of the world\u2019s most militarized societies, with an active-duty military of some 1.19 million people, compared with 630,000 in South Korea, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Long-range artillery that North Korea has situated as close as 35 miles from Seoul could drop as much tonnage of lead on the South Korean capital in 24 hours as Germany dropped on England during the entire London Blitz during World War II, if uncontested, one U.S. military official said last year.North Korea also possesses tens of thousands of special operations commandos, which Pyongyang could insert covertly into South Korea by submarine and plane to sabotage critical infrastructure, cripple the economy and stymie a military offensive, according to a U.S. military official. North Korea could also respond with formidable cyberwarfare capabilities, chemical weapons and bombings, analysts said.There is likely to be limited appetite for military actions in South Korea, where a newly elected liberal government has just replaced a more hawkish one, and where the population would be loath to jeopardize economic prosperity that has come with decades of peace. Even the installation of Thaad, an antiballistic missile defense system the U.S. recently sent to South Korea, has provoked controversy in the country, where many are old enough to remember the trauma of the Korean War.South Korean President Moon Jae-in called Wednesday for more sanctions against North Korea, but said he believes the issue should be resolved peacefully.Meanwhile, the window for any military strike that would seriously damage the North Korean nuclear program may be closing.\u201cYou have reached the point where it\u2019s less and less clear that you will have any opportunities in the future,\u201d said Anthony Cordesman, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cOne thing you have to consider very explicitly is that the further North Korea proceeds, the harder it is to have any kind of option.\u201dStill, Mr. Cordesman said the Trump administration, before pursuing any military alternatives, should consider a comprehensive package of policies including stricter sanctions, information warfare campaigns and military buildup in the region to pressure North Korea.Another question facing the U.S. is whether it is better to risk all-out war with North Korea to rid the country of nuclear weapons or to accept Pyongyang as a nuclear power and concentrate instead on deterring the regime from using its new nuclear arsenal.\u201cWe can continue to effectively deter the use of those weapons,\u201d Mr. Cronin said. \u201cThe problem is the American body politic is not ready to accept a nuclear-armed North Korea that can strike U.S. soil. We haven\u2019t had to make that judgment yet but we are right on the cusp of having to make that.\u201dWrite to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Missile Launch Creates Tough Choice for U.S..'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 20:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-missile-test-leaves-white-house-with-tough-choice-1499300730", "news_title": "Use of Force Against North Korea Carries Risk of Catastrophic War ", "keywords": "missile test,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,risk news,military action,weapons programs"}, {"content": "WARSAW\u2014Like many of his fellow Polish pro-government lawmakers,       Dominik Tarczynski       is sending a busload of constituents to Warsaw on Thursday to cheer for President       Donald Trump.       The buses are being provided by a foundation close to the governing party.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be huge\u2014absolutely huge,\u201d Mr. Tarczynski said of the coming welcome for Mr. Trump. \u201cThey just love him, the people in Poland\u2014they just really love him.\u201dPoland was working to put on a hero\u2019s welcome for Mr. Trump, who arrived late Wednesday for a brief visit that includes a speech Thursday in a Warsaw square.President       Barack Obama      formed a close bond with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and backed her liberal worldview, her acceptance of immigrants, and her support for a deeply integrated European Union. Now it is nationalist governments such as Poland\u2019s that hope Mr. Trump will see them as ideological kindred spirits and back their push to loosen the European Union and rebalance it away from Berlin.\u201cThere\u2019s this new success\u2014Trump\u2019s visit,\u201d       Jaroslaw Kaczynski,        chairman of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party, said at a party congress over the weekend. Tweaking European officials who are nervous that Mr. Trump\u2019s visit could deepen the divide on the continent, Mr. Kaczynski went on: \u201cThey\u2019re envious of it!\u201dPoland, where the conservative Law and Justice government took over in 2015, is locked in an escalating feud with the EU\u2019s executive body in Brussels and with Western European capitals. The European Commission has said the government\u2019s changes to the Polish judicial system, including appointing its own judges to the Constitutional Court, undermine the rule of law.French President       Emmanuel Macron       suggested Poland was rejecting European democratic principles and treating the bloc like \u201ca supermarket,\u201d implying it is taking advantage of the EU without following all of its norms.German politicians often slam Poland for failing to take in refugees and for reducing press freedoms.In Mr. Trump, some Polish politicians and commentators see a leader who has campaigned against accepting refugees and criticized the EU and Germany\u2019s influence in the bloc.\u201cRegarding refugees, the Polish government has the same position as Americans\u2014we want strict restrictions on refugees,\u201d said       Krzysztof Mr\u00f3z,        a Law and Justice lawmaker who plans to dispatch two buses full of Trump fans\u201498 people\u2014from his district at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning for the 300-mile drive to Warsaw.In lobbying for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit in recent months, Polish officials made a promise of a positive reception for the president part of their pitch. Polish Foreign Minister       Witold Waszczykowski       said in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal that he told Mr. Trump, on the sidelines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels in May: \u201cPlease visit us, your soldiers are already here, you can follow, and you can visit a country which is friendly.\u201dMr. Trump responded, according to Mr. Waszczykowski, that \u201cPolish Americans helped him win\u201d the presidential election.\u201cI said, \u2018Well, we can help you once again... if you visit us and cooperate with us,\u2019\u201d Mr. Waszczykowski recalled.But some critics of Poland\u2019s government are wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s trip. Bartosz Wieli\u0144ski, foreign editor of the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, said the government appeared to be turning Mr. Trump\u2019s speech into a \u201cpartisan spectacle\u201d and that his public reception would amount to a \u201cPotemkin village.\u201d\u201cThis visit, I think, is a kind of opportunity for the ruling government party to show that Poland is not completely isolated internationally,\u201d said       Rafal Pankowski,        a Warsaw political scientist.In Western Europe, some officials worry that Mr. Trump will fan the flames of anti-immigrant, anti-European Union sentiment just like he endorsed Brexit ahead of the British referendum on leaving the EU last summer.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that what the Poles want is to turn their back on France and Germany,\u201d a senior EU official said. \u201cTrump is surely not helping.\u201dPolish officials say Mr. Trump\u2019s visit isn\u2019t about deepening the east-west gulf in the EU, but about backing up Poland on issues including countering Russia and on energy security.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a justification to connect the visit of President Trump in Poland to the concept of dividing Europe,\u201d Mr. Waszczykowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s going, just by his presence, to appreciate our efforts, appreciate our achievements.\u201dTo be sure, many Poles are wary of Mr. Trump, in part because of his calls for closer cooperation with Russia\u2014a country that some of them see as an existential threat.According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring, 23% of Poles are confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, compared with 11% across the border in Germany.While low compared with his U.S. numbers (which hover between 35% and 40%), Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings in Poland are among the highest in Europe. While Britons and Italians rank Mr. Trump at about the same level, only 7% of Spaniards, 10% of Swedes, and 14% of French have confidence in the U.S. president, according to the survey. Among members of the European Union included in the poll, Hungary gave Mr. Trump his best rating, with 29% expressing confidence--still far lower than the 53% of Russians who see Mr. Trump positively.The preparations for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit\u2014a welcome that Mr. Tarczynski said will be far more \u201cemotional\u201d than Warsaw\u2019s receptions for Mr. Obama\u2014are the latest example of countries jockeying for advantage as the U.S. president puts past American foreign-policy tenets into question. In addition to speaking to Poles at a public square, Mr. Trump will address 12 central European, Baltic, and Western Balkan leaders who are gathering in Warsaw.Several organizations close to the Law and Justice party are also drumming up supporters to cheer for Mr. Trump. One of them, the nationalist Gazeta Polska Clubs, is touting Mr. Trump\u2019s address in Warsaw on Thursday as comparable to       John F. Kennedy\u2019s       \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech of 1963.Mr. Kaczynski, Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, even posed in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap in April, a Trump trademark. He did so in a meeting with       Matthew Tyrmand,        a Polish-American journalist who has written about Poland for the conservative U.S. outlet Breitbart News.\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with a political dynamic in Poland on the ground that understands Trumpian populism,\u201d Mr. Tyrmand said. Mr. Trump\u2019s trip, Mr. Tyrmand said, \u201chas huge implications for reshaping the geopolitics in a new presidential era.\u201dU.S. officials say Mr. Trump\u2019s trip will be about strengthening trans-Atlantic bonds and supporting one of America\u2019s staunchest allies. Poland is one of the few North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to meet the organization\u2019s target of spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense, White House national security adviser       H.R.

Some others said waiting longer could them give more time to figure out why inflation has slowed and that moving sooner might wrongly signal they were moving more aggressively to raise interest rates.Taken together, the minutes of the June meeting and subsequent comments from Fed officials show a growing likelihood that the Fed will initiate its balance sheet runoff plan in September. That sequence would give officials more time to see if the inflation slowdown is temporary before raising rates, and it would allow officials to proceed well before any transition to a new Fed leader if Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       isn\u2019t reappointed before her current term ends Feb. 3.The Fed\u2019s internal debate over the future policy path has been complicated by two puzzles.\u00a0Inflation has weakened, justifying some officials\u2019 call for a slower pace of rate increases.But financial conditions have eased despite recent rate increases\u2014with stock markets running to new highs, long-term yields declining and the dollar weakening. This has strengthened the resolve of those who want to stick with the Fed\u2019s current rate path, which projects another quarter-percentage move this year and four more next year.At the June meeting, officials discussed reasons why financial conditions haven\u2019t tightened, including strong corporate-earnings growth and growing risk tolerance among investors. Some officials raised concerns that stock prices looked high and that subdued market volatility could lead to \u201ca buildup of risks to financial stability,\u201d the minutes said.\u201cThe policy implication says, \u2018Look we\u2019ve been raising rates. We haven\u2019t overly tightened financial conditions, so we can afford to continue here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro LP. \u201cIt is a green light to continue, more than anything.\u201dOfficials raised rates\u00a0to a range between 1% and 1.25% at the June meeting, the central bank\u2019s third quarter-point rate increase in as many quarters, and they penciled in one more increase this year. They also reached consensus on how they will gradually reduce the Fed\u2019s $4.5 trillion asset portfolio, also known as its balance sheet, which could lead long-term rates to rise.Because the Fed is prepared to gradually shrink those holdings in a slow, predictable manner, by allowing some assets to mature without reinvestment, officials last month said they expected launching the runoff would have a limited impact on markets, according to the account published\u00a0Wednesday.From a market standpoint, the Fed has \u201cdone everything to make the end of reinvestment as palatable as humanly possible,\u201d said Jim Vogel, market strategist at FTN Financial.Markets showed little reaction to\u00a0the minutes Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 1.1 points, or 0.01%, to close at 21478. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved up after the release of the minutes but ended the day at 2.334%, according to Tradeweb, below\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a02.352% closing yield.The next Fed policy meeting is\u00a0July 25-26. Ms. Yellen\u00a0will have an opportunity to elaborate publicly on her outlook when she delivers semiannual testimony before Congress next Wednesday and Thursday.The minutes showed officials also face divisions over how the portfolio runoff plans could alter the path of interest rates going forward. At the June meeting, officials\u2019 median forecasts showed four more quarter-point rate increases in 2018.The central bank\u2019s discussion about the balance sheet picked up this year because Fed officials have grown more comfortable with the economic outlook. Officials stopped adding to the balance sheet in 2014, but they have been reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets to keep the Fed\u2019s holdings steady.Under the plans announced last month, the Fed will allow its holdings to decline gradually by allowing a predetermined amount of bonds to\u00a0mature every month without using the proceeds to buy more bonds.It would start by allowing up to $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage bonds to roll off without reinvestment, and let those amounts rise each quarter, essentially setting a speed limit for the wind-down. The plan\u2019s pace would ultimately rise to a maximum of $30 billion a month for Treasurys and $20 billion a month for mortgages.Fed officials have said they want the balance-sheet wind-down to run quietly in the background, meaning they are unlikely to adjust it from one meeting to the next, barring a shock to the economy.Officials raised rates last month despite some concern over declines in inflation gauges, which Ms. Yellen and others have largely attributed to one-off factors such as big discounts on wireless phone plans. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge briefly surpassed the central bank\u2019s 2% target in February but posted greater-than-expected drops since then, rising just 1.4% on the year ended in May.Officials will receive two more monthly inflation readings before their September meeting and are likely to study those reports closely to confirm their latest forecasts. They could face greater doubt or division on their policy path if current trends continue\u2014inflation remains soft, the unemployment rate falls further and asset prices continue their rise.Before\u00a0the\u00a0release of the June meeting\u2019s account, traders in futures markets placed a 19% probability on a Fed rate increase by September, and nearly a 60% probability of at least one rate increase by year-end, according to CME Group.The Fed\u2019s legal mandates are to ensure prices are stable, measured in recent years with the 2% inflation objective, and to provide maximum sustainable employment. But officials pay close attention to financial conditions, including corporate and government bond yields and asset prices, because those serve as the transmission mechanism for the Fed\u2019s rate-setting policy.Looser financial conditions could strengthen the argument of those who want to move faster on the balance sheet runoff.\u201cIf financial conditions aren\u2019t responding as much as the Fed expects to changes in the interest rate, and if that\u2019s because the Fed has a large balance sheet, you might want to reduce the balance sheet sooner to see how markets respond,\u201d said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS, a provider of hiring software, and a former analyst at the New York Fed.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Readies Timing of Portfolio Tapering.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 20:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-ready-to-start-portfolio-wind-down-within-months-1499277737", "news_title": "Fed Officials Ready to Start Shrinking Portfolio in Months", "keywords": "federal reserve minutes,fed june meeting,fed june minutes,fed minutes,fed rates,fomc,fomc june meeting,fomc minutes,june minutes,minutes,yellen,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Angela Merkel       on Monday set out her case for re-election to German voters in a manifesto that promises more of the same, for better and worse.In the better column, the program from Mrs. Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, fleshes out some tax reforms. Berlin is running record fiscal surpluses\u2014\u20ac54 billion ($61.33 billion) last year\u2014and CDU/CSU leaders have dragged Mrs. Merkel into supporting \u20ac15 billion in annual tax cuts.This will focus on the personal-income tax. The party would increase to \u20ac60,000 from \u20ac54,000 the level at which the second-highest 42% tax rate kicks in, and it will readjust the complex tax calculations for income up to that level to reduce the marginal rate for each additional euro of income.This is long overdue, but it\u2019s remarkably stingy and far from a knock-out punch against the tax plan released last month by Mrs. Merkel\u2019s opponents in the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). The SPD plan also promises only \u20ac15 billion in tax relief, but it would increase the threshold for the second-highest rate to \u20ac76,000 and then make up the difference by increasing the highest and second-highest tax rates, to a maximum of 48%. The current top individual rate is 45%.Mrs. Merkel\u2019s plan is better in not punishing higher earners to \u201cpay for\u201d middle-class relief. But she missed an opportunity to break free of the \u20ac15 billion tyranny afflicting Germany\u2019s political class. Berlin can afford to cut taxes more than that, including cuts in individual tax rates. Berlin can afford to cut the 33% corporate tax rate, too.The main weakness is that Mrs. Merkel\u2019s platform fails to do much more to help the economy beyond the labor-market reforms enacted 15 years ago by her SPD predecessor,       Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.       Those crucial reforms reduced unemployment benefits and made it easier to hire and fire some workers. They produced a more resilient economy that has weathered the eurozone crisis and now benefits from reviving global growth and demand for German exports.Mrs. Merkel has lived off that inheritance while hurting the economy with green-energy costs and the introduction of a costly minimum wage. Underemployment is a growing problem as tax and regulatory policies make it difficult for those in entry-level jobs to advance up the income ladder. Private investment remains weak, especially as Germany\u2019s labor laws and tax policies fall behind reforming European competitors such as the Netherlands, Spain and even potentially France.Mrs. Merkel\u2019s manifesto nods to these problems, but aside from the modest tax cut the plan consists of populist crowd-pleasers such as R&D spending and increased child allowances. Mrs. Merkel\u2019s steady-as-she-goes message may work against the SPD in an election when times are modestly good. It leaves for another day the debate over how Germany will respond in the next downturn.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 19:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/merkels-stingy-tax-reform-1499298954", "news_title": "Merkel\u2019s Stingy Tax Reform", "keywords": "angela merkel, cdu, elections, germany, income taxes, spd, tax policy,government finance,government budget,taxation,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Miosotis Familia joined the New York Police Department when she was 36 years old, hoping to help protect the city where she had spent her life.Ms. Familia       had worked for the Red Cross, said a family member and an associate, but she wanted to do more.\u201cThere\u2019s always one in the family that wants us to take care of everybody,\u201d said       Tonya Sanchez,        a childhood friend from Washington Heights whose sister married Ms. Familia\u2019s brother.On Wednesday shortly after midnight, Ms. Familia was fatally shot in the head while sitting in a mobile-command post vehicle in the Fordham Heights section of the Bronx.Shortly afterward she died at a hospital.

Vincent Brooks,        the top American military commander in South Korea, said the U.S. and South Korea were prepared to go to war with the North if given the order.\u201cSelf restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,\u201d Gen. Brooks said. \u201cWe are able to change our choice when so ordered.\u2026It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary.\u201dU.S. officials for years have said an attack on North Korea would have devastating results in the form of a counterattack on South Korea and possibly Japan.Military action, some analysts say, could take a number of forms. Most likely among them: a limited airstrike on North Korea\u2019s nuclear infrastructure or missile facilities. How successful such an attack would be in derailing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program would depend in large part on the quality of U.S. and allied intelligence on the nuclear and missile sites. Far less likely, but also possible, would be an attack designed to target the country\u2019s leadership.U.S. military officials on Wednesday said North Korea\u2019s latest weapons test featured a new type of missile fired from a mobile launch site, two factors propelling the view in Washington that the isolated country\u2019s nuclear-weapons program is a growing threat.Pentagon officials, briefing reporters on Tuesday\u2019s launch, described the potential weapon as a new kind of missile U.S. officials haven\u2019t seen launched from North Korea before. The two-stage missile was launched from a location known as the Banghyon Aircraft Plant, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, said Capt.       Jeff Davis,        a Pentagon spokesman.At the emergency session of the Security Council on Wednesday, the U.S. said it would introduce a new Security Council resolution within days to tighten and expand economic and diplomatic sanctions in response to North Korea\u2019s ICBM launch.However, Russia and China formed a united front against the U.S. and its allies, saying they would strongly oppose new sanctions or military action, and offering a joint plan that called for dialogue and a parallel halt in military operations and exercises by all parties, including the U.S., in the Korean Peninsula. Both Russia and China have veto power, as permanent members of the Security Council, and hold considerable sway over North Korea.Ms. Haley fired back, indicating the U.S. would be willing to put the resolution to a vote even in the absence of a consensus, an unusual move in a diplomatic body that usually takes care to coordinate texts of resolutions behind closed doors to appear united.\u201cIf you are happy with North Korea\u2019s actions, veto it,\u201d she told them. \u201cIf you want to be a friend of North Korea, veto it.\u201d She added that if they were to block the U.S. proposal, \u201cthen we will go our own path.\u201dAny overt military action would run the risk that the North Korean regime would interpret the attack as an existential threat and respond with force that could kill millions of people on the Korean peninsula, including some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Secretary of Defense       Jim Mattis       has warned that a military solution would be \u201ctragic on an unbelievable scale.\u201dSeoul, a city of more than 10 million, sits just 35 miles from the North Korean border, where Pyongyang has assembled artillery that could inflict devastating damage on the densely populated South Korean capital.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has called for more dialogue and closer economic ties with North Korea, on Wednesday called on global leaders to step up sanctions against North Korea, urging a peaceful resolution to the conflict.He was speaking during joint statements in Berlin with Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        who said North Korea \u201cposes a big threat to global peace.\u201dIf attacked by the U.S., North Korea could also likely fire on U.S. ally Japan, which is within range of many of Pyongyang\u2019s missiles. During one launch in March the North fired four missiles at once toward Japan, which some analysts interpreted as a warning that it could overwhelm any Japanese missile defense.The odds of a U.S. military strike on North Korea remain low\u2014about a 10% probability\u2014      Meredith Sumpter,        director of Asia for Eurasia Group, wrote in a note on Tuesday, adding it would probably be well-signaled by the U.S. and \u201cclear to outside observers in advance of any military move.\u201dU.S. officials monitoring Tuesday\u2019s launch operation made a determination of the missile\u2019s trajectory within minutes after takeoff, concluding quickly that it didn\u2019t pose a threat to the U.S. or its allies. The U.S. maintains missile-defense systems based in South Korea, at sea and in ground installations in the U.S.U.S. officials said the mobile nature of the launchpad used by Pyongyang contributed to the element of surprise that the North possessed an ICBM.North Korea on Wednesday touted another achievement of the test launch: It claimed that its missile warhead\u2014the forward section, which carries the explosive\u2014can withstand the extreme heat and pressure of re-entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere. If true, that would clear another hurdle in developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach American cities.U.S. defense officials said they were still assessing the re-entry vehicle and couldn\u2019t confirm North Korea\u2019s claims of the missile warhead\u2019s effectiveness. Officials determined that the missile was capable of traveling more than 3,400 miles.Following the North Korean test, the U.S. and South Korean armies conducted a rare unscheduled live-fire drill, launching tactical surface-to-surface missiles off the east coast of Korea\u2014an action they said was aimed directly at \u201ccountering North Korea\u2019s destabilizing and unlawful actions on July 4.\u201dThe drill and tough language appeared to be meant to reassure Seoul after North Korea\u2019s successful ICBM test.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described the development as an escalation of the threat to the U.S. It came despite years of sanctions and warnings aimed at preventing       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       regime from reaching the milestone.The U.S. had sought Beijing\u2019s help in pressuring North Korea, but recently President Trump indicated that route had been fruitless. \u201cTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\u201d he said in a tweet on Wednesday.A Chinese customs official told a news conference in April that China\u2019s bilateral trade with North Korea in the first quarter had increased by 37.4% to 8.4 billion yuan (about $1.2 billion). He didn\u2019t specify if that was a year-to-year comparison.Chinese customs figures show that bilateral trade continued to expand in April and May on a year-on-year basis, but that doesn\u2019t mean more revenue for North Korea: The second-quarter increase was driven by China\u2019s exports. Its imports from its neighbor declined in April and May, compared with those months last year, due in large part to Beijing enforcing a ban on North Korean coal.The U.S. has been making shows of force in recent months in response to perceived increases in tension on the Korean Peninsula. In April, it said it was sending the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group to the western Pacific to underscore Washington\u2019s commitment to the region. In that case, the announcement instead raised questions about U.S. credibility after it came to light that the aircraft carrier was thousands of miles away.Twice in May, the U.S. sent B-1B bombers on flyovers near the Korean Peninsula. Each came shortly after a North Korean missile test.\u2014Jeremy Page and Paul Sonne contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter.

F 0.68%       in stock-market valuation.The Volvo announcement is \u201cthe hard-reality case that Tesla will face intense competition by next decade from legacy [auto makers] expanding their electric options,\u201d Barclays auto analyst       Brian Johnson       said in an investor note. \u201cTesla may have a lead in battery costs,\u201d he said, but the \u201cscale advantages\u201d of multinational car companies likely means Mr. Musk\u2019s lead isn\u2019t as sizable as often believed.Investors also were reacting to Tesla\u2019s news Monday that second-quarter sales of its luxury Model S and Model X sport-utility vehicle were lower than analysts had projected because of a supply issue with battery packs, raising new fears the company will have trouble meeting ambitious production targets for its cheaper Model 3, which starts at $35,000.Several analysts also questioned whether demand for Tesla\u2019s two niche products is waning as it scrambles to make the leap to the mass market. The Model S, which sells for about $100,000, \u201cis getting a little long in the tooth,\u201d said       Dave Sullivan,        an analyst for AutoPacific Inc.Owned by China\u2019s Geely Holding Group, Sweden-based Volvo on Wednesday outlined plans to transition its entire lineup of new models to vehicles powered either by batteries or hybrid electric-internal combustion engines by 2019.While representing potentially the biggest bet yet against gasoline and diesel cars, the announcement follows a blueprint being drawn up by Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and             Daimler AG      . Those companies plan to sell millions of electric cars by 2025\u2014evidence the auto industry\u2019s incumbents believe the internal-combustion engine has an expiration date.While Mr. Musk is broadly credited with making electric cars sexy, regulations and financial incentives in the U.S., the European Union and China are the driving force pushing most auto makers to look to batteries as the industry\u2019s silver bullet for reducing emissions.Strict fuel-economy mandates are in place in the world\u2019s largest vehicle markets, often matched by tax breaks that can cut up to 50% off the price of an electric vehicle.In the U.S., Mr. Musk\u2019s Tesla is the face of the electric-car movement, outpacing all-electric offerings from GM and             Nissan Motor Co.       that are cheaper but considered dull by comparison.A new class of electrified or battery-assisted vehicles will soon challenge Tesla\u2019s thrust, however, with nameplates as exotic as Aston Martin, as rugged as Jeep\u2019s Wrangler or iconic as Ford\u2019s Mustang. As with Teslas, many will offer buyers a $7,500 federal tax break.Investors have prized Tesla\u2019s focus on technology, including semi-autonomous driving and over-the-air software updates\u2014but Volvo and others are looking to match it.Car makers in the U.S. threatening to edge in on Tesla\u2019s turf are pressured by       Obama      -administration rules mandating a steep increase in miles-per-gallon performance over the next eight years.Auto executives say a broad shift toward electrification\u2014whether hybrids that pair high-powered batteries with conventional gasoline engines, or full-blown electric cars\u2014will be needed to meet those regulations.The       Trump       administration is reviewing federal emissions rules, but any rollback could take several years and may not address mandates at the state level. California, and several states that subscribe to its clean-air rules, demand that 15% of vehicle sales by 2025 be zero-emission cars.Yet Americans continue to shrug off electric vehicles. While all but two states have regulations or incentives designed to promote their sales, cheap gasoline means car makers are investing in a technology that today offers meager returns.Ford, for instance, is spending $4.5 billion to revamp its U.S. portfolio with electric or hybrid trucks and SUVs, including a hybrid version of its F-150 pickup, the best-selling vehicle in America. Meantime,             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 0.67%       NV\u2019s rugged Jeep lineup will soon offer battery power to tackle off-road challenges.But less than 1% of the record 17.5 million-plus vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2016 were all-electric, says WardsAuto.com.In Detroit, electrified vehicles have long been panned as \u201ccompliance cars\u201d because they help the makers comply with clean-air rules\u2014even if they don\u2019t excite many customers or turn a profit. These cars may be good for the environment, but bad for the bottom line.Often priced significantly higher than a conventional car, vehicles like GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt or Fiat\u2019s 500e are niche vehicles that get a fraction of the marketing support or consumer interest that profit-rich pickup trucks and SUVs achieve. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive       Sergio Marchionne       has even asked buyers not to purchase the Fiat electric subcompact because the company loses thousands of dollars on each sale.To get electrification into the mainstream, analysts say gas prices likely need to rise while government subsidies remain in place or increase, and charging stations for the vehicles become much more numerous.In a report published earlier in this year, McKinsey & Co. noted that \u201cauto makers face a difficult challenge\u201d when it comes to how quickly to move away from internal combustion engines. The consulting firm estimates 30% of U.S. buyers would consider an EV purchase today, but car companies must boost consumer-education initiatives and marketing campaigns at a time when overall demand for automobiles is slipping.\u201cThey must strike the right balance between selling enough EVs to comply with tightening regulatory fleet emissions and fuel economy targets, while also preventing the incremental cost of adding battery packs from cannibalizing corporate profits,\u201d McKinsey said.The consulting firm estimates battery-pack prices have fallen about 80% since 2010, and an electric car and comparable gasoline-powered car could hit cost parity within a decade.Write to John D.

But bondholders beware: Politicians will happily throw them over as easily as Republicans dumped their reform principles.The three major rating agencies\u2014            Moody\u2019s,       S&P and Fitch\u2014are constructive in highlighting fiscal deficits, but they often underestimate credit risk. Downgrades are lagging indicators of fiscal and economic stress. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt wasn\u2019t slashed to junk until 2014\u2014seven years into a decade-long recession and after politicians had borrowed tens of billions to tape up structural deficits. And as they demonstrated again in Illinois, credit raters don\u2019t much care how deficits are closed. Tax increases are fine, even desirable, if spending cuts are too politically difficult.Earlier this year the big three credit raters cut Illinois\u2019s rating to just above junk and warned the state would lose its investment grade if politicians didn\u2019t pass a budget reducing its $15 billion backlog of bills. While the yield on Illinois\u2019s 10-year general obligation bonds is 4.4%, servicing its debt is twice as expensive as for highly rated governments\u2014and watch out if interest rates rise.Democratic leaders used the junk threat to turn up the heat on Mr. Rauner, who proposed a compromise of temporary income and corporate tax increases in return for a few modest economic and government reforms. But Democratic legislators and public unions pocketed the taxes without the reform.They figure they can get whatever they want from the next Democratic governor as they did with Mr. Rauner\u2019s predecessor       Pat Quinn.       Chicago business groups backed Democrats in the budget fight, hoping a state tax hike would bring more revenues into the city and keep local politicians from targeting downtown businesses. Good luck with that.Rating agencies in effect gave downstate Republicans political cover to back the tax increase. After the House passed a budget over the holiday weekend raising $5 billion in taxes, Fitch praised the state\u2019s \u201cconcrete progress.\u201d S&P noted that the budget could \u201chelp put a halt to this erosion of the state\u2019s sovereignty over its fiscal affairs.\u201dBut while higher taxes may let bondholders breathe easier for a while, they won\u2019t change the state\u2019s tax-borrow-and-spend culture. To pay its backlog of health-care bills\u2014which are accruing interest at a 9% rate\u2014the state now plans to issue $6 billion in general obligation bonds. Illinois has borrowed $17 billion to fund pensions, which remain unfunded by $130 billion. The state this year will pay $1.6 billion in interest on the bonds and $8.9 billion to the pension funds\u2014equal to about 35% of the state general fund.After jacking up property taxes, Chicago Public Schools last month borrowed $400 million at roughly 6.4% to make mandated pension payments. The short-term loans are backed by state aid. As one alderman said, \u201cyou\u2019re still robbing Peter to pay Paul and putting a Band-Aid on it.\u201dRating agencies were loath to scold Puerto Rico, Detroit and Stockton, California, when they raised taxes while deferring spending reforms. But the tax increases propelled their economic decline and population flight, and bondholders ultimately got fleeced. Illinois may not be able to go bankrupt under federal law, but that won\u2019t stop politicians from making them an offer they can\u2019t refuse.Oh, and please don\u2019t come whining about \u201cthe sanctity of contracts\u201d when the politicians start the fleecing. It\u2019s hard to tell who are less believable: Illinois politicians or the credit raters who judge their paper.Appeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 19:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/junk-by-any-name-in-illinois-1499297774", "news_title": "Junk by Any Name in Illinois", "keywords": "Bruce Rauner,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Watching the Republican party self-immolate over the ObamaCare law, I\u2019d like to shake the hand of whoever had the idea to plant the expansion of federal Medicaid payments inside ObamaCare.Before this, Washington on average has been paying about 57% of Medicaid\u2019s costs. ObamaCare expanded the federal payment\u2019s share to 100% of newly eligible adults for any state that signed on, with the match \u201cfalling\u201d permanently to 90% in 2020. That was political genius.Maybe it was       Jonathan Gruber,        the ObamaCare architect vilified for admitting that the \u201cstupidity\u201d of American voters got the law passed. I\u2019d say Mr. Gruber has the last laugh now on what people not long ago called the stupid party.What an irony it is that one of the Republican arguments made now for preserving ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is the opioid crisis. Even after the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Medicaid\u2019s expansion was optional, some Republican governors got hooked on the promise of federal cash flow to the horizon.Now GOP governors in the Medicaid-expanded states of Ohio, Arkansas and Nevada are pushing their Republican senators to defeat any significant limitations on the nationalized funding of this entitlement. Other Republican-led states that took the expansion are Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New Jersey, Iowa and Indiana (which to its credit extracted the Obama administration\u2019s commitment to its Medicaid reform program).Now the party\u2019s fabled repeal-and-replace effort is threatened by a standoff between Medicaid\u2019s new best friends\u2014\u201cmoderate\u201d GOP senators\u2014and conservative colleagues who are trying to moderate the entitlement\u2019s permanent expansion.Add in       Donald Trump       criticizing the House bill as \u201cmean,\u201d and how can anyone fault the retired       Barack Obama       for golfing his way through the world\u2019s resorts? He earned his victory lap. His people understood the iron law of political spending: Offer it, and they will come.The structure of Medicaid always made the program a Faustian bargain for the states. Originating in the Great Society outpourings of the 1960s, Medicaid\u2019s purpose was to ensure medical care for the disabled and women and children in poverty. Though the states and Washington split the costs, a political genius back then inserted this spending opiate: If states expanded their Medicaid populations, Washington would still send them at least half of the rising costs. Meaning, of course, that taxpayers in states with even a minimal sense of fiscal responsibility paid for open-spigot states like California, New York, Illinois and New Jersey.Medicaid has become most states\u2019 second biggest budget outlay, behind K-12 education. Even the feds have cut back federal grants on everything else to pay for Medicaid. Here\u2019s the Government Accountability Office\u2019s bloodless 2012 report of how that works:\u201cThe increase in federal outlays for Medicaid and other health-related grant programs was offset by an approximately equivalent decrease in grants to state and local governments targeted for other areas such as transportation, education, and regional development.\u201dLike state-administered medicine everywhere, Medicaid \u201cworks\u201d only if no one notices it\u2019s robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Peters getting robbed to make Medicaid work include doctors who are supposed to serve this population.A Pew report described the mechanics of this perpetual grinding wheel: \u201cIn 2012, for example, Medicaid paid physicians on average 66 percent of what Medicare paid for services, down from 72 percent in 2008. Furthermore, both Medicaid and Medicare pay providers significantly less than what they receive from private payers. Low reimbursement rates decrease the willingness of providers to treat Medicaid enrollees, which sometimes limits enrollees\u2019 access to health care services.\u201dAs to       Nancy Pelosi,       Bernie Sanders       and       Elizabeth Warren       charging that the Republicans\u2019 attempted Medicaid reforms will kill people, those are crocodile tears. For years, states have tried to control Medicaid\u2019s open throttle the only way they know how\u2014with cuts. On Friday, a federal judge ordered Illinois to start paying a stunning $3 billion it has withheld from Medicaid providers, claiming it doesn\u2019t have the money. But from a pro shop somewhere, Mr. Obama, who learned his politics in Illinois, says the GOP effort to fix his namesake would \u201cruin Medicaid as we know it.\u201dMedicaid is already a fiscal ruin and lowest-common-denominator medicine. Advocates say it\u2019s better than nothing for the poor or uninsured, but well-controlled studies put even that claim in doubt.Reform Republicans want to give states a shot at restructuring the albatross Medicaid has become. Some GOP governors, such as Wisconsin\u2019s       Scott Walker,        are gamely trying to reform Medicaid without taking the federal payment expansion. But pressure on them to take the money will be intense if Senate Republicans fail or vote to repeal and revisit ObamaCare in two years.Give credit: ObamaCare\u2019s designers got this part right.Write henninger@wsj.com.Appeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 19:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gops-fatal-infatuation-1499297410", "news_title": "The GOP\u2019s Fatal Infatuation", "keywords": "gop,health care,medicare,obamacare,white house,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "Republican leaders consider next year\u2019s midterm elections a ripe opportunity to strengthen their party\u2019s majority in the Senate, but GOP lawmakers are turning down challenges in states in which President       Donald Trump       defeated Democrat       Hillary Clinton.Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican who represents the Second Congressional District in Missouri, said Monday that she won\u2019t challenge her state\u2019s senior U.S. senator, Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who is running for re-election in 2018. Mr. Trump won Missouri by 19 points last year.Ms. Wagner\u2019s decision follows similar choices by other lawmakers elsewhere. In Wisconsin, Rep. Sean Duffy, a Republican, has decided not to challenge first-term Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat; in Ohio, Rep. Pat Tiberi, a Republican, is passing on trying to unseat Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat.Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate, and the party is defending eight of those seats next year. Democrats have 23 seats up for re-election in 2018, along with the two independent senators who caucus with them. Of the Democratic seats, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump, a Republican, won in 2016, five of those by double digits.Still, midterms are often referendums on the president and Mr. Trump currently has a 37% approval rating, according to Gallup. And history shows the midterm elections more often than not go poorly for the party that controls the White House.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to knock off an incumbent in a good year. In a not-great year, those odds drop even further,\u201d said Josh Huder a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute.The prospect has left many potentially vulnerable Democratic incumbents without serious challengers. In North Dakota, a state where Mr. Trump won 63% of the vote, Sen.       Heidi Heitkamp,        a Democrat, has no challenger from the GOP.While the polls suggest Democrats face significant obstacles picking up seats in the Senate, they have done better in recruiting candidates. Rep. Jacky Rosen (D., Nev.), a polished political veteran, is planning to challenge the state\u2019s senior senator, Dean Heller, a Republican.A Public Policy Polling survey released last month showed Mr. Heller winning 39% of the vote against a Democratic candidate.Democrats are also hoping to unseat first-term GOP Sen.       Jeff Flake       of Arizona. Mr. Flake has challenges from both the left and the right.The National Republican Senatorial Committee declined to comment on the status of its efforts to recruit candidates.Austin Stukins, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said the race to challenge Ms. McCaskill is still early. There are \u201ca lot of great conservatives who are looking at the race, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d he said.Republicans are gearing up for a competitive race in West Virginia against Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat. GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins is challenging the incumbent senator.Among the challenges facing the GOP recruiters is that the environment in Washington appears toxic, and Congress, which has struggled for years to pass major legislation, is viewed by some as an unproductive and unfulfilling job, said GOP strategist Chuck Warren, who has consulted for Sens.       Orrin Hatch       of Utah and       Lindsey Graham       of South Carolina.\u201cYou go back there and all it is, is a food fight,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cNothing is getting done.

So if our forbearers celebrated the nation\u2019s founding over several days, I can stretch the holiday, too\u2014marking it not at home but in Europe, among friends of America who are mystified by what is happening in the United States.Many do not understand why the world\u2019s most powerful man acts on childish impulses and tweets ugly messages aimed at critics. Nor can they fathom why the world\u2019s oldest political party has twisted itself into mindless opposition\u2014\u201cresistance,\u201d as it\u2019s styled by the extremists who now call the tune for Democrats.This picture is not reassuring for a world that counts on American leadership. Our anxiety at home is mirrored in the anxiousness of our foreign friends. Still, we\u2019ve been here before. America has appeared broken in the past yet recovered its vigor, creativity, prosperity and leadership.While researching for my book on the 1896 election, I was taken aback at the quarter-century dysfunctionality of Gilded Age politics. In the five presidential elections before 1896, every winner received less than 50% of the vote. In two contests, the new president took an Electoral College majority but came in second in the popular vote. In a third race, the president came in first in the Electoral College and popular vote, but only by 9,467 ballots nationwide, a 0.02% margin.There were two years with a Republican president, House and Senate; two years with a Democratic president, House and Senate; and 20 years of divided government in which little was accomplished because the two parties not only had deeply conflicting ideas about policy but were still fighting the Civil War.After Republicans narrowly captured the House in 1888, Democrats responded by refusing to answer roll calls, thereby denying a quorum to conduct business. This went on for months until, after another fruitless vote, Speaker       Thomas Reed       directed the clerk to show as present every Democrat on the floor who refused to answer the roll call. All hell broke loose as Democrats attempted to bolt, but Reed had ordered the doors barricaded. Only one member\u2014a Texan\u2014escaped, pummeling a sergeant-at-arms and kicking out door panels to make good his escape.When the House later debated Reed\u2019s action, another Texas congressman rose and asked fellow Democrats to \u201corder me to remove this dictator\u201d from the podium by force. The speaker ruled him out of order and moved on. The offended Democrat was so angry that during the rest of the debate he sat in front of the podium, methodically sharpening his Bowie knife on his boot heel for hours in an attempt to menace Reed.Yet along came a new president, elected in 1896,       William McKinley.       He broke the gridlock, restored the country\u2019s confidence, and ushered in an America Century. Many of us have seen this in our lifetime as       Ronald Reagan       restored the nation\u2019s spirit when he reversed the decline of the 1970s.I\u2019m now doing research for a book on presidential decision-making, and I have come across many other moments when America seemed to be coming apart\u2014not just in those desperate years before 1860 or the tumult of riots in cities and on campuses a century later. We also had nullification, an agrarian revolt and the Great Depression, among other periods of disruption.It is amazing how close our country came to shredding itself as Federalists and Democratic-Republicans came to blows\u2014sometimes literally\u2014over foreign policy and defense in the 18th century\u2019s waning years.Maybe this time is different. Maybe America is really fading like the Roman Empire. Maybe social media is so corrosive that the damage it does cannot be repaired. Maybe democracy is dying. Maybe the U.S. government is crippled by the \u201cdeep state\u201d and fake news. And maybe the lack of trust in Washington, Congress and the presidency cannot be reversed.But don\u2019t bet on it. America specializes in comebacks. Just as we\u2019ve screwed up in the past and then found our footing, the practical common sense of Americans will assert itself, especially if we recommit ourselves to the enduring truths of the Declaration\u2014to \u201crevere\u201d it, in the words of       Abraham Lincoln,        and harmonize our \u201cpractices and policies\u201d with it. So as our national celebration ends, the responsibilities of ordinary citizens are just beginning.

Everyone is saying it. It\u2019s no accident that the left runs American culture. The right is too obsessed with mere mechanics\u2014poll numbers and vote counts\u2014to look up.\u201cResistance\u201d is unacceptable in referring to the Trump opposition because, obviously, it suggests the Resistance\u2014against the Nazis in occupied France. Many young people are too ignorant to recognize the term, but that hardly matters. The press uses it constantly. So when a young innocent finally does encounter the genuine French Resistance, he will think, \u201cAha, just like the resistance to Trump!\u201d And that\u2019s all the left wants: a mild but continuous cultural breeze murmuring in every American ear that opposing Trump is noble and glorious. Vive la R\u00e9sistance!This abuse of \u201cthe resistance\u201d happens everywhere. Many Republicans hate Mr. Trump and love to denounce him\u2014which lets them show their integrity and, sometimes, a less-praiseworthy attribute too.Many intellectuals think Mr. Trump is vulgar. That includes conservatives. They think he\u2019s a peasant and talks like one. Every time he opens his mouth, all they hear is a small-time Queens operator who struck it big but has never had a proper education, and embarrasses the country wherever he goes, whatever he says. It never dawns on them that the president can\u2019t stand them any more than they can stand him. Yet they expect him to treat them with respectful courtesy if he ever runs into them\u2014as he should, and on the whole does. Conceivably they should treat him the same way.Conservatives regret the collapse of authority, dignity and a certain due formality in the way Americans treat each other. They are right to complain when any president diminishes his office. Mr. Trump ought to think more seriously about what he owes the great men among his predecessors, and the office itself. But it\u2019s not clear that commentators make things any better when they treat the president himself like a third-rate clown.I\u2019d love for him to be a more eloquent, elegant speaker. But if I had to choose between deeds and delivery, it wouldn\u2019t be hard. Many conservative intellectuals insist that Mr. Trump\u2019s wrong policies are what they dislike. So what if he has restarted the large pipeline projects, scrapped many statist regulations, appointed a fine cabinet and a first-rate Supreme Court justice, asked NATO countries to pay what they owe, re-established solid relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia, signaled an inclination to use troops in Afghanistan to win and not merely cover our retreat, led us out of the Paris climate accord, plans to increase military spending (granted, not enough), is trying to get rid of ObamaCare to the extent possible, proposed to lower taxes significantly and revamp immigration policy and enforcement? What has he done lately?Conservative thinkers should recall that they helped create President Trump. They never blasted President Obama as he deserved. Mr. Obama\u2019s policies punished the economy and made the country and its international standing worse year by year; his patronizing arrogance drove people crazy. He was the perfect embodiment of a one-term president. The tea-party outbreak of 2009-10 made it clear where he was headed. History will record that the press saved him. Naturally the mainstream press loved him, but too many conservative commentators never felt equal to taking him on. They had every reason to point out repeatedly that Mr. Obama was the worst president since       Jimmy Carter,        surrounded by a left-wing cabinet and advisers, hostile to Israel, crazed regarding Iran, and even less competent to deal with the issues than Mr. Carter was\u2014which is saying plenty.But they didn\u2019t say plenty. They didn\u2019t say much at all. The rank and file noticed and got mad. Even their supposed champions didn\u2019t grasp what life under Mr. Obama was like\u2014a man who was wrecking the economy while preaching little sermons, whose subtext was always how smart he was, how dumb they were, and how America was full of racist clods, dangerous cops and infantile nuts who would go crazy if they even heard the words \u201cIslamic terrorism.\u201d So the rank and file was deeply angry and elected Mr. Trump.Some conservatives have the impression that, by showing off their anti-Trump hostility, they will get the networks and the             New York Times                   to like them. It doesn\u2019t work like that. Although the right reads the left, the left rarely reads the right. Why should it, when the left owns American culture? Nearly every university, newspaper, TV network, Hollywood studio, publisher, education school and museum in the nation. The left wrapped up the culture war two generations ago. Throughout my own adult lifetime, the right has never made one significant move against the liberal culture machine.So go ahead, proclaim it from the rooftops: the anti-Trump opposition is a virtual French Resistance!

Bush       once said: \u201cPoland should be strong and prosperous and independent and play its proper role as a great nation in the heart of Europe.\u201dPoland has lived up to those words. On Thursday, as an active member of NATO and the European Union, Poland hosts President       Trump       on his second international trip.This visit will demonstrate the unbreakable bonds between Poland and the U.S. and address the challenges facing our neighborhood and the broader Euro-Atlantic community.Polish-American relations are thriving, and for good reason. Poland has been a reliable partner to the U.S. since our democratic transformation. In the Middle East we answered America\u2019s call for action, deploying more than 40,000 Polish military personnel to Afghanistan and Iraq.With instability just beyond our borders, we welcome the deployment of U.S. and other NATO troops to our region. Thanks to the decisions made at the 2016 Warsaw NATO Summit and bipartisan support in Congress, Poland now hosts thousands of U.S. military personnel, as together we train to be ready to meet any threat.Poland also continues to be a security provider. We understand that solidarity is our strength. From the 2% of gross domestic product we spend on defense to our contribution of F-16s to the fight against ISIS, Poland continues to approach NATO membership and our alliance with America not as a handout but a commitment that must be honored every day.As President Trump declared recently, we must all take our defense and security obligations seriously. No one understands this better than Poland. That\u2019s why President       Andrzej Duda       announced that Poland will further increase its defense spending, to 2.2% of GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030.President Trump\u2019s visit indicates that the new U.S. administration is taking the challenges of our region and their global ramifications seriously, and is steadfastly committed to strengthening NATO\u2019s collective defense.America\u2019s renewed interest in our region is also visible in last month\u2019s delivery of American liquefied natural gas to Poland. Central and Eastern Europe have long been dominated by an energy monopoly left over from the Cold War era. We no longer have to be victims of geopolitics. Thanks to the newly constructed LNG import terminals on the Baltic coast and a system of interconnected pipelines, LNG delivered by ship to \u015awinouj\u015bcie, Poland, can be transported throughout our region and beyond. These terminals allow us to exert greater energy independence, and we look toward our American partners for continued LNG gas exports.The need to reassert our region\u2019s influence is the underpinning of the Three Seas Initiative, a forum that includes 12 countries from our neighborhood. President Duda and his Croatian counterpart, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, have invited Mr. Trump to meet with leaders from the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Sea region.America\u2019s commitment to liberty and democracy has captivated the Polish people for generations. Even more than four decades of forced Communist rule could not shake our appreciation of American values.

Yet, had you been following Indian Prime Minister       Narendra Modi\u2019s       Israel visit, which concludes Thursday, you\u2019d understand that those words, spoken by       Benjamin Netanyahu,        were euphoric and not cloying.Mr. Modi\u2019s visit to Israel is the first by an Indian prime minister in the 70 years since India\u2019s independence. The countries have had diplomatic relations for a quarter-century, but no Indian premier considered visiting Israel for fear of upsetting India\u2019s Arab allies\u2014and thereby, its supply of oil\u2014as well as its sizable Muslim population, for whose political leaders Israel has always been anathema. India also turned its back on Israel as a result of its commitment to a dishonest \u201canticolonial\u201d foreign policy\u2014that of nonalignment\u2014under which it was kosher to berate the Israelis for being colonial interlopers on Palestinian land.In truth, India and Israel have long done clandestine business. Israel helped India with weapons in its war with Pakistan in 1965. India returned the favor in 1967 when it gave Israel spare parts for its Ouragan and Mystere fighter planes. Mossad and RAW\u2014the Research and Analysis Wing, India\u2019s intelligence agency\u2014worked closely for many years before diplomatic relations began in 1992. Israel played a key role in helping India win its war with Pakistan in 1999, with its supply of Searcher-1 drones. These enabled India to detect, and destroy by air, Pakistani troops entrenched in mountain fastnesses.India has reciprocated diplomatically, particularly since the election of Mr. Modi\u2019s nationalist BJP government in 2014. New Delhi has abstained in recent United Nations resolutions critical of Israel, remarkable for a nation that has had a near-perfect record of anti-Israeli voting at the U.N. There is every indication, now, that these abstentions will turn into votes in Israel\u2019s favor.The Israelis see Mr. Modi\u2019s BJP as an Indian version of the Likud Party, and they are not wrong. The parties and their leaders share a determination to yield nothing to Islamist terrorism. The uninhibited warmth between the two prime ministers has been on full display on Mr. Modi\u2019s visit\u2014as of this writing, the two men have embraced each other five times in 24 hours. A new fast-growing breed of chrysanthemum was unveiled by Israeli agronomists. Its name? The Modi.The florid stuff aside, this visit marks a diplomatic coming of age for India and Israel: India because it has now shed the last of its dead skin of nonalignment. Remarkably, India is the only major power that can claim to have excellent relations with every country in the Middle East.With the global surplus in oil and gas, India no longer fears an Arab backlash to its embrace of Israel. After the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Saudis had ordered India to shut down Israel\u2019s Consulate in Bombay or face a cutoff of oil.       Indira Gandhi       refused, and the country had to resort to a deal with the shah\u2019s Iran that involved paying huge sums into a slush fund for a senior member of the shah\u2019s household.The present Indian government is\u2014to put it delicately\u2014less mindful of the Indian Muslim vote-bank than its Congress Party predecessors were. There is still leftist Indian opposition to Israel, but these are irrelevant groups that also reject the strengthening of ties with the U.S.This is also a defining moment for Israel, and there is a reason why Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s entire cabinet turned out to welcome Mr. Modi at the Tel Aviv airport on July 4. The world\u2019s biggest democracy is now unabashedly, unequivocally in Israel\u2019s corner. Israel\u2019s ties with India, unlike with China, aren\u2019t purely transactional. Messrs. Modi and Netanyahu have formally acknowledged a civilizational bond between two peoples that share many of the same values and all of the same fears.

They never mention those who lose jobs because the ACA remains.The ACA includes a penalty on employers that fail to provide \u201cadequate\u201d insurance for full-time workers. Thanks to the ACA, hiring the 50th full-time employee effectively costs another $70,000 a year on top of the normal salary and benefits.Many business owners have described how this penalty prevents them from hiring and has caused them to reduce work hours to below the full-time threshold. ACA supporters dismiss these statements as \u201cmere anecdotes\u201d not corroborated by national sampling and statistical analysis. But did any of them rush out to gather the national samples, especially after Jan. 1, 2016, when the employer penalty took full effect?In partnership with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, in March 2017 I was able to commission Hanover Research to survey small businesses nationwide regarding their hiring and compensation practices. The result was a sample of 745 small businesses, representing every major industry and together employing almost 50,000 people.We asked managers (almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans) how many people each business employed and whether it offers health insurance. Many businesses, when they do not offer coverage, keep their payrolls just below 50 full-time employees and thereby narrowly escape the ACA\u2019s penalty. This pattern is not visible among businesses that offer coverage.When we followed up, the businesses employing just fewer than 50 often said the ACA caused them to hire less and cut hours below the full-time threshold. The penalty caused payrolls to shrink or prevented them from growing.Nationwide, we estimate the ACA-inspired practice of keeping payrolls below 50 has cost roughly 250,000 jobs. This does not count jobs lost when businesses close (we didn\u2019t survey closed businesses) or shrink because of other ACA incentives.The tally of lost jobs is bound to grow because the penalty itself automatically grows and the IRS is still learning how to enforce it. And the businesses we surveyed disproportionately say that they reduce hiring and hours for new employees rather than existing employees. They may continue to shrink until their payrolls are fully turned over.Does the ACA at least spur small business to offer coverage? About a third of those now offering coverage began doing so after the ACA was passed. But two-thirds of those now not offering coverage previously did offer it. Some of the managers said the exchanges are a new option and that offering coverage at work would render employees and their families ineligible for taxpayer assistance.No doubt a few of the 250,000 lost jobs are replaced at businesses that weren\u2019t seeking to duck the 50-employee threshold. But even reallocated jobs are a problem, because the reallocation is motivated by uneven federal incentives unrelated to creating value in the marketplace.The ACA is an important reason why the growth rates of employment, wages, productivity and GDP continue to be substandard. Maybe it is time for repeal.Mr. Mulligan is author of \u201cSide Effects: Economic Consequences of Health-Care Reform.\u201dAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'How Many Jobs Does the ACA Kill?.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-jobs-does-obamacare-kill-1499296604", "news_title": "How Many Jobs Does ObamaCare Kill?", "keywords": "affordable care act,health care,jobs,obamacare,trump,unemployment,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,employee benefits,lay-offs,redundancies,small,medium businesses,workers pay,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Three decades ago,       Ronald Reagan       worked with Congress to give the U.S. a modern, competitive and pro-investment tax system that set the stage for more than a decade of economic growth. Tax shelters disappeared at the stroke of the president\u2019s pen. Rates were cut, deductions were trimmed and a slew of special breaks were abolished. As Australia\u2019s Prime Minister       Malcolm Fraser       put it at the time: \u201cA young man just starting out here might not move to Hong Kong in search of lower tax rates, but he might well go to the U.S.\u201dTwo years earlier, in 1984, British Prime Minister       Margaret Thatcher       significantly cut corporate tax rates, and the world only yawned. When the U.S. acted in 1986, it launched something akin to a gold rush. \u201cEuropean countries are affected by Washington\u2019s tax competition more than by competition among their continental neighbors,\u201d             UniCredit                   noted in a February 2017 report, recalling the Reagan tax reform. In the three decades since, other nations have followed the U.S. lead, competing to lower their corporate rates while broadening their tax bases.But Washington has forgotten the lesson it taught the rest of the world. As the U.K., Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands, Hungary and other democracies made their tax systems friendlier to investment, the U.S. went the opposite direction. As they flattened tax rates and eliminated deductions, America tossed aside the 1986 reform and succumbed to public-policy meddling.Repeated political machinations created a bewildering tax system\u2014a jumble of brackets, rising rates and special deductions, with exemptions and exclusions for everything from the production of sugar cane to the destruction of obsolete equipment. More than 5,900 changes have been made to the tax code since 2001, according to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s taxpayer advocate.In contrast, the British cut their corporate tax rate from 28% in 2010 to 20% today. As if on cue, government economists predicted that tax receipts would drop. Instead, corporate tax revenue has increased 28% since 2012, according to a March report by the Centre for Policy Studies.Canada\u2019s federal corporate tax rate is only 15%. It applies exclusively to revenue earned inside the country, instead of around the world, as the U.S. tax does. This is a major reason why Burger King is now a Canadian company.Americans started this tax revolution 30 years ago, and it\u2019s time they got back in the competition. Taxpayers in the U.S. deserve a much less complicated personal and corporate code, one that does not favor the well-connected and that unshackles the economy to grow again.Governments levy taxes to raise revenue, but politicians also use the tax code for social engineering\u2014to redistribute income, encourage saving, and reward or penalize certain behavior. The temptation to favor certain constituents and choices seems almost irresistible to America\u2019s elected representatives.For example, the corporate code allows businesses to deduct interest expenses, favoring debt financing over equity. But why should the government, not known for its skill in picking winners and losers, be trusted to create such incentives? Better to let the markets decide.Moreover, all this complexity imposes huge societal costs. Last year individuals and businesses spent $409 billion and nearly nine billion hours on tax compliance, according to the Tax Foundation.A tax code littered with exceptions for politically favored interests also breeds a well-justified cynicism\u2014an insidious cost that\u2019s difficult to quantify. A November 2016 Reuters poll found that 72% of Americans believe the \u201ceconomy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue that they\u2019re wrong.In 1986, after Reagan\u2019s reforms went through, Canada\u2019s assistant deputy minister of finance,       Peter Daniel,        called his country to action. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re concerned about companies and individuals moving to the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do what we have to do to remain competitive.\u2019\u2019Lower tax rates do not guarantee economic growth, but they help. Simplicity would get the U.S. closer to efficiency and fairness. It would also keep America ahead of the international competition, allowing the U.S. to once again serve as a model for the world to emulate.Ms. Ketterer is co-founder and CEO of Los Angeles-based Causeway Capital Management.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 19:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-once-led-the-world-on-tax-reform-1499296536", "news_title": "America Once Led the World on Tax Reform", "keywords": "1986,reagan,tax reform,thatcher,trump,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "\u2018The future is already here\u2014it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed.\u201d The aphorism coined by novelist       William Gibson       explains why       Andrew McAfee       and       Erik Brynjolfsson\u2019s       tour of the technologies that are shaping the future of business, \u201cMachine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future,\u201d contains sights that are already familiar and others that are not. This is a book for managers whose companies sit well back from the edge and who would like a digestible introduction to technology trends that may not have reached their doorstep\u2014yet.The authors are well-qualified in futurology. Mr. McAfee is a research scientist and Mr. Brynjolfsson a professor of information technology, both at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The pair\u2019s last book, \u201cThe Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies\u201d (2014), surveyed the \u201castonishing progress\u201d of digital technologies\u2014hardware, software, networks\u2014and, as they put it in one chapter title, \u201cThe Digitization of Just About Everything.\u201dThe authors define the first machine age as the Industrial Revolution, made possible by a much improved steam engine invented by       James Watt       in the late 18th century. The second machine age began more than half a century ago, when businesses first deployed computers to handle routine information processing. Machine power began to replace brain functionality as it had earlier replaced human and animal muscles. But just as the Industrial Revolution did not begin with the crude, pre-Watt steam engines, the transformative effects of computers did not begin at their first appearance. The big effects came only with recent, and now accelerating, technological improvements. The authors call this the second phase of the second machine age, when computers go beyond handling the routine and increasingly provide decision making whose quality exceeds that of humans.By Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson  Norton, 402 pages, $28.95\u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d presciently captured the bleeding edge of technology. For their new book, the authors have repackaged much of the same material on \u201cthe digitization of just about everything\u201d into a primer written expressly for business decision makers. Each chapter ends with a list of bullet points and discussion questions, suitable for internal company planning sessions. The book\u2019s title, stripped of plurals, articles and on the dust jacket even commas\u2014\u201cMachine Platform Crowd\u201d\u2014is so concise as to risk being unintelligible.In the authors\u2019 terminology, \u201cMachine\u201d is shorthand for computers running software that, with new AI techniques called \u201cdeep learning,\u201d essentially teaches itself how to make judgments superior to those of humans. \u201cMachine\u201d also encompasses the disappearance of employees in the services sector, leaving only the customer, robots and software\u2014what the authors refer to as \u201cvirtualization.\u201d \u201cPlatform\u201d refers to digital environments that bring economic actors together, exploiting free, or nearly free, online access, reproduction and distribution. Uber and Airbnb are examples of new platforms. \u201cCrowd\u201d refers to information resources created by the uncredentialed, the nonexpert and, with rare exceptions, the unpaid. Wikipedia and the Linux operating system comprise the two most impressive achievements of the crowd.\u200bMessrs. McAfee and Brynjolfsson argue that, in the latest phase of the second machine age, incumbent businesses will be pushed aside if they fail to understand how new machines and software, platforms, and the crowd enlarge the scope of digital technologies\u2014just as manufacturers that had appeared and thrived in the first phase of the first machine age were displaced when electricity supplanted steam power in the early 20th century.\u200bThe disruptive power of digital technologies is widely appreciated at this point, however. In the authors\u2019 own reporting we see not only start-ups at work in putting digital technologies to novel uses but also stalwarts that came of age in analogue times. General Electric used an online design competition run by FirstBuild for a new countertop ice maker it was considering developing, then gauged market interest by running a crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo. McDonald\u2019s has embarked on virtualization, installing self-service ordering and payment stations that will soon be placed in all 14,000 of its American restaurants.The book\u2019s last section, on the crowd, covers bad behavior on the part of the online crowd so briefly that a reader who blinks will miss it. But then comes the book\u2019s strongest segment. In the penultimate chapter, the authors present a splendid tutorial on things that are too new for most civilians to have gained a good understanding of\u2014cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts. The authors present the theoretical possibility that conventional contracts and the human handling of disputes could be rendered obsolete by dense networks of sensors in the physical world and extremely detailed contracts anticipating all contingencies so that machines alone can handle enforcement. But they show that computing power, however much it grows, seems unlikely to replace the human component for dispute resolution.\u200bAt the end of their tour, the authors back away from the excited tone that permeates the preceding 300 pages. \u201cThe company of the future will actually be pretty boring,\u201d they write\u2014the institution of the firm will not be pushed into the dustbin of history. They even see a future for middle managers, not because their knowledge or decision-making acuity will match the machine\u2019s\u2014it won\u2019t\u2014but because \u201cwe\u2019re much more swayed by a good story or compelling anecdote than we are by a table full of statistically significant results.\u201d\u200b\u201cMachine, Platform, Crowd\u201d is not the first book to speak of the seismic impact of the digital revolution on economic life. It\u2019s not even Messrs. McAfee and Brynjolfsson\u2019s first book to clang the bell.

Ted Cruz (R., Texas) to let insurers that sell plans that conform to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations also sell policies that don\u2019t.The idea, also backed by Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), would allow insurers to offer cheaper, less-comprehensive policies, likely to be bought by healthier people. Those policies could charge higher prices to those with pre-existing medical conditions, and possibly deny them coverage altogether.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) asked the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to analyze the Cruz provision\u2019s impact on the federal budget and on insurance coverage, according to Senate GOP aides\u2014a sign Senate leaders are genuinely contemplating it.The action unfolded as Mr. McConnell continued to reach out to various senators while Congress is on recess. Mr. McConnell was forced to delay a vote before the recess amid defections from both conservatives and centrists. He is working to assemble a revised version the Senate can consider shortly after it returns to Washington.The majority leader still wants a bill to modify and replace the ACA, despite calls from President       Donald Trump       to pursue a full repeal first and work on a replacement later. Tweaks to the original Senate bill are likely to include more funding for opioid addiction treatment and possibly beefed-up funding for tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance.The Cruz proposal likely would lower premiums for some consumers, a priority of Senate conservatives, and could help bring some of them on board. Sens. Cruz and Lee are among four conservative senators who rejected the initial version of Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill, saying it did too little to uproot the ACA and lower premiums.The Cruz idea also is getting a warm reception from influential GOP House conservatives, including Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s a good amendment,\u201d Mr. Jordan said in a brief interview. \u201cIf that goes in, that\u2019s a great move.\u201dStill, Mr. McConnell\u2019s challenge has always been that moves aimed at enticing conservatives could alienate centrists, and vice versa. The Cruz proposal puts GOP Senators who pledged to preserve protections for people with pre-existing conditions in a precarious position.Health analysts said the amendment would cause premiums for that demographic to jump, resurrecting a thorny political issue that drew national attention earlier this year when House Republicans added a similar measure to their bill, known as the MacArthur amendment.\u201cIf this were adopted, premiums would skyrocket for people who need comprehensive coverage,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.Mr. Cruz\u2019s office, asked for comment Wednesday, referred to an interview he gave a Dallas-based radio station. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to lower premiums, and the way you lower premiums is you give the consumers freedom to choose the health insurance plan that they want without the government mandates,\u201d Mr. Cruz told WBAP.The measure started gaining traction in the Senate last week when Mr. McConnell scrapped a planned vote because nine GOP Senators said they couldn\u2019t support the legislation. Mr. McConnell can only lose two GOP votes for the bill to pass, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking any tie, since no Democrats are likely to support the Republican effort.A vote on a revamped Senate GOP health bill to knock down large parts of the ACA could be held in mid- or late July, said people familiar with the matter.Outside conservative groups such as Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, which are pushing for a full repeal of the ACA, also called Obamacare, say the Cruz measure would get them at least a step closer to their goal.\u201cIf Senate Republicans insist on tweaking Obamacare, we urge them to adopt language being pushed by Sens. Cruz and Lee that will provide consumers with more choice and truly affordable health insurance coverage,\u201d FreedomWorks President       Adam Brandon       said in a statement Wednesday.The House would have to approve any bill the Senate passes for it to become law, and conservative House Republicans who almost foiled the party\u2019s effort to pass a bill in May also say the Cruz provisions could be essential to getting their support.\u201cIf the MacArthur amendment is not in there, the Cruz amendment is not in there, or an amendment that is similar to those that drives down premiums, you lose substantial votes in the House on the conservative side of things, which makes it almost impossible to pass,\u201d said Mr. Meadows, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen conservative House Republicans.The MacArthur amendment, sponsored by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.), would let states get waivers to opt out of ACA requirements. The idea of both the Cruz and MacArthur initiatives is to let people buy more-limited, cheaper insurance policies if they prefer, a reversal of the ACA\u2019s approach of requiring insurers to provide more robust plans.The White House also has backed Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal.\u201cThis is similar to efforts that transpired in the House, and we think it\u2019s perfectly appropriate,\u201d White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cAnd so we hope it\u2019s part of the process and bringing everybody together.\u201dThe text of the Cruz provision hasn\u2019t been released, but it would lower premiums for some by allowing skimpier health plans typically not permitted by the ACA. People who buy their own insurance, rather than getting it through work, could get tax credits that further reduce their payments. That is enticing to many Republicans who criticized the initial Senate bill as not doing enough to bring down costs.Younger, healthier people would be more likely to buy these more-limited plans because they may not need comprehensive benefits, health analysts said. Older people and those with pre-existing conditions would be more likely to seek out the plans that meet the ACA requirement of covering 10 mandated benefits, such as mental-health services and maternity care.Such a bifurcation likely would mean increased costs for comprehensive plans, analysts said. People receiving the bill\u2019s tax credits would be buffered from the price increases, but those who earn 350% of the poverty level and wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the credits would pay more, they said. Middle-income earners with pre-existing conditions would be the hardest hit.\u201cWhen it gets to crunchtime on these health bills, the discussion comes down to getting premiums down,\u201d said       Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cAnd that comes down to relaxing rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dDoug Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and an adviser to       John McCain\u2019s       2008 presidential campaign, said he supports policies that would allow insurers to offer a variety of plans. But, he said, segregating those plans from ones that comply with ACA requirements would drain the ACA marketplaces of young, healthy customers, driving up costs for sicker patients.\u201cThe exchanges are a mess already, and this wouldn\u2019t do anything to stabilize them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might even make it worse.\u201dMr. Lee said Sunday that he didn\u2019t expect the Senate bill to leave those with pre-existing conditions worse off than under current law, and that healthier people would see their costs go down.\u201cFor those who were underneath the 350% of federal poverty level line, those people would see their subsidies go up\u2026and so we think those people would be essentially held harmless,\u201d Mr. Lee said on CBS. \u201cAnd we would see other people, other people who would avail themselves of free market forces, being able to unite with an insurance company wanting to sell them a policy that they want to buy and a policy they could afford.\u201d\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Cruz\u2019s Plan to Save Health Bill Gets Closer Look.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 18:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ted-cruzs-plan-to-save-republican-health-care-bill-gains-traction-1499294541", "news_title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Plan to Save Republican Health-Care Bill Gains Traction ", "keywords": "gop heatlh plan,health bill,health care overhaul,health care reform,macarthur amendment,obamacare,pre-existing conditions,premiums,ted cruz health proposal,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "Hotels, cruise lines and casinos are some of the best-performing stocks in the U.S. so far this year, reflecting solid demand for travel and leisure despite industry concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s policies could hurt foreign tourism.Wynn Resorts Ltd. was one of the top five best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 so far this year, rising 53% through Wednesday. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Wyndham Worldwide Corp., a hospitality-service company, were among the index\u2019s 35 best performers. A group of 11 hotel, restaurant and leisure stocks in the S&P 500 has risen 19% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 and its broad consumer-discretionary sector.Some travel organizations, including the World Travel & Tourism Council and travel consultant ForwardKeys, have said that they expected some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to damp appetite for tourism to the U.S.The administration started to implement its temporary travel ban that affects visitors from six Muslim-majority nations last week and has pushed to restrict some visas and issued new security measures for airlines flying to the U.S.\u201cWe are watching it like a hawk,\u201d said             Marriott International Inc.       Chief Executive       Arne Sorensen,        when asked at an analyst meeting in March about travel challenges relating to the travel ban, currency difficulties and nationalist sentiment in the U.S. and abroad. \u201cTo state the obvious, the language around these issues and the sentiment around these issues is not a positive thing.\u201dMr. Sorensen is one of several executives who have publicly voiced concerns that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies could hurt the travel industry.So far, some analysts say that anxiety hasn\u2019t hurt their shares. Travel and leisure shares are benefiting from improved consumer confidence and tourism-related spending, making them attractive investment alternatives compared with other stocks in the consumer-discretionary sector, they say. The S&P 500 grouping also includes traditional retailers, many of which have been hammered by lower foot traffic and internet competition from e-commerce giants like             Amazon.com Inc.\u201cConsumer-discretionary money needs to be invested somewhere, and the gaming and lodging spaces have benefited from some of the Amazon-driven disruption in some of the other subsectors,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst       Carlo Santarelli       said.The U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that international travel to the U.S. grew in May compared with the same month a year earlier, after also posting a year-over-year increase in April. Domestic travel also rose in May, the association said.As of May, spending on hotels, leisure and travel has increased every month except for two since the start of 2015 compared with a year earlier, according to             First Data Corp.       Sales data from a database that includes four million merchant locations across the U.S. show monthly travel expenditures increased almost 6% on average year over year, hotel expenditures rose 4.4% and leisure spending increased 2.8% over that period.Aside from leisure-linked shares in the consumer-discretionary sector, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at retail or restaurants, where every day, same-store sales are down,\u201d and store closures and fears of competitive encroachment weigh on investors, said       Rachael Rothman,        a Susquehanna Financial Group analyst who covers hotels, casinos and cruise companies.Meanwhile, casinos are benefiting from strength in Macau, Las Vegas and regional gambling, Telsey Advisory Group senior equity analyst David Katz said.Macau monthly gambling revenue has increased every month from a year earlier since August 2016, according to the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That follows 26 months of declines as Chinese President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       administration cracked down on corruption.Steve Wynn,        chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts, said on Wynn\u2019s most recent earnings call in late April that the crackdown hurt the company briefly, but that expected patterns of spending were resuming.\u201cPeople are settling back into routines that they\u2019re comfortable with, and that includes going to Macau and buying a new car or shopping at Louis Vuitton,\u201d Mr. Wynn said.Wall Street analysts expect Wynn\u2019s earnings per share to grow by more than 40% from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, according to FactSet.Some analysts said valuations make certain travel and leisure stocks attractive compared with other parts of the market. Amazon.com was trading at about 183 times its past 12 months of earnings Wednesday, according to FactSet, compared with about 50 for Wynn and roughly 17 for Wyndham and Royal Caribbean. The broader S&P 500 was trading at around 21.8 times its past 12 months of earnings on Monday.However, some said the stocks could be susceptible to a pullback, especially given how far up they have run. The University of Michigan\u2019s index of consumer sentiment has fallen slightly since hitting a 10-year high in January. And even though Macau gaming revenue increased more than 25% in June compared with the same month a year earlier, that increase fell short of analyst expectations. Wynn\u2019s stock fell $3.11, or 2.3%, Monday.Corrections & Amplifications   Wall Street analysts expect Wynn\u2019s earnings per share to grow by more than 40% from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, according to FactSet.

Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, Ben Brafman, said he was \u201cethically obligated\u201d as a lawyer to seek a resolution, but that his client wasn\u2019t interested in a plea.Mr. Shkreli, 34 years old, is on trial facing charges of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud stemming from his management of two hedge funds and a publicly traded pharmaceutical company. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.In a motion for a gag order filed Monday, prosecutors cited the activity of a             Twitter                   account that appeared to be run by Mr. Shkreli, as well as an unsupervised visit Mr. Shkreli made Friday to an overflow viewing room in the courthouse, where he spoke with reporters about witnesses and evidence presented at the trial so far.In that visit, Mr. Shkreli brushed off questions about possible plea discussions.On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mr. Shkreli\u2019s reported comments, noting that \u201cany juror could have been there.\u201d But the judge opted not to partially sequester the jury, a measure prosecutors had requested to prevent them from inadvertently hearing about the case from Mr. Shkreli.In court, Mr. Brafman said his client\u2019s surprise conversation in the overflow room was \u201cill-advised,\u201d and pledged it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Mr. Brafman agreed to the terms laid out by Judge Matsumoto, barring Mr. Shkreli from speaking in the courthouse or in the area surrounding the courthouse.But Mr. Brafman also said that Mr. Shkreli was suffering from anxiety, made worse by the \u201conslaught of the press\u201d covering the trial. In a written response on Monday, Mr. Brafman said Mr. Shkreli was defending himself from what \u201che perceives to be highly prejudicial, one-sided coverage\u201d of the trial.Mr. Brafman didn\u2019t address the government\u2019s claim that Mr. Shkreli\u2014who has been banned from Twitter\u2014was using a new account, with the handle @BLMBro, to address his supporters and taunt reporters and witnesses. The account had been suspended as of Wednesday morning.While the charges against Mr. Shkreli aren\u2019t related to his most notorious actions\u2014jacking up the price of a drug used to treat AIDS patients and spending $2 million on a Wu-Tang Clan album\u2014his public persona has informed nearly every aspect of the trial, from jury selection to the first witnesses.Prosecutors said in Monday\u2019s filing that Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cactive and deeply divisive media presence\u201d was partly why it took nearly three days to select a jury for the trial. At least two dozen prospective jurors, from a pool of more than 300, said they couldn\u2019t be impartial about Mr. Shkreli.Mr. Brafman has repeatedly expressed dismay about the coverage of the case. Last Tuesday, after one day of jury selection, Mr. Brafman asked for a mistrial, citing a New York Post cover that featured a photo of Mr. Shkreli and an unflattering headline. The mistrial motion was denied.Also that day, Mr. Shkreli claimed on his             Facebook                   page that, for $12 apiece, he had bought the domain names for a CNBC reporter and for the reporter who had written the Post article and was selling them to raise money for his debut rap album. The Twitter account @BLMBro tweeted a similar message.The @BLMBro account also retweeted statements that prosecutors said aimed to undermine the credibility of witnesses and reporters covering the trial.During the trial\u2019s lunch break on Friday, an unaccompanied Mr. Shkreli entered a second courtroom that had been set up with a live feed of the trial for reporters and spectators. Speaking with several reporters, Mr. Shkreli commented on the government\u2019s evidence and witnesses, before Mr. Brafman came to retrieve him.Later, outside the courthouse, Mr. Brafman said \u201cI would very much appreciate it if he did not talk to the press because sometimes he doesn\u2019t have a filter.\u201dThe trial resumed Wednesday morning with testimony from the government\u2019s third and fourth witnesses.Corrections & Amplifications   The securities-fraud trial of Martin Shkreli began on June 26.

The other drugs used in the studies are             Celgene Corp.\u2019s       Pomalyst and Revlimid.An FDA spokeswoman couldn\u2019t immediately be reached to comment.Merck said all patients in two of the studies and a portion of those in a third study will stop receiving Keytruda. Other studies of Keytruda will continue, including among multiple myeloma patients, Merck said.Merck is conducting more than 400 clinical trials to test new uses for Keytruda, which is already FDA-approved to treat multiple cancer types including those of the skin and lungs. The drug, introduced in the U.S. in 2014, works by harnessing the body\u2019s immune system to attack tumors.Merck first disclosed the increased patient death rate last month, saying it had paused enrollment for new patients in two of the multiple myeloma studies, based on a recommendation by an external committee monitoring the safety of patients. At that time, Merck said it would allow patients already enrolled in those studies to continue receiving Keytruda.The third study affected by the FDA suspension tested Keytruda in combination with a variety of older drugs to treat multiple myeloma. A subset of patients receiving Keytruda in combination with Revlimid and another drug, dexamethasone, will discontinue Keytruda treatment, but Keytruda\u2019s use among other patients in the study will continue.A Merck spokeswoman said the company had no further details about the patient deaths in the studies.Keytruda had sales of $1.4 billion in 2016, which are expected to grow this year as the drug has been approved for additional uses, including to treat any tumor with a certain genetic mutation.Merck shares fell 1% to $63.50 in after-hours trading after it announced the FDA action.

He was also chairman of Marsh & McLennan\u2019s risk and insurance-services operation. Current Marsh President       John Doyle       will take Mr. Zaffino\u2019s spot as CEO.Mr. Duperreault was CEO of Marsh & McLennan from 2008 to 2012.Mr. Zaffino\u2019s selection was\u00a0first\u00a0reported by\u00a0trade publication\u00a0Insurance Insider.Mr. Zaffino is expected to become a key part of a team tasked with\u00a0improving AIG\u2019s profit margins after years in which the company has trailed many peers.

A U.S. government bailout required it to sell off some prized businesses to fully repay nearly $185 billion provided by taxpayers.Mr. Duperreault was named to the top job after a profit-improvement plan championed by the previous AIG chief executive,       Peter Hancock,        fell behind schedule.Some activist investors\u2014including       Carl Icahn,        who has a representative on AIG\u2019s board\u2014last year called for the insurance conglomerate to improve its results by splitting itself apart. But those investors have given AIG some leeway to improve returns using other methods.Mr. Hancock\u2019s strategy was to eliminate, or shrink, lines of business that didn\u2019t meet profit-margin targets, cut costs and return $25 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.Thus\u00a0far Mr. Duperreault has said he is open to slowing down the firm\u2019s share buybacks and instead using the capital for acquisitions.

Nvidia was among the 10 biggest gainers, adding 3.72, or 2.7%, to 143.05.The tech sector is expected to help lead second-quarter earnings growth in the S&P 500, according to FactSet, but some investors and analysts are concerned that the group\u2019s outperformance has left it susceptible to a selloff.With investors piling into and out of some of the biggest tech stocks recently, they will likely continue favoring companies with good cash flow, said Laurie Kamhi, managing director and partner of LCK Wealth Management at HighTower.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge disparity in the winners and losers,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, energy shares slid as oil prices tumbled anew.The energy sector was the S&P 500\u2019s worst performer, falling 1.3%. U.S. crude for August delivery fell 4.1% to $45.13 a barrel to end an eight-session winning streak\u2014its longest since 2010. Oil entered into a bear market June 20 amid oversupply concerns, before prices rallied at the end of the month.\u201cI\u2019ve been a long-term believer of the view, \u2018Sell rallies in oil,\u2019\u201d said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cThis is just another instance of that. The overall supply dynamic is still not solved,\u201d he said.Falling oil prices helped support bonds and other haven assets, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.334% from 2.352% Monday. Yields fall as prices rise.Market reaction was muted to the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes from its June meeting, which showed officials readying plans to start gradually shrinking the central bank\u2019s balance sheet in coming months. Some investors and analysts said the minutes weren\u2019t surprising after a number of global central banks struck a more hawkish tone last week.\u201cMarkets seem to have an understanding of where the Fed\u2019s mind is today, and nothing has altered that path as of yet,\u201d said Mr. Thooft.Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 and Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.2%.Write to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'S&P Climbs as Technology Rebounds.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 17:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-lower-due-to-north-korea-worries-1499222811", "news_title": "S&P Rises on Rebound in Technology Shares", "keywords": "asia markets , brent crude oil ,china stocks,europe markets, europe shares,federal reserve, federal reserve interest rates,fed policy change,global forex markets ,global markets ,global stock markets ,janet yellen,north korea , oil prices, u.s. futures,Micron Technology,MU,Semiconductor Industry Association,Advanced Micro Devices,AMD,S&P 500,S&P,gxc,German government,Iberdrola,IBE.MC,ES:IBE,Baidu,BIDU,NVIDIA,NVDA,Nathan Thooft,Alan Wilson,Laurie Kamhi,Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9,financial performance,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,equity markets,money,currency markets,money markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,main stock market commentary,stock market commentary,semiconductors,banking,central banking,credit,financial services,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "New Jersey officials approved starting Jersey City\u2019s transition to full control of its schools on Wednesday, making it the first district statewide to regain autonomy after a takeover due to academic failure.In 1989, Jersey City became the first of four urban districts to be taken over under a new state law allowing such intervention in dysfunctional systems. At the time, state officials said the district was so rife with nepotism, patronage and academic problems that children were deprived of their right to an education.The New Jersey Board of Education passed a resolution Wednesday saying the district had made enough progress in improving its instruction that state intervention could be withdrawn.

This may have been true in the distant past when the bloc adopted a Fortress Europe approach to trade with the rest of the world. But it hasn\u2019t been true for at least the last 30 years. The EU emerged as one of the principle architects of the Uruguay round of global trade liberalization completed in 1994, and since then, the EU has been a leading advocate for trade liberalization. Its average tariff is around 3%, with low tariffs on almost everything except agricultural products\u2014a point Brexiters implicitly acknowledge when they insist that the U.K. has nothing to fear from trading with the EU from outside the bloc.The idea that the EU is a protectionist club will look even wider of the mark when\u2014if all goes to plan\u2014European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       and Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       confirm at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday that the EU and Japan have reached a political agreement on a long-awaited free-trade deal.The EU is often criticized for its failure to secure more bilateral free-trade deals, a reflection of the undoubted difficulty of reaching agreements that satisfy 28 member states. But the flip side is that those deals it has concluded have by necessity been highly ambitious and yielded substantial benefits. This one, if completed, would follow hard on the heels of last year\u2019s comprehensive EU-Canada free-trade deal and the earlier EU-Korea free-trade agreement, which in its first five years boosted EU exports to South Korea by 55%, opening up huge opportunities with the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.Nor should the symbolic timing of this meeting\u2014on the eve of the G-20 summit in Hamburg\u2014be overlooked. Over the past five years there have been many times when the Japan-EU deal seemed to be going nowhere: Overcoming the vested interests opposed to opening up access to the European car market and the Japanese food market appeared just too difficult.But the combination of Brexit and the election of       Donald Trump       has injected new urgency into the negotiations. For Japan, they present an opportunity to reinvigorate its trade policy following Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. For the EU, the talks are an opportunity to reassert the bloc\u2019s commitment to free trade ahead of a meeting at which one of the major points of discussion is likely to be rising U.S. protectionism.In reality, protectionism has been on the rise long before the political upheavals of 2016\u2014and not just in the U.S. True, in the nine years since the G-20 committed itself to resisting protectionism, there has been no repeat of the disastrous tit-for-tat tariff hikes that followed the passing of the notorious Smoot-Hawley Act in the U.S. in 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression. But other forms of trade discrimination\u2014typically tax breaks for exports and other policies designed to help firms steal foreign market share\u2014are rife, according to the latest Global Trade Alert, complied by       Simon Evenett,        a professor at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. It finds that 73.5% of G-20 exports face some type of distortion in foreign markets.The U.S. emerges from this study as the worst offender even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election: It has introduced nearly 1,250 protectionist measure since November 2008, far above second-ranked India at just under 750. But since the start of the year, the pace of U.S. protectionism has picked up noticeably with 189 discriminatory measures introduced there compared with just 93 that liberalize trade.The EU emerges from the study in a better light: Since 2008, it has cut more tariffs than it has raised and EU member states have introduced fewer discriminatory policies, perhaps reflecting the bloc\u2019s strict state-aid rules.Of course, the EU is hardly immune to protectionist pressures. Yet so far, it has been able to resist them. When it overhauled its anti-dumping regime earlier this year, the bloc resisted pressure from some member states to match higher U.S. retaliatory tariffs against subsidized Chinese steel. At the same time, a proposal to restrict foreign-owned companies from bidding from public procurement contracts, first proposed in 2013, remains stalled in the European Council. Last month, member states reacted coolly to a proposal from French President       Emmanuel Macron       that the EU give itself greater powers to block foreign investment in strategic sectors.Nonetheless, the EU\u2019s newfound status as the global leader in free trade is sure to be further tested. Plenty of hard bargaining lies ahead before a Japan-EU trade deal is formally signed, ratified and applied.\u00a0While the European Commission is increasingly confident that it will reach political agreements this year on trade deals with the Mercosur bloc of South America and Mexico and will start trade talks with Australia and New Zealand, nothing is guaranteed.And with Mr. Trump threatening to rip up existing trade deals and Brexit-supporting politicians openly citing greater freedom to use state aid as a supposed benefit of pulling out of the world\u2019s deepest free-trade agreement, the prospect of a modern-day Smoot-Hawley moment can\u2019t be ruled out. But it won\u2019t be the EU that triggers it.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 17:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-resists-protectionism-better-than-most-1499290638", "news_title": "EU Resists Protectionism Better Than Most ", "keywords": " eu-japan free trade deal, eu trade policy,protectionism, trade liberalization,European Union,Donald Trump,Shinzo Abe,Jean-Claude Juncker,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "When Rev. Charles Boyer asks his African-American parishioners at the Bethel AME Church in Woodbury, N.J., if they know someone in prison, a majority of hands go up.Black neighborhoods in this blue-collar town and others across the country have been disproportionately scarred by the number of African-Americans serving long, mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses. In New Jersey, blacks make up 61% of the prison population but only 14% of the state\u2019s residents, according to figures from the state legislature.A bill that is now in the hands of Gov.       Chris Christie       would make New Jersey the fourth state in the country to require lawmakers to consider a \u201cracial impact statement\u201d before approving any criminal justice system legislation.The movement toward racial impact statements is emerging as another front in the long-running debate on the intersection of race and criminal justice, a debate that has intensified in recent years partly due to a series of police shootings of black men that were captured on video.Supporters of the bill like Rev. Boyer say the Republican governor\u2019s signature would reinforce one of the strengths of his record\u2014an innovative approach to criminal justice\u2014at time when his poll ratings are among the worst of any governor in the nation and New Jersey is just getting past a recent budget impasse that shut the state government for three days. Opponents contend that sentencing laws should be written without consideration of race.Mr. Christie has made combating the state\u2019s drug addiction crisis a signature issue, backing laws that expand alternatives to prison for drug offenders, require insurers to cover six months of addiction treatment, and overhaul the state\u2019s bail system so poor people aren\u2019t unnecessarily behind bars. The governor was tapped by President       Donald Trump       this year to lead a national commission to combat opioid addiction.\u201cGov. Christie sees himself as a forward thinker on criminal justice reform,\u201d Rev. Boyer said. \u201cI know he agrees that the war on drugs has been horrible for people of color and has a passion around solving the opioid crisis. This bill is an easy for win for him to say he\u2019s on the side of justice.\u201dOpponents of racial impact statements, however, like       Roger Clegg,        president of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, said they distract policy makers from what he says are the root causes of crime in minority communities, particularly higher rates of out-of-wedlock births.\u201cThe whole idea of the civil-rights movement was to get government out of the business of taking race into account,\u201d said Mr. Clegg, a former deputy assistant general in two Republican administrations. \u201cIs government supposed to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to pass this bill because it has a politically incorrect racial result even though it\u2019s a necessary bill?\u2019 \u201dMr. Christie hasn\u2019t taken a public position on the racial impact bill, which faces a July 10 deadline for his signature or veto. A spokesman for the governor said he would review the legislation.The bill received unanimous support in the state Senate and only three no votes in the Assembly, quietly marking the latest victory for the bipartisan movement in state capitols to revamp criminal justice policies. Grappling with costly and crowded prisons, both red and blue states are looking for alternative ways to rehabilitate offenders, particularly those who aren\u2019t violent, without compromising public safety.African-Americans in New Jersey are incarcerated at 12 times the rate of whites, making New Jersey\u2019s racial disparity the worst in the country, according to an analysis of Justice Department data last year by the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that advocates reducing the prison population.New Jersey also ranks at the top of the 16 states that have achieved double-digit rates of decline in their prison populations since reaching peak levels, the group says.The federal government, however, is reversing its course of the past few years as the Trump administration ramps up prosecution of drug and immigration offenses. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argues that charging drug offenders more aggressively will help restore the rule of law and curb increases in violent crime in some cities.Critics accuse Mr. Sessions of reviving a fruitless \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d with its significant financial and social costs. Mr. Christie hasn\u2019t commented publicly on Mr. Sessions\u2019 approach to criminal justice.On average, African-Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at five times the rate of whites across the country, according to the Sentencing Project. Iowa was the first to require racial impact statements in 2008, followed by Connecticut and Oregon. Minnesota lawmakers also use racial impact statements, though they aren\u2019t mandatory.In Arkansas, where African-Americans make up 16% of the state\u2019s residents but 43% of the prison population, a proposal to require racial impact statements for sentencing bills was voted down in March.Bills requiring racial impact statements have also been considered in Florida, Mississippi and Wisconsin, according to criminal justice experts.A study of the Iowa law by the Simpson College Urban Studies Institute found that racial impact statements didn\u2019t appear to positively or negatively impact passage of 16 criminal justice bills between 2009 and 2013. But the researchers predicted that over the next 10 years, racial impact statements could help reduce disparities in incarceration rates.Supporters cite, among other things, laws passed around the country in the 1980s and 1990s, without such racial impact recognition, that increased penalties for drug possession around schools, public housing projects and parks and had a disproportionate negative impact on minority communities.A New Jersey sentencing commission in 2005 found that 96% of the inmates convicted of the harsher penalties under such laws were African-American or Hispanic because urban, minority neighborhoods were disproportionately blanketed by drug-free zones. New Jersey lawmakers eliminated mandatory minimum prison sentences for school-zone offenses in 2009.\u201cWe cannot continue burying our head in the sand and pretend that our laws are being enforced in a way that is race-neutral just because they are written that way,\u201d said Dianna Houenou, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey.Noting that lawmakers often rely on environmental and fiscal impact statements, she added, \u201cThese impact statements only help us make more informed decisions.\u201dAnother example of legislation later found to have far-reaching racial consequences were the tougher penalties for possession of crack than for powder cocaine.

Sessions, federal lawmakers reduced the disparity between in 2010.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com and Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'New Jersey Governor Faces Decision on Racial Impact Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 17:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/racial-impact-bill-in-new-jersey-underscores-national-justice-debate-1499290581", "news_title": "Racial Impact Bill in New Jersey Underscores National Justice Debate", "keywords": "addiction,chris christie,criminal justice,drugs,justice,new jersey,race relations,racial impact,Chris Christie,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick to be the next Federal Bureau of Investigation director is scheduled to appear before Congress next week in what is likely to be a contentious confirmation hearing in light of the president\u2019s much-debated firing of former Director       James Comey       in May.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, announced that       Christopher Wray,        a former top Justice Department official, will appear before his committee on July 12 at 10 a.m. to face questions.Mr. Comey had been overseeing an investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 election when he was removed from his post by Mr. Trump. His firing sparked a political storm that eventually led the Justice Department to appoint       Robert Mueller       as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.Democrats are expected to press Mr. Wray next week about whether he can maintain his independence from Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey testified before Congress that he believed Mr. Trump had pressured him to drop a probe into former national security adviser       Michael Flynn,        something the president has denied.Mr. Comey also said he began writing memos of his meetings with Mr. Trump because he was afraid Mr. Trump would misrepresent what had happened during those sessions.Mr. Wray, 50 years old, served as the associate attorney general in charge of the criminal division from 2003 through 2005 under President       George W. Bush.       A longtime Republican, Mr. Wray entered private practice and has since represented high-profile clients including New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       and Credit Suisse AG.The Trump administration embarked on an involved search process for Mr. Comey\u2019s replacement, initially considering such political figures as Sen.       John Cornyn       (R., Texas) and former Sen.       Joseph Lieberman       (I., Conn.) before settling on Mr. Wray, a more traditional pick.If he is confirmed, Mr. Wray will face the task of reinvigorating an FBI that has lacked a long-term leader since May and has been buffeted by political winds.

Instead, the 4-part bill that opened the week on Monday revealed stages \u201cset\u201d almost exclusively with dancers.The exception here was \u201cAfterEffect\u201d which featured, to mostly pointless effect, an abstract, geometric background designed by       Fran\u00e7oise Gilot.\u201cAfterEffect,\u201d first performed in 2015, is a numbingly busy and incoherent display for a 27-dancer cast by ABT dancer-turned-choreographer       Marcelo Gomes.       Set to Tchaikovsky\u2019s 4-movement \u201cSouvenir de Florence,\u201d the 35-minute ballet reveals the eager efforts of a novice dancemaker strung into what feels like infinite hubbub. The printed program identifies the featured dancers as \u201cThe Man, His Loss and His Hope,\u201d but mostly presents them as more active and athletic members leading the rest of the cast known as \u201cthe community.\u201d On this occasion the three named participants were performed respectively by the confident       James Whiteside,        bright-faced       Misty Copeland,        and a bounding and ebullient       Zhiyao Zhang.       Other talented ABT dancers are due to lead this strung-out activity before the week\u2019s end and all one can do is wish them and their audiences godspeed.Happily, the rest of this bill allowed its various casts to present ballet as a form of theater whose poetic dimensions are revealed by choreography that artfully plumbs Tchaikovsky\u2019s music. The other new work on the program was the company premiere of       Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s       \u201cSouvenir d\u2019un lieu cher\u201d (\u201cMemory of a Dear Place\u201d), and first performed in 2012 by Dutch National Ballet.The 14-minute work is set to two of the three parts (\u201cM\u00e9ditation,\u201d \u201cScherzo\u201d and \u201cM\u00e9lodie\u201d) of Tchaikovsky\u2019s violin and piano composition of the same name, orchestrated by       Alexander Glazunov.       \u201cSouvenir\u201d features two couples\u2014Mr. Gomes with       Stella Abrera       and Alban Lendorf with       Sara Lane      \u2014costumed by Keso Dekker in stylish outfits in jewel-tone hues befitting the dusky effects of       Brad Fields\u2019s       lighting.The ballet opens with Ms. Lane and Mr. Lendorf hailing each other with gestures of greeting across an empty stage, suggesting an overfamiliar depiction of generic lovers. Soon, however, gaining fresh and vivid life from the impassioned strains of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cMeditation\u201d portion of \u201cSouvenir,\u201d Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s ballet takes flight. We see embraced couplings and aerial forays, their animation sometimes suggests mirror images of the same couple, at other times with one dancer\u2019s moves following in the wake of another\u2019s, there\u2019s a sense of echoing moments as Mr. Lendorf\u2019s moves repeat those of Mr. Gomes or Ms. Lane\u2019s, those of Ms. Abrera.The \u201cScherzo\u201d section shows off the individual dancers one at a time, as each variously skitters, bounds and spins, seemingly spurred by Tchaikovsky\u2019s sonorities. The ballet\u2019s capstone pose is a banked grouping of both couples, leaving one pair feeling like the shadow of the other.The other two works in this mix were both by       George Balanchine,        whose internationally renowned Russian-based career includes numerous dances based on the music of his compatriot. \u201cMozartiana,\u201d set to Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cSuite No. 4, Op. 61,\u201d dates from 1981 and was first given by ABT in 2004. Led by a central ballerina and her dancing partner, and featuring a male soloist, four girl ballet students and four attendant women, the 5-part ballet plays out on a plain stage, with a sky-blue background.Rouben Ter-Arutunian\u2019s       mostly black costuming has a formal air that hints at the Seville of Mozart\u2019s \u201cMarriage of Figaro,\u201d even if Tchaikovsky\u2019s homage doesn\u2019t refer to that opera\u2019s music. Statuesque       Veronika Part,        who performed the ballet\u2019s lead on this occasion, did so with a sweetness and dignity if not ultimate precision and playfulness. As her partner, Blaine Hoven made fine work with his choreography\u2019s ongoing intricasies, missing only some freedom in the use of his head.       Daniil Simkin       made the ground-covering gigue airy and light of weight, missing the dance\u2019s inherent sharpness and accentuations.Balanchine\u2019s showstopping \u201cTchaikovsky Pas de Deux,\u201d from 1960, a once-little known addition to his \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d got an expert if not fully confident performance from principal dancer       Isabella Boylston       appearing alongside soloist dancer       Joseph Gorak.       Particularly at tricky partnering moments\u2013overhead lifts and breathlessly-caught diving leaps\u2014the pairing showed that it had a way to go toward true finesse. Still, Ms. Boylston danced with daring and power, Mr. Gorak, with boyish charm and shooting-star impetus, and both smiled unaffectedly through it all.Before the week\u2019s out, \u201cAurora\u2019s Wedding,\u201d Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s all-dancing excerpt from his beautifully staged, 2015 production of \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty\u201d will make its first outings. Likewise, the sometimes hair-raising choreography he arranged for the pas de deux to cap \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d (2010), will be given as a stand-alone duet. Throughout, Tchaikovsky will be in the air as ABT\u2019s dancers take their music-inspired choreography to leave their mark on the art of the great Russian composer.\u2014Mr. Greskovic writes about dance for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 17:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-tchaikovskys-footsteps-1499290362", "news_title": "In Tchaikovsky\u2019s Footsteps", "keywords": " american ballet theatre,arts in review, ballet,dance, peter ilyitch tchaikovsky,political,general news,ballet,arts,entertainment,music,theater,reviews"}, {"content": "Illinois\u2019s Democratic legislature appears to have forged a budget deal that could stave off a junk credit rating and resolve a two-year fiscal standoff, but the plan appears to do little to solve the state\u2019s long-term problems.Indeed, a major rating firm said Wednesday that it continues to look at a possible downgrade of the state\u2019s credit rating to a level no state has ever seen.On Thursday, the state House is expected to join the Senate in overriding a veto by Republican Gov.

Don\u2019t do it,\u201d the governor said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cThis income tax hike is booby-trapped. It\u2019s got land mines all over it.\u201dA budget wouldn\u2019t be a panacea. Illinois is struggling under the weight of $250 billion in pension debt, according to an estimate by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, a liability far greater than any other state\u2019s. The state\u2019s own estimate is about $126.5 billion, based on more optimistic investment assumptions.The burdensome backlog of nearly $15 billion in bills left over from two years without a budget will likely leave Illinois \u201cvulnerable to unanticipated economic stress,\u201d             S&P Global Inc.       noted Monday. Last week, a federal judge found Illinois noncompliant with its Medicaid payments, with the state owing $3 billion to health-care providers.And Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Wednesday said that it was officially placing Illinois\u2019s rating on review for a possible downgrade, even after factoring in the likely vote by the House of Representatives to override Gov. Rauner\u2019s veto on a tax hike and move forward on a budget.\u201cDespite the progress toward budget balance that the emerging fiscal plan embodies, the plan entails substantial implementation risk,\u201d said Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe plan\u2026 appears to lack broad bipartisan support, which may signal shortcomings in its effectiveness once implemented.\u201d\u201cOne budget is not going to fix their pension liabilities,\u201d said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. \u201cThe pension hole that the state has dug itself took decades and it\u2019s going to take a long time to get out of that hole.\u201dLaurence Msall,        president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan Chicago-based government-watchdog group backed by business leaders, said there are really only a few ways for the state to solve its pension problems. Illinois would need \u00a0a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to reduce the liability or a means of bringing in enough revenue to cover state operations and pay off pension debts over time.\u201cIt would be a great improvement to have any type of budget framework,\u201d Mr. Msall said. \u201cHowever that will not be the end of Illinois\u2019 financial crisis.\u201dDon Rose, a political consultant, said the General Assembly must continue to pursue pension reform and explore the possibility of changes to the state\u2019s constitution.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a slow process,\u201d Mr. Rose said \u201cThis [budget] is not a cure-all. We\u2019ve got to find longer-term solutions, revenue-based.\u201dBut if Thursday\u2019s House vote to override the governor is successful, Mr. Rauner will have been dealt a stinging legislative rebuke ahead of a planned re-election race in 2018.\u201cThis presents a unique opportunity for the governor because either he can mobilize all of the angst among taxpayers\u2026and that could potentially propel him to re-election,\u201d said       Diana Rickert,        vice president of communications for the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. \u201cOr he\u2019s going to be meek and not say anything and be like, \u2018I tried, I failed, they\u2019re blocking me.\u2019 This is really a defining moment in the governor\u2019s political career.\u201d\u2014Shibani Mahtani contributed to this article.Write to Quint Forgey at quint.forgey@dowjones.comHeather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'In Illinois, Long-Term Problems Still Loom Illinois Looks Set To Adopt Budget.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 17:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/illinois-budget-deal-would-leave-many-problems-unaddressed-1499284214", "news_title": "Illinois Budget Deal Would Leave Many Problems Unaddressed ", "keywords": "budget,governor,illinois,pensions,tax ,veto override,Bruce Rauner,Michael Madigan,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "In calling on Israeli Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       to seize an opportunity for peace supposedly presented by the increasing ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, William Galston is following a formulaic and ineffective algorithm that has consistently failed to produce peace (\u201cWill Netanyahu Seize the Chance for Peace?,\u201d Politics & Ideas, June 21). That algorithm is: A) Something happens. B) Israel is pressured to make concessions because A) happened. C) Israel makes concessions. D) The concessions are pocketed by the Palestinians while they torpedo any chances for peace. E) Go to A) above.This FORTRAN-like futility loop recurs because Mr. Galston and similarly minded enablers can\u2019t or won\u2019t acknowledge that the Palestinians are not willing to conclude any peace agreement with Israel that involves Israel continuing to exist as a Jewish state. Hence the Palestinians rejection of multiple generous offers of peace and their own state, from before Israel\u2019s rebirth to the present day. The 2002 Saudi Arab Peace Plan Mr. Galston proffers required Israel to take in an unlimited number of Palestinians, thus ending Israel\u2019s existence as a Jewish state.I call on Mr. Galston to seize this opportunity to abandon this spiral of futility and to correctly identify the roadblock preventing peace between Israel and Palestinians: relentless Palestinian terrorism, rejection of all reasonable peace offers and a determination to destroy Israel.Daniel H. TrigoboffWilliamsville, N.Y.The Palestinians need a Sadat-like leader to make peace. Unfortunately any such leader would fear being assassinated. Accordingly, peace awaits a cultural change within the Palestinian people. That is going to be a lengthy process. Without that change, peace between Israel and the Palestinians is impossible. And a true peace requires a long process of small, verifiable, confidence-building steps as an integral part of a peace agreement. Just placing signatures on a piece of paper before both parties are ready for peace is a sure path toward more bloodshed.Ellery BlockWesterville, OhioCompletely absent from Mr. Galston\u2019s analysis is the recognition that Hamas, the terrorist organization that controls Gaza and has many followers in the West Bank, is at daggers drawn with the Palestinian Authority and its nominal president,       Mahmoud Abbas.The people who periodically fire guns and missiles into Israel, and who dig the attack tunnels under the border between Israel and Gaza, are all under the control of Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza. Mr. Abbas has no control over them whatsoever. There is a reason he hasn\u2019t set foot in Gaza for 10 years: He prefers not to be assassinated. A \u201cpeace agreement\u201d signed by Mr. Abbas would be worthless to Israel because he is a \u201cleader\u201d who has virtually no followers. The vast majority of Israelis want peace, but they don\u2019t want the peace of the grave.Unless and until the Palestinian Authority can summon the will and force to disarm Hamas and other terrorist groups who believe that Muslims have a religious obligation to obliterate the Jewish state, there will be no peace, nor even a chance for peace.David E.

The company cited weak consumer demand and winter weather that was milder than normal, reducing the need for more repairs from weather-related parts breakage. The company reported same-store sales growth of 4.3% in the comparable period last year.Chief Executive       Greg Henslee       said in prepared remarks that lower sales metric will hurt the bottom line, but added \u201cwe remain confident in the long-term health of our industry\u201d and said the company can continue to capture market share.An O\u2019Reilly spokesman declined to comment beyond its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company is expected to release its full quarterly financial results July 26.Shares in O\u2019Reilly Automotive, one of the largest U.S. specialty retailers of auto parts, fell 19% to $178.77, its largest one-day percentage decline since its initial public offering in 1993, according to FactSet.Analyst       Alan Rifkin       of BTIG lowered his earnings per share expectations for O\u2019Reilly Automotive by more than 4% in the 2017 fiscal year and 2018 fiscal year, to $11.80 and $13.50, respectively.The warning from O\u2019Reilly Automotive weighed on peers             Advance Auto Parts Inc.       and             AutoZone Inc.,       whose shares fell Wednesday 11% and 9.6%, respectively.In recent months Advance Auto Parts said a warmer winter contributed to a comparable-store sales decline of 2.7% in its quarter ended in April, while AutoZone said a similar metric fell by 0.8% in its quarter ended in May.

It has done well with retail brokers who buy these products but has been slower to take off among banks that issue them\u2014Goldman rivals.This is a common challenge on Wall Street: Initiatives\u00a0that need multiple banks to thrive\u2014to reduce costs, deepen liquidity and product choice, and gain clients\u2019 trust\u2014can be hampered by old rivalries. Shared platforms are cheaper and more efficient but are a tough sell when they are backed by a single bank.Bringing in outside investors could bolster Simon\u2019s credibility as a neutral platform and give it an edge in a growing crowd of tech-enabled competitors.Goldman is talking to several firms about a deal to both invest in Simon and agree to sell products through it, the people said. There is no guarantee, though that the talks will produce a deal.Goldman declined to comment.Simon connects banks that issue structured notes to retail brokers who buy them on behalf of clients. It was originally developed as a conduit between Goldman\u2019s traders and its own wealth advisers, and opened up to outside firms in 2015.Since then it has enrolled thousands of advisers at brokerages such as             Raymond James Financial Inc.       who can use the app to\u00a0customize notes for their clients and learn about these complex products.But it has been tougher to attract rival banks to the platform. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., one of the largest issuers of structured notes, chose to partner with             International Business Machines Corp.       to develop its own competing platform.Among the largest banks that sell structured notes and certificates of deposit, only Goldman does so through Simon. Others such as         Barclays               PLC and         Credit Suisse Group               AG use independent brokerages or their own sales forces.Some other banks have resisted Goldman\u2019s fees, according to people familiar with their concerns. Others say they would prefer a neutral platform that isn\u2019t run by one bank. Independent competitors are springing up, too, such as Transparitrade, launched by a former Wall Street lawyer.Having outside investors in Simon would put some distance between it and Goldman\u2019s own trading desk and potentially bring new banks onto the platform. That could give brokers more choices when selecting products for clients.It would also mark the latest bid by Goldman to monetize software it initially developed for internal use. Goldman in 2015 spun out a series of apps it had built to allow its employees to access their work email on mobile devices. An internal chat tool called Live Current became the basis for the Symphony message service now available across Wall Street.That effort is likely to continue as       R.

Their words suggest as much.At their meeting last month, Fed officials debated when to start shrinking the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday, with some favoring starting \u201cwithin a couple of months\u201d and others suggesting it would be better to wait. The main sticking point: Uncertainty over whether the recent drop in inflation is temporary, or a real problem.Indeed, inflation was much on the policy makers\u2019 minds, according to a textual analysis of the minutes conducted by University of Notre Dame economist Bill McDonald. The word showed up 97 times in the minutes. That was the most since the minutes of the January 2016 meeting, when worries about emerging market stresses, falling commodity prices and slower U.S. growth were buckling financial markets. Excluding frequently used words such as \u201cthe\u201d and \u201cof,\u201d inflation was the most commonly used word in the minutes.The low level of inflation is a worry for the Fed, because it calls into question whether the central bank will be able to keep raising rates to what it considers normal levels without damaging the economy.The tone of the minutes was also decidedly less upbeat. The share of words in the minutes that were positive (\u201doptimistic,\u201d \u201cprogress,\u201d etc.), fell to the lowest level since January 2016, according to Mr. McDonald. Such shifts in tone can be revelatory. Carefully worded as the Fed\u2019s communications tend to be, they can reveal shifts in sentiment that eventually matter.Consider what happened not long after the Fed\u2019s January 2016 meeting.

Global stockpiles are still high, and the threat of new U.S. oil flooding into already brimming storage tanks pushed the market into a steep decline in June. Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members that were exempt from production quotas, have been also been ramping up, threatening to blunt the impact of the output reductions.Oil\u2019s rally in recent weeks was spurred in part by early signs that U.S. production may not be as resilient in the face of low prices as many believed.

Given a strong stock market, low volatility and scores of private companies that could be ready for initial offerings, the IPO market should be even busier, some fund managers and bankers say.\u201cThe new-issue market is healthy, so I would have expected we\u2019d have more IPOs given the market environment matched against this backlog of private companies,\u201d said       Anthony Kontoleon,        global head of equity syndicate at Credit Suisse Group AG.More than 160 private companies are valued at $1 billion or more, including ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource. In June 2014, there were about 60.Some of these companies are likely to go public in the second half of this year, but few big-name startups are expected, some bankers and stock-exchange officials say.\u201cThere are a lot of private companies I would assess as ready to go public. Whether they choose to go public or not, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d said       Gavin Baker,        manager of the Fidelity OTC Portfolio. His firm invests in still-private companies as well as publicly traded firms, and while he said it doesn\u2019t matter to him when companies choose to make their stock-market debuts, he does believe companies benefit from being publicly traded. \u201cIt forces a level of discipline and transparency,\u201d he said.IPOs have generally encountered solid interest from investors this year.Companies that listed on U.S. exchanges in 2017 have risen an average 10% from their IPO prices, according to Dealogic data for the first half of the year. The S&P 500 rose more than 8% in that time.Part of what has fueled demand for new offerings, some fund managers say, is that these outsize gains offer actively managed funds a way to beat their benchmarks at a time when passive investment strategies are growing more popular and stock indexes such as the S&P 500 have performed well.Newly listed technology companies have had a particularly strong showing, echoing broader gains in technology stocks around the world. Tech IPOs in the first half of 2017 were up an average 19% from their offer price, according to Dealogic. Among the best performers are enterprise software companies, including             MuleSoft Inc.       and             Okta Inc.,       which have gained more than 45% and more than 30%, respectively, since their IPOs.In a sign of the breadth of the rebound, one of the best performing IPOs in the first half was construction company             Jeld-Wen Holding Inc.,       which has risen 37% from its IPO price through Wednesday\u2019s close.Still, some of the most highly anticipated IPOs of 2017 have struggled recently.             Snap Inc.       shares soared in their first day of trading in early March, rising 44% after pricing at $17 a share, a dollar above expectations, but in recent weeks the Snapchat parent has fallen. On Wednesday, shares closed down 1.5% at $17.32.Blue Apron Holdings Inc. suffered a particularly disappointing stock-market debut in the last week of June. The meal-kit maker offered shares at the bottom of its lowered target range, and the stock closed below its IPO price on its second day of trading. Blue Apron shares closed at $8.84 Wednesday, down 12% from their IPO price.Some fund managers and bankers said Blue Apron\u2019s difficult path to public markets was likely to come up in conversations as other private companies decide whether to list. However, many are treating the company as an outlier. In the first half, 22% of companies priced their U.S.-listed IPO below their initial pricing range, on track for the smallest percentage of companies to do so since 2007, according to Dealogic.Fear of potentially market-moving events, such as the U.K. referendum on leaving the European Union and the U.S. presidential election, deterred many companies from going public in 2016, but expectations of volatility have been muted so far this year, which bodes well for offerings in the second half of 2017.\u201cFrom a macro point of view, there are more reasons to go public in the current environment than there are to wait,\u201d said Paul Donahue, head of Equity Capital Markets Americas at             Morgan Stanley.Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 16:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ipo-market-isnt-quite-back-as-many-startups-are-still-holding-out-1499252401", "news_title": "IPO Market Isn\u2019t Quite Back as Many Startups Are Still Holding Out ", "keywords": "2q market report,finreg,ipo markets, ipo price, ipo rebound, unicorns,vc analysis,vc ma,Airbnb,Uber Technologies,Anthony Kontoleon,Gavin Baker,Paul Donahue,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "With the retail sector in flux,             Nike Inc.       is looking for new ways to sell sneakers and shirts, but some industry watchers worry that the company\u2019s efforts to broaden its reach could damage its cultural cachet.The world\u2019s largest sportswear maker has begun selling goods through Amazon.com Inc. and increasingly is using its mobile apps as sales tools, attempting to connect with consumers who are buying more online. Already, sales on Nike.com and the company\u2019s apps have doubled to more than $2 billion since 2015, the company said last month.Those initiatives mark a shift away from how Nike has traditionally released its most desirable products. Five years ago, the company had to tell longtime sales partners             Foot Locker Inc.        FL -0.08%       and             Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc.        DKS 0.70%       to move limited-shoe releases to the morning hours from midnight because shoppers who camped outside stores were getting out of hand. Frequent online releases of coveted Jordan shoes could make them less rare and not as much in demand anymore, some industry watchers say.By making certain shoes available only through Nike channels or big chains such as Foot Locker, the company is diminishing the mom-and-pop shops that have served as community stewards of cool.\u201cThey\u2019re putting their foot on the gas in terms of releases,\u201d said Matt Halfhill, founder of sneaker-news site Nice Kicks, which chronicles new releases across major shoe brands. Mr. Halfhill, who said he has been involved in sneaker culture since the 1990s, believes the push toward direct sales actually hurts Nike\u2019s connection with consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to sell commoditized shoes, but most boutiques even discourage you from buying on the phone. They only sell shoes in stores to customers, where you see everyone in line waiting for shoes talking to each other,\u201d he said.A Nike spokesman said the company is focused on \u201cdisrupting the sneaker shopping experience\u201d by offering different types of releases, some in nontraditional places. Last month, the company released a limited edition sneaker in collaboration with acclaimed chef David Chang. Users of the Nike SNKRS app could purchase the shoe at Mr. Chang\u2019s Fuku restaurant in New York through augmented-reality technology by taking a photo of the menu within the app, which unlocked a sales portal.Wall Street has taken note of the choppy waters for Nike, which has to navigate North America\u2019s retail downturn, in particular the troubles facing sporting-goods stores. \u201cThe big picture concerns are competition is gaining on Nike, \u2018athleisure\u2019 is slowing, and the shift to online spending is proving highly disruptive to Nike\u2019s wholesale business,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole wrote in a research note.Nike\u2019s share of the U.S. retail sneaker market fell 1 percentage point to 50% this year through May, according to industry tracker NPD Group, while rival Adidas AG climbed to 11% from 7% over the same period. Adidas\u2019s gains come about two years after the company changed its leadership and refocused on sales in the U.S., where the German company has struggled for years.Adidas\u2019s resurgence includes new \u201cfranchises\u201d\u2014such as the NMD and Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy line\u2014that have gained a youthful following and made inroads on Nike\u2019s cultural dominance.Nick Santora, a former sneaker-store owner and editor of online sneaker magazine Classic Kicks, said Adidas is more on point with youth culture of late.\u201cIt took them a while, but things are coming together the right way,\u201d Mr. Santora said. \u201cKanye, for some people, for certain kids, that brand is now acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cNike was always \u2018sports, sports, sports,\u2019 but if you\u2019re over 11 years old right now, musicians are where it\u2019s at.\u201dNike has released collaborations with hip-hop artists such as Drake and \u200bA$AP Bari among others, and a training shoe with actor and comedian Kevin Hart. The company says it has relationships with entertainers as well as thousands of athletes, and it develops signature sneaker lines for only a select few.Although Mr. Santora, 39, said he is a lifelong Nike fan, he admits to some brand fatigue.\u201cI haven\u2019t bought a pair of Nikes in a couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be that cool anymore.\u201dWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Matt Halfhill said he has been involved in sneaker culture since the 1990s.

Today, coal use is plunging, and by\u00a02025 is expected to power just one-third of this region.This is all part of a plan released last month by the local utility,             Minnesota Power,        ALE 1.06%       to generate 44% of its electric power from renewable sources like\u00a0wind farms.\u00a0It also plans to build a new high-efficiency natural-gas power plant and has already shut down six of its eight coal-fired units.This is an extreme example of the transition happening across the U.S. power grid.\u00a0Natural gas, wind and solar power are expanding rapidly, while electricity generation from coal and nuclear reactors is shrinking.The transition in the grid comes as the Trump administration has signaled it would like to help coal make a comeback, and last week President       Donald Trump       said he wanted to \u201crevive and expand our nuclear-energy sector\u201d and announced a policy review. Because U.S. power demand isn\u2019t growing, promoting coal and nuclear would come at the expense of gas and renewables\u2014and vice versa. This has set up a power-grid showdown: Will new federal policies bring back coal and nukes, or will gas and renewables continue to grab market share?It isn\u2019t just small utilities like Minnesota Power that are changing their generating mix.Duke Energy Corp.      , a large utility based in Charlotte, N.C., with power plants in\u00a0five states, generated 7% of its power from gas and renewables in 2005. Last year, Duke got 32% from those new sources, and it expects the portion to hit 44% by 2026.Last week, Oregon utility PacifiCorp, which is owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Energy, filed plans to spend $3.5 billion on wind generation and transmission projects. The parent company had previously said it planned to spend $13.6 billion between 2017 and 2019 primarily on wind and solar projects. PacifiCorp said its renewable projects are \u201cthe most cost-effective option to meet customers\u2019 energy needs over the next 20 years,\u201d the company said.Overall, gas, wind and solar\u00a0now meet 40% of U.S. power needs, up from 22% a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.As gas and renewables have grown, coal, the mainstay of American electricity generation for decades, the past few years have been a bloodbath. Three of every 10 coal generators has closed permanently in the past five years.Nukes, another mainstay for decades, are imperiled, too. By 2023, there may be 54 nuclear-power plants, down from 65 a decade earlier. Only new state subsidies can keep more from closing, plant operators argue.Coal and nuclear plants have provided so-called base-load power for decades, running around the clock to ensure a reliable stream of electricity. As those sources of power lose ground to gas and renewables, some worry the grid could become unstable.Natural gas has been the main agent of change, mostly because the advent of hydraulic fracturing unlocked vast new natural gas reserves in the U.S., creating very low prices for the fuel.\u201cThat is what is making coal go away,\u201d said       Pat Vincent-Collawn,        chairman and chief executive of             PNM Resources Inc.,       a New Mexico utility.\u00a0It expects coal to drop from 51% of its generation last year to 41% next year.In addition to inexpensive and abundant gas, new power plants are much more efficient than they were even five years ago.\u201cNot only have we gotten better at getting the natural gas molecule out of the ground, but we have gotten much better at getting as much electricity out of that molecule as possible,\u201d said       Josh Rhodes,        a research fellow at the University of Texas Energy Institute.Until a few years ago, gas plants typically operated about 30% of the time, turning on and off as the grid needed power. Today, they run more than half the time. Many are on virtually nonstop, taking over the role once played by coal and nuclear.Ben Fowke,       \u00a0chairman and chief executive of             Xcel Energy Inc.,       a large utility that covers parts of Colorado, Minnesota and six other states, says\u00a0wind and solar aren\u2019t responsible for the demise of coal and nuclear plants. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come out that renewables are to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cWind is saving our customers money.\u201d For now, renewable energy enjoys a federal tax subsidy.Few utilities chiefs agree the administration should step in to prop up coal. There is more agreement that nuclear power plants should be saved from premature retirement.Nukes, which have no carbon emissions, are struggling to compete with low wholesale power prices brought on by inexpensive natural gas and renewable generation. Low power prices are great until baseload assets are on the line, said       Joe Dominguez,        executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs for             Exelon Corp.       \u201cPolicy makers need to step in and address that,\u201d he said.For Minnesota Power, a mixture of a lot of wind, some solar, hydro power from Canadian dams and a state-of-the-art gas plant will make it easier to provide reliable electricity, even with the loss of so much coal.\u201cThe combination of flexible natural gas and renewables really work well together,\u201d said       Julie Pierce,        Minnesota Power\u2019s vice president of strategy and planning.\u2014Dan Molinski contributed to this article.Write to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   PacifiCorp has filed plans with state regulators to spend $3.5 billion on wind and transmission projects.

The jolt from Volvo that all its cars would be electric or hybrid by 2019 casts serious doubt on Tesla\u2019s ability to live up to its long-term expectations.The electric car maker\u2019s shares were down more than 10% this week through Wednesday, in less than two full days of trading because of the holiday.The belief that Tesla would generate hefty profits in the coming years led investors to forgive the company\u2019s long history of missing its own deadlines.In the latest example, CEO       Elon Musk       promised earlier this week that Tesla would be able to build 20,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a month by December. Last year, he told analysts that Tesla was aiming to build at least 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. The new timeline, which calls for 100 cars built in August and more than 1,500 in September, would fall well short of the earlier forecast.But fresh competition means patient attitudes won\u2019t last forever.\u00a0In addition to Volvo,             Volkswagen                   has promised several new electric cars by 2020. And             General Motors                   has begun selling the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt.The Model 3 will launch as U.S. auto sales are slowing dramatically. And sales of Tesla\u2019s two high-end models haven\u2019t grown meaningfully in a year. The company blames this in part on production issues, but Tesla produced more vehicles than it sold for the last six quarters. Tesla said Model S and X\u00a0deliveries in the second half of the year would likely be higher than in the first, though it added the caveat: \u201cprovided global economic conditions do not worsen considerably.\u201cAnalysts are seemingly bracing for that possibility. They forecast an adjusted loss of $5.81 per share this year on average, according to FactSet; a year ago they predicted $2.62 a share in adjusted profit.Analysts still expect big profits by 2020, predicting $11.93 a share, on average. But those estimates were also much higher a year ago. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock has surged more than 50% this year, and trades at more than 28 times that 2020 earnings forecast. Rival auto makers trade for a fraction of that multiple.Investors\u2019 expectations for Tesla have gotten so disconnected from reality that even if the Model 3 succeeds and growth resumes for its other two models, the company\u2019s shares could perform terribly.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Big Talk From Tesla Disturbs Investors.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 16:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reality-bites-for-tesla-shares-1499275686", "news_title": "Reality Bites for Tesla Shares ", "keywords": " model 3,tesla shares,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla Motors,General Motors,GM,Volkswagen,VOW.XE,Volvo,VOLV-B.SK,Volvo Series B,SE:VOLVB,Elon Musk,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,commercial vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "Gold prices reversed losses Wednesday as rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea stoked demand for the haven metal.Gold for August delivery closed up 0.2% at $1,221.70 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

None, though, has come close to the success of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go.\u201d There are several reasons why, industry observers say.One is that the allure of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d wasn\u2019t primarily its augmented reality.While the game\u2019s digital monsters materialize as if in the real world, they don\u2019t interact with it. A Snorlax might appear next to a tree, but the catlike creature won\u2019t peek from behind it. Many players who took up hunting the monsters ended up turning off the augmented-reality feature.The real innovation of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d analysts say, was its use of location-based technology to get players walking outside and socializing with others. A recent update to the game doubled down on community building by letting players meet at specific locations to jointly defeat powerful monsters in \u201craids.\u201d\u201cWe have worked for many years to build a new kind of game based on real world exploration, physical movement and social gameplay,\u201d Niantic Inc., the game\u2019s creator, said in an email. \u201cOur definition of \u2019Augmented Reality\u2019 is the entire concept of building a game that takes place in and augments the real world.\u201dOthers believe the popularity of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d had to do with, well, Pok\u00e9mon, whose characters are known to millions of gamers old and young. \u201cIngress,\u201d a prior augmented-reality game from Niantic, attracted a decent following but wasn\u2019t nearly as popular.Pocket Gems Inc. wanted to tap into the buzz around augmented reality last summer. The San Francisco mobile-game maker scratched the idea, though, convinced the success of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d came largely from its intellectual property. The company is still open to making games using augmented reality when the technology can better stand on its own, Chief Executive       Ben Liu       said.The foundation is there. Some 40 million people in the U.S. this year are expected to use augmented reality at least once a month, mostly through social or utility apps, according to eMarketer. The research firm estimates that number will rise to 54.4 million by 2019.Investors have poured $4.5 billion into 707 virtual- and augmented-reality startups since 2010, according to industry tracker PitchBook Data Inc. Most of the money has gone toward the development of augmented-reality glasses and other areas outside of games, it said.Augmented-reality backers argue more hit games will emerge as app makers experiment.Developers, for example, will be able to make digital images interact with objects in the real world, said       Noah Falstein,        who served as Google Inc.\u2019s chief game designer from 2013 through April. Currently, fewer than a million smartphones world-wide can make use of that ability, he estimates.Apple last month unveiled a new platform called ARKit aimed at bringing a richer augmented-reality experience to its roughly one billion devices world-wide.

Also featuring       Greg Fox       on drums,       Shahzad Ismaily       on synthesizers and       Toby Summerfield       on guitar, the quartet makes music that is a squall of aggressive sounds that loop, collide and coalesce to engulf and occasionally disorient the listener. At its best, \u201cEx Eye\u201d lands hard as a relentless, textured wave. It\u2019s out now on the Relapse label.That wave, said Mr. Stetson when we spoke by phone last week, is the deliberate result of a mutual decision by the newly formed band regarding how it would approach its work. Following the recording of Mr. Stetson\u2019s album \u201cSorrow: A Reimagining of G\u00f3recki\u2019s 3rd Symphony,\u201d which was released in 2016 and featured Messrs. Fox and Ismaily, the musicians decided to join in a unit that emphasized maximalism and formal compositions. Having played in Mr. Summerfield\u2019s large ensemble Never Enough Hope, Mr. Stetson invited the guitarist to become a member.While they juggled other projects, the musicians carved out writing and rehearsal time to prepare for Ex Eye appearances at some of last summer\u2019s major festivals. As soon as they began practicing at Mr. Ismaily\u2019s Figure 8 studio in Brooklyn, they achieved the kind of brutal, intricate sound they had discussed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t achieve the fantastic,\u201d Mr. Stetson said, \u201cwhat the point?\u201dAlong with the musical maturity of his Ex Eye colleagues, Mr. Stetson\u2019s techniques\u2014in which he deploys circular breathing and multiphonics\u2014defend the quartet against comparisons to a heavy-metal rock band led by a free-jazz saxophonist. Mr. Stetson is part of the ensemble, not its sonic centerpiece; and the jabbing, provocative arrangements often push the music outside of rock\u2019s propensity for the groove, (though on \u201cXenolith; the Anvil,\u201d the bass synth line by Mr. Ismaily grabs on and doesn\u2019t let go).On the track \u201cForm Constant; the Grid,\u201d Ex Eye offers what may be its prototypical performance: Mr. Stetson opens with a lengthy repetitive solo complete with the occasional squeal; Mr. Ismaily shines a light underneath him with a subtle figure; Mr. Fox then enters with a stalking, down-tempo beat; and Mr. Summerfield offers arpeggiated notes on electric guitar. Thus, the trap is set and when the guitar suddenly issues a metallic roar, the maelstrom begins. Soon, Messrs. Fox and Summerfield lock in furiously, then Mr. Stetson leaps over the top. On it goes, with jolting stops and unexpected unison playing; and eight minutes after it begins, the performance hurdles to an raging, tightly choreographed conclusion. Exhausting but also invigorating, \u201cEx Eye\u201d reveals new things with repeated listenings.Contrast this music with what\u2019s on Mr. Stetson\u2019s solo disc \u201cAll This I Do for Glory,\u201d which was released in late April. On that record, Mr. Stetson creates dense electronic tracks via a variety of reed instruments\u2014most notably the bass saxophone\u2014which he augments with his moaning voice, the air that passes through his nose and lips, and clacking percussion. For all its activity, the album has a clarity that\u2019s in contrast to the wash of threatening sounds on \u201cEx Eye.\u201dWhen I asked Mr. Stetson if he feared sales of his solo disc would be cannibalized by \u201cEx Eye,\u201d he said he has no control over such things, adding there is no perfect time to release recordings by musicians as busy as he and his fellow bandmates. Mr. Fox, who is the drummer for the metal-inclined rock band Liturgy, will release a solo album, \u201cThe Gradual Progression,\u201d in September, and he, Mr. Stetson and bassist       Trevor Dunn       plan to record a trio album. Mr. Ismaily, who\u2019s probably best known for his stint with       Marc Ribot\u2019s       Ceramic Dog, is in demand as a musician and producer, and based on his performance here Mr. Summerfield should find no shortage of work. As for Mr. Stetson, he has a solo tour lined up, which includes an appearance at the Pitchfork Festival in Chicago later this month.Ex Eye will reunite in August for several U.S dates that will test how its through-composed maximalist music is experienced in a live performance. There is every chance that the boundaries the band imposed on itself will be destroyed on stage with determination and ominous glee.\u2014Mr. Fusilli is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

But it then slipped and settled at 2.334%, compared with Monday\u2019s 2.352%, its highest close since May 11.Yields fall as bond prices rise. The U.S. bond market was shut Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.Traders said the muted reaction in the bond market suggested many investors don\u2019t expect a big rise in yields given the cautious approach taken by the Fed in normalizing its crisis-era monetary policy.The minutes suggested the Fed was inching closer toward making the first step in cutting its large bondholdings. Yet it showed officials remained split on the timing to implement the exit strategy for its signature monetary stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis.Policy makers are confronting the continued disconnect in the economy that is complicating the policy normalization process: a labor market that is approaching full employment versus signs of slowing inflation.\u201cThe Fed is divided over the timing of the balance sheet run-down and why inflation is where it is,\u2019\u2019 said Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at             Aberdeen Asset Management.       \u201cThe market is going to struggle to read the tea leaves with this one.\u201dThe 10-year yield has jumped from this year\u2019s low of 2.135% set on June 26. Hawkish comments last week from top policy makers at central banks in the eurozone, Canada and the U.K. raised investors\u2019 concerns over a pivot toward tighter monetary policy, pushing up global government bond yields.A closely watched survey showed Wednesday that sentiment was the most bearish on Treasury bond prices since last December.The share of investors expecting higher bond yields rose to 32% for the week that ended Monday from 27% a week ago, according to the Treasury client survey from             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. The share of those expecting lower yields fell to 11% from 23%.Analysts say a sustained rise in bond yields would need data showing stronger growth and higher inflation. The June nonfarm jobs report, due Friday, is this week\u2019s key data point.The Fed in June raised its short-term interest rates for the third time since last December. Investors are debating whether the Fed may raise rates one more time before the end of this year or stand pat.Some analysts said the Fed may slow down the pace of rate increases as it moves toward paring down its balance sheet, which may keep a lid on how high Treasury bond yields can go.Short-term Treasury yields are highly sensitive to the Fed\u2019s rate increases. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was 1.414% Wednesday, unchanged from Monday and the highest close since Nov 2008.But the 10-year Treasury yield remained below the 2.446% settled at the end of last year, underscoring the Fed\u2019s limits in influencing long-term bond yields.Some investors expect the 10-year yield to rise to 2.6% or above by the end of this year. The yield last traded above 2.6% in mid-March. Others say the yield could be capped below 2.5% and that a rise toward 2.5% would be a buying opportunity.The 10-year Treasury yield had fallen earlier as a disappointing factories report bolstered demand for haven assets.

The \u201cpolitical and economic blockade will continue until Qatar revises its policies,\u201d he said.Accusing Qatar of supporting extremist groups and meddling in their domestic affairs, the four Arab states severed diplomatic relations on June 5 and imposed a transport ban on the nation of 2.2 million people. Qatari officials have consistently denied the allegations.On Wednesday, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister,       Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani,        lashed back, saying in London that the allegations by Saudi Arabia and its allies were \u201cclearly designed to generate anti-Qatar sentiment in the West\u201d and that their demands didn\u2019t represent \u201creasonable and actionable grievances.\u201d\u201cQatar continues to call for dialogue despite the siege that is a clear aggression and an insult to all international treaties bodies and organizations,\u201d Mr. Al-Thani told a gathering at the London-based think tank Chatham House. He said his country is more progressive and open than are others in the region, and its principles have made it a target.\u201cUnlike many states in the Middle East, Qatar was not built on oppression, fear and censorship,\u201d Mr. Al-Thani said.When they issued their demands to Qatar on June 22, the four Arab states boycotting Qatar gave it 10 days to comply. That deadline was extended on Sunday and expired early Wednesday. Doha has responded to the demands through Kuwait, but the details of its reply haven\u2019t been made public.The steps under consideration by the four nations at their gathering in Cairo on Wednesday weren\u2019t known. U.A.E. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs       Anwar Gargash       has said Qatar could be expelled from the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member political and economic bloc that includes Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. Mr. Al-Thani said Qatar\u2019s rivals in the group couldn\u2019t suspend it because such a decision would have to be taken by consensus.Bahrain\u2019s foreign minister,       Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa,        said in Cairo that Qatar\u2019s future as part of the GCC would be reviewed by the council when its six members meet, but didn\u2019t say when. \u201cDecisions are studied carefully,\u201d he said.Mr. Al-Thani of Qatar said its rivals in the group couldn\u2019t suspend it because such a decision would have to be taken by consensus.Doha is seeking help from the U.S. to resolve the dispute, while Abu Dhabi and Riyadh want the U.S. to back their efforts to isolate their neighbor. The response has been mixed, stoking fears of a prolonged diplomatic crisis.President       Donald Trump       has taken up the allegations against Qatar\u2019s ties to terrorism funding. Meanwhile, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       has sought to defuse the standoff, urging the two sides to use the list of demands as a starting point for negotiations.Mr. Tillerson\u200bsaid in June that the embargo on Qatar, which hosts 10,000 American troops at the largest U.S. military base in the region, was beginning to interfere in a U.S.-led military campaign against the jihadist group Islamic State.\u201cThe blockade is hindering U.S. military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department.Mr. al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia said it is committed in its fight against terrorism but can\u2019t have Qatar as an ally that also \u201cturns a blind eye towards terrorism financiers who operate openly [there]\u201d and toward \u201cextremists.\u201dQatar\u2019s economy has been resilient so far but could begin to suffer deeply if the transport ban remains in place and other economic sanctions are imposed.Mr. Al-Thani said the country is paying 10 times its normal rate to ship food and other goods into the country via alternative routes. This week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service changed its outlook on Qatar\u2019s credit rating to negative, citing the likelihood of a \u201cprolonged period of uncertainty.\u201dA similar diplomatic standoff in 2014 over Qatar\u2019s alleged support for Islamist organizations that Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain deemed terrorist organizations ended after eight months, with the three nations agreeing to return their ambassadors to Doha.

TSLA -0.91%       shares took a beating\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0after several analysts questioned whether\u00a0customer demand for its two electric vehicles is waning as the company begins producing a cheaper sedan.The Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s shares fell nearly 5% in midday trading to $335.74\u2014the lowest point in more than a month\u2014after rising about 69% this year through last week on enthusiasm for the coming Model 3 sedan, which is central to Tesla\u2019s plan to sharply increase total sales.Tesla on Monday\u00a0reported sales of its Model S cars and Model X sport-utility vehicles\u00a0were lower than analysts expected because of a supply issue with battery packs,\u00a0raising new fears the company will have trouble meeting ambitious production targets for the Model 3.Goldman Sachs                   analyst       David Tamberrino       reiterated a sell rating on Tesla\u2019s stock, writing in an note to clients that demand for the Model S and Model X vehicles appears to be plateauing after production exceeded second-quarter sales.\u00a0\u201cWe see potential for downside as the Model 3 launch curve undershoots the company\u2019s production targets,\u201d he said.Toni Sacconaghi,        an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Tesla\u2019s sales report \u201craised more questions than answers\u201d and asked\u00a0why investors didn\u2019t find out sooner about the \u201csevere production shortfall\u201d of battery packs, which Tesla said caused production to average about 40% below demand.\u201cIf production was so poor in April and May for its 100 kwh battery, why didn\u2019t Tesla executives discuss the issue on the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call on\u00a0May 3?\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.Tesla spokeswoman       Sarah O\u2019Brien       didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Tesla said it sold about 22,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the second-quarter, up about 53% but short of the average estimate of 23,655 deliveries, according to four analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Tesla finished the first half with sales of 47,100 vehicles, just meeting its goal of delivering 47,000 to 50,000 vehicles.\u201cModel S is getting a bit long in the tooth,\u201d said       Dave Sullivan,        an analyst for automotive consultancy AutoPacific Inc.The discouraging analyst reports came as Volvo Cars, the auto maker owned by Chinese automotive group Geely Holding Group,\u00a0said\u00a0all new\u00a0models starting in 2019 would be either fully electric or a hybrid. The move means Volvo would become the first major auto maker to abandon the conventional car engine, in a challenge to Tesla.Tesla made about 84,000 fully electric cars last year, and Chief Executive Officer       Elon Musk       is depending upon the Model 3, which will sell for about $35,000, to help bolster his annual production to 500,000 next year.\u00a0Part of that plan seemed to depend upon making a combined 100,000 Model S and Model X vehicles.The Model S, which typically sells for $100,000, first went into production in the third quarter of 2012 and has helped fuel quarter after quarter of sales growth since. Mr. Musk has tried to keep that model fresh by making some tweaks, such as offering better batteries and software updates.Model X went on sale in 2015 and was plagued by production problems, which Tesla addressed in its press release\u00a0on Monday. \u201cIt should also be noted that production quality and field reliability of the Model X, for which Tesla has been fairly criticized, have improved dramatically,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt is now rare for a newly produced Model X to have initial quality problems.\u201dJ.D.

In May, the owners of Montauk Juice Company sued the coffee giant, which for several days in April sold a drink called the Unicorn Frappuccino, for trademark infringement. Montauk Juice is asking for $10 million in damages.The case\u2019s first court date is scheduled for\u00a0July 25\u00a0in federal court in Suffolk County.Montauk Juice contends that Starbucks infringed on its \u201cdistinctive and famous trademark\u201d and confused its customers. The suit portrays multicolored chaos: Customers tagged the Frappuccino with #unicornlatte on Instagram. Media outlets mixed up the names. People wrongly thought the latte was inspired by the Frappuccino.Since January, the Unicorn Latte has accounted for 25% of the End\u2019s revenue, the suit says. But now, according to the suit, the $9 drink \u201chas suffered, and continues to suffer, brand dilution and tarnishment.\u201dThe latte and the Frappuccino feature shades of pink and blue, and brightly colored powders. Both were popular on social media.\u00a0Neither contains coffee.In legal documents, Starbucks disputed the fame of the latte and denied it had an obligation to get permission from the End. Furthermore, while Montauk Juice had submitted a trademark application, it was pending, Starbucks noted.The two companies did agree that unicorn foods were popular.\u00a0The complaint notes that \u201cthe Unicorn Latte fits with the current trend of colorful foods\u2014a relatively recent interest, particularly on the internet, with multicolored foods that includes Unicorn Noodles, Rainbow Bagels, Mermaid Toast, and even Unicorn Poop.\u201dIn legal documents, Starbucks concurred that unicorn-themed foods, including the poop and noodles, were trendy.In an interview,       Madeleine Murphy,        co-founder and chief visionary officer of Montauk Juice, declined to comment on the lawsuit. But she said the key ingredient in the latte, which the suit calls \u201cher greatest invention thus far,\u201d is a blue-green algae only harvested from a lake in Oregon.\u201cI love kale, but it\u2019s not magical like that,\u201d added Ms. Murphy, 32 years old, of the algae.Asked for comment, a Starbucks spokeswoman said the claims were without merit and its Frappuccino was inspired by unicorn-themed food and drink on social media. It is no longer available in its stores, she said in a statement.The suit is unusual because trademark cases more commonly involve a big company suing a smaller one, said       Barton Beebe,        a professor at New York University School of Law. He said Montauk Juice has a legitimate argument for what is called \u201creverse confusion,\u201d or customers believing its latte is a Starbucks knockoff.Jane Ginsburg,        a Columbia Law School professor, said if Starbucks was aware of Montauk Juice\u2019s latte, that could influence some judges\u2019 decision making because using the name could be seen as bad faith.\u00a0\u201cBut the real question is whether or not the relevant public for the good is likely to be confused as to who is the source of the good,\u201d she added.At the End last week, customers offered their own legal analyses.\u201cI guess if all places can have a chai latte, then they can also have a unicorn latte?\u201d said       Derick Whitson,        a 26-year-old freelance photographer who was sipping peppermint tea.Katie Dalebout,        27, said when she first heard about Starbucks\u2019s unicorn drink she wondered if it, too, contained superfoods such as the algae.\u201cIt confused me,\u201d said Ms. Dalebout, a blogger and podcaster who was drinking a latte with cannabinoid oil. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are they working together?\u2019 \u201dWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Coffee Shop Seeks $10 Million in Starbucks Unicorn Suit.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 15:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyn-coffee-shop-locks-unicorn-horns-with-starbucks-1499282397", "news_title": "Brooklyn Coffee Shop Locks Unicorn Horns With Starbucks ", "keywords": "starbucks,the end,unicorn,unicorn frappuccino,unicorn latte,williamsburg,The End Brooklyn,Starbucks,SBUX,Montauk Juice Factory,corporate crime,legal action,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,trademarks,political,general news,arts,entertainment,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The sharp slide in the British pound\u2019s value against the dollar since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union could pose difficulties for Britain\u2019s defense budget, British Defense Secretary       Michael Fallon       said.\u201cIf that lower rate persists, then obviously that is a challenge,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in an interview.\u201cI don\u2019t know how permanent that is, but that is clearly a change\u201d since Britain last reset its defense strategy in 2015, he added.His comments came ahead of a trip to Washington, where he will meet with Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       to discuss improving collaboration between the U.S. and the U.K. and also promote Britain as America\u2019s most dependable and highest-spending defense partner in Europe.As the U.K. prepares to leave the EU, it has sought to strengthen ties with the U.S. in areas including defense, security and trade.

He said former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       plan to cut troops there was wrong and praised the approach of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson\u2019s       plans for Afghanistan came under criticism this week after a group of U.S. senators visiting Kabul, including Republican       John McCain,        said the lack of a clear strategy could undermine the expected surge of U.S. troops there.Mr. Fallon said local forces needed the support of troops from the U.S. and the U.K., which will boost its troop numbers in Afghanistan to 550 troops over the summer. The U.S. currently has more than 8,500 troops in the country.\u201cIt would\u2019ve been a mistake to cut numbers as Obama was threatening last summer,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve increased last summer, and we\u2019ve increased again. We think what\u2019s important\u2014the lesson of Iraq\u2014is you support local forces and you supply the enablers that they simply don\u2019t have.\u201d\u2018This is our continent. We\u2019re going to go on defending it. It just won\u2019t be in the EU context.\u2019Mr. Fallon also said the West need to do more to cut North Korea off from the international finance system, after Pyongyang\u00a0launched a ballistic missile with the capacity to reach the U.S.\u201cWe need to make sure North Koreans are not accessing any part of the financial system that might contribute to the missile program,\u201d he said, adding the EU and other international organizations should consider putting new sanctions on North Korean individuals and entities and enforce current ones. \u201cClearly the sanctions are not yet biting sufficiently hard,\u201d he said.The U.K. remains committed to the defense of Europe and won\u2019t try to use security as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations with the EU, Mr. Fallon said.The defense secretary also announced the U.K. would host a summit with France in London in the fall to discuss security cooperation.\u201cThis is our continent. We\u2019re going to go on defending it,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cIt just won\u2019t be in the EU context.\u201d\u2014Robert Wall contributed to this article.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Weaker Currency Tests U.K. Military Spending.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 14:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/low-pound-could-constrain-british-defense-spending-1499280881", "news_title": "Low Pound Could Constrain British Defense Spending", "keywords": "british pound, post-brexit britain, uk currency, uk defense spending,European Union,U.K. defense ministry,Lockheed Martin,LMT,Boeing,BA,Michael Fallon,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Connecticut Gov.

She was assigned to the 46th precinct in the Bronx.The officer was sitting in a police vehicle on East 183rd Street near Creston and Morris avenues at about 12:30 a.m. in Fordham Heights when she was shot in the head. Law-enforcement officials identified the suspect as       Alexander Bonds.Mr. Bonds was seen on video walking toward the vehicle and tightening his hood before firing one shot at the officer from a silver revolver, a senior law-enforcement official said.Officer Familia died at St. Barnabas Hospital early Wednesday, officials said.An officer and a sergeant shot and killed the suspect one block away after Mr. Bonds drew the revolver, the officials said.A bystander also was hit during the encounter with the suspect and is in stable condition.Officer Familia was in an NYPD mobile-command post when she was struck, police said.

The British sprinter\u2014the Manx Missile, they call him, as he\u2019s from the Isle of Man\u2014is one of the winningest cyclists in history, with 30 Tour stage victories, just four off legend Eddy Merckx\u2019s record of 34. Cavendish is 32, not ancient but getting up there for a sprinter, and he\u2019s raced hard for a long time. It isn\u2019t clear how many more shots at the Tour stage record he\u2019ll have. And it\u2019s brutal to leave with a broken shoulder just four days into the planet\u2019s biggest bike race.It stinks.Now let\u2019s talk about Peter Sagan.Even if you\u2019re not a bike racing fan, you\u2019ve probably caught a whiff of the controversy over the past day or so, ever since Cavendish hit the deck in the furious closing meters of Tuesday\u2019s Stage 4, and Sagan, cycling\u2019s popular world champion, wound up being expelled for what the race jury concluded was dangerous riding and his role in causing the crash. The video replay has been argued about, slow-mo\u2019d, super-slow-mo\u2019d, atomized and picked apart with Zapruder-like focus. Accusations have flown. Sides have been taken. Sagan and Cavendish have been trending on Twitter in the U. S.\u2014as if they were NBA free agents.The whole thing is another dose of crazy for a sport that pretty much invented crazy.There are two aspects to this story: what did or didn\u2019t happen, and what it means for Sagan to get booted from the Tour. I guess we should tackle the what-happened question first, though a person hoping for absolute clarity on what happened will likely wait forever.I think it\u2019s important to establish that a field sprint in a bike race is a highly chaotic environment. Bikes are moving at speeds approaching 40 miles an hour, heart rates are fully in the red, and, in a race like the Tour de France, careers can literally be made with a victory. In a space of seconds there are dozens of factors for a racer to consider, including what the right wheel is to follow (hiding behind a teammate or rival is a great way to save energy until the final burst), what the right time is to jump, and, importantly, what\u2019s the right place to be on the road. There\u2019s a lot on every sprinter\u2019s plate. Then, of course, they\u2019re riding between immovable barriers over pavement wearing basically form-fitting underpants. It\u2019s sketchy as hell.No one, not even Sagan and Cavendish, can probably tell you with 100% certitude what happened Tuesday. I\u2019ve watched the video at least 40 times, and there are angles that look terribly damning to Sagan, and then angles that make it look like Cavendish was already crashing before Sagan flicked an elbow, which will now be known in Tour de France lore as The Elbow. What\u2019s undeniable is that Cavendish crashes very hard, and on his way down, takes out a couple of riders behind him as well. It\u2019s a pile-up. It\u2019s ugly. It also happens in bike races all the time.The most interesting voices to hear from have been the people who\u2019ve actually been there: in the madness of a sprint, where positioning is everything and the smallest deviations can cause havoc. Riders who\u2019ve been there know that stuff like Tuesday will occur in a sprint: there\u2019s tricky maneuvering, boneheaded choices, and yes, bodily contact. It\u2019s dangerous, but sprinters bump shoulders and butts and even helmets from time to time, intentionally and not. Chances are taken\u2014Cavendish took one himself in moving up between Sagan and the barrier, because while Sagan can move, a barrier doesn\u2019t care who Cavendish is, and isn\u2019t going anywhere. But aggression like that is everywhere in a sprint. Smart aggression can be rewarded. Dumb aggression can be a disaster. Emotions afterward run high.It isn\u2019t for everybody. There\u2019s a reason 90% of the peloton steers clear of the final sprint.What seems pretty clear among sprinters is that even if Sagan deserved a penalty for contact with Cavendish\u2014and there\u2019s also reports he was cited for dodgy riding before that\u2014throwing him out of the race was a truly nuclear option. Retired Tour sprinters like Baden Cooke and Robbie McEwen lined up to disagree with dramatic expulsion. Even Sagan\u2019s current rivals feel it was extreme. \u201cSometimes I should watch images before I say something,\u201d tweeted the sprinter Andre Greipel, who\u2019d harshly criticized Sagan before. \u201cApologies to [Sagan] as I think the decision of the [race jury] is too hard.\u201dSagan is a supremely skilled and admired (even Cavendish likes him) rider who\u2019s brought panache and personality to a sport that can sometimes feel personality-deprived. To be clear: That\u2019s not a reason to keep him in the Tour if what he did clearly merited being tossed from the race. But it doesn\u2019t seem clear. Clarity is nowhere to be found. The arguments are still raging, and likely will be for a long time.What we\u2019re left with is a race without Peter Sagan and Mark Cavendish\u2014and a Tour that suddenly feels a lot less fun.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Booting Peter Sagan: Fair or Foul?.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 14:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/booting-peter-sagan-from-the-tour-de-france-fair-or-foul-1499279400", "news_title": "Booting Peter Sagan From the Tour de France: Fair or Foul?", "keywords": "bike crash,bikes,cycling,mark cavendish,peter sagan,sagan cavendish,tour de france,tour de france stage 4,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014South Korean President Moon Jae-in called on global leaders Wednesday to step up sanctions against North Korea following its intercontinental ballistic missile test, but he also urged them to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.His comments came before a meeting in Berlin with German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        who said North Korea \u201cposes a big threat to global peace\u201d and that the missile test violated international law.The two leaders met ahead of this year\u2019s gathering of leaders from the Group of 20 nations in the German city of Hamburg.

He qualified his response by saying, \u201cEvery once in a while you get a dipsy-doodle,\u201d according to a tweet by Ms. Tausche. (A Twitter account for Sen.

In 1982, when Democrats argued that tax cuts and military spending would drive up the deficit, Reagan responded, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a real dipsy-doodle.\u201dThe term was popularized in 1937 (when Mr. Hatch was 3 years old) by a song titled \u201cThe Dipsy Doodle.\u201d Performed by Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra and by       Larry Clinton,        its composer, the song playfully describes verbal flubs: \u201cWhen you think that you\u2019re crazy / You\u2019re the victim of the Dipsy Doodle / But it\u2019s not your mind that\u2019s hazy / It\u2019s your tongue that\u2019s at fault, not your noodle.\u201dIn titling the song, Clinton drew on colorful baseball slang for off-speed pitches that fool batters looking for fast balls. A 1940 article in the Hartford Courant explained that Clinton got his inspiration at a game featuring New York Giants pitcher       Carl Hubbell,        famous for the slow delivery of his screwball pitch, which was nicknamed \u201cthe dipsy dew.\u201dClinton had meant to shout out, \u201cGive \u2019em the dipsy-dew, Carl!\u201d but instead it came out as \u201cGive \u2019em the dipsy-doodle, Carl!\u201d So inspired, \u201cLarry went home and sat down to write a song,\u201d the Courant reported.Long before Hubbell threw his screwball, baseball players used the phrase \u201cdipsy-dew\u201d (also spelled as \u201cdipsy-do\u201d or \u201cdipsy-doo\u201d) for odd-breaking pitches. It shows up in regional newspaper accounts of minor-league baseball games as early as 1910, when the Daily Times of Portsmouth, Ohio, described the \u201c\u2018dipsy-dew\u2019 curve\u201d of       William Ludwig,        who pitched for the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Ohio State League.The \u201cdipsy\u201d part of \u201cdipsy-dew\u201d evokes the dipping movement of a nasty curveball. As for \u201cdew,\u201d Major League Baseball\u2019s official historian       John Thorn       pointed out to me the resemblance to an even older name for an off-speed pitch: the \u201cdewdrop.\u201d That dates back to the 19th century, when pioneering pitchers first figured out how to vary the speed and motion of their delivery to keep batters guessing.After \u201cThe Dipsy Doodle\u201d hit it big in 1937, baseball players latched on to the term, and it entered sports like boxing and football to label deceptive, zigzagging moves. In politics, the phrase has been used for various kinds of confusion and chicanery, but Mr. Hatch may be the first to bring \u201cdipsy-doodle\u201d into the age of Twitter.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 14:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-dipsy-doodle-turn-on-twitter-1499278966", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Dipsy-Doodle\u2019 Turn on Twitter", "keywords": " ben zimmer,dipsy-doodle, etymology,orrin hatch, politics, trump, tweet, twitter, word usage,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Monogram Residential Trust Inc.       said Tuesday that it agreed to be acquired by Greystar Growth and Income Fund LP, an investment group led by Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC, in a deal valued at around $2 billion.

The majority have died in the eastern part of the country, where the U.S. military has stepped up operations to fight the local Islamic State branch, which has established a foothold near the Pakistani border.Fewer than 9,000 U.S. soldiers are currently deployed in Afghanistan.

If the full IOC approves the measure, the group will then decide in September which city plays host to the Games first. IOC officials and U.S. bid officials have already begun discussions on awarding the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, which is seen as a less time sensitive proposal than Paris because its venues are largely complete and the bid isn\u2019t dependent on public investment beyond security and some infrastructure improvements that are already planned. Paris requires a public-private partnership for construction of its Olympic Village as well as some other sites, and government support may wane if the city has to wait until 2028. Officials in Los Angeles and at the U.S. Olympic Committee say for now they remain focused on bidding for the 2024 Games.The Paris bid has just 63% support across the city, region and country, while Los Angeles has 78% support in the city, 72% in California, and 64% support nationally.Despite the Paris bid\u2019s comparably low public approval rating, Paris 2024 Co-Chairman, Bernard Lapasset, said the bid \u201crepresents a unified vision of the sports movement, the political stakeholders and the citizens of Paris and France. There is a momentum behind our bid.\u201dA Paris 2024 spokesman said recent independent polls show support at 73%.The report hailed the Los Angles bid as \u201cforward-looking,\u201d \u201cinnovative,\u201d and \u201cvibrant,\u201d and in line with Bach\u2019s goals to bring Olympic spending and venue construction under control. The bid has challenges, though, according to report.It noted the need for a confirmed investment from NBCUniversal on construction of the International Broadcast Center, a strong transport plan for travel between venues, and the need to raise the profile of both paralympic sports and events less popular in the U.S. than overseas, such as international handball, for instance.In a statement, LA2024 chief executive Gene Sykes, said bid leaders \u201clook forward to sharing with the full IOC Membership our truly sustainable solution that encourages future cities to bid for the Games, engages the world\u2019s youth and secures the long-term financial stability of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements.\u201dThe Paris bid received high marks for its plans to be a vehicle to highlight France\u2019s role as a climate-change leader, with its reliance on a an public transportation. The bid includes plans to make the River Seine suitable for swimming and for the proposed Olympic Village in the Saint-Denis district to be converted to much-needed housing.The Paris bid\u2019s challenges include creating a uniquely Olympic atmosphere in the city\u2019s central Games zone, getting the Seine clean enough for swimming\u2014a proposal that doomed Rio organizers\u2014and negotiating funding guarantees.

With a big iOS software update now in public beta test, the iPad is at long last capable of doing serious work. In iOS 11, you\u2019ll be able to run multiple windows, drag and drop from one app to another, and browse your files in one place. You can do things that used to require a laptop.You can also expect to get confused. Like a guy taking his first yoga class, my fingers twisted and wobbled into this new way to work. Over a week, my arm got tired of reaching over to the screen of my 10.5-inch iPad Pro to use all the new finger-operated tricks. More than once, I gazed longingly over at my Magic Mouse.Ever since Steve Jobs said the iPad would usher in the \u201cpost-PC era,\u201d the question that has dogged the iPad is: Can it replace a laptop? Today, as iPads outsell Macs in units, I think the better questions are: What is an iPad good for? And when are you still better off using a laptop?Apple causes confusion by blending some, but not all, laptop and tablet capabilities. You operate a Mac with a horizontal keyboard, a mouse and a trackpad\u2014but never fingers on the upright screen. The iPad now comes with a $160 keyboard that makes the touch screen sit up like a laptop\u2014but there\u2019s no horizontal mouse or trackpad to save your hands from constantly reaching up.             Microsoft\u2019s       rival Surface Pro machines have their own compromises but do it all, with touch screens and trackpads, plus software that can run tablet and laptop apps alike.The iPad\u2019s slim hardware has some clear advantages for people on the move. It\u2019s always on, no waiting around for boot-up. The battery generally outlasts ultraportable laptops, and now its processors can even handle complicated tasks like photo editing. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $650, gets closer to an ideal balance of portability and screen real estate, and leaves space for a less-cramped keyboard.Excited by iOS 11? We are, too. But until its release this coming fall, it is available to the public only as test software. Sign up for a download at https://beta.apple.com.Some advice: Avoid putting iOS 11 on an iPad or iPhone you rely on. The software is prone to crashes and hasn\u2019t been optimized for battery life or performance on devices made before 2013.What\u2019s really held back the iPad is its software, which has worked mostly like a stretched-out iPhone. iOS 11, coming this fall to most iPhones and iPads purchased in 2013 or later, strikes its own path for the iPad. It finally allows Apple and app makers to explore the productivity potential of the iPad\u2019s big touch screen.Some new iPad gestures in iOS 11 become less annoying when the iPad is laying flat or held in your hands, instead of connected to the keyboard. And Apple can still change iOS 11 a bit based on feedback from users of the beta version. Here\u2019s a tour of the iPad\u2019s new skills\u2014and where it still struggles to work fast.The Dock is where you keep your most important apps on a Mac, and now there\u2019s one on the iPad. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to pull it up and over whatever app you\u2019ve got open. You can keep adding apps\u2014I squeezed in 16!What\u2019s useful is that you no longer have to keep going back to the home screen to open apps. But when you\u2019re using the iPad with a keyboard, it still involves a lot of reaching up to the screen. Your best bet is to learn a keyboard shortcut: Cmd+opt+d.You have to learn just the right amount of finger flick to pull the Dock up. Keep pushing too far and up pops a new screen, called the App Switcher. It blends together a redesigned Control Center, where you turn on airplane mode and do other common tasks, with a zoomed-out view of open apps.The iPad now gets closer to dashboard experience of laptops, with the ability to make multiple apps fully functional at the same time\u2014if you can figure out how.The most basic way to multitask is Split View: Launch one app, then pick another out of the dock and move its icon toward the edge of the screen. You have to hit just the right spot\u2014not far enough, and it won\u2019t stick. This mode requires participation by app makers, which is limited today.Another option, called Slide Over, lets one app hover over another. Launch an app, then pick another out of the dock, dropping it not quite so close to the edge. This took practice, and I never found a convenient way to make the floating app go away.There isn\u2019t a way to turn an incoming notification\u2014say, an email from your boss\u2014into a Slide Over app. And with the exception of Safari windows, you can\u2019t run two of the same app side by side. Little stuff like that means more finger yoga to accomplish tasks that take only a slight hand movement on a Mac.Want to run more than two apps? Well aren\u2019t you productive. On newer iPads, you can run both a Split View and Slide Over at the same time.And a caveat: On my 2014-era iPad Air 2 running the beta software, it took an eternity for the two apps to load. Fingers crossed it speeds up by the time iOS 11 is in its final version.This may be the most useful iPad skill yet: Now you can move things from one app to the next. Say you want to email a photo: Tap the image you want to send, then drag it over to your email app and drop it in a new message. It also works with text and files.You can drag multiple things at once: Tap one photo, then use a different finger to tap on another, and they make a stack that you can drop as one.Is this easier than holding command and selecting multiple things with a mouse or trackpad? No. But it is a clever use for the iPad\u2019s multi-touch screen.On a laptop, you know where all your stuff is. But it was a big mystery on the iPad until now. iOS 11\u2019s Files app shows you what you\u2019ve got stored locally, as well as in the cloud.Combined with drag and drop, this lets you organize your stuff into nested folders and even tag it. A downside: it doesn\u2019t include the stuff that lives in your Photos and Music apps. Everything you see in Files is included in search.Apple says even third-party services like Dropbox will be coming to this app. So your iPad could actually become the easiest way to search, tag and browse files if you\u2019ve got them spread all over the place.Apple has given its apps a boost, and the best example is Notes. Now if you tap the lock screen with an iPad Pro pencil, up pops the Notes app for taking your big ideas and doodles. It\u2019ll even recognize your handwriting so you can search for them with text later.Another trick: tap an icon in the lower right corner to take photos of paper documents.Notes will act like a scanner app and fix lighting and stretch them out to look great.Is this easier than taking a photo on your phone and sending it to your computer? Actually, yes! And that\u2019s still where the iPad shines most: doing things you just can\u2019t on a laptop.Write to Geoffrey A.

Producers zeroed in on shooting locations and a date with a full moon to maximize their chances for drama. If weather, technology and the wildlife itself cooperate, viewers will see lion prides in Kenya hunting by moonlight during a wildebeest migration, and macaque monkeys in Thailand smashing mussels on the beach for their breakfast.The animals \u201care our superstars, but like any talent you hope they perform on the day you need them to,\u201d says Tim Pastore, National Geographic\u2019s president of original programming and production.To combat overcrowded TV schedules, audience indifference and the ratings-deflating force of DVRs, TV networks continue to invest in live programming. NBC, which kicked things off in 2013 with \u201cThe Sound of Music Live,\u201d scheduled \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d for next Easter (though it postponed a production of \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d ). Fox will stage live versions of \u201cRent\u201d and \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d next season. ABC is planning an adaptation of             Disney\u2019s       \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201dNational Geographic channel has dabbled in its own version of such stunts, airing live footage of a brain surgery and astronauts on the International Space Station. \u201cEarth Live,\u201d however, is a bigger bet in terms of budget and logistical challenges. It brings a commensurate risk of giving viewers a lackluster day in the (wild) life of the planet, or the cringe-worthy experience of watching a high-wire act gone wrong.After years of reality shows about survivalists and other rugged characters, the channel has been launching more ambitious shows to steer its programming back into sync with National Geographic\u2019s 129-year-old brand. They include the channel\u2019s first fully scripted series, \u201cGenius\u201d (about the life of Albert Einstein), and \u201cMars,\u201d a documentary-drama hybrid.The channel is part of a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and             21st Century Fox.       21st Century Fox and             News Corp                   , parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.As the director of many live awards shows, including Oscars, Emmys and Tonys broadcasts, \u201cEarth Live\u201d director Glenn Weiss is more accustomed to corralling footage of celebrities than animals. He\u2019ll orchestrate feeds coming in from the field to a studio in midtown Manhattan. There, naturalist Chris Packham will provide on-camera commentary, along with hosts Phil Keoghan and Jane Lynch, who says her role as host is to \u201cstand there in amazement and say \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201dNational Geographic has deployed wildlife cinematographers who specialize in the species and locations they\u2019ll be shooting. They include Sophie Darlington, tracking lions in the Maasai Mara game reserve in Kenya; Bob Poole, looking out for hyenas that come into Ethiopian villages for food by night; and Andy Casagrande, sending underwater images of bull sharks on the prowl in Fiji. Producers in New York will keep an eye on social media so if any specific animals emerge as stars, they can respond with more footage.New technology, including a camera with capability of capturing images in color of animals under moonlight, made it more feasible to tape animal nightlife. \u201cEarth Live\u201d locations include a cave near San Antonio, where millions of Mexican free-tailed bats should emerge at dusk, and in Finland, near the Arctic Circle, where there\u2019s some sunlight in the sky at 3 a.m. when wolverines are expected to be on the move.Plans for the special started two years ago when executive producer Al Berman pitched the concept to National Geographic. That began the process of narrowing down more than 100 potential shooting locations, and dates with a full moon that would bring heightened tides and animal activity. \u201cWe looked right across the calendar, in both Northern and Southern hemispheres. If you want to choose one night to look at animals, this is the night,\u201d says executive producer Andrew Jackson.In the run-up to July 9, researchers and camera crews have been keeping tabs on members of the wildlife cast to make sure they\u2019re behaving as expected and in their places for several weekend rehearsals before the big show.Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'national Geographic\u2019s live tv spectacle WILDLIFE.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-geographic-aims-for-the-super-bowl-of-nature-shows-1499274192", "news_title": "National Geographic\u2019s Live TV Spectacle", "keywords": "bye bye birdie,earth live,live musical,live programming,national geographic channel,nature show,the sound of music,political,general news,arts,entertainment,natural environment,television,radio,reviews,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "\u201cJuly Fourth marks a day of shared traditions in a nation that has grappled with divisions this past year,\u201d reports the Associated Press.

The 30-year-old actor had taken a few months off from exercising, so he planned an easy loop through his Los Angeles neighborhood.He was five minutes from his house and had just broken a sweat when a man with white hair, also jogging, blew past him. Mr. Bruce estimated him to be in his late 70s. Ten yards down the road the man turned his head back and shouted: \u201cKeep up\u2026 if you can!\u201dAlthough Mr. Bruce chuckled to himself, he immediately picked up his pace. \u201cA \u2018game-on\u2019 type of instinct kicked in,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Alright old man, I got you.\u2019\u201dPsychologists define \u201ctrash talk\u201d as boastful remarks about oneself or insulting remarks about one\u2019s opponent delivered before or during a competition. Trash talk is prevalent in sports, business, politics and the military\u2014and also common between friends or family members when they find themselves competing for something.Now, new research from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School\u2014soon to be published in the journal \u201cOrganizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes\u201d\u2014shows that trash talk can be surprisingly motivating to the target of it.In a series of six studies, the Wharton researchers brought approximately 1,000 participants into their lab and told them they were being paired with another person taking part in the study\u2014in reality, it was a researcher\u2014and that they would compete with this person on a task. But first they were asked to chat with their partner online. Some received neutral messages from this person: \u201cHey, it looks like we will be competing against each other in the next task.\u201d Others received trash talk: \u201cThis is going to be so easy.\u201d \u201cYou are a total loser.\u201d \u201cI am going to beat you like a rented mule.\u201dThe participants then performed tasks that measured their persistence or effort. The \u201cslider task\u201d required them to move a slider, or cursor, on a computer quickly to a target number. The candle problem tested their creativity: Each person was given a candle, a pack of matches and a box of tacks and asked to figure out a way to attach the candle to the wall so that it does not drip on the table or floor below it. The researchers told them they could win money. And in one experiment, they were instructed that they would be working as a team with the person they were paired with, to compete against other teams.The researchers found that the trash talk recipients performed better on all the tasks that required them to exert effort. They reported feeling more rivalry, and they were also more likely to cheat. But they performed worse on the task that measured their creativity\u2014perhaps because they were distracted by anger\u2014and on the ones where they were asked to cooperate with their partner.\u201cWhen you interact with someone who is trash talking you, it shifts your perception about the relationship,\u201d says       Jeremy Yip,        an assistant professor of management at Georgetown University, visiting scholar at Wharton and lead researcher on the studies. \u201cYou were already in a competitive relationship, but now it becomes a rivalry and you start to care more about defeating your opponent.\u201d Rivalry makes people work harder when they compete, Dr. Yip says. In the research, the people who were the targets of trash talk wanted to punish their rival, even when he or she was on the same team.The researchers did not study whether men or women use trash talk more. They focused on the targets of the trash talk and found that both men and women react similarly when they are on the receiving end of it.How can you harness trash talk, either as the talker or the target? Here is some advice.Recognize the consequences. You may boost your opponent\u2019s performance. \u201cAsk yourself how you would react if someone trash talked you,\u201d Dr. Yip says. \u201cIf you step back and think about it, you will see that being called a loser is going to motivate you as competitor.\u201dConsider your personality. This is a specialized type of communication. \u201cTrash talk requires a certain brashness that not everyone has, and, as in tennis, you have to be ready for the return shot,\u201d says       Daniel McGinn,        author of \u201cPsyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help you Succeed\u201d and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. \u201cThe recipient is often going to try and give better than he or she gets.\u201dChoose your target well. The research shows that people who are targets of trash talk do worse on tasks that are creative and better on tasks that require persistent effort. So trash talk the quarterback, to distract him, not the defensive tackle. Try it with a golfer, not a cyclist.Don\u2019t trash talk your teammates. This turns them into competitors, according to the Wharton studies.Don\u2019t take it personally. Realize that in competition, even unstated ones, the norms for communication are different. Aggressive talk is common.Know yourself. Are you better off ignoring the trash talk completely, using it to motivate yourself but staying quiet, or responding with verbal fire of your own to try and destabilize your opponent? \u201cI see a parallel between how one deals with trash talk and how a comedian deals with a heckler,\u201d says Mr. McGinn. \u201cPersonality is important.\u201dTry ignoring it. Not every comment needs a response. \u201cJust because you see a log floating down the river doesn\u2019t mean you need to jump on it,\u201d says       Warren Kennaugh,        a behavioral strategist and executive coach in Sydney.Motivate yourself.

When he looked at a dilapidated historic wine tavern in Vienna\u2019s Grinzing neighborhood, in the Alpine foothills above the city, he saw the potential for a modern luxury villa.The building bore witness to centuries of Viennese history, roughly taking its present form in the late 1600s. Parts of the building\u2019s foundation could be much older, though exactly how much older is disputed. A guest book, however, shows the tavern had special allure in the mid-20th century, welcoming celebrities such as Liz Taylor and             Walt Disney.\u201cI was looking for a challenge,\u201d Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos, 76 years old and a Vienna native, says of his purchase.Developers have bought similar taverns to convert into million-dollar condos, adds Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos, \u201cbut I wanted to turn mine into a home.\u201dHe bought the building, set on a one-tenth acre lot in Grinzing\u2019s village-like core, in 1998 for about $525,000, after it had fallen into bankruptcy. He then invested about $1.7 million to convert the architectural hodgepodge\u2014U-shaped, three stories with a sprawling basement\u2014into a 6,500-square-foot, seven-bedroom home with five bathrooms and two powder rooms. He created the home for his wife and four children, now grown.The property is for sale for \u20ac3.5 million, or about $3.97 million.The transformation includes, for example, underfloor heating and an outdoor pool. A cluster of south-facing rooms where the tavern\u2019s clientele once likely drank white-wine spritzers (a Viennese favorite) became a double-height salon, decorated with ornate antique furniture from Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos\u2019s family, a clan of Hungarian aristocrats long settled in Austria.The home is one of several noteworthy buildings in the heart of Grinzing, says art historian Paul Mahringer, of Austria\u2019s Federal Monuments Authority, now in the process of designating the Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos home and dozens of surrounding structures as part of a protected historic zone.Mr. Mahringer says the home was likely used as a residence and workplace for centuries by farmer-winemakers, who would have grown grapes in Grinzing\u2019s nearby vineyards and then made wine on the premises.Shortly after buying the property, Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos had the house examined by an expert affiliated with a local museum. The examiner found what he believed to be ancient Roman traces in the basement.Mr. Mahringer, however, argues that the basement is probably no older than the 16th century, when Grinzing, then a small village miles from the walled city, was first caught up in the Ottoman Empire\u2019s expansion into central Europe.Grinzing was largely destroyed twice, adds Walter \u00d6hlinger, a historian at Vienna\u2019s Wien Museum, citing Vienna\u2019s two major Ottoman sieges of 1529 and 1683.\u201cThe oldest depiction of Grinzing shows the village in flames,\u201d he says of a 16th-century rendering of the 1529 battle, now part of the museum\u2019s collection. Most Grinzing structures were destroyed, he adds, but \u201cthe cellars survived,\u201d along with the wine that farmers hid from marauding armies.The Wien Museum archive contains several depictions of what became the Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos home and courtyard.Both Mr. Mahringer and Mr. \u00d6hlinger believe the home likely was built in the years following the final 1683 defeat of Ottoman troops, after which the border between the Habsburg and Ottoman empires moved to southeastern Europe, leaving Vienna and its environs to redevelop.When Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos bought the property, the basement had an earthen floor and was filled with debris. He made the space into a rec room. \u201cMy children could play music as loud as they wanted,\u201d he says.One part of the project took far longer than expected: the restoration of a Madonna fresco on the front of house, overseen by a team from Vienna\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts and partly paid for by the Austrian government.Claudia Riff, the Viennese art restorer who supervised the nearly two-year project, says the fresco dates to about 1800. Today, the fresco, showing a smiling, blue-draped Virgin, is a standout feature of the area.With the Ottoman sieges a distant memory, Viennese in the early 19th-century started to see the Grinzing vineyards and taverns as a pleasure destination. A few houses down from Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos, a plaque commemorates composer Franz Schubert\u2019s many visits to the village, incorporated into the city in the 1890s.After World War II, Grinzing became a hot spot, and by the 1950s, the future Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos home, then called Das Alte Haus (the Old House), had become a celebrity stomping ground, says area native Michael Lenzenhofer. It was more of an upscale restaurant than a traditional wine tavern. \u201cCelebrities arrived in Grinzing in Rolls-Royces,\u201d he says.The establishment likely began a spiral downward in the 1980s, in conjunction with a change in ownership and a courting of the mass-tourism trade.These days, Grinzing is being transformed by rising real-estate prices. The number of Viennese homes sold at or above \u20ac1 million has jumped more than 50% since 2012. Mr. Bakalarz-Z\u00e1kos thinks the time is right to pass its value onto his children.

But, getting it right takes more than just unbuttoning.There is a lot to consider. The collar shouldn\u2019t droop. The top and second buttons shouldn\u2019t be so far apart that man cleavage is exposed when the first button is undone. The lapel on the suit jacket or sport coat shouldn\u2019t swallow the ends of the collar.\u201cDifficult,\u201d is how       Andrew Downing,        of Columbus, Ohio, described figuring out how to wear a suit without a tie. The 23-year-old was set on wearing the look to a high-school sports award show. \u201cI wanted to try something a little more casual and be confident with it,\u201d said Mr. Downing, creative director of Varsity Magazine, which chronicles high-school athletics.After conducting tryouts with a few shirts in front of the mirror, he \u201cwas running into trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them, the collar is a little too flimsy. The collar can\u2019t be too flimsy. But it can\u2019t be too stiff either because you\u2019re going for a casual look.\u201d Ultimately unsatisfied with his collars, he gave up and went with a V-neck T-shirt instead.Some shirt makers are helping men nail down the open-collar look.Eton, a nearly 90-year old Swedish company whose shirts are sold at Bloomingdale\u2019s, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue, plans to debut next month a shirt line where collars come with buttons hidden underneath to help keep the collar from drooping, flapping or otherwise losing its place, especially when worn without a tie. \u201cInstead of a button-down, you have a button-under,\u201d said creative director       Sebastian Dollinger.Thomas Pink, the upscale British shirtmaker, carries a line of shirts with a \u201cspecially engineered independent collar, designed to be worn independent of a tie,\u201d the company says. The collar was designed to support itself and be more stiff than traditional collars, so that it rests perfectly under a jacket, according to the company.Specialty retailer       Sid Mashburn       calls out which collar works best for the no-tie look in the options menu for its new made-to-measurement shirt program. \u201cHands-down our most versatile collar... a spread [collar] can go as dressy as black-tie and as casual as no-tie,\u201d a description reads online.The store, with locations in Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., in addition to its Atlanta flagship, also developed a taller collar for its ready-to-wear dress-shirt line so the shirt \u201cstands above the collar line of the suit jacket or the sport coat,\u201d said Sid Mashburn, the retailer\u2019s founder and designer. \u201cIt\u2019s even better without a tie. It gives it a little more prominence.\u201d An extra piece of interlining where the collar band meets the collar also gives it shape and \u201ca little lift,\u201d he said.Without the proper collar, the no-tie, unbuttoned shirt look can come off as slovenly rather than stylish.Julie Rath,        a men\u2019s image and style consultant, directs men she helps to shirts with medium-to-full spread collars, \u201cwhich will sit nicely\u201d under a lapel, she said.A spread collar refers to its width, specifically to how far the ends are spread from each other. The collar extends out rather than down. The wider the spread, the more formal the shirt is considered, making a tie less optional since there is so much open space about the neck. A moderate spread collar is viewed as borderline formal and casual, making it work better with an open collar than most others.A straight or point collar is narrower with longer ends and is considered more formal, almost always worn with a tie. \u201cOpen collar can look really awkward with a straight or point collar,\u201d Ms. Rath said. Even if men can get part of the long point collar to sit flat under the lapel, \u201cinevitably as you move throughout the day, one side, and sometimes both, end up winging up and out while the other side stays down,\u201d Ms. Rath said.The decline in tie-wearing over the years has prompted shirt makers to put more thought into men\u2019s bare necks. \u201cWhen looking at introducing new collar shapes into the ready-to-wear collection we now always consider what it looks like without a tie as importantly as it does with one,\u201d said Dean Gomilsek-Cole, head designer at high-end British clothier Turnbull & Asser, which now offers many collars that can be worn with or without a tie. Its most popular is the Classic T&A collar, which is shaped to sit over a wearer\u2019s collarbone without needing a tie to maintain its shape.Men also have to think about how high the second and third button are so that when the top button is undone, the collar looks relaxed and fits neatly under a jacket, without spreading so open and exposing too much chest.\u201cDepending on the client\u2019s height and torso length, one button undone can hit too high on the chest and read as stuffy, whereas two buttons undone can hit too low and read as trying too hard to look swanky,\u201d said Ms. Rath, who is also the founder of NextLevelStyle.com, an online style course for men. Ms. Rath often brings clients to get custom shirts made so they can specify button placement.Eton relaunched a higher collar on its shirts last year. The extra 1 centimeter in height makes the collar stand up more while the strategic higher placement of the second button from the top keeps an open collar from veering too low.For an extra guarantee that the collar won\u2019t droop or flap, hang on to those plastic or metal collar stays that come with new shirts. Take them out when getting shirts laundered and pop them back in when you\u2019re ready to wear.Write to Ray A.

Vantiv has until Aug. 1 to make a firm offer.J.P. Morgan, which had been looking at Worldpay, said it was \u201cat a very early stage in considering\u201d a bid but decided against the move without providing a reason.Payments businesses are under pressure to join forces in part to cut costs as greater regulatory scrutiny and rising competition from technology startups squeeze the fees of incumbents. Worldpay rival Nets AS said last week it had been approached by suitors. In April,             Mastercard Inc.       received regulatory approval to acquire payment-technology firm VocaLink Holdings Ltd. for about $920 million.Ohio-based Vantiv helps merchants, banks and credit unions accept credit- and debit-card payments, as well as gift cards and online payments mainly in the U.S. By acquiring Worldpay, Vantiv would bolster its U.S. position and gain access to the U.K., markets where Worldpay processes millions of payments daily in stores, online and on mobile phones.Vantiv and Worldpay said they have identified \u201csubstantial\u201d opportunities for cost reductions, without disclosing how much or where they are. They added that their talks remain ongoing, and cautioned that there was no certainty any deal will be reached.Vantiv is offering a share and cash deal that would value Worldpay at about 19% above its closing share price before Worldpay said Tuesday that it had received preliminary approaches from Vantiv and J.P. Morgan. In London trading Wednesday, Worldpay was down 8.6% at \u00a33.73 ($4.83) after the stock had previously shot above the ultimate offer price.Under the terms of the possible deal, accepting Worldpay shareholders would get 55 pence in cash and 0.0672 of a Vantiv share for each share held\u2014giving them 41% of the combined group. Shareholders would also receive a cash dividend of 5 pence a share giving an overall value of \u00a33.85 for each share held.The combined group would be led by Vantiv\u2019s chief executive officer, Charles Drucker, as executive chairman and co-chief executive.

This is a technological headache that payment companies have been investing heavily to solve.Vantiv is already the leading processor of card transactions in the U.S., ahead of             First Data,       according to the Nilson Report, an industry research firm. Worldpay is the leading U.K. processor.But it isn\u2019t the U.K. business that Vantiv is really after: it is the U.K. company\u2019s global e-commerce offering, which focuses on serving online businesses, and provides 46% of Worldpay\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.The agreement between Vantiv and Worldpay is preliminary: There were no details on potential cost savings and the companies warned a formal offer may not ultimately be made. But the outline terms will see Worldpay shareholders get 55 pence (72 cents) in cash and 0.0672 Vantiv shares for each Worldpay share, plus an expected 5 pence dividend from Worldpay.That all adds up to an average premium to Worldpay shares of about 20% in the three months before the offer was made, according to FactSet. However, news of a potential bidding battle between Vantiv and J.P. Morgan on Tuesday sent Worldpay shares up nearly 30%. On Wednesday, however, J.P. Morgan said it doesn\u2019t intend to make an offer and Worldpay stock lost about half those gains.By late U.S. morning Wednesday, Worldpay was trading just 0.5% below the value of Vantiv\u2019s potential offer.Payments consolidation will continue because retailers and consumers want to be able to accept and spend money anywhere. When Worldpay first listed on the U.K. stock market in 2015, it had just turned down a takeover offer from             Ingenico,       a French payments group. Another payments company could yet be tempted to jump in with a competing bid.Worldpay investors can wait to see what the details of a Vantiv takeover really promise.Write to Paul J.

Units of the two countries\u2019 armies have been maneuvering at the trijunction between India, China and Bhutan since June 16\u2014the longest border confrontation between the two nations since the Sino-Indian war of 1962.It all started when a People\u2019s Liberation Army unit tried to build a road toward a Royal Bhutanese army camp on the Doklam Plateau. The Bhutanese protested and were supported two days later by an Indian army request that China cease its efforts. This led to a physical altercation between the two sides, with the Chinese soldiers probably destroying a few temporary Indian-army bunkers.Unlike in the past, China has taken an unusually aggressive tone in its protests, portraying itself as a victim of Indian aggression. It upped the ante by asking India to recall the 1962 war and learn a lesson, to which New Delhi responded that \u201cIndia of 2017 is different from India of 1962.\u201dExpressing deep concern over China\u2019s construction of a road in the disputed area, New Delhi conveyed to Beijing that such an action would represent a significant change of status quo with \u201cserious\u201d security implications for India. For its part, Bhutan issued a d\u00e9marche asking Beijing to return to the status quo ante.As claims and counterclaims fly between Beijing and New Delhi, the issue is primarily about China\u2019s bullying of Bhutan, a small South Asian nation, by trying to change the facts on the ground. Thimphu showed courage by standing up to the behemoth with Indian help.Bhutan shares a unique relationship with India, which is largely responsible for its military security. As per the 2007 India-Bhutan Friendship Treaty, the two nations cooperate \u201cclosely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither Government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other.\u201dIt\u2019s important for India to stand up for one of its closest allies. For China it\u2019s about challenging India\u2019s primacy in South Asia and sending a message to the smaller countries of the region that it retains the capability to shape South Asia\u2019s strategic environment decisively. Chinese construction of roads at Doklam has the larger military purpose of getting nearer to the Siliguri corridor so as to be able to cut off India\u2019s entire northeastern region should the need arise.Rather than underlining its rising power, China\u2019s bullying behavior underscores how rattled it is by Mr. Modi\u2019s proactive assertion of Indian interests. India was one of the few major powers not to attend May\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative Summit, repeatedly underscoring the hegemonistic design behind the plan\u2019s seemingly benign rhetoric. Growing bonhomie between Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump is also an unnerving factor for an insecure China.Many in India continue to argue that New Delhi shouldn\u2019t provoke China by tilting too close to the U.S. But China\u2019s aggressive behavior is a function of its own rise and desire to shape its strategic environment. Appeasing China won\u2019t work.After all, tiny Bhutan has done nothing to challenge China\u2019s growing pre-eminence. Its only fault is that it has close ties with India. The Modi government\u2019s policy of standing up to China and of working with like-minded countries in the region is the only way New Delhi can preserve its interests at a time when China\u2019s rise is upending a number of assumptions of global politics.Washington must respond to the rapidly changing power dynamic in the Asia-Pacific. By signaling that it is ready for a transactional relationship with Beijing in its initial months, the Trump administration may have inadvertently given China a green light to bully its neighbors. As Washington reviews its stance on China, it needs to be aware that Asia is being shaped by China\u2019s rise much faster than many anticipated even a few years back. A tense standoff between India and China could soon become the new normal if present trends continue.Mr. Pant is a distinguished fellow at Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi and professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London.", "news_time": "2017-07-05 12:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-tensions-on-the-himalayan-frontier-1499272511", "news_title": "Rising tensions on the Himalayan Frontier", "keywords": " bhutan, border disputes, china, doklam plateau, himalayas,india, indian army, narendra modi, people's liberation army, royal bhutanese army, war,Narendra Modi,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Two new California gun-control laws are on hold after challenges by the National Rifle Association, which is placing more emphasis on fighting restrictions in the nation\u2019s largest state through legal and regulatory means rather than at the ballot box.California voters last year approved a series of restrictions, including new limits on ammunition and magazines. During the campaign for the measure, pro-gun activists criticized the group, saying the NRA offered only token opposition.But last week, the group and its local affiliate, the California Rifle & Pistol Association, notched two significant wins\u2014including a ruling by a federal judge who found that the Constitution may protect some \u201cordinary\u201d military weapons.\u201cWe had to shift our tactics to be more heavily focused on litigation,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the NRA. California is home of some of the strictest gun laws in the nation and is often seen as an incubator for measures elsewhere in the nation.The ballot measure, which passed last year with 63% of the vote, prohibited possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and required background checks for ammunition purchases. U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez in San Diego blocked the magazine restrictions in a ruling on Thursday, while the lawsuit filed by the gun rights groups moves forward.The law, scheduled to go into effect July 1, would force Californians to surrender any ammunition magazine exceeding the limit or face criminal penalty of up to a year in jail and a fine of $100 per magazine, or both.Separately last week, a California administrative agency denied proposed regulations for implementing a 2016 law that expanded the state\u2019s ban on the sale of military-style weapons. The California State Legislature, dominated by Democrats, last year expanded the definition of prohibited \u201cassault weapons\u201d to include firearms with detachable magazines.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for self-defense. Since then, courts have appraised gun-control laws for their burden on the right to self-defense.Judge Benitez, dusting off a Supreme Court case from 1939, said in his ruling that guns that \u201ccould be part of the ordinary military equipment for a militia member, or that would contribute to the common defense,\u201d also enjoy constitutional protection.\u201cThe right to bear arms includes the right to keep and carry ammunition and magazines holding more than 10 rounds for those arms, for both self-defense and to be ready to serve in a militia,\u201d Judge Benitez wrote.Four federal appeals courts across the country have upheld restrictions on high-capacity magazines, said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which filed a brief in the case in support of the law.Ms. Shearer said no court has held that the Second Amendment creates an individual \u201cmilitia right\u201d to keep and bear certain arms.Chuck Michel, a lawyer who represents the NRA in the case, said Judge Benitez correctly found that the state had overstated the public-safety risk of high-capacity magazines, which were involved in two mass killings in California in recent years, according to one survey.Those included a 2013 shooting in Santa Monica that left six dead and a 2009 Oakland shooting in which four police officers and the shooter perished. The survey by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, now known as Everytown for Gun Safety, defined a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are killed.On the same day as Judge Benitez\u2019s ruling, a senior U.S. district judge in Sacramento declined to block the high-capacity magazine law in a separate lawsuit, saying the state was likely to win.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that he would continue to defend the law. California law already makes it illegal to buy or sell such magazines. A spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra, a Democratic former member of Congress, declined to comment on Monday.In a separate NRA challenge, a California agency rejected the state Justice Department\u2019s proposed regulations for the expanded \u201cassault weapon\u201d law. The June 26 order effectively halts the law while Justice officials draft a new proposal, Mr. Michel said.The law, signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown last year, expands the ban on sales of military-style weapons to include firearms with magazines that can be detached without disassembling the guns.

They have turned to last-gasp measures\u2014including the use of women as suicide bombers\u2014as Iraqi forces close in.\u201cThis is evidence that the terrorists are desperate now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ideology of such foreign [fighters] is well known to us. They fight until the end, until they get killed.\u201dIslamic State has held Mosul since June 2014, when its forces swept across large swaths of Iraq and Syria.Since then, government forces and their allies militias, backed by the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, have whittled down the territory controlled by the jihadist group to less than 40% of what it presided over at its peak, according to an estimate by IHS Markit.The Iraqi army seized eastern Mosul in January, and is now battling to complete its takeover of the west of the city, whose total prewar population numbered about 1.8 million people. An assault on the Syrian city of Raqqa, Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital, is also under way.Islamic State militants have trapped thousands of civilians to the labyrinthine neighborhoods of Mosul\u2019s Old City, using them as human shields in an attempt to discourage artillery shelling and bombing.As Iraqi forces closed in on Islamic State holdouts this week, civilians poured out of hiding and fled west out of Mosul, joining what the International Organization for Migration estimates are 818,000 Iraqis\u2014or nearly half of the city\u2019s prewar population\u2014already uprooted by the fighting.Many of those escaping carried suitcases full of clothes and what little food they had left. Some were wounded, while others walked barefoot in midday heat that reached almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit, their faces dirty and lined with exhaustion.Reaching government checkpoints on the outskirts of the Old City after trekking down dusty streets lined with destroyed buildings, they asked for food and water.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had food or water for four days,\u201d said       Zahdiya Ali,        who traveled with two of her girls, Zainab, 6, and Zahra, 5. \u201cThere were three to five [Islamic State] members in the area [in which we live]. They threatened that if we left they would shoot us in the legs, and told us that all the roads were planted with [improvised explosive devices] so we stayed in a small basement.\u201dOther families were separated amid the confusion and chaos of flight.Umeir Yousif,        17, and his brother Urwa, 16, arrived at one checkpoint barefoot and shirtless, calling for their mother. They said their home had been surrounded by Islamic State fighters for four days before they escaped the Old City through small alleyways.\u201cWe were starving,\u201d Umeir said. \u201cWe hope to go to the east side of the city. We have relatives there.\u201dMilitary forces are monitoring the fleeing civilians for suspected Islamic State members attempting to blend in among them. Men are often asked to remove their shirts as they approach government checkpoints to demonstrate that they aren\u2019t carrying weapons or encased in an explosives belt.After they are screened by the military, the ill and the injured are sent to get medical treatment. Many will eventually go to live with relatives elsewhere in the country or find refuge in a tent in one of the sprawling temporary encampments near Mosul.The fighting has become more difficult as the battle for Mosul nears an end, partly because of the concentration of civilians in the area, said Lt. Gen.       Abdul Ghani al-Asadi,        the general commander of Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism forces who on Monday put the number of Islamic State fighters left in Mosul at some 200.The casualty toll among civilians, government forces and Islamic State fighters in the battle for the city isn\u2019t entirely known.The government of Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi       hasn\u2019t recently released such figures for civilians and government forces, and the U.S. said in March that 774 Iraqi troops had been killed in the operation to retake the city.The U.S.-led coalition said in June that its airstrikes in Iraq and Syria alone had likely and unintentionally killed 484 civilians, including a strike in March in Mosul that killed more than 100.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Mosul Civilians Emerge and Flee as Battle Wanes.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 12:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-the-battle-for-mosul-nears-end-civilians-struggle-to-survive-and-flee-1499263370", "news_title": "As the Battle for Mosul Nears End, Civilians Struggle to Survive\u2014and Flee", "keywords": "iraq islamic state,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "The NBA off-season is only days old, but the drama is basically over, and it\u2019s time to start making sense of what happened over the last hectic week.Chris Paul was sent to the Houston Rockets. Paul George was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The New York Knicks did nothing, which was the smartest thing they\u2019ve done in years. And the last big domino fell on Tuesday night when Gordon Hayward wrote a longform essay for The Players\u2019 Tribune called \u201cThank You, Utah,\u201d to announce he was leaving Utah and signing with the Boston Celtics.The most important decision of free agency, though, once again belonged to Kevin Durant. What he did this summer was unexpected and seismic in its own way: Durant took a pay cut. And that may be what it takes to win a championship in today\u2019s NBA.It was obvious that Durant was staying with the Golden State Warriors after winning his first title and being named the MVP of the Finals. It was also known that he would take less than his maximum salary to make it easier for the Warriors to keep their other important players. But how much he left on the table was the stunning twist.Durant\u2019s salary next season will be $9.5 million less than what it could\u2019ve been, $6.8 million less than necessary and about $1.5 million less than what he earned last season.His willingness to accept only $25 million helped Golden State\u2019s owners save about that much in luxury tax, but it also helped the Warriors re-sign Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, and that means it helped Durant. This was essentially a happiness tax. Durant could afford it. He\u2019s banked more than $130 million in annual salary over the last decade, and he earns more in off-court endorsements from             Nike                   and other sponsors than he does for playing basketball. The chance to win more titles was, to him, worth the price of losing millions of dollars.It was a shrewd decision based on the reality that NBA championship teams are built around discounts. Durant made himself the discount.He\u2019s not the first player and won\u2019t be the last player to give his team a financial break. That\u2019s because it has become almost impossible to win the NBA championship today without some kind of subsidy. The only way to beat the best NBA teams\u2014the ones stacked with two, three and four star players\u2014is to be more like them. But star players can play together only when some of them settle for less money than they could be making.Dirk Nowitzki afforded the Dallas Mavericks financial leeway in the summer of 2010 by re-signing for $16 million less than his maximum salary. It paid off for Nowitzki when Dallas won the 2011 championship. The more famous example of canny accounting that summer was LeBron James,       Dwyane Wade       and Chris Bosh sacrificing millions to be on the same team. That resulted in the 2012 and 2013 titles.The San Antonio Spurs team that beat the Heat in 2014 couldn\u2019t have existed without their own salary-cap jujitsu. Kobe Bryant alone earned more that year than Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Manu Gin\u00f3bili combined, and Kawhi Leonard was still on a rookie contract with a lower salary than Matt Bonner\u2019s.The Warriors, meanwhile, had a bargain even before Durant. For the last three years,       Stephen Curry       has been the most underpaid player in professional sports, the reward for Golden State taking a risk on his bum ankles five years ago. Curry wasn\u2019t paid like a star, and that let the Warriors sign three more stars.But the days of Curry\u2019s discount are over. He agreed to the richest contract in NBA history last week, and there was no way Golden State could\u2019ve kept its championship team fully intact without someone else taking a hit. Durant became the someone else. By accepting less than his market value\u2014which is still enough money to purchase a decent place in the Bay Area\u2014Durant bought the Warriors the flexibility they needed to retain every one of their key players.A player as valuable as Durant making himself less valuable may not be what the players\u2019 union prefers. But the recent history of the NBA is labor doing exactly that. \u201cThis is player agency every bit as much as Durant leaving Oklahoma City is player agency,\u201d SB Nation\u2019s Tom Ziller wrote. \u201cThis is power. This is what pioneers like Oscar Robertson fought for: a player\u2019s right to choose his team and negotiate a salary both team and player feel is appropriate.\u201dThat\u2019s why the biggest splash of this NBA off-season wasn\u2019t any player signing with a new team for more money. It was one player staying with the league\u2019s best team for less money.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 12:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kevin-durant-made-the-biggest-move-in-nba-free-agencyagain-1499271410", "news_title": "How Kevin Durant Made the Biggest Move in NBA Free Agency\u2014Again", "keywords": "basketball,golden state warriors,kevin durant,lebron james,nba,stephen curry,Golden State Warriors,New York Knicks,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "CHIHUAHUA, Mexico\u2014On the morning of March 23, gunmen here fired eight shots into a cherry-red Renault Duster SUV, killing newspaper reporter Miroslava Breach as she waited outside her home to drive her 14-year-old son Carlos to school.A hand-painted sign at the scene said the journalist\u2014known for her investigations into ties between drug gangs and local political machines\u2014was murdered \u201cfor having a loose tongue.\u201dAfter a few years of declining violence under Mexican President       Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto,        the drug war has come roaring back to life.Ms. Breach was one of 11,155 people murdered in Mexico in the first five months of 2017, according to government statistics. The pace of murders\u2014about one every 20 minutes\u2014represents a 31% jump from a year earlier, and, by year-end, could rival 2011\u2019s 27,213 homicides for the worst body count in Mexico\u2019s peacetime history.\u201cThe momentum of reducing violence in recent years has clearly broken down,\u201d said Earl Anthony Wayne, who served as U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 2011 to 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly in the interest of the U.S. to have this violence going on near our borders, both for the effect it could have on U.S. citizens in those areas and for the effect it could have on commerce.\u201dMany of the causes of the resurgence are long standing, including the growing market for opioids in the U.S. and a bloody competition among rival trafficking groups touched off by the death or arrest of senior leaders.There is also a counterintuitive dynamic at work, say scholars of the drug trade: In recent months, voters have thrown out of office allegedly corrupt state and local leaders of President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. That, in turn, has led to the breakdown of unofficial alliances between drug gangs and politicians\u2014what some are calling a pax mafiosa\u2014that had kept the killings in check.\u201cThe local and state governments of the PRI controlled the violence and crime using informal rules,\u201d said Jorge Chabat, a professor who focuses on security issues and international relations at Mexico City\u2019s nonpartisan CIDE research center. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You can traffic drugs, as long as you don\u2019t kill too many people.\u2019 \u201dMexico\u2019s earlier peak in violence started in 2006, when rival cartels began turf wars that eventually claimed more than 100,000 lives. Then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of the National Action Party, or PAN, deployed the armed forces against powerful drug lords who had grown influential enough to challenge government power and control large swaths of the country.30 thousand25Estimatefor full year\u202020NationalStatisticsInstitute15", "news_time": "2017-07-05 11:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/11-155-dead-mexicos-violent-drug-war-is-roaring-back-1499270119", "news_title": "11,155 Dead: Mexico\u2019s Violent Drug War Is Roaring Back", "keywords": "chihuahua,corruption,drugwar,institutional revolutionary party,mexican crime,Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto,political,general news,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,gangs,murder,manslaughter,criminal enterprises,politics,international relations,domestic politics,trafficking,smuggling"}, {"content": "Sherry Lansing, 72, is the former chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures. She is the subject of Stephen Galloway\u2019s biography, \u201cLeading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker\u201d (Crown Archetype). She spoke with Marc Myers.When I was 8, my father wasn\u2019t well. We didn\u2019t have air conditioning, so late one night, while I was asleep, my mother helped him out to the porch off my bedroom. \u201cOh dad, be quiet,\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou woke me up.\u201d He died later that night of a heart attack at age 42.My last words to my father and my tone have hung over me my entire life.Losing my father so suddenly taught me to seize opportunity. I also never liked to leave disagreements unresolved. Subconsciously, I was afraid the other person might die before we patched things up.I was born in Chicago. My family first lived in an apartment on South Merrill Avenue and then moved to a house on South Creiger Avenue a year before my father died.It was a middle-class, two-story, three-bedroom brick house with small yards in the front and back, a stoop, a driveway and garage. We also had large closets. I\u2019d hide out in them when I wanted quiet.My father, David, set up an area in the back for a swing set where he pushed me. My father adored me. He gave me unconditional love, and we were very close.My most vivid memory of my father was watching silent movies with him in a nickelodeon theater at a local museum. I loved seeing him laugh.My father was in real estate and owned a handful of rental buildings. After he died, two men came to the house and told my mother, Margot, not to worry, that they would run his business.My mother said, \u201cNo you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll teach me and I\u2019ll run it.\u201d Mom learned everything she needed to know and worked hard. She became my biggest role model. At 32, she was a widow and strong. I used to go with her to collect the rents. She taught me not to be a victim. She\u2019d say, \u201cPull up your socks,\u201d which meant, \u201cGo for it.\u201dAfter my father died, I so wanted life to be normal again. I hoped my mother would marry every man she dated. I wanted a dad more than anything.In 1956, when I was 12 and my sister, Judy, was 6, my mother married Norton Lansing, a successful furniture manufacturer. Norton was a widower who had two children, Andrea and Richard. We all moved in together.In my teens, I fell in love with the movies. I went to the Hamilton Theatre as often as I could. I loved the stories and performances, and set my sights on Hollywood.My parents wanted me to go to an all-girls private high school, but I insisted on a co-ed public school. I applied to the University of Chicago\u2019s Lab School, a spectacular, nonjudgmental school that valued intellect rather than status.You had to take a test to get in, and I took mine while I had the chicken pox. I didn\u2019t want to miss an opportunity. I was accepted.My junior-year math teacher was most influential. He promised me that once I got math, the subject would be thrilling. He helped me get it, and I ended up loving math.By the time I was a sophomore, I was 5-foot-10 and skinny. After my mother encouraged me to apply for a modeling job at the Carson Pirie Scott department store, I was hired and modeled in shows as the \u201cyoung bride.\u201dAt Northwestern University, I studied for a teaching credit in English and math, and I minored in theater. During my junior year, in 1964, I married.After graduation in \u201966, my husband and I moved to Los Angeles. My husband was studying to be a doctor and did his internship at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, so he was gone most of the time.Then he was drafted and was sent to South Korea. The marriage didn\u2019t survive the distance and we divorced. It was a tough time.I taught high-school English and math for a while, and modeled. Then I landed a few movie roles in the late \u201960s before realizing that acting made me uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t like being anyone but myself. I also realized I had little talent for acting.In 1971, producer Ray Wagner hired me to be a script reader at MGM. At the time, this was an alternate path for ambitious women in Hollywood.I was a fast reader and could synopsize what I read and explain why a script was worthwhile or not. Four years later, I was MGM\u2019s executive story editor.At 35, I became president of production at 20th Century Fox and then left to become a producer. In 1992, at 47, I became the head of Paramount Pictures.When I got the job, I thought back to that 8-year-old girl sitting next to her father at the movies. I wished my father had been alive. I missed him terribly.Today, my husband and I live in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles. Our house is a three-bedroom Mediterranean that sits on top of a hill. We moved in 10 years ago after renovating.The house is comfortable and isn\u2019t the least bit intimidating. Everyone who comes over plops down in our overstuffed furniture and feels at home.I have a ton of photos of my father and mother around the house. I wish I had his old opera 78s.

His time there served as a foundation in wealth management that\u2019s guided his work and philosophy throughout the rest of his career. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trained to sell securities; I was trained to help people set goals and establish plans that allowed them to work towards and achieve them,\u201d he says.

Domestic and global uncertainty has raised a number of concerns for clients, including whether a market correction is coming and whether they should take their money out of the market. \u201cThis is where the planning process really proves its worth,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you can reference a plan, remind people of what they\u2019re trying to achieve, and show them how the current strategy they have in place is helping them reach those goals\u2014regardless of the market\u2019s ups and down\u2014it has a calming effect.\u201dStrategies to weather the storm: RDM uses bond ladders to hedge against interest-rate risk and uses options strategies with some clients to provide downside protection. Yet Mr. Weiner says that the most effective tool in weathering uncertain times is a portfolio that is properly allocated according to a client\u2019s long-term needs and risk tolerance. The knowledge that their diversified investment mix is performing the way it should in a volatile market can give clients the confidence to avoid emotional\u2014and often detrimental\u2014decision-making, he says.Proudest professional achievement is\u2026 Knowing how the firm\u2019s work has helped surviving family members achieve financial security after the death of a loved one. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side of the coin,\u201d Mr. Weiner says. When the adviser was 10 years old, his father passed away, forcing his mother to step in and run the family business. It was a challenge because there was never a plan in place for that contingency, he says. \u201cThe work we\u2019ve done to help other families avoid that situation, to give them the confidence that they\u2019re taken care of, that makes me very proud.\u201d\u2014Compiled by Alex Coppola", "news_time": "2017-07-05 11:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/easing-client-worries-in-uncertain-times-1499270029", "news_title": "Easing Client Worries in Uncertain Times", "keywords": "corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014China responded to international calls to let cancer-stricken Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo seek treatment abroad by inviting foreign doctors to come help treat him in China.China has attempted to head off any criticism around the treatment of Mr. Liu, a central pro-democracy figure who was serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion. According to his lawyers and the Shenyang Bureau of Justice, he was released from jail to a hospital on June 7 after being diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer.China\u2019s government has released several high-profile dissidents from prison to seek medical attention abroad in the past, but has resisted increasing pressure from the U.S., the European Union and the United Nations to let the 61-year-old Mr. Liu leave.Doctors recently told Mr. Liu\u2019s family members the cancer was getting worse and that his condition was too delicate for him to be transported out of the country, said one of the Liu family\u2019s lawyers, Shang Baojun, who welcomed the invitation to outside doctors. \u201cAt the very least, the foreign experts can determine whether his body is strong enough for him to travel abroad,\u201d he said.There were no details about which foreign experts had been contacted, whether any had agreed to help or what access they would get to Mr. Liu or his medical records.The First Hospital of China Medical University in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where Mr. Liu is receiving treatment, said on Wednesday that it had invited \u201cthe most authoritative\u201d experts in liver cancer from the U.S. and Germany to travel to China to assist local doctors. It said the decision was made \u201cin accordance with the request of family members and the recommendation of experts from the medical treatment team.\u201dThe Shenyang Bureau of Justice confirmed the invitations on its website.The invitations come ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Hamburg on Friday, where Chinese President       Xi Jinping       is likely to face a host of foreign-policy questions, including on the situation of Mr. Liu. Mr. Xi met with German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       in Berlin on Tuesday, and met with her again on Wednesday to discuss the G-20 agenda.China has pushed back at questions around Mr. Liu, labeling him a criminal and asking other countries not to interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs.Mr. Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, two years after he led the drafting of an explosive pro-democracy manifesto and a year after he was imprisoned. Security agents have largely confined his wife,       Liu Xia,        who hasn\u2019t been accused of any crime, to the couple\u2019s Beijing home ever since. Ms. Liu has expressed an interest in moving to Germany with her husband, according to friends of the couple.The invitations to foreign oncologists show that China is sensitive to the attention Mr. Liu has drawn, said       Maya Wang,        a China researcher with Human Rights Watch.She noted that in the past, a dissident like Mr. Liu might have been allowed to leave, but that circumstances have changed. \u201cWith the internet, it\u2019s now easier than ever to criticize the government, raise international concerns, and organize opposition from outside China\u2019s borders,\u201d she said.Nicholas Bequelin,        Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for East Asia, said the Chinese government had gone to extraordinary lengths to impose a \u201cnear-complete information blackout\u201d around Mr. Liu to minimize blowback from keeping a Nobel laureate in prison.\u201cAs long has having Liu Xiaobo die in China is likely to result in less embarrassment than him dying abroad, the authorities will continue with the same technique,\u201d he said.Information on Mr. Liu\u2019s condition is difficult to come by. Neither he nor Ms. Liu is reachable. Exiled dissident writer       Yu Jie,        a close friend of the Liu family, said he had spoken with one of the Chinese doctors treating Mr. Liu, who said the laureate\u2019s condition was worsening.\u201cThe cancer is spreading, and Xiaobo is in great pain,\u201d Mr. Yu said, citing the doctor.He said the doctor told him Mr. Liu was being treated on the third floor of a free-standing hospital building, with all surrounding rooms cleared of patients and plainclothes members of China\u2019s paramilitary armed police posted outside. Members of the medical team were required to hand over their smartphones before entering the hospital to prevent any images of Mr. Liu leaking out, he said.The First Hospital of China Medical University and Shenyang Bureau of Justice didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Chinese officials and Western diplomats in Beijing had discussed the possibility of inviting foreign doctors to treat Mr. Liu in China in meetings and phone calls over the past several days, a Western diplomat familiar with the discussions said.\u201cThe concern is that the foreign medical experts will have to work through the Chinese team, so they might not get full access to all the information about his condition,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 11:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-invites-foreign-doctors-to-treat-dissident-liu-xiaobo-1499237594", "news_title": "China Invites Foreign Doctors to Treat Dissident Liu Xiaobo ", "keywords": "china human rights,chinese activists,chinese dissidents,chinese politics,liu xiaobo,nobel peace prize winners,awards,cancer,political,general news,health,liver cancer,medical conditions"}, {"content": "DONNELLYVILLE, Australia\u2014After months of waiting, the nuts still hadn\u2019t dropped. So around last September, Noah Seccombe, a 39-year-old macadamia farmer in eastern Australia, decided it was time to bring out the sticks.For about a week, a team of workers up to four people strong used homemade nut-knocking sticks to hit the macadamias out of 1,500 trees. Typically many of the nuts fall naturally, but last year Mr. Seccombe said 30% of the crop of some trees was stuck on the branch.\u201cYou\u2019re looking up into the trees all day with a stick above your head and every now and then a nut falls down and hits you on the forehead,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty hard. It\u2019s not much fun.\u201dDemand for macadamia nuts, native to Australia, has soared as consumers seek more natural alternatives to processed snacks. Over the past decade, global production of macadamias, which are also used in trendy skin creams, is up some 80%, says the International Nut and Dried Fruit Council. In Australia, the world\u2019s biggest macadamia producer, prices have roughly doubled in recent years.Macadamia farmers must collect their crop from trees that can tower more than 30 feet, and the boom has them devising increasingly nutty ways to extract every last kernel. In eastern Australia, growers have tried blowing the nuts down, or blasting them from trees with water\u2014with little success. Some have fixed rods or chains to tractors and forklifts to knock the branches, drawing local comparisons with medieval torture instruments.Other tree-nut industries cracked this problem years ago. Almond farmers, for example, use machines that grab the trunks with a claw-like appendage, shake the tree and knock out the nuts. Macadamia farmers are skeptical. They are worried their tree, a subtropical rain-forest species, can\u2019t withstand the abuse like an almond tree, which comes from a drier clime. They must find other ways.In Australia, macadamia nuts typically start dropping in February and keep falling for about six months. A plant hormone can be used to speed up the fall, but many farmers don\u2019t like it. It is then a race to pick the nuts from the ground, generally with machine harvesters, before rainstorms wash them away or pests eat them.\u201cI come from a country where we do everything by hand, and I thought, why do we have to wait? Why don\u2019t we just go and get the nuts?\u201d said Enrique Paredes, a Peruvian who has been farming macadamias in Australia for 15 years. But then there are the tall trees. \u201cWhat do you do then? You cannot get them down,\u201d Mr. Paredes said.Adding to the challenge, some tree varieties are particularly prone to \u201csticktights\u201d or \u201cmummies,\u201d which are nuts that simply don\u2019t want to fall.For Mr. Seccombe, that is when the sticks come out. His preferred wood is from the kurrajong tree, which grows on his farm in the state of New South Wales. He bolts a bit of triangle-shaped metal to the top. Last year, workers knocked nuts worth about 20,000 Australian dollars, or $15,300, from his trees.Even with a long stick, that tactic is feasible only for smaller trees. Australia\u2019s labor costs make it too expensive to manually knock macadamias down on a large scale. And there are hazards more dangerous than falling nuts.About seven years ago, one of Mr. Seccombe\u2019s workers\u2014a relative, in fact\u2014was on nut-knocking duty when he disturbed a bunch of wasps. He was stung maybe six or seven times, said Mr. Seccombe, including on his face.\u201cHe must have stuck his head pretty much straight into a wasp\u2019s nest, and went yahooing and tearing clothes off as he ran down the hill and ended up pretty much stripped down to his shorts,\u201d Mr. Seccombe said. \u201cI rang him to come back the next day, and he said no. He probably never looked at a macadamia tree the same way again.\u201dWhen Andrew Wallis, a farmer in Queensland, was faced with lots of sticktights last year, he put a metal beam across the bed of a forklift and attached chains to the beam. Lifting the beam above the trees, he drove though the orchard, allowing the dangling chains to rattle through trees and smack around the macadamias.\u201cIt worked, to a certain extent,\u201d said Mr. Wallis\u2019s wife, Joanne. \u201cYou can\u2019t get them all out. It just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dBetween the sticktights, the rain and the pests, about 15% of the macadamia crop is lost every year, compared with more like 2% in the tree-shaking almond industry.Chris Cook, who manages a farm not far from Mr. Seccombe\u2019s, decided to mechanize nut-knocking after being asked by his boss to solve the problem of macadamia farming\u2019s inefficiency.Mr. Cook tried hooking up a circular blower, like those used in cotton harvesters, to the back of a tractor. It would \u201conly blow off three or four at a time,\u201d he said. He tried a pressure washer, which \u201cgot down nuts, but got down leaves and branches.\u201dHe settled on a contraption that resembles a spiral hairbrush and involves some 360 fiberglass rods vibrating around a center shaft. He mounts it on a pruner. On a recent day, he donned a pair of industrial earmuffs, got in the driver\u2019s seat, and slowly drove the machine through a row of trees. The rods jiggled through the canopy, and nuts came falling down.The Australian Macadamia Society, an industry group, began testing a modern shaking machine in Mr. Cook\u2019s macadamia orchard in June. Early results appear promising. But years of study will be needed to gauge the machine\u2019s impact on the trees.Mr. Seccombe is all for testing shakers, though he is skeptical they will be fully effective. Of more immediate concern is how many macadamias will be stuck in his trees this year, which could require knocking them down by hand.\u201cThe nut\u2019s worth a lot of money,\u201d he said.Appeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Oh, Nuts!

But millennials buying homes are increasingly opting for adjustable-rate mortgages instead.Because interest rates on ARMs tend to be lower than those on fixed-rate mortgages, borrowers can save hundreds of dollars in monthly payments. For example, according to personal finance website Bankrate.com, the average interest rate on June 30 for 5/1 jumbo ARMs, in which the rate is locked for five years and then adjusts annually, was 3.43%, compared with 4.01% for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loan. In this case, if you borrow $700,000 at 4.01%, the monthly payment of principal and interest is $3,345.95. The same loan at 3.43% would have a monthly payment of $3,116.02 for the first five years\u2014a saving of $229.93 a month.A few things to consider:\u2022 Assume rates will go up. Although interest rates have been relatively stable recently, if they tick up, so will your mortgage payment. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the tolerance for interest-rate risk,\u201d says TD\u2019s Mr. Rodriguez. \u201cYou have to go in assuming upfront that rates are going to rise. You could be in for a nice surprise if they go down, but more often than not, you\u2019re not going to get that surprise.\u201d\u2022 Consider the caps. When rates reset after the initial loan period, most ARMs are capped at 2 percentage points per adjustment\u2014whether rates increase or decrease. There\u2019s also a 6 percentage point cap on increases over the life of the loan. Ms. Weil says that under the qualified-mortgage rules of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, lenders must consider ARM borrowers at the highest potential rate over the first five years of the loan, rather than the initial rate, so that helps to ensure borrowers can afford the loan if rates increase.\u2022 Learn the lingo. Understand how your ARM works. Each ARM has not only a cap, but also an index, which is the benchmark interest rate upon which adjustments are based. That index is commonly the prime rate or Libor. There\u2019s also the margin\u2014the percentage interest rate, commonly 2 percentage points, added to or subtracted from the index when the loan adjusts. The index benchmark is variable, but the margin is constant throughout the life of the mortgage. If you\u2019re not sure how the loan works, ask your lender or financial adviser.ARMs are popular with millennials because these borrowers are more mobile, says John Walsh, chairman of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage Services, where millennials applying for 7/1 ARMS increased 18% this year through June 15, compared with the same period a year ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to work at GE for the next 30 years,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of them will move to accelerate their career path, so they\u2019re not going to stay in the house as long.\u201dDespite the potential for savings, the vast majority of borrowers apply for fixed-rate loans. In April, 91.5% of all mortgage applications were for fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\u201cThe majority of our jumbo customers are at fixed rates because they\u2019re still low,\u201d says Ray Rodriguez, regional mortgage sales manager for the metro New York market for TD Bank. \u201cRight now you can still get a jumbo fixed-rate loan for under 4%. But once it gets closer to the high fours, you\u2019ll see a kick in the number of people looking for adjustable-rate mortgages.\u201dExperts say the best way to select an ARM is to match the fixed period to the time you plan to be in the home. \u201cA 3/1 adjustable will provide a rate advantage, but if the borrowers think they\u2019re going to stay in their house for a longer time, then I would go with a 5/1 because that gives them more stability,\u201d says       Meredith S. Weil,        chief operating officer of Third Federal Savings and Loan Association in Cleveland. Conversely, for borrowers planning to live in their homes for a shorter period, a 3/1 might make more sense because that will come with a lower rate.Corrections & Amplifications   When an ARM resets after the initial term expires, most adjustments are capped at 2 percentage points per adjustment. An earlier version of this article said the rate adjustments were capped at 2%. There\u2019s also a 6 percentage-point cap on increases over the life of the loan, not a 6% cap.

The real-estate magnate turned U.S. leader once planned to bring his business empire to the country of his forefathers\u2014which has boomed in recent years as tall buildings sprout in Berlin, Frankfurt and elsewhere.A push by Mr. Trump to enter the market stalled about 15 years ago, derailed by red tape, site constraints, and business disputes, according to a former business partner and public records.After Mr. Trump narrowly avoided bankruptcy in the 1990s, his investment style shifted. He typically puts little of his own money into deals, and Mr. Trump\u2019s German project\u2014to bring Trump towers to Europe\u2019s largest economy \u2014was conceived as a branding partnership in which he provided his name, while local partners secured the financing, according to his German ex-partner.Around 2000, Mr. Trump, whose paternal grandfather was born and raised in the southern German town of Kallstadt, teamed up with       Ulrich Marseille,        a onetime Hamburg politician and founder of a nursing-home business.The two met a few times in New York before setting up TD Trump Deutschland AG in 2000 with the goal of building and promoting Trump towers in Germany, according to Mr. Marseille.According to their understanding, Mr. Marseille and others would set up meetings with urban planners, land holders and potential investors, and the U.S. businessman would \u201ccut the red ribbon,\u201d Mr. Marseille recalled.More prominent deal-makers joined the company, among them Hans-Hermann Tiedje, former editor-in-chief at Germany\u2019s mass-market Bild tabloid and advisor to the late Chancellor       Helmut Kohl.      Mr. Tiedje       didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The Trump Organization didn\u2019t answer any questions related to TD Trump Deutschland, but a spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Trump\u2019s organization had explored opportunities in \u201cvarious markets\u201d but has no properties in Germany.In Germany, Mr. Trump wanted to build \u201cas high as possible,\u201d said       Petra Roth,        mayor of Frankfurt from 1995 to 2012. A few months after they met in New York in 2000, Mr. Trump flew to Frankfurt to request permission to build on a prime riverside plot, she said.But he showed little patience with the German planning process, she said.\u201cHe was totally perplexed that I, the mayor, couldn\u2019t grant him planning permission,\u201d Ms. Roth said. \u201cHe told me: You are the mayor. Do it!\u201dIn a joint interview with Bild and the Times of London this year, Mr. Trump complained about what he described as the European Union\u2019s drawn-out process of approving deals, though he made no comments about his failed attempt in Germany.Land-development plans didn\u2019t allow for a skyscraper on Mr. Trump\u2019s favored spot in Frankfurt, Ms. Roth said, so the focus of TD Trump Deutschland instead turned to affluent Stuttgart, one of Germany\u2019s main industrial hubs, further south.Stuttgart\u2019s mayor at the time,       Wolfgang Schuster,        and other city officials were initially smitten by the idea of a Trump tower, with apartments, offices, a hotel and restaurant, according to local residents and the minutes of a meeting of the local council, which decides on major projects. Also, Mr. Trump\u2019s German venture had promised to generate about a 1,000 new jobs in the city, Mr. Schuster said, according to the minutes.In 2001, Schweger and Partner architects won a design competition with a sketch of a 200-meter high tower with a \u201ctransparent crown at the top,\u201d according to the architect\u2019s web site.However, some residents were concerned the building would dwarf everything else in the city, where the tallest buildings stand around 75 meters (around 250 feet). Also, some city officials doubted the tower would find enough tenants, according to the minutes.The council in early 2003 voted to end discussion, pulling the plug on the project, the minutes showed. The decision was partly motivated by the failure of TD Trump Deutschland to present \u201ca reliable\u201d financing plan, according to another council document.Another plan for a Trump Tower at Berlin\u2019s busy Alexanderplatz square had also stalled. Mr. Marseille said ground conditions were mainly to blame\u2014Berlin\u2019s wet, sandy ground and the square\u2019s dense subway network mean erecting a skyscraper there is particularly challenging.As plans for a Trump tower in Germany floundered, the business partners began to quarrel. In late 2004, Mr. Marseille\u2019s company took Mr. Trump\u2019s organization to court, alleging that it had yet to pay for its stake in TD Trump Deutschland.The written ruling by Berlin\u2019s district court from March 2006 showed that while the Trump Organization and Marseille-Kliniken AG had agreed to set up TD Trump Deutschland as 50-50 venture, Marseille-Kliniken paid the entire equity of \u20ac4 million between April 2000 and November 2002, expecting to get half back.The court ruling also showed that the Trump Organization didn\u2019t inject any equity into the joint venture. But the court found in favor of Mr. Trump\u2019s organization, citing a clause in the contract that gave it the right to withhold payment.Mr. Trump\u2019s organization said at the time that none of the building projects ever came to fruition and that therefore earlier agreements were no longer valid.\u201cIt was a costly adventure,\u201d said Mr. Marseille.Write to Nina Adam at nina.adam@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 10:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-returns-to-germany-where-his-push-for-towers-was-frustrated-1499266370", "news_title": "Trump Returns to Germany, Where His Push for Towers Was Frustrated", "keywords": "building regulations,city planning,construction,g20,group of 20,planning,trump,trump germany,us politics,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       and China\u2019s President       Xi Jinping       pledged to boost economic cooperation between their countries as they met ahead of what is expected to be an unusually tense international summit on Friday.\u201cWe are very happy to see that thanks to efforts from both sides, Chinese-German relations have entered a new phase,\u201d Mr. Xi said Wednesday, according to a German translation of his remarks.U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, his threats to crack down on abuse of free trade, and his withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord have brought Germany and China, two of the world\u2019s largest exporters and both defenders of the climate agreement, closer together.This new closeness is expected to feature prominently later this week when Ms. Merkel chairs this year\u2019s G-20 summit of the world\u2019s largest economies, which will force her into a delicate balancing act between her commitment to the Western alliance and her professed aversion to Mr. Trump\u2019s international agenda.\u201cEconomic relations between China and Germany are of course very important,\u201d Ms. Merkel told a joint press conference with Mr. Xi. \u201cWe don\u2019t only exchange goods, but we\u2019re also cooperating more and more in technological areas.\u201dIf the value of exports and imports are combined, China beat the U.S. and France to become Germany\u2019s leading trading partner for the first time last year. Germany exported \u20ac76.1 billion ($86.4 billion) of goods to China, making the Asian giant its fifth-largest export partner, and imports from China reached \u20ac93.8 billion, making it Germany\u2019s biggest supplier.The two-day G-20 summit starts Friday in Hamburg. European delegates have said they would confront Mr. Trump on his trade stance and on his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.Ms. Merkel said she expected difficult negotiations.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to bring together all 20 countries with all their developments and positions,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet what the final result will look like.\u201dApart from conflicting views on free trade, climate protection is seen as the main stumbling block at the G-20 meeting. China, the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon ahead of the U.S., has said it would stick to its commitments under the Paris deal, which saw more than 190 countries pledge to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.In separate comments published Wednesday, Ms. Merkel also took direct aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy.The U.S. view of globalization, she told the Die Zeit weekly, was \u201cnot about a win-win situation but about winners and losers\u2026 Not just the few should benefit from economic progress. Everybody should participate.\u201dSeveral commercial deals were signed on Wednesday, timed to the meeting between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Xi. These included an agreement between car maker             Daimler AG       and             BAIC Motor Corp.       to develop electric cars; strategic partnerships between industrial conglomerate             Siemens AG       and Chinese companies; and a Chinese order for 140 aircraft from             Airbus SE.

The unemployment rate\u00a0sits at 4.3%,\u00a0the lowest in 16 years, suggesting the economy has reached, or nearly reached, full capacity.Expansions don\u2019t die of old age, economists like to say.\u00a0On the other hand,\u00a0should we really assume this one will be a record breaker?\u00a0From\u00a0a level this low,\u00a0unemployment\u00a0has more room to go up than down. Another ominous sign:\u00a0Central banks are tightening monetary policy, which has\u00a0preceded\u00a0every recession. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0has raised rates three times since December\u00a0and last week central banks in Britain, the\u00a0eurozone\u00a0and\u00a0Canada all hinted\u00a0that years of easy money were\u00a0coming to an end.Still, the presence of recession preconditions isn\u2019t enough to say one is imminent.\u00a0To understand implied volatility, think of\u00a0hurricane insurance.\u00a0Right after a storm, homeowners are more anxious to have coverage,\u00a0even\u00a0as insurers withdraw, which of course means premiums spike.\u00a0As\u00a0years go\u00a0by without another\u00a0hurricane, homeowners\u00a0let\u00a0their\u00a0coverage\u00a0lapse, insurers return and\u00a0premiums\u00a0drop.\u00a0Similarly, implied volatility\u00a0is low\u00a0today because\u00a0years without a\u00a0financial calamity\u00a0have sapped demand for hedging\u00a0while enticing\u00a0sellers\u00a0with the prospect of\u00a0steady income in exchange for potentially huge losses.\u00a0But just as hurricane premiums don\u2019t predict the next hurricane, low implied volatility tells us\u00a0nothing about\u00a0whether or\u00a0when\u00a0a\u00a0downdraft\u00a0will\u00a0actually\u00a0come.Similarly, when\u00a0unemployment got nearly this low in 1989 and again in 2006, a recession was\u00a0about\u00a0a year away; but in\u00a01998, it was three years away, and in 1965, four years.\u00a0A narrowing spread between short-term\u00a0interest\u00a0rates and\u00a0long-term rates\u00a0comparable to the present has happened\u00a012 times since\u00a01962,\u00a0and only\u00a0five\u00a0times\u00a0did recession follow within two years.But if today\u2019s conditions don\u2019t dictate a recession or a market meltdown, they expose vulnerabilities that make either more likely in the face of some\u00a0catalyzing event.When \u200bgrowth is steady and interest rates are low for years, investors and businesses\u00a0behave as if\u00a0those conditions will last forever.\u00a0That\u2019s why even\u00a0with muted\u00a0economic growth,\u00a0stocks are trading at\u00a0a historically high\u00a022\u00a0times the past year\u2019s earnings. It\u2019s also why home prices have returned to their pre-crisis peaks in major American cities. Real estate has scaled even greater\u00a0heights in Australia, Canada and\u00a0parts of\u00a0China,\u00a0which\u00a0exhibit some of\u00a0the same lax lending and\u00a0wishful thinking\u00a0that underlay\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0housing bubble a decade ago.Companies meanwhile have responded to\u00a0slow,\u00a0stable growth\u00a0and low rates by borrowing heavily,\u00a0often to buy back stock or\u00a0pay\u00a0dividends. Corporate debt\u00a0as a share of\u00a0economic output\u00a0is\u00a0at\u00a0levels\u00a0last seen\u00a0just before the past two recessions.When everyone acts as if steady growth and low volatility will last forever, it\u00a0guarantees they won\u2019t.\u00a0Once asset prices fall,\u00a0the flow of credit that sustained\u00a0them\u00a0dries up,\u00a0aggravating the correction.\u00a0Corporate leverage is at levels that in the past led to weakening corporate bond prices and greater equity volatility,\u00a0says Jonathan\u00a0Tepper, founder of Variant.\u00a0\u201cA high\u00a0proportion of companies\u00a0won\u2019t be able to pay back debt.\u201d\u00a0A\u00a0selloff\u00a0in\u00a0corporate bonds\u00a0and\u00a0stocks could become self-reinforcing as those who insured against such a move sell into it to limit their own losses.Of course,\u00a0some things are different this time.\u00a0The postcrisis regulatory crackdown\u00a0means\u00a0if asset prices fall, they\u00a0probably won\u2019t\u00a0take\u00a0banks\u00a0down\u00a0with them.\u00a0Last week       Janet Yellen,        the Fed chairwoman, said she thought there wouldn\u2019t be another financial crisis \u201cin our lifetimes.\u201d\u00a0Fair enough: crises as catastrophic as the last\u00a0happen twice a century. But small\u00a0crises\u00a0are inevitable\u00a0as risk\u00a0migrates to\u00a0financial players who haven\u2019t\u00a0drawn the attention of\u00a0regulators.\u00a0\u201cElevated asset valuation pressures today may be indicative of rising vulnerabilities tomorrow,\u201d Fed vice chairman       Stanley Fischer      warned last week.Inflation is\u00a0uncomfortably low rather than too high as\u00a0in previous cycles, which makes it less likely central banks will have to\u00a0raise interest rates\u00a0sharply or rapidly. But in a world with permanently lower inflation and growth, businesses will struggle to earn their way out of debt, and interest rates will bite at lower levels than before.\u00a0This confronts the Fed with a dilemma.\u00a0If\u00a0bond\u00a0yields\u00a0remain around 2%\u00a0to 2.5%, the\u00a0Fed may be playing with fire\u00a0by pushing\u00a0rates to 3%, as planned.\u00a0If it backs off\u00a0those plans, it could egg on\u00a0excesses\u00a0that make\u00a0any reversal more violent.Ms. Yellen and Mr. Fischer, both veterans of past mayhem,\u00a0need to be on guard for a repeat.

Junior creditors and existing shareholders are in line for small distributions of equity in the reorganized company, provided they vote to approve the restructuring plan.Founded in 2002, True Religion sells designer jeans and other apparel at 140 True Religion and Last Stitch retail stores. For its most recent fiscal year, the company generated $369.5 million in revenue.But True Religion\u2019s sales have been declining for several years, according to court papers, as customers moved away from brick-and-mortar and mall shopping toward online retailing. In addition, premium denim sellers such as True Religion have been losing ground\u00a0to fast-fashion and low-price apparel retailers as the company\u2019s new product designs failed to resonate with consumers.The company took steps to stanch the red ink, closing 30 stores and cutting its workforce in recent years while redirecting resources to its online channel. But it hasn\u2019t been enough, as the business posted a $78.5 million loss last year.Southern California garment sellers and manufacturers, which employ more people making and designing jeans and jackets than other pockets of the country, have been hard hit as retailers shutter stores at a record pace.In the past two years, American Apparel, surfwear pioneer Quiksilver Inc. and teen friendly retailers Wet Seal LLC, Nasty Gal Inc. and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. have filed for bankruptcy. In recent months, Los Angeles-based teen retailer Papaya Clothing and menswear business Bachrach have sought chapter 11 protection.True Religion has lined up a $60 million bankruptcy loan to fund its business while under chapter 11 protection, which will allow the company to continue to pay its vendors and a workforce of approximately 1,900 employees.The company\u2019s legal advisers include Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones.

By contrast, it kept its prices for light crude unchanged in the U.S. and increased them by 45 cents in the Mediterranean and by 55 cents in North West Europe.Prices normally rise in the third quarter to reflect higher seasonal demand as refineries restart operations after first-half maintenance; the Middle East burns oil for air conditioning and American drivers hit the road. In addition, a decision by OPEC and key allies such as Russia to tighten the spigots last year should enable Saudi Arabia to charge more for each barrel it sells.But the Kingdom is facing mounting competition from other producers in OPEC, notably Libya, Nigeria and Iran, which are exempted from the group\u2019s output reductions.Amid a thaw between the country\u2019s warring militias, Libya says its oil production has risen to 1 million barrels a day\u2014an increase of 170,000 barrels a day over two months to a level not reached since 2013. And according to JBC Energy, Nigeria added 250,000 barrels a day during the same period following a truce with militants last year.Both countries mostly produce highly prized light oil and have focused their expanding sales to the Asian market.Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s production is nearing 4 million barrels a day for the first time since sanctions were lifted last year, the country\u2019s government spokesman       Mohammad Bagher Nobakht       was quoted as saying Tuesday by the semiofficial ISNA news agency. And Iraq, which has struggled to comply with its commitment to cut, is also increasing its exports, according to Baghdad\u2019s petroleum ministry.Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Saudis to Cut Price of Some Crude Exports to Asia.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 09:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-cuts-oil-prices-in-asia-amid-rising-competition-1499262234", "news_title": "Saudi Aramco Cuts Oil Prices in Asia Amid Rising Competition ", "keywords": "oil prices,saudi aramco,Saudi Aramco,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Mohammad Bagher Nobakht,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Conventional wisdom suggests you don\u2019t need life insurance during retirement. By this point, the children are likely grown and financially self-sufficient and you\u2019ve amassed a sizable enough nest egg to make life insurance superfluous.Or so the thinking goes. But before you dump your policy, it pays to take stock of your financial situation and carefully consider your long-term goals. Only then will you know if you\u2019ve got enough insurance, or too little or too much.\u201cSometimes life insurance makes a ton of sense to keep and sometimes it makes no sense,\u201d says       Bob Gavlak,        a certified financial planner and wealth adviser with Strategic Wealth Partners Ltd., a registered investment adviser in Independence, Ohio. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a matter of getting a more appropriate insurance strategy in place, given that your goals, objectives and financial circumstances have changed.\u201dAmong the factors to consider: how much you\u2019ve saved versus how much debt you\u2019ve accrued; your financial obligations; your income-replacement needs; your health and how long you expect to live; your tax situation; potential liquidity issues; legacy-planning goals; and charitable-giving desires.Ideally, financial advisers recommend that people evaluate their future insurance needs a few years before retirement, to optimize the timing of any changes they want to make.Consider the case of heirs. Some people choose to keep life insurance during retirement because the death benefits are tax-free to heirs. Others maintain it as another asset they can use to balance out the distribution of their estate to their heirs. Life insurance can also give a surviving spouse a financial cushion, and provide a greater sense of financial security while both spouses are still alive.Sometimes people with assets that are difficult to liquidate quickly, like property, maintain life insurance so their heirs have cash on hand to pay the expenses that can pile up when someone dies.       Hans E. Scheil,        a certified financial planner and chief executive of Cardinal Retirement Planning Inc., a registered investment adviser in Cary, N.C., typically recommends that clients purchase at least $25,000 in permanent life-insurance death benefits. This will help cover the costs of a funeral, probate and executor fees and provide some income replacement, he says.\u201cWhen a person dies, the survivors need some amount of money right away,\u201d Mr. Scheil says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be doing a real favor to your family. It\u2019s as much convenience as it is necessity.\u201dHealth issues are another important consideration.       Justin Halverson,        founding partner at Great Waters Financial, an advisory firm based in Minneapolis, recently worked with a couple in their early 60s who had just retired. Each has a term life-insurance policy that will last well into their 80s. They don\u2019t have long-term-care insurance and the husband wouldn\u2019t qualify because of a pre-existing condition.Mr. Halverson advised the couple to maintain their term insurance in case one of them needs nursing-home care and they deplete their nest egg to pay for it. The surviving spouse could then live comfortably on the insurance proceeds, he says.Mr. Gavlak of Strategic Wealth Partners recently worked with a 61-year-old client who had a $350,000 universal life-insurance policy with a cash value of $100,000 and was planning to retire. The client no longer needed the death benefit to protect his wife and children, but he wanted to purchase long-term-care insurance. He used the cash value of the old policy to fund a new policy, in what\u2019s known as a Section 1035 exchange, named after the section of the tax code that allows such transfers to be done tax-free.Sometimes, however, dumping life insurance makes more sense from a cost-benefit standpoint.       Kimberly Foss,        a certified financial planner and president of Empyrion Wealth Management, a registered investment adviser in Roseville, Calif., works with a 72-year-old widow who has a $500,000 whole life-insurance policy that she purchased 10 years ago after her husband died. Her goal is to leave that money to her grandchildren. However, she is paying tens of thousands of dollars in premiums each year. Ms. Foss advised her that she may be able to get a better return by investing what she is spending on premiums in a tax-deferred account and letting it grow over time.Tony D\u2019Amico,        a certified financial planner who is the chief executive and senior adviser at Fidato Wealth, a registered investment adviser in Strongsville, Ohio, recommended a similar approach for two healthy and financially sound 63-year-olds he met earlier this year who had recently retired.The couple has self-sufficient adult children and had amassed an investment portfolio of $1.5 million. Their term life-insurance policy was about to mature, and buying permanent insurance would have been prohibitively expensive, Mr. D\u2019Amico says. The couple already had long-term care insurance, and he advised them to drop the term insurance and invest the money that they would have used to buy permanent life insurance.Every decision about insurance requires meaningful financial planning, Mr. D\u2019Amico says. \u201cYou make the most educated decision you can about your health and lifestyle and what you anticipate,\u201d he says, \u201cand then roll with the punches.\u201dMs. Winokur Munk is a writer in West Orange, N.J.

Donald Trump\u2019s       election raised expectations that a reset in relations could boost Russian assets. But as President Trump prepares for his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       this week, change seems in short supply.Instead of an easing in relations, the talk is of increased sanctions on Russia against a backdrop of continued allegations about interference by Moscow in politics in the U.S. Meanwhile, the picture from Russia itself is little changed. Overreliance on commodities and poor demographics continue to dog the outlook. Growth has returned, but remains subdued by emerging-market standards: the Central Bank of Russia says that for growth to exceed a pace of 1.5% to 2%, structural reform is necessary.A familiar correlation has re-emerged: oil equals Russia. The ruble faded as oil prices fell, and is now up less than 3% against the dollar this year. By contrast, the Mexican peso, which bore the brunt of emerging-market fears after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, is up 13%. Russian stocks soared last year as oil rebounded, but this year the RTS Index is down 12.6%.But Russia does offer a curious kind of sclerotic stability that is great for fixed-income investors. Underpinned by relatively orthodox monetary and fiscal policy and easing inflation, ruble-denominated government bonds have returned 9.4% this year, a Bloomberg Barclays index shows. Government debt is extremely low, at 16% of gross domestic product, according to             Moody\u2019s                  ; sanctions have helped to support dollar-denominated Russian bonds by making them a scarcer asset.Equities meanwhile suffer under this stasis. Take the list of the biggest companies by market capitalization.

A few U.K. companies are embracing a new approach: Scrap targets and make bosses long-term shareholders. U.S. boards should take note.In the name of payment for results, American companies increasingly favor rewarding executives with stock awards linked to complex performance hurdles. Called long-term incentive plans or LTIPs, these are taking the place of stock options, a hugely popular form of pay in the 1990s now tainted by suspicions of share-price manipulation and short-termist management.Experience in the U.K., where performance-linked LTIPs have been around for longer, suggests they are little better than options. Executives might hit profit or cash-flow targets by trimming research budgets or capital spending rather than growing the business. Even when targets are missed, bosses sometimes end up with their awards, over which boards typically have discretion.Governance folk initially took to stock-based pay because it appeared to align management with shareholders interests. But LTIPs don\u2019t turn executives into big shareholders: Most exchange stock for cash as soon as they can. Meanwhile, LTIPs inflate pay, because in salary negotiations executives discount the value of uncertain future awards they barely understand.Royal Bank of Scotland                   is one reformist. In May it introduced a new compensation plan that required its bosses to hold a lot more shares and keep stock awards for a minimum of four years.The move at the bank, still controlled by the U.K. government after a financial-crisis bailout, opened up a trans-Atlantic battleground over the philosophy of executive pay. U.S. governance adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders vote against the new plan on the basis that it created \u201cgreater certainty of outcome:\u201d Stock awards were easier to get, even if the maximum payout was reduced.Norges Bank Investment Management countered with a statement of support for the policy. The manager of the world\u2019s largest sovereign-wealth fund said in April that requiring bosses to be long-term shareholders was an \u201cunderutilized strategy.\u201d The RBS proposal eventually passed with 96% of votes casts.Payment in shares held in trust for many years makes the performance of long-term stockholdings, rather than stock awards or options, the key form of variable compensation for bosses. Share prices cannot, over a period of years, be gamed in the way the metrics that trigger LTIP payouts can.VIEW InteractiveThey can go down as well as up, introducing a symmetric variability that gives executives with big shareholdings a powerful incentive to succeed. And they encompass the other performance metrics that currently trigger LTIP payouts: Cost cutting, top-line growth and other targets will all eventually be reflected in the share price.Not all reforms have been successful. Last year             Weir Group,       a Scotland-based pump maker that suffered in the mining downturn, tried to introduce smaller but more certain pay packages. Shareholders voted down the change, which some felt were opportunistic: Executives\u2019 stock awards hadn\u2019t paid out in prior years. Companies need to be sensitive about introducing reforms after a pay slump.In general, however, the fad for stock awards with complex performance triggers has gone far too far. Executive pay should be structured to turn bosses into long-term investors.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'How to Fix Out-of-Whack Executive Pay.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 08:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-solve-problems-of-misaligned-executive-pay-1499252867", "news_title": "How To Solve Problems of Misaligned Executive Pay ", "keywords": " agency problem, corporate governance, c-suite, excessive opaque executive pay,executive pay, executive remuneration,finreg, heard on the street, incentivizing management, overpaid bosses, overpaid executives,stock options,management,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,senior level management,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,heard on the street"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Self-driving cars may be the future of personal transportation, but they are still forbidden on the crowded streets of China\u2019s capital city\u2014as             Baidu Inc.

Chinese news organizations and social media commenters quickly pointed out that driverless cars aren\u2019t allowed to operate on public streets.Beijing traffic authorities couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment, although Chinese media reports said they were looking into the matter. Baidu didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Who said the road to self-driving cars wouldn\u2019t have a few potholes along the way?Baidu, which operates China\u2019s most popular internet search engine, is hoping to leverage its technology in mapping and artificial intelligence into an autonomous driving vehicle with the ability to navigate city roads and highways by 2020.But Alphabet\u2019s Waymo,             Ford Motor Co.       and             GM                   are all ahead of Baidu, according to a recent report by Navigant Research.Instead of trying to go it alone, Baidu this spring announced Apollo, an open-source platform for self-driving software\u2014akin to Google\u2019s open-source Android system for smartphones. At the developer conference Wednesday, Baidu opened the platform so developers can begin downloading source code.\u201cApollo can be the Android in the car industry,\u201d Baidu President       Qi Lu       said. \u201cIn the long term, our innovation, capability and speed will be better than a closed system.\u201dMr. Qi also said the self-driving vehicle platform now has partnerships with more than 50 entities, including chip maker             Nvidia Corp.      , Dutch navigation maker TomTom,             Intel,Microsoft Corp.       and Ford.Many details on those partnerships haven\u2019t been released, however, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Baidu would work with Ford, a potential competitor.Even so, Baidu\u2019s move to open-sourcing its software and forging partnerships might help it catch up to its competitors, analysts say.\u201cIt definitely gives Baidu more of a chance to succeed,\u201d said       Kitty Fok,        managing director of research firm IDC. \u201cTechnology wise, Google and other global companies have spent a lot on investments.\u201dTo demonstrate the potential of collaboration, two of Baidu\u2019s Apollo version 1.0 self-driving cars were on hand for test drives at the developers conference.Baidu\u2019s Apollo software, which provided a simple interface to drive a programmed route, was used in a Lincoln sedan. Baidu worked with AutonomouStuff, a Peoria, Ill.-based company that provides autonomous-enabling technology, to create the prototype.\u201cThey\u2019re making a system that\u2019s very easy to add features to that you can adapt to different vehicles,\u201d said       Josh Whitley,        the lead software engineer at AutonomouStuff who worked on Baidu\u2019s autonomous vehicle. \u201cNo one else is doing a completely open-sourced version of an autonomous software system.\u201d\u2014Junya Qian and Liza Lin contributed to this article.Write to Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 08:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-head-takes-self-driving-car-to-beijing-ai-conference-1499256279", "news_title": "Baidu Head Takes Self-Driving Car to Beijing AI Conference", "keywords": "apollo open source,apollo self-driving software,artificial intelligence,autonomous cars,self-driving cars,self-driving software,Baidu,BIDU,AutonomouStuff,Robin Li,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,artificial intelligence technologies,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,computing,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "As a slew of Silicon Valley companies confront accusations of unfair treatment of women and minorities, Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business is trying to help would-be entrepreneurs create more conscientious companies.The 10-week course is the first of its kind at the nation\u2019s most selective M.B.A. program and prime breeding ground for tech startups. Students enrolled in \u201cBuilding Diverse and Inclusive Organizations,\u201d slated to launch this spring, will examine research on how to prevent bias from creeping into job descriptions and managers\u2019 feedback\u2014and how to promote stronger feelings of belonging, which can enhance employee performance and retention of women and underrepresented minorities.Students will also review case studies of companies\u2019 efforts to improve diversity with expanded parental leave and job promotion policies and critique recruitment and retention reports from firms like             Facebook Inc.,        FB 0.79%Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       and             Procter & Gamble Co.        PG 0.45%\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, as people begin to realize that inclusion has to be built into the fabric of the company,\u201d says       Fern Mandelbaum,        a Silicon Valley venture capitalist leading the course.Though other courses at Stanford touch on how diversity impacts a company\u2019s business performance, this is the first specifically evaluating the policies of startups and early-stage companies.Gender and racial inclusivity has become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most intractable challenges. This year alone, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google have been locked in public battles over allegations of discriminatory pay practices, which the companies dispute. The sector\u2019s treatment of women has attracted more scrutiny in recent weeks, as big investors in Uber Technologies Inc. demanded the resignation of Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       following allegations he presided over a workplace permissive of sexism. Days later, a partner of venture firm Binary Capital resigned after he was accused of sexually harassing multiple women entrepreneurs.Although companies have committed to stronger recruitment and retention efforts, the annual data that firms like             Twitter Inc.       and Apple Inc. share about the gender and racial makeup of their workforces suggest slow progress.Sluggish improvement and the string of recent scandals have prompted executives and aspiring founders to seek out new strategies to diversify workforces. Stanford business school\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs,       Sarah Soule,        says students have also been asking for more guidance on the issue in recent years.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of focus on the numbers by companies that say they care about diversity, without those numbers changing,\u201d Ms. Mandelbaum says.She has been on the front lines of Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to change. In the past few years, she has spent less time in the office of Vista Venture Partners, the Palo Alto, Calif., firm she co-founded, as her role has grown as a corporate diversity coach. She also teaches other classes at Stanford, including \u201cEntrepreneurship from Diverse Perspectives\u201d and conducts workshops on creating supportive work environments.During a two-week pilot of the new course in May, speakers like Pat Wadors, LinkedIn Corp.\u2019s chief human resources officer, and       Rachel Williams,             Yelp Inc.\u2019s       head of corporate recruiting, led case study discussions. Co-teacher       Joelle Emerson,        founder of diversity consultancy Paradigm, invited       Candice Morgan,        the head of diversity at Pinterest Inc. and a current client, to speak about how the company trains managers to minimize implicit biases about job candidates and employees.The course comes as Stanford\u2014which enrolled 41% women and 29% minorities in the M.B.A. class last year\u2014and other top business schools take steps to diversify the makeup of their own programs, administrators say.Colton Heward-Mills, an African-American student who enrolled in the pilot course, says that while he has long felt passionate about diversity, he was particularly moved when a white classmate in the early stages of launching a company devised a strategy for supporting diverse employees for a project the two worked on.\u201cThis class made me hopeful that more people who haven\u2019t typically needed to pay attention to these issues are beginning to now,\u201d he says.Most companies are just starting to introduce strategies for reducing workplace bias, despite a wealth of academic research demonstrating bottom-line benefits, says Ms. Emerson. Such approaches make sense in the formative stages of a company\u2019s lifespan \u201crather than reacting after something goes wrong,\u201d Ms. Emerson adds.The idea seems to be gaining steam.Venture firm Freestyle Capital invited Ms. Mandelbaum to lead a panel on inclusion for the leaders of its portfolio companies last month. Since the discussion, Freestyle has started developing a metric for early-stage startups to evaluate investment opportunities. The measure is based on factors like a startup\u2019s commitment to diverse hiring and inclusive promotion practices, which Freestyle co-founder       Josh Felser       says have become an important gauge of a company\u2019s health.\u201cWe don\u2019t want our CEOs to end up like Travis (Kalanick), and it\u2019s become clear that the earlier we can get them to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion the better,\u201d says Mr. Felser.Write to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Stanford Tells Startups to Behave.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inclusion-101-techs-future-founders-get-schooled-on-diversity-1499256001", "news_title": "Inclusion 101: Tech\u2019s Future Founders Get Schooled on Diversity", "keywords": "alphabe,alphabet,apple,business,candice morgan,colton heward-mills,discrimination,diversity,facebook,fern mandelbaum,gamble,google,graduate,joelle emerson,linkedin,mba,pat woders,procter,rachel williams,sarah soule,school,sex,sexual,silicon,stanford,travis kalanick,uber,university,valley,vc industry news,workplace,yelp,Apple,AAPL,Procter & Gamble,PG,Stanford University's Graduate School of Business,Google,GOOGL,Alphabet,GOOG,Facebook,FB,Uber Technologies,Travis Kalanick,Candice Morgan,Fern Mandelbaum,Joelle Emerson,Rachel Williams,Sarah Soule,Pat Wadors,regulation,government policy,new products,services,information technology,management,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,information technology policy,workplace discrimination,workplace diversity,political,general news,society,community,education,social issues,cosmetics,toiletries,computers,consumer electronics,internet search engines,consumer goods,internet,online,personal care products,appliances,technology"}, {"content": "Commuters who rely on New York Penn Station will endure considerable pain this summer\u2014but there won\u2019t be that much gain.The extensive repairs that will reduce service into the station by 20% and disrupt tens of thousands of passengers won\u2019t address major causes of delays over recent years.Denise Richardson,        executive director of the General Contractors Association of New York, a trade group, worries that once service is restored in September, people will wonder why they suffered through eight weeks of what New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo      has dubbed a \u201csummer of hell\u201d only to withstand continued disruption.\u201cThey are not going to understand because it\u2019s not being explained properly,\u201d Ms. Richardson said.She added that a failure to limit expectations risks alienating commuters when public understanding is needed the most.Partial shutdowns like those at Penn Station could become more common as rail operators consider drastic action to reverse decades of neglect.Joe Lhota,        the new chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has signaled that he is considering such shutdowns of the subway system, where some tracks and signal systems predate World War II.Amtrak will reduce service at Penn Station from\u00a0July 10 through Sept. 1\u00a0while engineers carry out repairs to tracks and switches at the western end of the station, the site of two low-speed derailments in March and April.An estimated 20,000 commuters will be diverted to other stations in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Queens where they will transfer onto the subway, buses, ferries and the PATH rail system to reach Manhattan.One of those commuters, John Gallagher, a communications officer at an investment bank, said he realizes that the work is only the start of a long haul to improve reliability and that delays will continue even after the work is completed.\u201cI think most of us are being realistic,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said as he rode an NJ Transit train from Penn Station to South Orange one recent evening. \u201cI think we will get back to the levels we were seeing a couple of years ago.\u201dIn fact, the repair work will return Penn Station roughly to the level of service it delivered this winter, before the derailments led to speed restrictions that resulted in frequent delays of up to 30 minutes.\u201cThat\u2019s the goal,\u201d said Amtrak\u2019s chief operating officer Scot Naparstek, who is overseeing the repair work. \u201cOur goal is to return the reliability of the station to at least if not better than it\u2019s been before.\u201dOn Monday, Amtrak lifted a speed restriction that has been in place during preparation work for the July repairs.The restriction has mostly affected NJ Transit. During the peak morning and evening hours in May, on average, just 59% of NJ Transit trains operated on time at Penn Station.Lisa Torbic, a spokeswoman for NJ Transit, said: \u201cWe do think that once these much-needed repairs are done, NJ Transit\u2019s on-time performance will return to the levels that have been consistent in the past.\u201dAccording to the rail system\u2019s figures, during the 12 months ended February 2017, peak hour NJ Transit trains were, on average, on time just 86% of the time.The Long Island Rail Road\u2019s service into Penn Station also suffered before the derailments.A report by New York state\u2019s comptroller found that last year, 87% of the LIRR\u2019s trains arriving at Penn Station between\u00a08:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.\u00a0were on-time. During the peak of the return commute, between\u00a06 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., 80% of its trains were on-time.This summer\u2019s repair work won\u2019t address the principal causes of such delays, such as aging tracks and switches at the eastern end of the station. The tracks and switches will be repaired during evenings and weekends early next year.More important, it won\u2019t improve common choke points such as rail tunnels under the Hudson River and the East River, which were damaged during superstorm Sandy, or a century-old swing bridge at Kearny, N.J., that sometimes fails to close.Other delays are caused by equipment and infrastructure owned and operated by NJ Transit and the LIRR.According to LIRR figures, between 2002 and 2016, Amtrak was responsible, on average, for just 7% of its delays.Last year, according to the state comptroller\u2019s report, the LIRR took responsibility for 30% of disruptions, mostly because of its own unscheduled infrastructure repairs and mechanical problems. It blamed 27% of delays on passengers, mostly for boarding or exiting trains too slowly at stations with short platforms or because of overcrowding.A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the LIRR, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear from the outset that Amtrak has a lot more repair work to do to bring their Penn Station infrastructure\u2014and the infrastructure they control including switches, signals and third rail all the way to Harold Interlocking in Sunnyside\u2014into a state of good repair where it is no longer a frequent cause of LIRR delays.\u201cThe work they are doing this summer will help reduce LIRR delays from one set of switches, but will not eliminate the potential for delays at other locations.\u201dWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-penn-station-summer-of-hell-more-delays-disruption-expected-1499256002", "news_title": "After Penn Station \u2018Summer of Hell,\u2019 More Delays, Disruption Expected ", "keywords": "amtrak,commuters,delays,derailment,nj transit,penn station,repairs,summer ,tunnel,railroads,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Lloyds Banking Group        LYG 1.12%       PLC promoted several executives Wednesday, ahead of a strategy revamp and in a bid to appease investors concerned that the bank had too few potential internal replacements for Chief Executive       Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio.The reshuffle announced by the bank also sees key lieutenants to Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio handed extra responsibilities, evidence of the Portuguese financier\u2019s desire to tighten his grip at the lender\u2019s helm.Executive director       Juan Colomb\u00e1s       will take the additional role of chief operating officer, while Chief Financial Officer       George Culmer       will also oversee strategy.       Andrew Bester,        head of commercial banking and one of the few Lloyds executives once touted as a potential replacement to Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, is leaving the company.The moves follow months of speculation that Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, having overseen the successful privatization of Lloyds, would leave the bank to join a rival or pursue a career outside finance. Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio has repeatedly said he was happy at Lloyds.However, one major criticism from investors was that the bench of potential internal replacements for Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio was too small. Wednesday\u2019s moves were in part to address this, according to a person familiar with the matter.A handful of executives were promoted including Vim Maru, who will oversee the bank\u2019s vast retail business.       David Oldfield       will run the bank\u2019s commercial business. The changes are still subject to regulatory approval, according to the bank.Lloyds will outline its next strategic plan in February, following years of reshaping after its taxpayer bailout in 2009. Earlier this year the government finally shed the remnants of its investment in the bank.Lloyds will now focus on continuing to reshape itself into one of the lowest-cost retail banks in Europe. The new plan is likely to see more focus on cost-cutting and refocusing on digital products as the bank wrestles with low interest rates and the threat of disruption by technology giants like             Amazon.com Inc.       or             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, according to a person familiar with the matter.

CGI 1.27%       is looking for a clear lane to financial recovery. The truckload carrier struck an amended credit agreement with lenders led by Bank of America Corp., WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, giving Celadon breathing room as it undertakes an audit of financial statements and copes with troubles in its truck-leasing arm. Celadon is putting off reporting on its latest financial results, but still expects to post an operating loss. The company\u2019s financial woes follow strong expansion that boosted Celadon to the country\u2019s 12th-largest carrier in the truckload sector, with acquisitions since 2014 fueling the growth. Celadon says its operating numbers are \u201ctrending upwards,\u201d and the company is likely getting help from the direction of the market. The latest American Trucking Associations\u2019 tonnage index jumped 6.5% from April to May, and DAT Solutions LLC says demand in the spot market outpaced capacity through most of June.The slowdown in the auto industry is only getting deeper, putting a cloud over U.S. industrial demand. Detroit\u2019s Big Three of             General Motors Co.      ,             Ford Motor Co.       and             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles                   NV all reported sales declines of 5% to 7% in June, and the WSJ\u2019s Mike Colias and Adrienne Roberts report that left overall industry sales off 2% so far in 2017. Adding to the troubling trend are significant reductions in deliveries to car-rental companies, long the Motor City\u2019s biggest customers, suggesting that auto makers are girding for a longer-term retrenchment. Auto makers traditionally have used lower-margin sales to rental companies to keep factories rolling even as dealership traffic slowed, but now it looks like they want to clear unsold inventory from dealer lots before they take another look at factories. That\u2019s already evident in shipping networks, with U.S. railroad shipments of motor vehicles and auto parts down 4.9% in the first five months of the year.Tesla Inc.       is setting tough new production goals even as the auto maker continues to have trouble getting its supply chain into higher gear. The Silicon Valley business barely reached its sales goals in the first half of the year, but the WSJ\u2019s Tim Higgins reports that Tesla concedes it suffered a \u201csevere production shortfall\u201d of its battery packs that undercut efforts to sell its electric cars. The production cycle has been a major problem as Tesla has sought to challenge the big auto makers that manufacture and sell far more vehicles. Tesla is aiming to become more of a mainstream player with the rollout of its lower-priced Model 3. Chief Executive       Elon Musk       is setting an ambitious schedule, pushing suppliers to ramp up enough to push 20,000 of those cars a month through the assembly line by December. That would demand the kind of supply-chain discipline that Tesla so far has found difficult to find.Export documents are taking a role in a federal probe ofCaterpillar Inc.       Federal investigators believe the heavy-equipment manufacturer failed to submit numerous required export filings in recent years, the WSJ\u2019s Andrew Tangel and Aruna Viswanatha report, potentially as part of an effort to avoid paying taxes. It\u2019s the latest inquiry centered on Caterpillar\u2019s management of its international supply chain as the company handled sales and replacement-parts distribution overseas. Investigators are finding discrepancies between Cat\u2019s filings through the U.S. Automated Export System and documents seized from the company. That\u2019s also focusing attention on the export system, which receives hundreds of thousands of filings every week and industry experts say may be subject to technical glitches. Caterpillar has already faced scrutiny on the Swiss subsidiary at the heart of the investigation, with a U.S. Senate report saying the company had avoided taxes by assigning profits for overseas parts sales to the unit.\u2018Optimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest for at least five years, backlogs of orders are building up at the fastest rate for over seven years and factories are reporting near-record hiring as they struggle to deal with the upturn in demand.\u2019Estimated year-over-year increase in U.S. imports of fireworks in the second quarter, according to Panjiva.U.S. factory activity accelerated in June, with new orders growing as inventory growth retreated.

In a neighborhood in Midtown known as Sutton Place, the East River 50s Alliance, filed an application for a zoning change, as any private developer might do. But instead of a zoning change for a single building, the application called for a ban on tall towers in a 10-square block area. It called the effort \u201can unprecedented citizens\u2019 application.\u201dThe application entered the city\u2019s formal land-use review process in early June. Since then the local Community Board unanimously voted for it, and last week, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, who had already signed on as co-applicant, formally approved it. The application is headed for a hearing at the City Planning Commission followed by a vote later this summer.The alliance has a network of support that other communities only dream about. Since it was founded in 2015, its leaders say it has spent more than $1 million on lawyers, planners and environmental consultants to bring the plan this far.Many of the leaders of the movement live across the street from the new tower, in a massive 485-foot tall co-op known as the Sovereign, where some views would be blocked by the new building. When it opened in 1974 as a luxury rental, the Sovereign also was criticized for being out of scale with the neighborhood.\u201cWe are going to take this to the finish line because we believe that building it right is crucial for our community,\u201d said       Lisa Mercurio,        a member of the board of the alliance. She lives in the Sovereign, but said her own window views wouldn\u2019t be affected by the new tower. She said many other individuals and co-ops and condominiums in the area support the change.The plan would cap new building heights at between 210 and 260 in a 10-block area in Midtown, east of First Avenue. To reach 260 feet in height, developers would have to include affordable housing in their projects.Also listed as co-applicants are two Manhattan council members,       Ben Kallos       and       Daniel Garodnick,        as well as state Senator       Liz Krueger.The proposed zoning amendment has set off a race between the alliance and the developer of the new tower, known as Sutton 58, on East 58th Street near Sutton Place.Gamma Real Estate which took over the Sutton 58 site in March in a sale supervised by a bankruptcy judge, is racing to complete work on the foundation. Once a foundation is substantially complete the old zoning would apply.The slender building will be 62 stories on a 60-foot wide lot that will cantilever 10 feet over a low rise apartment building next door. The building permit lists the height at 799 feet, but a zoning diagram shows the top of the roof above a floor of mechanicals at 856 feetUnder current rules, the tower developers are receiving a zoning bonus by agreeing to pay more than $24 million toward affordable housing at another East Side site.Jonathan Kalikow,        president of Gamma Real Estate, said the zoning application was an illegal attempt to \u201cspot zone\u201d the Sutton 58 project. He said the association was \u201cseeking to protect the window views of its members.\u201d\u201cAt every step, this application has been wholly driven by the desire of these residents to preserve views, not to benefit their community,\u201d he said.The planning commission\u2019s staff worked with the alliance to get the proposal ready, but has raised strenuous objections to it.At a commission meeting in June,       Marisa Lago,        the chair of the panel, said the plan \u201cremains problematic and contains what I believe to be fundamental impediments to its approval.\u201dShe said the rezoned area already included many buildings that exceeded the proposed height caps, and that the area was \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d to exclude many other tall buildings. She specifically cited the Sovereign.The current zoning was appropriate for the neighborhood because it was so close to the Midtown business district and had easy access to mass transit, she said.She also questions whether the new zoning actually would add more affordable housing because developers could get better terms in other neighborhoods.Melissa Grace,        deputy press secretary to Mayor       de Blasio       said the plan would \u201cblock new buildings in what is already a high-rise neighborhood,\u201d and not actually expand affordable housing.\u201cThis proposal would protect the views of a handful of residents who live in a building that is hundreds of feet taller than the height they feel is appropriate,\u201d she said.But       Ms. Brewer       said the proposal was a good one, and she would continue to press the administration to support it.\u00a0\u201cI actually have not seen such a group of decent committed individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never know what is going to happen.\u201dWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/group-uses-new-tool-to-press-ban-on-tall-towers-in-east-midtown-1499252403", "news_title": "Group Uses New Tool to Press Ban on Tall Towers in East Midtown ", "keywords": "condos,co-op, east river 50s alliance,gamma real estate,new york, new york city, new york housing, skyscrapers, sovereign,sutton 58, sutton place, zoning,Gamma Real Estate,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,land use,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues,welfare,social services,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014Big Pharma is investing billions of dollars to tackle deadly diseases prevalent in China, developing new drugs to combat a lineup of top killers that differ from those in the West.Swiss drugmaker             Novartis AG        NVS 0.31%       is testing a molecule to combat a rare head and neck cancer widespread in southern China. American rival             Johnson & Johnson        JNJ 0.56%       is creating innovative drugs to tackle lung cancer and hepatitis B, endemic in China. And France\u2019s             Sanofi SA        SNY -1.95%       is researching a new way to treat liver cancer\u2014one of the most common forms of cancer here\u2014despite early setbacks.The move is a switch from a decades-old strategy of selling existing drugs to China\u2019s billion-plus people, and is aimed at gaining a stronger foothold in the world\u2019s second-largest drug market which has long eluded Western companies.Lung, liver and stomach cancers are among China\u2019s top killers, according to the World Health Organization, accounting for more than a million deaths every year. Those diseases kill hundreds of thousands of people in countries like Japan and South Korea too, offering an opportunity for drugmakers to sell China-tailored treatments in neighboring markets. Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia are among the top causes of deaths in the U.S. in comparison.But large unmet needs aren\u2019t alone driving companies to discover new therapies here. Regulatory hurdles have made it tough for foreign firms to quickly launch their newest treatments in China, largely because they are discovered overseas.Recent corruption scandals have made it harder for companies to market older drugs that are approved for sale here. A Chinese court slapped a nearly-$500 million fine on             GlaxoSmithKline                   PLC in 2014 after it found the U.K.-based company\u2019s local unit guilty of bribing doctors. Novartis last year agreed to pay $25 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation into bribery allegations in China.Western firms found China\u2019s lucrative market slipping away, and in recent years many began moving from bringing existing drugs to discovering new cures here.J&J in 2012 opened a discovery lab in Shanghai, and is now working on new medicines for lung cancer, blood cancers and hepatitis B. Hepatitis C is more common in the U.S. The lab is planning to test its first breakthrough on patients over the next year, and expects the compound to emerge from its lung cancer or hepatitis B programs.Novartis injected $1 billion between 2009 and 2014 to convert an existing Shanghai facility into a new discovery center. In October, it began testing its first China discovery\u2014a molecule to treat nasopharyngeal cancer\u2014on Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese patients.En Li, Novartis\u2019 research head in China, said the company will soon test another compound, to treat liver fibrosis. His team of 600 scientists are running at least a dozen other projects aimed at finding new treatments for diseases such as lung and stomach cancer.Until a few years ago, China lacked the manpower needed for drug discovery, a process that involves searching for compounds with medicinal potential. But a government program encouraged thousands of Western-trained Chinese scientists to return over the past decade, encouraging Big Pharma to deepen research.Like drug production\u2014Western firms have long contracted Chinese factories to manufacture their drugs inexpensively\u2014the cost of drug discovery is cheaper in China, too, meaning companies will increasingly use labs here to advance their global pipeline, according to Vikram Kapur, who leads Bain & Co.\u2019s health-care practice in Asia.J&J and Novartis say their discoveries, while targeted at China\u2019s needs, will also be tested on patients in the West so they could be sold there if needed. Lung cancer, for example, is widespread in the U.S. and the U.K.Not every project will produce a new discovery. Sanofi was preparing to test a new molecule to treat liver cancer some three years ago, but the program was shelved before it could be tried on patients, said Alex Zhang, who oversees the company\u2019s research activities in China.The process of testing discoveries on people\u2014called drug development\u2014is also risky, with projects more likely to fail than succeed. Roughly one out of every 10 discoveries tested in the U.S. between 2006 and 2015 eventually made it to market, according to trade body Biotechnology Innovation Organization.Instead of developing new molecules in its own lab, Sanofi is striking partnerships with academia in China. Mr. Zhang said the company is running roughly 10 projects with Chinese universities, focused on finding treatments for liver cancer, hepatitis B and diabetes. The collaborations are still in early stages, and he doesn\u2019t expect to see results before two years. The U.K.\u2019s             AstraZeneca                   PLC has also joined with universities in China, and is creating new drugs for stomach cancer and chronic kidney disease, among others.Drugs that meet large clinical demand stand a better chance at being reimbursed by the government, making otherwise costly medicines more affordable for patients. They are also harder for doctors to ignore.Local upstarts aren\u2019t far behind.             Hutchison China MediTech Ltd.      , which counts Hong Kong billionaire       Li Ka-shing       among its backers, has sought approval for its first drug in China\u2014a compound to fight colorectal cancer. Additional tests are planned for the same drug to work on patients with lung and stomach cancer.\u201cWhat\u2019s important\u2014whether it\u2019s Big Pharma or companies like ours\u2014is that drugs are now specifically being designed for Chinese patients,\u201d said Chi-Med\u2019s Chief Executive       Christian Hogg.       \u201cPatients are absolutely going to be the winners in this.\u201dWrite to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'Drugmakers Sharpen Focus on Top Killers in China.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-big-pharma-is-targeting-chinas-deadliest-diseases-1499252401", "news_title": "Lung, Liver and Stomach Cancers Kill a Million Chinese a Year; Big Pharma Responds ", "keywords": "Johnson & Johnson,JNJ,Sanofi,SAN.FR,SNY,Novartis,NOVN.EB,GlaxoSmithKline,UK:GSK,AstraZeneca,UK:AZN,Alex Zhang,Vikram Kapur,En Li,cancer,political,general news,medical research,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,health,hepatitis,lung cancer,medical conditions,sciences,humanities,trafficking,smuggling,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "NEW YORK\u2014Police say a New York City officer who was shot while sitting in her patrol car has died in what they called a \u201cclear assassination.\u201dPolice Sgt.

Her ownership interest in Two Boots was transferred to Mr. Hartman in the divorce, according to legal documents.Real-estate broker Warburg Realty said it intends to list the property for $10 million. A final sale would need to be approved by a judge.Two Boots isn\u2019t directly affected by the bankruptcy, and Mr. Hartman said sales have been strong. Some business debt is attached to the property, though, including a loan taken out in 2013 that with fees and interest has increased to $2.3 million.A landlord also has staked a claim in the chapter 11 to collect more than $500,000 tied to a broken lease for a Baltimore outlet that closed this year.The townhouse is around the corner from the first Two Boots pizzeria that opened 30 years ago on Avenue A and, coincidentally, is likely to be sold at an important moment for the family-owned business.Two Boots is talking with potential partners about the possibility of providing operational expertise and investing new capital to grow a business that has more than a dozen outlets, Mr. Hartman said.\u201cThe company has grown about as far as an indie filmmaker-turned-entrepreneur can take it,\u201d he said.Two Boots has faced challenges following the loss in early 2016 of a busy spot in Grand Central that it had been operating for 16 years, which had been a major source of revenue, Mr. Hartman said. To make up for the loss, Two Boots moved to another location nearby.Mr. Hartman also planned to open a new pizzeria in the Financial District last fall but renovations took longer than anticipated and it is now expected to open in six weeks, he said.With its vibrant, funky d\u00e9cor and cornmeal-crusted pies, Two Boots has remained a neighborhood fixture as development and higher rents have transformed the East Village from a bohemian enclave of artists and punk rockers to a popular landing spot for young professionals.As the downtown landscape changed, Two Boots adapted, moving across town to open a West Village pizzeria in 1995 where nearly a decade later Carrie and Miranda could be found gossiping over slices on the \u201cSex and the City\u201d TV series.Since then, Two Boots has added pizzerias in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Mets ballpark, Citi Field, in Queens. Two Boots\u2014the name refers to the shape of Italy and Louisiana\u2014also moved further afield with franchises in Jersey City, Nashville and Los Angeles. Two Boots says its influences are Cajun and Italian.The East Village \u201cis almost unrecognizable today compared with what it was\u201d in the 1990s, said New York City historian and writer Tess Stahl, who described the arrival of Two Boots as a forerunner to the gentrification of the East Village. \u201cIn many ways, Two Boots is one of the last remnants of the old neighborhood,\u201d she said.Referring to how the neighborhood has changed, Warburg Realty said in a price assessment filed in the bankruptcy court: \u201cThe East Village is rapidly gentrifying\u201d and the townhouse likely would attract an investor who can turn the home into multiple rental units. The property was valued by the New York Department of Taxation in 2015 at $14.1 million, according to court documents.The sale likely would force out Ms. Kornish, who continued living in the townhouse following the divorce. An overseer for the property who was appointed by a judge took legal action in June to remove her from the residence, which initially was to be sold in 2012. Placing the building in chapter 11 halted a foreclosure sale that had been set for last October.\u201cI have done so much work in my home to make it my home,\u201d Ms. Kornish lamented. She said she had planned to live in the residence for the rest of her life and pass it down to her children.Ms. Kornish would be entitled to half of the proceeds from the sale after debt on the property is paid.

On Wednesday, Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Geely, said it would phase out the internal combustion engine and only make fully electric or hybrid cars by 2019.The Swedish company\u2019s historic move follows Beijing\u2019s update to its electric-vehicle policy last month, designed to encourage more production of cars that use bigger batteries and therefore can travel further. That should benefit companies that make higher-quality electric cars and cull those that have fallen behind.Annual electric-vehicle sales in China have already reached 500,000, more than in the U.S. and other developed countries. The electric-vehicle industry\u2019s fast pace of growth had stoked rumors Beijing would clamp down on production.But Beijing wants to keep pressing on the accelerator, while avoiding the overcapacity that has bedeviled its other industries from solar panels to wind turbines in the past. Car makers that build higher-quality electric vehicles, with longer-lasting batteries, will face less stringent penalties if they fail to meet volume targets for green cars. They will also earn more of the credits Beijing doles out for electric-vehicle output, which auto makers can trade and record as intangible assets.The hope is that this policy tweak will keep production humming while weeding out inferior quality. It may already be working. Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler said recently it would upgrade the facilities used by its joint venture in China to make more electric vehicles. Detroit-based Ford Motor said in April it would start building electric cars in China.The new measures aren\u2019t so good for the likes of Great Wall Motors, China\u2019s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles. Having ridden the boom in SUV sales, it faces trouble now as its brands\u2019 fuel consumption remains well above government-mandated targets. Few expect Great Wall to bring a competitive electric vehicle to the market soon. Meanwhile, Geely could get a leg up over its peers. For all the green-car subsidies the auto industry has thrived off so far, China\u2019s latest rules could help with a much-needed purge.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 05:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-and-china-charge-up-electric-car-drive-1499248702", "news_title": "Volvo and China Charge Up Electric-Car Drive", "keywords": " china cars, electric cars, green cars,volvo,Volvo,VOLV-B.SK,Ford Motor,F,Daimler,XE:DAI,Great Wall Motors,Geely,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,commercial vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "The eurozone\u2019s economic recovery likely accelerated in the three months to June, according to business surveys that have been a good guide to growth in the past.The pickup in growth has fueled speculation that the European Central Bank will soon consider a reduction in the stimulus measures it has put in place since mid-2014, but inflation has remained surprisingly weak and policy makers are therefore expected to proceed with caution.Data firm             IHS Markit                   said its composite Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone, based on a survey of 5,000 companies, fell to 56.3 in June from 56.8 in May. The June figure was higher than the preliminary estimate of 55.7. A reading above 50.0 signals an increase in activity, while a reading below signals a decline.The upward revision in the June figure reflected the improved state of the economy in France. Economists at Barclays attributed that to the \u201cMacron effect,\u201d or a rise in new orders as political uncertainties ease in the wake of pro-European Union centrist       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       victory in the May presidential elections.Despite a drop as the second quarter came to an end, the average PMI for the three months through June was the highest for more than six years, and suggests growth was faster than in the three months through March, when the eurozone outpaced the U.S. and the U.K.There were also few signs in the surveys that the period of stronger growth will soon come to an end.\u201cThe dip in the PMI in June certainly doesn\u2019t look like the start of a slowdown,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. \u201cGrowth of new orders accelerated very slightly to reach the second highest in just over six years, and companies are struggling to satisfy this increase in demand.\u201dMr. Williamson said the average PMI points to quarter-to-quarter growth of 0.7%, up from 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The PMIs are usually a good indicator of economic growth. While the first official measures of activity during the first quarter recorded a slightly weaker expansion than that signaled by the business surveys, they were later revised to tell the same story.The eurozone\u2019s recovery over recent years has been led by strong growth in Spain, its fourth-largest member. The PMIs suggest the country\u2019s expansion gained fresh momentum in the three months to June, and are consistent with quarter-to-quarter growth of 0.9%, which would mark a pickup from the first quarter.\u201cBoding well for the outlook for the economy is that new orders continue to grow at a robust rate, as does employment; firms added workers at the fastest pace in over 10 years in June,\u201d said Cathal Kennedy, an economist at RBC Capital Markets.There were further indications of the strength of the economy Wednesday, as the European Union\u2019s statistics agency said retail sales rose 0.4% in May from April, twice the rate of increase expected by economists.But the more rapid pace of growth has yet to translate into a sustained pickup in inflation toward the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%. Indeed, IHS Markit\u2019s survey found that businesses raised their prices at the slowest pace in five months during June, partly in response to weakening commodities prices.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 05:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-picked-up-speed-in-second-quarter-1499245203", "news_title": "Eurozone Economy Picked Up Speed in Second Quarter", "keywords": " central banks, ecb, economic news, euro,europe, european economy, eurozone, eurozone economy, interest rates, monetary policy, qe in europe,European Central Bank,financial performance,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,industrial production,euro zone,currency,economic news,purchasing managers index"}, {"content": "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month by a quarter-percentage point and laid out plans to shrink its portfolio of bonds and other assets. But after its June 13-14 policy meeting, the Fed\u2019s statement, new economic projections and Chairwoman       Janet Yellen\u2019s       press conference left many questions about officials\u2019 thinking and future course of action. Here\u2019s what to watch for in the minutes of the meeting to be released\u00a0July 5 at 2 p.m. EDT.An Old Question: InflationBoth the statement and Ms. Yellen\u2019s press conference suggested little worry about inflation\u2019s dip back below the Fed\u2019s 2% target in recent months. In the weeks since the meeting, however, several officials have expressed reservations about raising rates further absent new signs of firming inflation.\u00a0The minutes could provide more detail on the internal debate. Look for signs of a split among officials over how to react to disappointing inflation numbers.A New Concern: Financial ConditionsMinutes of the March meeting hinted at questions about loose financial conditions, with some officials noting that equity prices had risen \u201cquite high relative to standard valuation measures.\u201d Those questions have resurfaced in recent weeks in Fed officials\u2019 public remarks.\u00a0Although the Fed\u2019s June statement and Ms. Yellen\u2019s press conference didn\u2019t suggest any concern about loose conditions it is possible officials addressed the matter at greater length behind closed doors. If that is the case, expect to get further hints of their discussion in the minutes.Balance Sheet TimingThe Fed laid out at the meeting its plans for how it will shrink the portfolio, but stopped short of telling us when that process would start.\u00a0All Ms. Yellen would say during her press conference was that the roll-off could begin \u201crelatively soon.\u201d Does that mean we can expect it to begin following the July meeting? The September meeting? Later? The minutes could give us a clue.A New Inflation Target?Ms. Yellen caught a lot of observers by surprise in her press conference when she opened the door to re-examining the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target, in place formally since 2012. Economists have been debating inflation targeting for some time, but her statement that the Fed \u201cwill be reconsidering\u201d the 2% goal \u201cat some future time\u201d instantly made that debate more relevant.\u00a0Did officials discuss changing the target during their meeting? We\u2019ll find out in the minutes.How Tight Is The Labor Market, Really?As the unemployment rate has fallen\u2014to 4.3% in May\u2014so has the Fed\u2019s estimate of the long-term stable unemployment rate. In June, officials lowered their estimate of so-called full employment to 4.6%, down from 4.7%. But, as Ms. Yellen acknowledged, the correct estimate of full employment is \u201chard to pin down.\u201d Any internal debate on the level of full employment would be hugely relevant for interest rates. If full employment is lower than we thought, that means the labor market has more room to strengthen, which would be a case for delaying further rate increases.Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-minutes-could-show-how-inflation-could-sway-rate-rises-1499247000", "news_title": "Fed Minutes Could Show How Inflation Could Sway Rate Rises", "keywords": "federal reserve,inflation,janet yellen,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues"}, {"content": "Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. purchased a fledgling San Francisco-based online travel firm in late 2015, part of a multibillion-dollar buying spree that earned it a reputation as one of China\u2019s most aggressive overseas acquirers.Just over a year later, that travel firm, Travana Inc., has filed for bankruptcy amid a raft of litigation\u2014a sign of HNA\u2019s broader struggles managing its acquisition spree.Travana, in which HNA invested $27.5 million, faced \u201cinsurmountable obstacles\u201d and \u201cthe decision to cease operations was in the best interests of all stakeholders,\u201d according to an HNA statement. Travana\u2019s technology didn\u2019t provide the expected competitive edge, its former chief executive overspent and the company faced lawsuits from a rival alleging it had stolen intellectual property, Travana\u2019s board said in court filings.Travana has denied stealing the rival\u2019s intellectual property. The former CEO,       Jason Chen,        denied that he overspent.A group of Travana creditors led by its former chief executive claim the firm\u2019s failure is the fault of HNA, and are petitioning a San Francisco court to order an investigation of the circumstances leading to its bankruptcy. The creditors allege HNA and one of its appointees to Travana\u2019s board had engaged in \u201cself-dealing, corruption, wrongdoing and bad faith\u201d that caused the business to fail, and that HNA shut down Travana to hide that wrongdoing, according to the June 15 petition. Travana at one point had around 140 employees globally including half of that in the U.S.\u201cHNA stands to gain nothing from the liquidation process, which is being conducted in an orderly fashion for the benefit of Travana\u2019s creditors,\u201d HNA said in a statement.Charles B. Mobus,        a different HNA appointee to Travana\u2019s board who is a managing partner at New York banking firm Benedetto, Gartland & Co., said the allegations in the petition are without merit. Mr. Mobus sits on the board of several other companies acquired by HNA and says he has worked with HNA for more than 20 years. Benedetto, Gartland & Co. specializes in raising capital for private-equity firms and providing other investment banking services.Closely held HNA Group had humble beginnings as an airline in China\u2019s southern Hainan province, and once attracted billionaire       George Soros       as an investor. In recent years it has been on an acquisition tear. Largely via overseas acquisitions, its assets have more than quadrupled since 2010 to around $146 billion, according to HNA\u2019s website. It has announced around $33 billion worth of foreign acquisitions since 2015, according to Dealogic, including a $6.5 billion purchase of 25% of             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.       and a $6 billion deal for electronics distributor Ingram Micro Inc.But Chinese regulators have recently started to probe the high debt levels of HNA\u2014which had around $104 billion in debt at the end of 2016\u2014as well as other aggressive overseas investors. Some industry-watchers warn that HNA may be taking on more than it can effectively manage.\u201cIt\u2019s stretching their management bandwidth,\u201d said Edward Tse, chief executive of Gao Feng Advisory Co., a Shanghai-based consulting firm. \u201cThey are dabbling in financials and logistics. It\u2019s getting farther from what they are familiar with.\u201d\u2018All acquisitions have problems. What matters is how you solve them.\u2019In previous statements, HNA said it \u201chas built up a strong global business with world class tourism, logistics and financial services assets. The Company is in a sound financial and operational situation.\u201d HNA declined to comment beyond the statement.Another one of HNA\u2019s earlier investments in the U.S. also appears to be struggling. At Nicklaus Club, a Monterey, Calif.-based golf club that HNA took over in 2015, the Chinese company insisted on approving all expenses, according to a person who worked there. HNA took seven months to approve a $150,000 bill to fix a broken well on the course, causing the grounds to dry and many members to leave, according to a member and a former manager.Some Nicklaus employees\u2019 insurance plans were canceled after HNA stopped contributing to premiums, helping spur several labor complaints against HNA, according to the former manager of the club. HNA was also delinquent on a $15,000 payment to the homeowners\u2019 association that the golf club shared with a residential compound, according to minutes of the HOA\u2019s April meeting.\u201cThis is a company with a lot of money, but it seems they just don\u2019t like to write checks,\u201d said the former manager at the club.HNA declined to comment on the Nicklaus disputes.The Nicklaus and Travana acquisitions are small investments compared with HNA\u2019s total portfolio. Brussels-based             Rezidor Hotel Group                   AB, in which HNA has a 51.2% stake as of May 2017, reported its strongest quarterly earnings since 2007 during the first quarter of this year. The Chinese firm has also made, thus far, shrewd bets in real estate in Midtown Manhattan. HNA said in March it is looking to sell its 90% stake in a top tier office building at 1180 Sixth Avenue in New York City. It purchased the property for around $265 million in 2011.In Europe, HNA is facing problems with the management of a Spanish hotel group in which it is the biggest shareholder. Last year, a minority investment group removed Mr. Mobus and other HNA appointees from             NH Hotel Group\u2019s       board and replaced the chief executive officer after claiming that HNA had conflicts of interest when HNA decided to purchase a rival chain.In open letters to NH Hotel\u2019s shareholders, Mr. Mobus said that there are corporate governance lapses in the current management of the hotel group and added that the managers had interests that weren\u2019t aligned with other shareholders. The letters also repeated HNA\u2019s demands for a formal search for a new chief executive officer. NH Hotel didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u201cAll acquisitions have problems. What matters is how you solve them,\u201d said Mr. Mobus in an interview.He pointed to a situation in Zurich, where a Swiss air cargo handler bought by HNA and on whose board Mr. Mobus sits, found itself in a technical breach of debt covenants this year, after a mistaken transaction by an HNA subsidiary. HNA put $800 million into Swissport International Ltd. after the breach was discovered, helping to support the company\u2019s finances.HNA\u2019s involvement with Travana started in early 2015, when HNA\u2019s chief executive,       Adam Tan,        was introduced through a             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       investment banker to an entrepreneur, Mr. Chen, according to a person familiar with the situation. Mr. Chen, who graduated from Harvard Law School and is a grandson of Chen Cheng, a late top politician in Taiwan, was seeking funds to help rescue the assets from a bankrupt online travel firm that he had invested in, according to the creditors\u2019 court petition to launch an investigation into Travana\u2019s bankruptcy. He proposed to start a new company, which became Travana, using the assets from his previous bankrupt firm, according to the filings and the creditors\u2019 court petition.Messrs. Tan and Chen met at HNA\u2019s headquarters in Beijing in May, and later that month, Mr. Chen went to Hangzhou and met with HNA\u2019s chairman       Wang Jian       and Mr. Tan at Shangri-La Hotel near the scenic West Lake in the city, according to the person familiar with the matter.HNA agreed to invest as much as $200 million in the venture, acquiring a 90% ownership interest, according to the June 15 creditors\u2019 petition. Mr. Chen was appointed CEO and represented minority shareholders on the board, while HNA tapped four other directors, according to the petition.One of HNA\u2019s appointees was Shi Lei, a then 29-year-old executive in one of its investment units, according to the petition and Mr. Shi\u2019s LinkedIn profile. Mr. Shi was also present in the two meetings in Beijing and Hangzhou, and had met Mr. Chen before these two meetings, according to the person familiar with the matter. Mr. Shi, who also became Travana\u2019s president, \u201cattempted to extract an unearned and illegitimate percentage of Travana shares from Chen and the non-HNA investors as a \u2018token of appreciation\u2019\u201d and \u201cwas thoroughly unqualified and unsuited for any executive management role at a U.S. based venture,\u201d according to the petition.\u00a0The petition added that at Travana, Mr. Shi was referred to as \u201cAdam\u2019s Nephew.\u201d Mr. Mobus said that Messrs. Shi and Tan aren\u2019t related.HNA declined to comment and didn\u2019t make Mr. Shi available for comment. Attempts to reach Mr. Shi were unsuccessful.Mr. Mobus said Mr. Shi was instrumental in persuading HNA Group to invest in Travana, and was seeking his fair share of any upside in the company.\u00a0Mr. Shi is a bright young man who \u201cearned his position\u201d in Travana, said Mr. Mobus.Mr. Tan agreed to grant Mr. Shi around half the amount of stock he wanted, the petition said. Mr. Shi then sabotaged Mr. Chen\u2019s attempts to build the business and curtailed spending on marketing, according to the petition. Mr. Chen complained to the board in a letter. But soon after, Mr. Tan fired Mr. Chen, cut off funding and said Travana needed to be completely restructured, according to the petition.The Travana board disputes accusations of sabotage and pointed out that the decision to shut down the firm was largely because it had lost confidence in Mr. Chen. \u201c(Mr.) Chen led a team that squandered HNA\u2019s initial investment of approximately $27.5 million, reducing Travana\u2019s cash balances down to a critical level without significantly developing Travana\u2019s business or meeting required business milestones,\u201d the board said. The board also alleged that Mr. Chen had engaged in misconduct after Travana was sued by a rival online travel firm last year for allegedly using misappropriated technology.Mr. Chen denied these allegations.\u201cWe made tremendous efforts to build a good company the right way,\u201d said Mr. Chen in a statement. \u201cIn an instant, everything we worked so hard to build was wiped away. Although a Chinese company is the controlling stockholder, I firmly believe that this is no excuse to disregard legal and ethical standards in the U.S.\u00a0What happened to Travana should be a cautionary tale.

Its troubles peaked last year when concerns over its stability and the flight of billions in deposits undermined confidence in Italy\u2019s banking sector as a whole.In December the Italian government announced plans to rescue Monte dei Paschi after the Siena-based bank failed in its attempt to raise fresh capital from private investors.A Monte dei Paschi spokesman declined to comment Tuesday.Monte dei Paschi faces a capital shortfall of \u20ac8.1 billion. In addition to the public money, shareholders and junior bondholders will contribute \u20ac2.7 billion from the conversion of junior bonds into equity. The government will end up owning a 70% stake in the bank. Earlier in the day, the European Union approved the state rescue.The Italian government used a loophole in Europe\u2019s new banking rules to secure approval to use taxpayer money to prop up the bank, drawing the ire of some European officials who worry that the regime is already being watered down.In December, Rome earmarked \u20ac20 billion to help ailing banks, primarily Monte dei Paschi.Another portion of those funds will go toward the liquidation of Italian lenders Banca Popolare di Vicenza SpA and Veneto Banca SpA. That operation will cost the government \u20ac5.2 billion immediately, plus as much as \u20ac12 billion in state guarantees tied to the sale of the banks for \u20ac1 to         Intesa Sanpaolo               SpA.With the Monte dei Paschi bailout and liquidation of the two lenders, the government has done much to address the weakest parts of Italy\u2019s banking sector, say officials. For instance, with the capital injection, Monte dei Paschi will have one of the biggest capital cushions in European banking.Under pressure from the European Central Bank, which is pushing European banks to address the problem of bad loans, Italian banks have stepped up efforts to sell and liquidate sour debt, with tens of billions of such loans earmarked for disposal.Nonetheless, the Italian banking system is among the weakest in Europe, with about \u20ac200 billion in bad loans. The banks have suffered from a combination of poor management, low interest rates, poor profitability and economic growth that has been the weakest in the region for years.Italy\u2019s banking woes remain a serious impediment to a stronger recovery in the country, which isn\u2019t enjoying the rebound other European countries have seen. Italy\u2019s economy is expected to grow about 1% this year, slightly more than half the rate for the eurozone as a whole.\u2014Eric Sylvers  contributed to this articleWrite to Deborah Ball at deborah.ball@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Italy Spends Billions to Save Lender.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 05:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-wins-eu-approval-for-6-1-billion-in-state-aid-for-monte-dei-paschi-1499178379", "news_title": "Italy Formally Takes Control of Monte dei Paschi ", "keywords": " italian banks, italy banks, italy state aid,monte dei paschi,Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena,European Commission,Banca Popolare di Vicenza,Veneto Banca,Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.,IT:ISP,Margrethe Vestager,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "FRANKFURT\u2014The European Central Bank hasn\u2019t discussed making changes to its monetary policy, a key member of its executive board said, underscoring the central bank\u2019s patient approach to normalizing its expansionary programs.\u201cThe Governing Council has not been discussing changes in our monetary policy that may come in the future,\u201d       Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9       said at a news briefing Wednesday.Mr. Coeur\u00e9 also played down recent financial market volatility that was partly sparked by comments from ECB President       Mario Draghi       that were viewed as an indication of a coming policy change.\u201cI don\u2019t think these kind of market reactions that we\u2019ve seen last week are very significant in the big picture,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said.Markets whipsawed last week after Mr. Draghi said the central bank would start winding down its bond-buying program as the eurozone\u2019s economy accelerates. But his speech was laced with caution and other ECB officials have suggested investors overreacted to his comments.Speaking in Rome on Tuesday, the ECB\u2019s chief economist       Peter Praet       said the eurozone economy was strengthening, but \u201cunderlying price pressures continue to be subdued.\u201d The inflation rate in the 19-country bloc slid to 1.3% in June, some way below the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%.The central bank is due to continue buying \u20ac60 billion ($68 billion) a month in mostly government bonds until the end of 2017. Thereafter, most economists expect it to gradually reduce its monthly purchases and are looking closely at statements from central bankers for clues to that effect.The ECB also said Wednesday that the use of the euro as a funding currency in international debt markets fell in 2016 and early 2017, but the share of the currency in foreign-exchange reserves grew slightly.\u201cThe euro remains by far the second-most important international currency,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said.In June, the ECB said it had switched \u20ac500 million of its foreign-currency reserves into yuan from U.S. dollars, marking the central bank\u2019s first investment in the Chinese currency.Mr. Coeur\u00e9 suggested the ECB was open to increasing the volume of yuan in its portfolio at a later date.\u201cI would expect that if it\u2019s a success, then we buy more,\u201d he said.--Tom Fairless contributed to this article.Write to Todd Buell at todd.buell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 05:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-hasnt-discussed-halting-easy-monetary-policy-says-key-board-member-1499246515", "news_title": "ECB Hasn\u2019t Discussed Halting Easy Monetary Policy, Says Key Board Member ", "keywords": " benoit coeure,ecb monetary policy, eurozone inflation, mario draghi,European Central Bank,Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The U.S. dollar\u2019s performance has been anti-climactic this year, dropping 4% against a basket of major currencies. But investor pessimism may have gone too far.Of course, there is still good reason to root for other currencies. The Trump administration\u2019s lack of policy mojo aside, global economic data has proven unexpectedly robust, posting the longest run of positive surprises in six years. But as investors cheer a reflating global economy, they may be dumping too many dollars: For the first time in more than a year, U.S. dollar positioning, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has flipped from net long to net short.Excessive pessimism about the dollar creates its own worry for emerging markets due to the danger of sudden swings back. During the past few years of low U.S. interest rates, governments and companies in developing countries have gotten used to borrowing heavily in dollars. Any resurgence for the dollar would raise the cost of that borrowing in local currency terms.Such a move seems more likely when you consider that foreign exchange movements are generally driven by divergent expectations for growth and interest rates. Currencies of countries whose growth forecasts had been upgraded the most this year, such as Mexico and Poland, outperformed over the last quarter, according to             J.P. Morgan                   strategists.The positive vibe around emerging-market currencies should ease as the premise for it weakens. The proportion of developing countries receiving growth upgrades has fallen to just over 40% from 60% in the past month, based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s rolling measure. Asia\u2014a driver of emerging-market growth earlier this year\u2014is losing steam, with industrial production growth dropping to its lowest point in more than a year everywhere except China. Adding to signs of strain, downgrades of emerging-market debt have accelerated.The U.S. economy isn\u2019t on a tear, but growth elsewhere hasn\u2019t found as firm a footing as investors seem to believe. There is still a 50% chance the Fed will raise rates once more by December, another factor that should be dollar-positive. Jitters are emerging: a stark repricing of currencies last week after central bankers talked about tightening policy led to the largest-ever one-day outflow from the biggest emerging market hard-currency ETF last Thursday, with $343 million being withdrawn, according to J.P. Morgan. That, though, compares with inflows of $14 billion so far this year, meaning there is scope for plenty more outflows.No matter how fast-footed, investors should remember reversals in sentiment can happen fast.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-05 03:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-doom-and-gloom-looks-overdone-1499240207", "news_title": "Dollar Doom and Gloom Looks Overdone   ", "keywords": "currencies heard on the street ,forex analysis ,heard on the street ,u.s. dollar,u.s. dollar heard on the street ,Commodity Futures Trading Commission,economic performance,indicators,economic news,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "ZAMBOANGA, Philippines\u2014The decapitated bodies of two Vietnamese crewmen abducted last year by suspected Abu Sayyaf militants were found on the southern Philippine island of Basilan, the Philippine military said.The bodies of the sailors,       Hoang Thong       and Hoang Va Hai, were found Wednesday by villagers in the town of Sumisip, said the military\u2019s Western Mindanao Command.

The department required passengers to either check in their devices or leave them at home.Last week, Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly       said the ban could be widened to airports that fail to adopt more stringent security, including enhanced passenger screening. Airports already subject to the restrictions could see those lifted in return for closer checks.The 280 foreign airports that send direct flights to the U.S. must have explosives-detecting scanners within 21 days, one step the Department of Homeland Security has mandated to avoid a broader ban on laptops aboard flights.Opponents of widening the restrictions, including the International Air Transport Association that represents over 200 airlines and the European Union, were concerned it could dent demand for travel and that storing a large number of electronic devices in the cargo area of planes posed safety concerns. Lithium batteries used in many of the devices pose a fire risk.Emirates Airline said it had \u201cbeen working hard\u00a0in coordination with various aviation stakeholders and the local authorities to implement heightened security measures and protocols that meet the requirements of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new security guidelines for all U.S.-bound flights.\u201dEmirates Airline, like rivals Etihad and Qatar Airways, focus much of their activity on ferrying passengers via their Persian Gulf state gateways between cities in Europe and the U.S. and Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The electronics ban hit their business as lucrative business travelers considered defecting from the airline, flying via other hubs to avoid having to check in their gadgets.Turkish Airlines on Wednesday also allowed passengers again to use electronics on its U.S.-bound flights. Chief Executive Officer       Bilal Eksi       on Wednesday said via             Twitter                   he expected a similar ban imposed by the U.K. to be lifted on the airline\u2019s big Istanbul hub.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Lifts Laptop Ban On Two More Airlines.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 03:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-lifts-laptop-ban-on-emirates-airline-turkish-airlines-1499238237", "news_title": "U.S. Lifts Laptop Ban on Emirates Airline, Turkish Airlines", "keywords": " airport security,laptop ban,us flights,Etihad Airways,Turk Hava Yollari A.O.,THYAO.IS,TR:THYAO,U.S. government,U.S. Department of Homeland Security,Emirates Airline,Turkish Airlines,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,terrorism,transport,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "For Volvo the internal combustion engine has run its course.In the face of competition from upstarts like Tesla Inc., which begins production this week of its new mass-market Model 3 electric battery-powered family car, the Chinese-owned automotive group on Wednesday said all new Volvo models from 2019 would be either fully electric or a hybrid.Volvo is the first major auto maker to abandon the technology that has powered the industry for more than a century. Hakan Samuelsson, president and chief executive of Volvo Cars, said in a statement that the move \u201cmarks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,\u201d reiterating his target of selling one million electric cars and hybrids by 2025. \u201cWhen we said it, we meant it. This is how we are going to do it.\u201dVolvo also said it would launch five new electric and hybrid vehicles between 2019 and 2021. Two of the new models would be built by Polestar, the performance-car unit that Volvo is spinning off as a \u201cseparately branded electrified global high performance car company.\u201d Volvo Cars would build the other three models. No further details were available.All major auto makers are preparing for a shift to electric vehicles, but the challenge for the industry is to get the timing right because of the industry\u2019s typically long product cycles that involve years of research and development before a vehicle rolls off the assembly line.Auto executives talk about an impending \u201ctipping point\u201d when the costs of some electric car models are expected to fall below the cost of the conventional version of the same vehicle type. When that happens, industry executives and analysts say momentum could shift quickly in favor of electric cars.Industry analysts estimate that rising costs of developing combustion engines that meet ever-stricter emissions regulations could make some electric models more affordable as soon as 2025. With a starting price of around $35,000, the Tesla Model 3 that launches this week is only slightly more expensive than             BMW AG\u2019s       3-Series sedan with a gasoline or diesel engine.Volvo\u2019s decision to accelerate the move to go electric could help it in light of a potential stock listing. Volvo, a Swedish luxury car maker that was founded in 1927, was bought by Ford Motor Co. in 1999. Ford sold the company to Geely Holding Group, a Chinese investment company, in 2010.Struggling when Geely acquired it, Volvo has achieved a significant turnaround and is building its first manufacturing plant in the U.S.Geely\u2019s wager is paying off. Volvo reported a 67% increase in net profit to 7.5 billion Swedish kronor ($880 million) in 2016 on revenue of 180.7 billion kronor, up 10% from the previous year. The Swedish company\u2019s global sales grew 6% to 534,332 vehicles last year. That put it on track to achieving its sales target of 800,000 vehicles by 2020.The U.S. was Volvo\u2019s fastest-growing market last year, posting an 18% increase in sales to 82,726 vehicles, driven by the popular XC90 luxury sport-utility vehicle.Volvo declined to comment on speculation about an initial public offering, saying a listing was an option.European auto makers that have relied on diesel engines because of their fuel economy and low carbon dioxide emissions have seen their stock prices discounted as investors worry about the growing number of municipal authorities that threaten to ban diesel vehicles from driving in their cities.By contrast, Tesla, which only makes electric cars, sold around 84,000 cars last year, but its market value has surpassed those of Ford,             General Motors Corp       and BMW, which sell millions of cars each year.Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Volvo Sets Plan to Go All Electric Or Hybrid.'", "news_time": "2017-07-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-to-phase-out-conventional-car-engine-1499227202", "news_title": "Volvo Plans to Go Electric, to Abandon Conventional Car Engine by 2019", "keywords": " combustion engine, electric cars, hybrid cars,volvo cars,BMW,Tesla,TSLA,Geely Holding Group,Hakan Samuelsson,plans,strategy,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,commercial vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,motor vehicle parts,automotive,vehicle engine,engine parts"}]
