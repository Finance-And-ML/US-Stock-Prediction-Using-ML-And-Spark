The companies they are investigating include some from mainland China that are already listed in Hong Kong.Even if investors find something they suspect is wrong with a company, it can be hard for them to act, due to restrictions on short selling in China\u2019s equity markets. In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the city\u2019s market regulators have been pushing back against critical research reports on companies.\u2018If the company\u2019s doing one thing strange in its financials, generally it\u2019s doing a number of strange things.\u2019Nonetheless, investors are still turning to the several firms that have sprung up in recent years, specializing in research into Chinese companies via a combination of new technology and on-the-ground investigations.\u201cIf the company\u2019s doing one thing strange in its financials, generally it\u2019s doing a number of strange things,\u201d said Gillem Tulloch, the founder of Hong Kong-based GMT Research, which sells its reports to mutual funds and hedge funds but doesn\u2019t take short positions.The firm recently used satellite imagery from Google Earth to view a large sample of projects owned by Hong Kong-listed             China Evergrande Group,       the country\u2019s largest listed property developer by sales. GMT alleges that the images show that progress of construction work had stalled at several of Evergrande\u2019s developments. It included its findings in a report that claimed the company could in practice be insolvent: GMT said its analysts also visited around 40 of Evergrande\u2019s properties to verify its findings.Evergrande didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The company\u2019s shares have almost tripled this year after it carried out a series of share buybacks.Some companies in China are getting wise to on-the-ground visits.       Sean Chen,        Hong Kong-based director of strategy at Blackpeak Group, a research and risk-advisory firm, said that while investigating one company listed on the mainland on behalf of an investor, his team found one of its electrical component factories in Guangdong empty.\u201cWhen we asked the security guards of the neighboring factory, they told us that a few days prior to our own visit, the company had offered to pay 100 yuan ($14.80) to local villagers to come to the factory, wear hard hats and pretend to be workers to impress some [other] foreigner investors who were visiting,\u201d Mr. Chen said.Some research firms deploy the latest machine-learning tools to comb through company financial data for warning signs. Typically, this involves writing computer code that hunts for traits common to fraudulent firms and then looks for other companies that match.One company using such methods, Shenzhen-based blueflag.io says it is seeing interest from global long-only fund managers who occasionally want to check on individual companies where they suspect fraud.\u201cWhat they want to own are the new-economy stocks\u2014that\u2019s where you have the higher fraud risk,\u201d said Fredrik \u00d6qvist, the company\u2019s founder.Some research methods veer into the personal, as investors try to untangle the sometimes complex web of a company\u2019s so-called \u201crelated party transactions\u201d\u2014deals between spouses, family members and other close associates that may not always represent the best interests of minority shareholders.One portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified, said she had in the past tried to learn details about the ex-wives of directors or where their children go to school, as a way to unearth information on the company.Making negative research on companies public in Hong Kong can be tricky. The city\u2019s market-misconduct panel last year banned short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research from trading securities in the city for five years for publishing a research report about Evergrande in June 2012. The case is currently pending appeal.If a company issues a report questioning the accounting practices of a listed company, their management can ask Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission to begin an inquiry, which may escalate into an investigation. Disclosing that a company is under investigation is a criminal offense in Hong Kong, carrying penalties of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum fine of 1 million Hong Kong dollars (US$128,086).The aggressive stance from Hong Kong\u2019s regulator has produced a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d and has minimized the amount of critical research produced, said       Timothy Loh,        a Hong Kong lawyer who defended Mr. Left in his case with the SFC last year.\u201cPeople want to be much more careful about what they say,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re more scared of what might happen with the SFC subsequently.\u201dAn SFC spokesman defended the commission\u2019s actions. \u201cResponsible research, including research issued by credit-rating agencies and research houses, can all contribute to the overall market quality and price-discovery process and has no intention to suppress legitimate commentaries on listed companies, whether positive or negative,\u201d he said.Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-china-markets-open-up-investors-dig-deeper-1501048477", "keywords": [" china companies, china due diligence, china foreign investment, china research , china shares,china stocks,MSCI,plans,strategy,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,corporate due diligence,private equity,venture funding,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,printing,publishing,database,directory publishing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial services,investing,securities,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-26 18:48:00", "news_title": "Dow, Nasdaq Close at Records After Fed Stands Pat ", "content": "U.S. stock indexes climbed to fresh records after corporate earnings continued to beat Wall Street expectations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and             Nasdaq Co      mposite posted all-time highs on the same day for the first time since July 19.Stocks stayed steady after Federal Reserve officials voted unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged and signaled that the central bank could start shrinking its balance sheet \u201crelatively soon\u201d\u2014a decision that was widely expected by investors and analysts.\u201cThe Fed has done such a clear job in communicating some of their short-term and long-term goals,\u201d said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services. \u201cAt this point, earnings take over and start to dominate,\u201d he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 97.58 points, or 0.5%, to 21711.01.The S&P 500 inched up 0.70 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2477.83 after erasing slight losses from earlier in the session, and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.57 points, or 0.2%, to 6422.75.

Good jobs, as defined by the report\u2019s authors, pay more than $35,000 a year, or more than $45,000 for workers over the age of 45. The median wage for the jobs Georgetown examined was $55,000.The number of good jobs for noncollege graduates rose to 30 million in 2015 from 27 million in 1991, but the labor market grew, too. By 2015, the share of all good jobs that went to noncollege graduates fell to 45% from 60% in 1991\u2014leaving 45 million workers in low-paying, sometimes part-time roles that don\u2019t offer a path to the middle class.In the post-World War II era, jobs in manufacturing and production propelled millions of American workers into the middle class. Today, more middle-class jobs for nongraduates are in financial services and health care. A high-school diploma alone won\u2019t cut it for a lot of those jobs, however.Among noncollege degree holders, only workers with an associate degree had better odds of finding a good job in 2015 than they did 1991, Georgetown found. High-school graduates and dropouts, and people with some college, are all faring worse now than before, the report says.\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that there are no good jobs available if you don\u2019t have a B.A.,\u201d says Anthony Carnevale, the Center\u2019s director.There are still pathways to well-paying careers, but fewer jobs pay a living wage\u2014at least $17 an hour for a full-time job\u2014or higher for noncollege graduates relative to the total labor market. A growing share of those jobs require some postsecondary training, he says.\u201cYou need to be in a program that leads directly to those jobs,\u201d says Mr. Carnevale, such as community college or a certification course. \u201cAnd you need to hold your institution accountable to being able to prepare you for a job.\u201dWorkers are getting the message. The number of career-focused certificates awarded by community colleges, in fields such as electronics engineering, emergency management and video production, more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.In 2015, Wyoming had the highest share of noncollege good jobs thanks to a boom in mining and other natural-resource industries, coupled with a low overall population. It was followed by New Jersey and Maryland, densely populated states with more diverse economies.This fall, Georgetown, in concert with             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., will launch a Good Jobs Index that maps the states and occupations where people without college degrees can find economic opportunities that pay at least a living wage.In 1991, 27% of good jobs open to noncollege workers were in manufacturing; by 2015, the proportion had fallen to 16%; that share may fall further as employers reduce labor costs through globalization and automation. The authors analyzed Census surveys from that period to draw their conclusions.Despite the shifting composition of well-paying jobs for nongraduates, the division by gender has remained roughly steady over the same period. Women hold approximately 30% of those positions, and their lack of access to lower-skilled but solid jobs helps explain why they are more likely to go to college than men.\u201cIt\u2019s their only way up,\u201d says Mr. Carnevale.Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'The State of Good Jobs in America.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-state-of-good-jobs-in-america-1501042549", "keywords": ["Anthony Carnevale,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,recruitment,workers pay,political,general news,career planning,general labor issues"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-26 00:05:00", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "content": "Senate Republicans overcame internal fissures in narrowly voting to begin debate on their health-care overhaul, but the party suffered a setback hours later when a proposal replacing major portions of the ACA failed to attract enough votes to pass.Trump signaled that his next priority is overhauling the tax code to push corporate rates down and help middle-class taxpayers.Sessions\u2019 defenders voiced their support for the attorney general as he drew continued public criticism from the president.The House approved new Russia sanctions, a move that may put congressional Republicans at odds with Trump.Manafort reached a deal with investigators to avoid public testimony about Russian election meddling.The U.S. will issue new sanctions on Chinese entities over North Korea, a State Department official said.Israel removed metal detectors from one of Jerusalem\u2019s holiest sites amid Muslim anger over access.Saudi Arabia and its allies added new groups and individuals allegedly linked to Qatar to their terror lists.The U.S. Navy said it fired warning shots at an Iranian patrol boat in the Persian Gulf that came near American and coalition ships.A U.S. judge temporarily blocked the deportation of over 1,400 Iraqi immigrants with criminal records.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1501041939", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-26 00:02:00", "news_title": "Muslims Grow More Anxious About Discrimination, Survey Finds", "content": "Muslims in the U.S. say they are anxious about their place in society in the early days of the       Trump       administration, but nonetheless show signs of optimism about opportunities in America, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.The Pew survey found that 75% of Muslims believe that members of their religion face \u201ca lot of discrimination.\u201dMore than 70% said President Donald Trump was \u201cunfriendly toward Muslims,\u201d a huge jump from the 4% of Muslims who said the same of President       Barack Obama       in 2011. Nearly half said they had personally experienced discrimination in the last 12 months, up from 40% in 2007.In 2007, near the end of his second term,       George W. Bush       also received low approval ratings from Muslims, similar to those Mr. Trump received in this study.Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign called for a ban on Muslims from entering the country. Since entering office, he signed an executive order barring nationals of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., a move that many Muslims here have decried as discriminatory but that the administration said was needed to fight terrorism. Most of the order is currently on hold, pending a hearing at the Supreme Court.Despite their concerns about hostility toward Muslims, those surveyed still held warm feelings for the country. More than 90% said they were proud to be American; 70% said most people can get ahead through hard work.Pew surveyed more than 1,000 Muslims between January and May of this year by telephone. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points.Researchers said that Muslims\u2019 optimism about life in the U.S. likely stemmed, at least in part, from the growing support that members of the public have offered as discrimination and hate incidents against\u00a0Muslim-Americans have climbed.A growing share of Muslims\u201449%\u2014said that someone had expressed support for them because of their religion in the past year; 55% now say Americans are generally friendly toward Muslims.\u201cThe Muslim community has evolved such that it is no longer an issue, this idea of being both American and a Muslim,\u201d said\u00a0Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Kentucky and an adviser to the study. \u201cThat ties into the optimism. These ideals, equality and pluralism, can be realized.\u201dOn questions about religious extremism, Muslims\u2019 opinions largely mirrors those of the population at large: 71% said they were either \u201cvery concerned\u201d or \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d about extremism in the name of Islam in the U.S., compared with 70% of the general public.But opinion diverged on whether the threat of extremism could come from within Muslim communities in the U.S.Many Muslim-Americans said no, with three-quarters saying there was little or no support for extremism in Islamic communities here. In the general public, 35% said there was a great deal or fair amount of extremism among Muslims in the U.S.More than 30% of Muslims said they were \u201ctreated with suspicion,\u201d up from 28% in 2011.\u201cMuslims are concerned about extremism and terrorism,\u201d said       Besheer Mohamed,        a senior researcher at Pew and one of the authors of the study. \u201cBut many are dissatisfied with the government\u2019s approach the these issues.\u201dWrite to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/muslims-grow-more-anxious-about-discrimination-survey-finds-1501041731", "keywords": ["muslim-americans,pew muslims,trump discrimination,trump immigration ,trump muslims,u.s. muslims,Pew Research Center,Trump,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,religion,social issues,surveys,polls"]}]
