He said he was honored to serve as attorney general and the position was \u201cbeyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201dMr. Sessions was at the White House as recently as Wednesday, for a National Security Council meeting, according to White House spokesman       Sean Spicer.On Thursday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       told reporters that Mr. Trump was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself earlier this year but that he didn\u2019t regret keeping him in the role. The two haven\u2019t spoken in the last 24 hours, she said.\u201cClearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the news conference, scheduled to announce a major takedown of the largest online marketplace for illicit goods, AlphaBay, Mr. Sessions was asked only about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, fielding no questions about the case. Aides ended the gathering after they solicited, but didn\u2019t receive, any questions on the AlphaBay operation.Mr. Sessions pointed to the AlphaBay case and a health-care fraud takedown announced last week, as well as a gathering with state and local law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, as evidence the agency was continuing to enforce administration priorities in combating transnational crime and spikes in drug use and violent crime.\u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.In the interview with the Times, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201dSome prominent Republicans had called on Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), as well as many Democrats. Legal ethics experts said that because Mr. Sessions had played a key role in the Trump campaign, it could raise questions if he oversaw an investigation that examined, among other things, whether that campaign coordinated with Russia.On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had been a vocal proponent of appointing a special counsel, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time right before our eyes,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest; said Mr. Comey had provided congressional testimony \u201cloaded up with lies\u201d; and questioned Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s neutrality since he was from Baltimore, a city Mr. Trump said had \u201cvery few Republicans.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment, and Mr. Comey declined to comment through an associate. At the news conference, Mr. Rosenstein said he was working to \u201cadvance\u201d the administration\u2019s priorities.\u201cI was proud to be here yesterday, I\u2019m proud to be here today, I\u2019ll be proud to be here tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Trump aimed much of his frustration in the interview at Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator who endorsed Mr. Trump early in the campaign, when few Republicans were getting behind their eventual nominee. Mr. Trump described the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as \u201cextremely unfair\u2026to the president.\u201dHe also blamed Mr. Sessions for \u201cbad answers\u201d to Congress that set him down a path that led to his recusal. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he hadn\u2019t had \u201ccommunications with the Russians\u201d even though he had met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergey Kislyak.\u201cJeff Sessions gave some bad answers\u2026He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The recusal came one day after reports of those discrepancies emerged. Mr. Sessions said at the time that he was recusing himself from all investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign on the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials.\u2014Byron Tau, Michael C.

John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

SHLD 10.60%       said Thursday it will start selling its Kenmore appliances on Amazon, loosening its grip on one of its historic product lines and becoming the latest big American brand to capitulate to the online-retail giant.News of Amazon\u2019s move into appliances, one of the categories it hasn\u2019t deeply penetrated, rippled through the industry. Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat. Lowe\u2019s Cos. tumbled;             Home Depot Inc.        HD -4.09%       and             Best Buy Co.        BBY -3.93%       fell 4% apiece.Amazon\u2019s rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.             Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.60, while Amazon, based in Seattle, closed at an all-time high of $1,028.70. Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion, Sears\u2019s hovers near $1 billion.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.\u201cAmazon is a continual improvement machine, and Kenmore is a brand with extraordinary heritage and awareness,\u201d something that could transform it into a major winner in an online category currently lacking a dominant player, said Ken Seiff, a venture capitalist at Beanstalk Ventures and a former retail executive. \u201cThere\u2019s no positive outcome\u201d for brick-and-mortar competitors.While major appliances are a fraction of Home Depot and Best Buy\u2019s sales, Amazon is now increasingly targeting their bread-and-butter business of services, says Forrester Research analyst Brendan Witcher. \u201cFor years we believed the defensible margins were those in services, because it\u2019s not easy to do online,\u201d he said. But as Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant Alexa is installed in more devices\u2014including Kenmore\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s changing.A Home Depot spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective.\u201d Best Buy declined to comment.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. The company\u2019s Prime subscription program, which according to UBS has an estimated 63 million North American members, also offers companies broad access to customers.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to expand our selection,\u201d said Matt Furlong, general manager of home improvement and appliances at Amazon.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. And for years, the only place Americans could buy a Kenmore stove or washing machine was at their local Sears or Kmart.But there are fewer of those sprawling stores these days\u2014nearly 1,000 have closed since 2009\u2014and people aren\u2019t buying as much from them.The brand is now produced by Whirlpool Corp.,             Electrolux                   AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s share of major-appliance sales in the U.S. fell to 22% in the 12 months ended March, down from 30% four years earlier, according to TraQline, a market research firm. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The Kenmore brand\u2019s share of the market fell to 10.3% from 16.7% during that same period.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to             Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on             Amazon.com        AMZN 0.18%       will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit line that Sears announced Monday.Although that line was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor. The Sears spokesman said the company is in ongoing discussions with various parties with respect to the loan facility.\u2014Andrew Scurria and Imani Morse contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Sears Links With Amazon, Jolting Appliance Industry.'"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:59:00", "news_title": "Beer and Wine in the Same Glass?

These cross-genre blends of beer, wine, booze and soda bring playful irreverence to summer refreshment.Experimenting with wild yeasts and natural fermentation, brewers have found common ground with winemakers. Once the staff at Texas\u2019s Jester King Brewery saw neighboring Hill Country wineries using the same natural-fermentation tricks they did\u2014barrels, open tanks, local microbes\u2014borrowing fruit from them seemed a logical next step.Jester King SPON Albari\u00f1o & Blanc du Bois is a Belgian-style lambic beer refermented with wine grapes. \u201cWe had to develop our palate,\u201d said Jester King founder       Jeffrey Stuffings,        \u201clearn to identify what flavors are good, what\u2019s bad, what just needs time.\u201d One early experiment with Blanc du Bois grapes gave off \u201cthis funky, overripe-fruit smell,\u201d Mr. Stuffings said, \u201cbut then we drank some Sauvignon Blanc made with those grapes and tasted the same flavor. That gave us confidence we weren\u2019t off course.\u201dAll these beer blends are born of exploration, made by brewers chasing exotic yeasts once limited to cider, mead and even sake. Unity Brewing Co. ferments a gluten-free beer using the bacteria and yeast normally found in kombucha. Cambridge Brewing uses sake\u2019s unique mix of yeast and koji (a mold). To produce its Bitches Brew, Dogfish Head studied the traditional honey fermentation that makes ancient African t\u2019ej wine.Before the advent of modern brewing, with its clearly delineated styles and designated yeast strains, brewers worked with a splash of this, a pinch of that and a hefty helping of respectful resignation to the mysteries of fermentation. There\u2019s an element of improvisation to these new brews, and that\u2019s what makes them fun. \u201cIn the early days, we were crushing grapes with baseball bats,\u201d said Allagash brewmaster       Jason Perkins.They\u2019ve grown up, somewhat. Dogfish Head plans to release its Bitches Brew in canned six packs this year\u2014big news for a beer once available only as a centerpiece-size shareable bottle. Will that workaday packaging detract from its distinctiveness? Allagash\u2019s Mr. Perkins believes these beers deserve attention, not affectation. \u201cWhen I\u2019m drinking wine, it\u2019s usually out of grandma\u2019s juice glasses,\u201d he said. And he drinks these beers from nothing more pompous than a short, wide-mouth glass to direct and disperse their aromas. \u201cI\u2019m practical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re brewers at heart.\u201d"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 17:58:00", "news_title": "Poland Moves to Replace Supreme Court, Despite Protests", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/poland-presses-forward-with-plan-to-remake-supreme-court-1500559212", "keywords": "poland democracy,poland judiciary,poland politics,European Union,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,judicial branch", "content": "WARSAW\u2014Poland\u2019s lower chamber of parliament approved a bill that would allow the government to replace every judge on the supreme court, a move opposition politicians and European Union leaders warned undermines democracy in the once-communist nation.The bill, which allows the government to retire all 83 judges on the country\u2019s highest courts within the next two weeks, passed Thursday only eight days after it was first introduced. By nightfall tens of thousands people gathered to protest in the country\u2019s biggest cities.Under the proposed law, only judges granted exemptions by President       Andzrej Duda       would stay on. The justice minister would then appoint acting judges whom he would be able to fire at any moment. That would give the ruling Law and Justice party the leeway to take control of the judiciary, which it says is stocked with former communists who don\u2019t represent the will of voters.Poland\u2019s Senate, where Law and Justice holds an absolute majority, was expected to ratify the bill by Friday. Mr. Duda would then need to sign it to turn it into a law that would take immediate effect.EU leaders have called the bill an alarming step backward for Poland\u2019s postcommunist democracy and a breach of EU legal standards, but have been powerless to intervene. That inability shows the bloc\u2019s waning sway over its members in what was once Europe\u2019s Soviet Bloc.Poland, the largest of those countries, was once held up as a model reformer, exemplifying the benefits of adhering to the EU\u2019s liberal democratic vision for Europe. EU officials considered the fast-growing country a model for what countries like Turkey and Bosnia could gain by joining.Now Poland is becoming instead an example of how little authority the EU can exercise even over its members. For months, Warsaw has repeatedly shunned proposals to speak on the issue of judicial independence with the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm. In May, several governments pushed Poland to engage with the commission, to no avail. Last week, Polish foreign and interior ministers again shrugged off another EU request for more dialogue.Next week, the EU will adopt a set of recommendations for Poland\u2014the third such initiative\u2014and debate potential disciplinary measures. Eventually, the EU could move to revoke Poland\u2019s voting rights in the bloc, which would be a considerable and unprecedented rebuke of a member state.\u201cSooner or later you will have to take the necessary steps to enforce the rules,\u201d said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the commission.But actually punishing Poland for its supreme court law would be extremely difficult for the EU. In most cases, that would require unanimity from its members\u2014including some, such as Hungary, that are also at odds with the EU over what a European democracy should look like.\u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to enter into these guys\u2019 minds,\u201d said Marcin Matczak, a law professor at the public University of Warsaw, speaking of the Law and Justice party\u2019s leadership.For Poland, the bill underlines the conservative, nationalist government\u2019s broad power to remake the largest EU country formerly in the Soviet Union\u2019s orbit.Though the courts have been the central battlefield in that effort, the government has also increased its influence over media, passing a law last year that gives it the right to name the heads of the public TV and radio stations.The ruling party and its state-media allies say their opponents are traitors and its leader,       Jaroslaw Kaczynski,        has accused the opposition of conspiring to kill his identical twin brother, who died in a 2010 plane crash in Russia. \u201cYou murdered him, you scumbags,\u201d he said to the opposition during the parliament ary debate on the new law.Poland is in a \u201cpolitical crisis,\u201d said President Donald Tusk of the EU\u2019s European Council, a former Polish prime minister and leading figure for the opposition\u2014which along with Russia\u2019s government says the plane crash was an accident.\u201cThe situation, including at international level, is really serious,\u201d he said Thursday.Poland\u2019s supreme court is nearly the only domestic check on Law and Justice\u2019s rule. The court holds the power to invalidate or validate election results. It can also block political parties from receiving state funding and functions as an appeals court for businesses and individuals who feel they aren\u2019t being treated fairly by the government\u2019s tax services, regulators or law enforcement.Until now, high-court judges have generally been appointed and managed through a process that gives fellow judges considerable sway.The ruling party says the judges have been unaccountable and slow to render judgments.\u201cWe are fighting pathologies in the judiciary,\u201d Foreign Minister       Witold Waszczykowski       told reporters Wednesday. \u201cPeople even call parliament to complain to us that their cases are pending for years.\u201dTop business leaders have expressed unease over the law, saying they fear investors could be exposed to government interference in arbitration. One of the country\u2019s main investor lobbies, the Polish Business Roundtable, has asked Mr. Duda to veto the law.Mr. Duda has said he would sign the bill as long as an amendment is passed to raise the number of votes needed for legislators to choose the committee members tasked with vetting future judges. The Senate is expected to do so.Two years ago, Law and Justice won an absolute majority in the country\u2019s parliament, the first time any party had done so since the fall of communism. At the time, the party\u2019s euroskeptic views and populist style led some politicians and analysts to expect it would be isolated in Europe and unpopular at home.But the party has faced only minimal resistance. Two weeks ago, it hosted U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who greeted thousands of supporters bused in from across the country. In opinion polls, Law and Justice continues to lead, and the opposition remains fractured.A tribunal tasked with examining whether new laws are permissible under the constitution is now led by justices appointed by the ruling party. The U.S. State Department has repeatedly condemned Poland\u2019s moves against the judiciary, but that criticism has been overshadowed by the praise Mr. Trump expressed for Poland\u2019s leadership during his visit.As the law passed, only a few hundred protesters gathered outside parliament. They stamped their feet on police barricades and chanted \u201cshame!\u201dLater, protests against the new law grew to more than 10,000 people in Warsaw, many holding candles. Several thousand more gathered in Krakow and elsewhere.\u201cWe are frustrated and upset: It\u2019s actually the end of democracy in Poland,\u201d said Karolina Kostowska, a graphic designer in Warsaw. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019re completely speechless.\u201d\u2014Emre Peker and Laurence Norman in Brussels contributed to this article.Write to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Poland Moves to Replace Its Highest Judges.'"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 15:26:00", "news_title": "Elon Musk Teases a New York-to-D.C.

Amtrak\u2019s Acela Express travels between New York and Washington in slightly less than three hours.He didn\u2019t immediately say which government agency or official had given approval, or elaborate on issues such as timing or cost, but later added he aimed to build similar systems in suburban Los Angeles and Texas. Infrastructure projects of large sizes often take years\u2014if not decades\u2014to receive government approvals.\u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.A representative for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnel venture, The Boring Company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for clarification.The Transportation Department referred questions about the hyperloop to the White House, which confirmed conversations with Mr. Musk and other Boring Company executives. But the White House didn\u2019t say whether it had given any kind of approval for the hyperloop.A White House spokesman said in a statement: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dA spokesman for New York\u2019s mayor tweeted the announcement was \u201cnews to City Hall.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s tweets raised more questions than they answered.Depending on the route, such a project could require approvals from five or six state governments, said Lynne Kiesling, associate director of Purdue University\u2019s Research Center in Economics. Ms. Kiesling\u2019s research includes the effect of regulatory institutions on technological change.\u201cStringing together five or six such approvals would be a long, costly and fractious process,\u201d she said.Mr. Musk has long talked about the creation of a so-called hyperloop, a system for high-speed transportation in a near-vacuum state that takes place in miles-long tubes. Since Mr. Musk floated the idea in 2013, others have tried to commercialize the concept. Hyperloop One has raised $180 million but has faced delays in rolling out a prototype.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets convey his wide-ranging interests. He is chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.,       which last year merged with energy company SolarCity, another business he backed. He also heads rocket-maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.In April, Mr. Musk announced plans for a new company called Neuralink Corp., where he also is CEO, aiming to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in \u201cconsensual telepathy.\u201dIn his series of tweets Thursday, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop system, a network linking New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, would be accessible from city centers, with up to a dozen access points in each city.Mr. Musk responded to few of the questions posed to him on Twitter. \u201cSupport would be much appreciated!\u201d he said in one tweet.He began teasing the idea of a tunnel project on Twitter in December, with a post saying, \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, however, if the musing was more than just a man bored with Los Angeles traffic.In January he tweeted: \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front.\u201d \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so,\u201d he said.He has been testing his tunneling techniques at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif.Just days ago, at a gathering of U.S. governors, Mr. Musk answered a question about whether he feels pressure from people\u2019s expectations about his projects, particularly in light of the Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has soared more than 50% this year.\u201cI find it quite tough when there are very high expectations,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI try to actually tamp down those expectations.\u201d\u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com"}]
