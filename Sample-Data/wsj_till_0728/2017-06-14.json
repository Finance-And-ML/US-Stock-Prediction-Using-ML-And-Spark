[{"content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.\u2014A gunman with a history of criticizing President Donald Trump and GOP policies opened fire on Republican congressmen gathered at a baseball practice Wednesday morning, shooting four people in an attack that stunned the capital and prompted both parties to set aside partisan differences.Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who is the House majority whip, was shot once in the left hip and was in critical condition after multiple surgical procedures, a Washington hospital said. A congressional aide, a lobbyist and a Capitol Police officer were also shot, officials said. Another Capitol Police officer and another congressman sustained minor injuries during the ambush.Officials identified the suspected gunman as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector who had run-ins with neighbors in an Illinois suburb of St. Louis. Mr. Hodgkinson, who had one handgun and one rifle, was killed by police, FBI Special Agent in Charge Timothy Slater said.While the officials didn\u2019t ascribe a motive, letters and online posts in Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s name were critical of the Republican president. Mr. Hodgkinson was taken to a hospital and died from multiple gunshot wounds to his torso, Mr. Slater said.The extent of Mr. Scalise\u2019s wound only became apparent late Wednesday, when MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement that the bullet caused extensive internal damage and that he had undergone two surgical procedures and was expected to undergo more.The shooting, which pierced a quiet suburban neighborhood outside Washington just after 7 a.m., was the first time in more than 60 years that multiple U.S. lawmakers had been targeted in the same attack. It came six years after the attempted assassination of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D., Ariz.), an attack that left six dead and 13 wounded, including two congressional aides. Ms. Giffords was shot in the head and survived.In the wake of the shooting, leaders from both parties called for unity and the calming of Washington\u2019s tense partisanship.House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) declared from the House floor that \u201can attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.\u201d Rep.       Nancy Pelosi       of California, the House Democratic leader, told members: \u201cWe are not one caucus or the other in this House today.\u201dAt the White House, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation\u2019s capital is here because, above all, they love our country.\u201dLater in the evening, Mr. Trump, first lady Melania Trump and the White House physician traveled to the hospital, where they met with Mr. Scalise\u2019s wife and medical team. White House physician Ronny Jackson, who had also cared for Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor,       Barack Obama,        earlier visited the hospital to learn about Mr. Scalise\u2019s condition, the White House said.Mr. Trump sent a tweet after leaving, saying that Mr. Scalise was \u201cin very tough shape -- but he is a fighter. Pray for Steve!\u201dIt was a more sober message than his assurance earlier Wednesday on Twitter that Mr. Scalise \u201cwould fully recover.\u201dWitnesses described seeing a gunman with a rifle open fire near the third-base dugout at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria. Dozens of shots rang out as about 22 lawmakers practiced batting and fielding and local residents walked their dogs in the muggy heat.The Republican team was being guarded by officers with the Capitol Police on a detail protecting Mr. Scalise, 51. Police immediately opened fire on the gunman, police and witnesses said.Mr. Scalise was shot as he stood by second base, and he dragged himself into the outfield in a bid to reach safety, witnesses said.Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.), who was in the batting cage at the time of the shootings, said he heard a single shot followed rapidly by a string of about 10 shots. He said he then heard more rounds of gunfire.\u201cI probably heard 50, 60 shots,\u201d Mr. Paul said on MSNBC. \u201cEverybody probably would have died except for the fact that the Capitol Police was there,\u201d which was only due to Mr. Scalise\u2019s presence, he said.The lawmakers and aides had been practicing for Thursday evening\u2019s annual charity congressional baseball game, to be held at the home of Major League Baseball\u2019s Washington Nationals. The game, a bipartisan social event, is intensely competitive. Republicans have been practicing each morning since April, eager to build on last year\u2019s win over the Democratic team, which snapped a yearslong losing streak for the GOP.Mr. Ryan told lawmakers in a briefing Wednesday that the game would go on as scheduled, drawing a standing ovation, lawmakers said. Mr. Trump wants to attend to support the lawmakers, White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       said, but won\u2019t because \u201che has been advised that there is not enough time to follow Secret Service protocols.\u201dAlso wounded were Zach Barth, a staff member of Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas), Mr. Williams\u2019s office said, and Matt Mika, a lobbyist for             Tyson Foods Inc.,       the company said. Mr. Williams, a former professional ballplayer, has been a coach of the GOP baseball team since 2013; he injured his ankle during the chaos.Mr. Barth was released from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Williams said.Capitol Police Special Agent Crystal Griner was shot in the ankle, while the department\u2019s Special Agent David Bailey sustained an unspecified injury during the attack. Ms. Griner was also being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the White House said, and the president met with her and her wife there when he visited Mr. Scalise.The Federal Bureau of Investigation was taking the lead on the investigation because it involves a member of Congress, police said. The FBI said it had found no indication the shooting had links to international terrorism.Mr. Slater said Mr. Hodgkinson left his Illinois home and had been in Alexandria since March. He had been living out of his car, a white cargo van, on East Monroe Avenue, near the baseball field where the shooting took place, he said. Mr. Hodgkinson didn\u2019t appear to have a job, he said.On a             Facebook                   page that appeared to belong to Mr. Hodgkinson, he wrote on March 22 that \u201cTrump is a Traitor.

The bill names 277 offenses that are subject to prosecution for planning alone, overturning a traditional principle in Japanese criminal law that one must actually commit wrongdoing to be punished.Polls have shown public opinion roughly split evenly on the need for the law. After an all-night session, the upper house of parliament approved the bill early Thursday morning, with support from Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe\u2019s       ruling coalition ensuring enough votes for its passage.Japan has suffered no major terror attacks by foreigners and few domestically launched incidents outside of nerve-gas poisonings by a religious cult in the mid-1990s that killed about two dozen people. However, Mr. Abe\u2019s government says the new legislation is needed as part of counterterrorism preparations for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and will enable\u00a0Japan to ratify a United Nations convention to tackle organized crime.While the bill doesn\u2019t grant police any new investigative powers, critics said the result could be increased surveillance of groups planning protests, since police could more easily justify invasive tactics at an early stage. Similar legislative proposals have failed three times in recent years.The government says the bill would allow targeting only of organized criminals such as gangs of swindlers and international terror groups. It says police wouldn\u2019t target legitimate activities of civic groups or labor unions.Last month, the U.N. special rapporteur for the right to privacy wrote a letter to Mr. Abe expressing concerns that the bill could \u201clead to undue restrictions to the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression.\u201dMr. Abe\u2019s ruling party and its allies together hold roughly two-thirds of both houses of parliament, giving the prime minister a strong hand to advance his conservative security agenda. Two years ago, he pushed through a law enabling Japan\u2019s military to assist U.S. allies outside of Japanese territory, part of a program of more actively confronting security threats such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 22:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-passes-antiterrorism-law-1497492692", "news_title": "Japan Targets Would-Be Terrorists", "keywords": "anti-terror law japan,japan antiterror law, japan anti-terror law, japanese law, japanese laws, japan new law, japan parliament, japan terrorism,Shinzo Abe,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,crime,legal action,law enforcement,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "The Wall Street Journal has ranked technology companies to see which might emerge as leaders in some of the most dynamic parts of the tech industry.Click here to see the top 25 listing.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 22:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/explore-the-full-wsj-tech-companies-to-watch-ranking-for-2017-1497492420", "news_title": "Explore the Full WSJ Tech Companies to Watch Ranking for 2017", "keywords": " journal reports,tech companies to watch"}, {"content": "David Yeom was raised by a single mom in East Los Angeles, and trips to the local dollar store were both a necessity and a \u201ctreasure hunt,\u201d he says.Now Mr. Yeom runs Hollar Inc., which he says is an online version of a dollar store. Many items sell for $1, the median price is $5, and nothing costs more than $10.Mr. Yeom, who used to run marketing at Honest Co., an e-commerce startup for baby and other consumer products, says he and       Brian Lee,        the former CEO at Honest, got the idea for Hollar at a Carl\u2019s Jr. restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif.VIEW InteractiveHollar has hit on two trends\u2014the large market for low-price goods and the consumer shift to online shopping. Companies like             Dollar General                   and             Dollar Tree                   have held up much better than other brick-and-mortar retailers amid the e-commerce onslaught. The dollar stores, however, have little presence online. That is a void Hollar is trying to fill.\u201cNobody is going after this [market segment] in online retail, and I think it\u2019s wide open,\u201d says       Greg Girard,        an analyst at IDC Retail Insights, part of the Framingham, Mass., research firm IDC. Other e-commerce companies pursue the more well-off segments of society, Mr. Girard says.The median household income of a Hollar customer is $50,000, according to Mr. Yeom. And 80% of Hollar\u2019s orders are from outside California and New York.It is easier and cheaper to acquire customers for Hollar than it used to be for Honest Co., Mr. Yeom says, because while at Honest, most products were more expensive than alternatives, at Hollar they are all a deal.Most of the co-founders of Hollar come from humble backgrounds, and several immigrated to the U.S. as children, Mr. Yeom says. The other co-founders are       Jonathan Um,        formerly a director of strategy at 99 Cents Only Stores and a former captain in the U.S. Marine Corps;       Thanh Khuu,        former chief technology officer at startup ShoeDazzle; and       Eddie Rhyu,        a former creative director at ShoeDazzle. Mr. Lee is executive chairman of the company.Hollar shipped its first order in November 2015. It hit $1 million in revenue in less than six months. Mr. Yeom declines to disclose current revenue. Hollar is currently gross-margin positive, he says. The company has raised some $47.5 million so far and has about 220 employees.It offers tens of thousands of different items on its website. They are stocked at a facility in Commerce, Calif., which was formerly used by 99 Cents Only.Besides daily household items like toothpaste, the company\u2019s biggest seller has been Glow Pets, pillows shaped like an animal, such as a unicorn, with LED lights. The pillows sold for $2 each.The company has about two million active monthly users, and more than a million have downloaded its app.\u201cIt is a significant opportunity, but they\u2019ve got a big challenge, which is the logistics,\u201d says Mr. Girard of IDC. \u201cWhether something costs $1 or $100, it could cost the same to ship.\u201dMr. Yeom says the company is using several strategies to improve margins. Even though each item is inexpensive, order carts average $30, and the minimum order is $10.\u201cWhen you create an environment where everything is a great deal, and nothing breaks the bank, it\u2019s interesting the psychology that takes over people, and they just load up,\u201d Mr. Yeom says.Hollar also doesn\u2019t stock large or heavy items, which keeps packaging small and affordable. The average package it ships weighs 5 pounds, Mr. Yeom says. It often sources from third-party vendors who specialize in closeout deals, and being close to the Port of Long Beach helps, Mr. Yeom says.The company next plans to start a marketplace where other merchants can sell their products through Hollar. The company also hopes to expand internationally.Ms. Chernova is a special writer for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Most large and many small and midsize companies self-insure because it lets them customize their benefits and save money in the long term.VIEW InteractiveCollective Health uses enterprise software that boasts strong analytics that can help its customers yield insights from their own data and so better manage costs. It says its system also helps clients connect their employees with resources to manage budding health concerns before they worsen, and its call-center staff have incentives to not just answer questions but to guide plan members to the right care.Since securing its first customer in 2015, Collective Health has grown to handle health benefits for 77,000 employees and their dependents across 15 clients, including             eBay Inc.,Activision Blizzard Inc.       and Palantir Technologies Inc.Chief Executive       Ali Diab       has raised $150 million in venture capital for the San Francisco company, whose self-proclaimed ambition is to make people love their health-insurance plan.\u201cWhat Ali\u2019s really done well is he\u2019s built a mission-driven company,\u201d says       Mohamad Makhzoumi,        a general partner with New Enterprise Associates, which invested in Collective Health.Mr. Diab co-founded the company in October 2013 after experiencing a personal health crisis earlier that year. On a March afternoon he was sitting at his desk in San Francisco when he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen that would land him in the hospital for emergency surgery to treat an intestinal illness.When he returned home, his insurer denied most of his hospital claims, saying the surgical procedure was experimental and resulted in a longer-than-normal hospital stay.\u201cI felt like I got the world\u2019s best care,\u201d the 43-year-old Mr. Diab says. \u201cBut the experience of understanding how I should pay for my care, what was covered, what was not covered, felt like a world apart.\u201d Mr. Diab, a technology entrepreneur, decided to use his experience to make health insurance better.Much bigger companies, such as insurer             UnitedHealth Group,       are administering benefits and processing claims for self-insured companies, too. But Collective Health executives believe their execution and tech infrastructure will help them stand out.For instance, Collective Health says its benefits statements are written at a third-grade reading level to reduce frustration for patients trying to understand what their insurer is telling them. Collective Health\u2019s platform, meanwhile, was built with data and analytics in mind, so that employers can look at claims data to predict costs more quickly, says Mr. Diab, who previously led product management and business operations for mobile-advertising startup AdMob Inc.Mr. Diab\u2019s tech savvy and the medical expertise of physician and co-founder       Rajaie Batniji       are what sold Collective Health investor       Blake Byers,        a general partner with GV, the venture-capital arm of Google parent         Alphabet Inc.Dr. Byers says he was impressed with Mr. Diab\u2019s frankness about the difficulties their startup would face.

On the spot, they dreamed up a smart lock, and August Home Inc. was born.VIEW InteractiveTheir solution goes beyond keypad-based home-security systems by allowing homeowners to grant access to specific people only during agreed-to periods. After homeowners install August\u2019s $229 smart lock on the inside of their door, they can lock and unlock the door using the app on their smartphone. They can allow their housecleaners access for a specific day and time, or set a regular schedule, like every day from 8 a.m. to noon. The housecleaner must have an August account and the smartphone app to unlock the door. If the owner stops using that cleaner, he or she can stop the cleaner\u2019s access to the house.August also sells an accessory keypad for owners who prefer to give guests access codes. And the homeowner still has the option to lock and unlock the door with a key.The San Francisco startup has raised more than $65 million. Its latest round of investment valued the company at about $150 million, according to an estimate by PitchBook Data. It sold about 44,000 smart locks in 2016, the tech-market-research firm Parks Associates estimates, and has about 85 employees.For Mr. Johnson, who is chief executive, August is his fifth startup, but it could be his first hit. Mr. Behar, the chief creative officer, is a career designer who also co-founded consumer-electronics startup Jawbone in 2003, last valued at $1.5 billion.August hopes to unlock what analysts say is a promising market for smart-home devices. Some 8.7 million U.S. households have a smart-home device, according to data from Forrester Research, which forecasts that number will top 20 million by 2021.August\u2019s main competition is traditional lock makers that have their own connected versions. According to NPD Group, Schlage, an             Allegion                   PLC company, captured 51% of the retail revenue of smart-lock sales from May 2016 to April 2017. August was second with 37%. Kwikset, owned by             Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc.,       had 8%. August is fighting to differentiate itself from its competitors by emphasizing sleek app design and ease of use.\u201cAugust plays in a portion of the smart-lock market that\u2019s more in the retail and online-retail segment,\u201d says       Tom Kerber,        a director of Internet of Things strategy at Parks Associates. A partnership August announced last year with             Comcast Corp.\u2019s       home-security business, Xfinity Home, may help it boost sales, because most smart locks are sold as part of home-security packages, Mr. Kerber says.Last year August started selling another home-security product, a doorbell video camera, to compete with a similar product from Ring, formerly Bot Home Automation Inc. The doorbell camera, which allows users to see and hear visitors on their doorstep through an app, may help August get over the threshold into more homes, as consumers are more likely to buy a connected camera than a lock as their first smart-home device, says NPD analyst       Benjamin Arnold.As the largest tech companies battle to own the smart home, August is determined to stay competitive, in part by being operational with different platforms. August products can work with             Apple                   HomeKit, Google Home and             Amazon                   Alexa. The company also has partnerships with Airbnb and HomeAway, offering special features for home-sharing, such as giving the Airbnb guest the ability to grant other guests access during their stay.Security is paramount for August, Mr. Johnson says. The company hires an independent team to do constant penetration testing, and has never seen its systems compromised, the chief executive says. Among its security features, the company uses \u201crolling\u201d cryptographic codes. With this kind of system, \u201cthe cryptographic element is never the same. It\u2019s always changing,\u201d says Mr. Johnson.In a rolling-codes system, a series of codes is needed for the lock to open, Mr. Kerber says, so it is very good at frustrating hackers. If one of the codes is broken, he says, it\u2019s only \u201ca very small piece of the system.\u201dMs. Haggin is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

At the school where Mr. Carroll worked, he had noticed how frustrating it was for students and teachers to access the multiple learning apps that were being used in class.VIEW InteractiveSchools across the U.S., from kindergarten to 12th grade, are using an increasing number of apps to help students in areas such as reading, math and Spanish.

It creates one account for each user, who then has access to all of the apps offered at his or her school.Another advantage the company offers is for the learning-app developers themselves, who find it easier designing products for a widely used platform than having to negotiate the system requirements of many different customers. With this in mind, Clever\u2019s software is free for the schools that use it, but the company charges the app developers for the service it provides. Developers pay $10 to $20 a month to Clever for each school where students connect to their apps through Clever\u2019s platform.Clever at this point has no direct competitor. Its software is used in about 70,000 public and private schools across the U.S., according to the company, which is roughly half of the schools in the U.S. Its introduction of single-login technology to education in a way parallels what             Okta Inc.       has done for businesses. Okta, based in San Francisco, recently went public and has a market capitalization of roughly $2.3 billion.Comparisons are sometimes made in the news media between Clever and LearnSprout Inc., an education-technology startup, because both tackle the issue of improving access to online educational resources. But LearnSprout, acquired by             Apple Inc.       last year, is a platform for apps that help educators track students\u2019 performance, while Clever tries to solve more logistical issues.Spending on education software for the K-12 market is expected to grow 23.3% to $7.26 billion in 2020 from $5.89 billion this year, says research firm Gartner Inc., though Clever\u2019s addressable market is only a portion of that.\u201cThe education-technology industry has evolved from a niche market to a multibillion-dollar endeavor attracting serious investment,\u201d says Bridget Foster, managing director of the Education Technology Industry Network of the Software & Information Industry Association.Given recent activity in the sector, investors seem to like its prospects. Coursera Inc., a leading provider of massive online open courses, just raised $64 million to reach a $800 million valuation. AltSchool Inc., a personalized learning provider, has attracted investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital and Learn Capital. Learn Capital is an investor in Coursera.While Clever\u2019s focus is on improving the classroom experience, the company says its platform could one day be used to help school districts determine which apps are the most effective, or which work best for different learning styles. To do that, Clever will need to build new products and features and work with its app partners, Mr. Bosmeny says.Meanwhile, Clever measures its growth in the number of connections it makes between a school and a particular educational app. It has reached more than 200,000 connections in 2017, up 50% from last year, according to the company. A school district uses on average 10 apps, says Mr. Bosmeny, adding that he expects that number to grow to 40 and 50 apps in years to come.Clever has raised $43.3 million in funding in total and has a valuation of more than $250 million. Investors include       Ashton Kutcher       and       Peter Thiel.       The company has 111 employees.Ms. Razumovskaya is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

He, Chief Technology Officer       Nate Hardison       and Vice President of Engineering       Amos Schallich       quit their jobs in early 2014 and began working on a Wi-Fi router that promised to do away with \u201cdead spots\u201d in the home.Their solution was Eero\u2019s sleek, white router the size of a sandwich. With a traditional router, the Wi-Fi signal weakens the further one gets from the original router, even when using a booster signal. Each Eero device, however, is a direct access point to the Wi-Fi network, so each provides a top-strength signal. Consumers can place a few throughout their home so they can move from room to room without having to reconnect their devices. The company also collects data on the devices\u2019 performance and regularly updates its software to improve connectivity.The startup began taking preorders in February 2015, while the product was still in development, and had $2.5 million of sales in two weeks.Eero promised to ship those orders in the summer of 2015. But things didn\u2019t go according to plan, says Mr. Weaver, the company\u2019s chief executive. Eero didn\u2019t ship until February 2016, a delay Mr. Weaver attributes to unforeseen complications and inexperience. None of the company\u2019s three co-founders had shipped a hardware product before.\u201cI think most of our preorder customers have probably forgiven us,\u201d he says.San Francisco-based Eero, which so far has raised some $90 million and has about 150 full-time employees, earlier this month launched a second-generation cordless version of its router. Its latest product starts with a $299 package that includes an Eero router and a smaller-format router called a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Eero\u2019s routers are more expensive than traditional Wi-Fi routers, which can cost about $100. They also are pricey for mesh routers.             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google Wifi mesh router costs $129.In addition to the new hardware, Eero has expanded into subscription services. For $10 a month or $100 a year, Eero Plus provides features including enhanced security and tools for parents to manage their children\u2019s internet use by limiting access and filtering content. An Eero rival, Luma, which has raised about $20 million, has had parental-control features since its debut last year.Mr. Weaver disputes the suggestion that Eero added the service to match             Amazon                  -backed Luma. \u201cThis is stuff that we\u2019ve been working on since the inception of the company,\u201d Mr. Weaver says.Experts say Eero\u2019s stiffest competition comes not from rival startups but from bigger foes: the traditional router makers that partner with internet service providers, and the tech giants that are battling to control the smart home.             Netgear Inc.       holds 44% of the retail market for wireless routers, according to market-research firm NPD Group. Linksys holds 19%, and a few other traditional router makers follow. Eero holds 4%, and Google Wifi holds 3%. Luma has less than 1%.An Eero spokesperson says the market-share figures are misleading because they include traditional routers and mesh systems.\u201cI would say that the large tech companies have a huge advantage at this point, especially with their device strategies,\u201d says NPD Executive Director       Ben Arnold.       A giant like Google gains an edge by offering a suite of other smart-home devices, he says, and it\u2019s easy to imagine rivals like Apple and Amazon stepping into the mesh-router market.ISPs as well will likely start offering mesh-network-based routers, says       Tom Kerber,        a director of Internet of Things strategy at technology market-research firm Parks Associates. Some traditional router makers, like Linksys, already have.Nevertheless, Mr. Weaver believes Eero\u2019s independence will give it an edge. Consumers tend to want a hodgepodge of smart devices in their home\u2014such as an iPhone from Apple, Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker and a Nest thermostat\u2014so they will want to have a router made by an independent company to ensure it integrates with all their products, he says. They will also want one that isn\u2019t tied to their ISP so they can easily switch providers, he adds.Ms. Haggin is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

Prior attendees of technology conferences produced by the Journal and Founders Forum, a London firm that organizes events for a network of tech entrepreneurs and investors (and with which the Journal has a business relationship), were asked to respond to the following prompt for 10 subsectors of technology:VIEW InteractivePlease name up to three companies that have all of these characteristics: They are growing rapidly, you expect them to continue to grow rapidly, and you expect them to be innovation leaders in their subsector.The survey respondents were given the opportunity to name companies in any or all of these 10 subsectors:\u2022 Business software.\u2022 Consumer hardware.\u2022 Cybersecurity.\u2022 Education.\u2022 Entertainment.\u2022 Financial technology.\u2022 Health care.\u2022 Retail/e-commerce.\u2022 Publishing and advertising.\u2022 Social Media.Companies were included in the analysis if they received a threshold number of votes in the survey. In addition, companies were screened to ensure the analysis included young, emerging companies rather than large, well-established businesses. Companies were included only if they were less than six years old and had a valuation of $50 million to $500 million. Valuations were provided by Dow Jones VentureSource and its partner, Sand Hill Econometrics.The data for the analysis were drawn from Dow Jones VentureSource, Dow Jones Factiva, the companies and, in some cases, venture-capital firms. Companies were given the opportunity to update data that is maintained in Dow Jones VentureSource by responding to a questionnaire. Other updates were made, when additional information came to light.The analysis focused on five categories. Each category was given an equal weight in calculating a score for each company. The maximum possible score was 100. The top 25 companies scored between 72.0 and 42.3. Here are the categories:Founders\u2019 experience: Have the founders launched or had high-level experience at other venture-backed businesses? Companies were rewarded for founders\u2019 prior success. Founders received the greatest credit for founding other companies that were sold or went public.For each company, the analysis examined its founder or founders. The Dow Jones VentureSource database was used to identify other venture-backed companies each founder previously worked for as a senior executive or board member. Founders received basic credit for this type of experience. The analysis also identified other venture-backed companies that the founder founded. Founders who have founded other venture-backed companies in the past received additional credit. Finally, looking at the other companies the founders had founded, the analysis identified instances where those other companies were sold or had an IPO. Founders received the greatest credit for this.Investor track record: Do the venture-capital firms that have seats on the company\u2019s board have a record of success? Companies were rewarded for having successful venture-capital firms represented on their board.For each company, the analysis used the Dow Jones VentureSource database to examine the board members that are affiliated with a VC firm. The analysis identified prior instances when the VC firm was an investor in a company that had an initial public offering or was sold, and it calculated the value of all of the investments the VC firm made in the past. Ranked companies received credit for having board representatives from VC firms that have made investments that led to an IPO or sale, and VC firms that have invested significant sums.Investment: Has the company attracted substantial investments? Companies were rewarded for the amount of funds raised and for attracting multiple investors.For each company, the Dow Jones VentureSource database was used to calculate the total amount of equity raised and the number of firms (mostly venture-capital firms) that had made investments in the company. All firms that had made an investment were included; the analysis wasn\u2019t limited to current investors. Ranked companies received greater credit for having raised more money and for having attracted more investors. Because certain types of companies require less funding than others, the analysis evaluated the ranked company\u2019s total amount of funds raised in comparison to what was typical for a sample of large (based on valuation) venture-backed, still-privately-held companies in the ranked company\u2019s technology subsector.Growth: Has the company\u2019s workforce grown? Companies were rewarded for growth.For each company, the analysis examined the latest available data on the size of its workforce. These employee totals were drawn from the Dow Jones VentureSource database and the companies. In some cases, companies shared employee data on a confidential basis, for use in the data analysis but not to be published. Ranked companies received credit for having expanded their workforce. Because certain types of companies require a smaller workforce than others, the analysis evaluated the ranked company\u2019s workforce in comparison to what is typical for a sample of large (based on valuation) venture-backed, still-privately-held companies in the ranked company\u2019s technology subsector.Employee data was a proxy for growth because a preferred metric, revenue, was not available for most companies in the ranking. Private companies aren\u2019t required to publicly release financial data, and many keep their revenue data secret.Buzz: Has the company attracted attention in the tech community and in the media? Companies were rewarded for generating buzz.For each company, the analysis took into consideration the number of votes it received in the survey of tech-industry experts and watchers. Survey responses were received from 233 prior attendees of tech conferences run by The Wall Street Journal and Founders Forum. Respondents were asked to name companies that were growing fast, expected to continue to grow fast and expected to be innovation leaders in their area. Ranked companies received greater credit for receiving more votes.For each company, the analysis also assessed the number of articles in which the company was referenced, using the Dow Jones Factiva database to look for references. The name of the company was searched in Factiva\u2019s 16,000 English-language publications. Companies received credit for the number of articles in which they were referenced. They received greater credit for references that were made in the headline or first paragraph of articles.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 22:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-tech-companies-to-watch-how-the-rankings-were-compiled-1497492061", "news_title": "WSJ Tech Companies to Watch: How the Rankings Were Compiled", "keywords": "journal reports, methodology, tech companies to watch, tech companies to watch methodology , top 25 tech companies to watch, wsj tech companies to watch"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates and spelled out in greater detail its plans to start slowly shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets this year.The moves on Wednesday mark the latest test of the economy\u2019s ability to grow on its own as the central bank dials back the unprecedented stimulus measures it unleashed through successive bursts of bond purchases after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe economy is doing very well, is showing resilience,\u201d said Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       at a news conference following the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting.The Fed said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate on Thursday by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with its forecast.Together with the decision to raise interest rates, the balance-sheet plans show confidence in the economic expansion, which has been unspectacular but is also the third-longest on record.\u201cWe should want the Fed to raise rates because it signals something good about the underlying economy,\u201d said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at             Citigroup.       \u201cWhen it gets overheated and the Fed has to cut if off, that\u2019s when you get worried.\u201dMarkets were little changed after the widely expected moves. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.2%, to a fresh high of 21374.56. The S&P 500 fell 2.43 points, or 0.1%, to 2437.92.Wednesday\u2019s decisions mark a new chapter for the Fed and Ms. Yellen, whose tenure has been defined by meticulous plans to slowly drain reservoirs of stimulus that she and other Fed leaders forcefully advocated in response to the financial crisis that deepened the 2007-09 recession.Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure as Fed chairwoman began in early 2014, as the Fed began to slow its purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, the conclusion of the latest\u2014and broadest\u2014effort to spur household and business investment by pushing down long-term interest rates.The Fed stopped adding to its holdings, also known as its balance sheet, in October 2014, but it has continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets to maintain the portfolio\u2019s size. Since then, central bankers in Europe and Japan have ramped up similar bond-buying experiments.\u201cThe Fed has done a tremendous job helping the economy grind its way out of an extremely deep and disruptive recession,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays and a former Fed economist. \u201cIt generally operated alone and received a lot of criticism for doing what Congress asked it to do.\u201dPlans revealed by the Fed on Wednesday would start reducing the central bank\u2019s holdings gradually by allowing a small amount of net maturities every month. It would start by allowing up to $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage bonds to roll off without reinvestment, and let those amounts rise each quarter, essentially setting a speed limit for the wind-down.The limits would ultimately rise to a maximum of $30 billion a month for Treasurys and $20 billion a month for mortgage-backed securities.Ms. Yellen said if the economy performed in line with the central bank\u2019s forecasts, the Fed could set those plans into motion \u201crelatively soon,\u201d which market strategists believe could mean September or October.Officials have taken pains to communicate their strategy in advance to avoid a rerun of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when investor concerns over the Fed\u2019s decision to slow down asset purchases triggered market turmoil, including a sharp increase in Treasury yields and capital outflows from emerging markets.\u201cThe plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a news conference Wednesday.Allowing some of the holdings to mature without reinvestment could push up long-term rates. The Fed has been buying around $24 billion in mortgage securities a month this year and around $17.5 billion in Treasurys, according to FTN Financial.The Fed said all participants at its policy-setting meeting had agreed with the balance-sheet plans. Minneapolis Fed President       Neel Kashkari       cast the lone dissenting vote on Wednesday\u2019s decision to raise rates because he wanted to hold them steady.Since officials last met in early May, they have faced conflicting signals about the economy on two items that matter most: employment and inflation. Solid job gains have pulled down the unemployment rate to lower-than-expected levels, at 4.3% in May, but inflation has unexpectedly slowed.Ms. Yellen said officials are \u201cmonitoring inflation developments closely,\u201d but warned against reading too much into a handful of recent one-off declines in consumer prices, such as wireless-phone plans, that have weighed on inflation gauges.Fed officials marked down their projections for inflation this year, though they still see annual price gains reaching their 2% target by the end of 2018, in part because they expect tighter labor markets to ultimately help firm up prices.Officials now expect prices excluding food and energy to rise 1.7% this year, from a projection of 1.9% in March. They lowered their unemployment rate forecast to 4.3% for the end of 2017 and to 4.2% at the end of 2018 and 2019, down from March projections of 4.5% for each of those years.Officials\u2019 median expectation for the federal-funds rate showed few changes from projections released in March, and implies three more quarter-point increases in 2018 and three more in 2019.The central bank had held short-term rates steady since March, when it raised them by a quarter point, the third increase since June 2006. The Fed held rates at near zero from the end of 2008 through most of 2015, before lifting the benchmark rate once in late 2015 and once in late 2016.Despite recent increases in short-term rates, financial conditions have eased this year, with stocks rising to new highs and bond yields drifting lower. Mortgage rates, for example, have fallen to their lowest levels since November, with the average 30-year fixed-rate loan nearing 4%.\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before, where the Fed raises its rate, there\u2019s a little bump up, but then mortgage rates come back down,\u201d said Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif., who says this year is shaping up to be his best since he began selling houses in 1984.Given recent increases in short-term rates, \u201cwe should be at a 4.5% to 5% [mortgage] rate,\u201d said Mr. Klinge. \u201cThere is a disconnect, and it has been great for us.\u201dEquity markets also have supported more initial public offerings. So far this year, there have been nearly twice as many IPOs compared with the year-earlier period, with around $21.8 billion in deals, up from $7.2 billion last year, according to Dealogic.\u201cIt tells you that stock prices are higher, and people like to sell stock when stock markets move higher,\u201d said Citigroup\u2019s Mr. Levkovich.Wednesday\u2019s rate increase had been largely anticipated by investors and analysts, but how the Fed\u2019s plans later this year will unfold is less clear. Markets have been skeptical the Fed will follow through with another rate increase this year because of signs that inflation\u2019s weakness may be more stubborn than the Fed expects.Just how inflation develops in the months ahead is likely to shape how policy makers decide when to start the balance-sheet wind-down or raise rates again. Officials would want to see several more months of inflation readings before they significantly change their plans.\u201cWe have more concerns on inflation than they do,\u201d said Mr. Gapen.The Barclays economist said he sees risks of more persistent weakness than the transitory factors cited by Ms. Yellen and other officials, including from used-car prices and softer rent growth. Another price headwind, he said, looms from structural changes in the retail sector, with brick-and-mortar retailers struggling to maintain pricing power against online competitors.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Lifts Rates, Readies Asset Cuts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 21:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rates-sets-out-plan-to-shrink-asset-holdings-beginning-this-year-1497463322", "news_title": "Fed Raises Rates, Sets Out Plan to Shrink Asset Holdings Beginning This Year", "keywords": "fed,fed decision,federal reserve decision,federal reserve meeting,fed meeting,fed policy,fed rates,fomc,fomc meeting,janet yellen press conference,yellen,yellen press conference,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "China approved imports of two new varieties of genetically modified crops, clearing the way for U.S. agricultural companies to market new biotech seeds to farmers.The decision announced Wednesday affects genetically engineered corn and soybean varieties developed by             Dow Chemical Co.       and             Monsanto Co.        MON 0.68%       It comes after Beijing agreed to speed reviews of biotechnology applications as part of a trade deal with the Trump administration last month.For the U.S. farm sector, the move marks a step toward clearing a backlog of biotech seeds that have awaited approval from China, in some cases for years. Because China imports more soybeans than any other country and ranks as a major buyer of corn and other crops, seed companies typically wait to widely release new genetically engineered seeds until China says it will permit those crops to be imported.Seed companies have long complained that China\u2019s regulatory approval process is slow-moving and opaque, leaving farmers in North and South America without access to high-tech seeds and crop sprays that companies and farm groups say can help them battle hard-to-kill weeds and fend off destructive pests.The agricultural industry hailed the May trade deal announced between the U.S. and China, under which China committed to rule within 100 days on eight biotech crops, including four developed by Monsanto, two from Dow, one from             DuPont Co.       and one from             Syngenta AG      .\u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged and glad to see the progress being made,\u201d said       Joe Vertin,        a senior seed official with Dow.Dow continues to await Chinese approval for its similarly engineered Enlist soybeans. China\u2019s National Biosafety Committee has asked Dow for more information related to those seeds, which Dow is addressing, Mr. Vertin said. U.S. agriculture-industry officials anticipate the Chinese committee to meet again soon to rule on other seeds that have yet to be approved.A Monsanto spokeswoman said the company welcomed Wednesday\u2019s approval of its Vistive Gold soybean, which Monsanto says produces more healthful vegetable oil, but hopes China will address its other seeds in the coming weeks.In addition to the two new seed approvals, 14 other genetically modified crop varieties were renewed for importing into China.China\u2019s decision to allow new imports of genetically modified crops comes as the government struggles to balance a desire to boost farms\u2019 productivity with a deep mistrust of such crops by its citizens.The new approvals only apply to importing of grains into China, and not the planting of genetically modified seeds themselves. While China currently prohibits planting of genetically modified staples, western industry executives say they are hopeful that China will loosen those restrictions over time.There is a general scientific consensus in the U.S. that GMO crops are safe. But in China, doubts remain. While the government has said it believes genetically modified crops are safe in principle, it has been cautious about approving new varieties for imports, fearing a public backlash.Unlike in the U.S., China doesn\u2019t permit planting of genetically modified seeds for staple grains such as corn and soybeans. Loosening those restrictions is one measure that would help boost yields at Chinese farms, say industry executives, a huge goal for China\u2019s government as it strives to feed its growing middle class.State-owned China National Chemical Corp.\u2019s recent deal to buy Switzerland\u2019s Syngenta\u2014a major developer of genetically modified seeds\u2014brought such issues to the forefront of a public dialogue over genetically altered crops in China. Many foreign executives hope such a deal by a major Chinese state-owned enterprise could help open the market for more genetically modified crops over time.DuPont said that while it has yet to receive approval for an insect-control trait for corn it is seeking in China, it was \u201cencouraged by the fast progress\u201d of China\u2019s government in the latest approvals, and looked forward to the approval of additional products.China and the U.S. moved ahead this week with another aspect of the trade agreement, outlining rules for U.S. meatpackers to ship beef into China. The step is a precursor to China reopening its estimated $2.6 billion beef market to U.S. producers after nearly 14 years.\u2014Yang Jie contributed to this article.Write to Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.com and Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'China Clears Import of Pair of Modified Crops.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 21:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-greenlights-imports-of-two-new-gmo-products-1497444846", "news_title": "China Greenlights Imports of Two New GMO Products", "keywords": "china access,gmo crops,gmo foods,gmos,u.s. china trade,Monsanto,MON,China's Ministry of Agriculture,U.S. Soybean Export Council,Dow Chemical,DOW,Joe Vertin,regulation,government policy,new products,services,new product approvals,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,biotechnology,political,general news,sciences,humanities,agriculture,farming,support activities for agriculture,chemicals,food,beverages,tobacco,health care,life sciences,basic materials,resources,consumer goods,food products,genetically modified food,seeds"}, {"content": "A divide between Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruling family and executives of the kingdom\u2019s oil company over where to list its shares is slowing the march toward a planned 2018 initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.Executives at Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, are pushing Saudi Arabia\u2019s king and his son, Deputy Crown Prince       Mohammed bin Salman,        on the merits of listing the state-owned oil company on the             London Stock Exchange.Those executives are concerned that listing in the U.S. would expose the company to greater legal risks, including from potential class-action shareholder lawsuits, according to these people.But the Saudi Arabian royal court favors the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Atlanta-based             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.,       according to the people familiar with the matter, in part because of the kingdom\u2019s longstanding political ties to the U.S. and because the U.S. market represents the deepest pool of capital in the world.The visit by President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia last month helped to cement the prince\u2019s preference for New York, according to one of the people familiar with the decision process.\u201cThe deputy crown prince wants New York, and he has been pushing for it more and more in recent weeks,\u201d the person said.NYSE Group President       Thomas Farley       joined a group of U.S. executives to accompany Mr. Trump on his recent visit to Saudi Arabia. Similarly,         London Stock Exchange Group               PLC Chief Executive       Xavier Rolet       accompanied British Prime Minister Theresa May on her visit to Saudi Arabia in April, and they met with Aramco Chairman       Khalid al-Falih.A decision on where to list Aramco, which could value the company as high as $2 trillion, had been expected by some to come before the Islamic month of Ramadan, according to people familiar with the matter, but is now not expected until the end of July and could take longer than that.During a cabinet meeting late Monday night in Jeddah attended by both the prince and King Salman, senior company executives pressed their case for London as the safer bet, according to two people familiar with the matter.\u201cLondon is definitely the front-runner for them and the legal team,\u201d one of those people said of the Aramco executives who discussed the options at the cabinet meeting.The indecision about the venue is fueling a contest between the New York and London exchanges. Along with other major global exchanges, the two have been pitching the merits of their trading venues, in some cases touting their existing crop of energy stocks and the breadth of their country\u2019s energy sector to win the listing of what is likely to be the largest IPO in history.A Saudi Aramco spokesman said that no decision on a venue beyond a listing on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul exchange has been made, and that \u201call options continue to be held under consideration.\u201dA representative for the royal court didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.For the venues, such a listing promises more than healthy fees. It is likely to attract international investors looking for a piece of the oil producer, and that interest would generate greater trading volumes, the lifeblood of any stock market.Losing the battle for Aramco would mean forfeiting the bragging rights that it can use to compete against rivals for the next big IPO.In recent weeks, the London exchange has signaled to Saudi Aramco that even though U.K. rules require 25% of the company\u2019s shares to be held by public investors for a premium listing, which means a company meets the highest corporate governance and regulatory standards, it would consider lowering that threshold for the company or creating an international segment for some foreign companies, including Saudi Aramco. U.K. rules give the regulator the ability to lower the 25% requirement for such a listing.\u201cLondon is trying hard to accommodate Aramco,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the matter.The NYSE declined to comment, as did the LSE.Some officials who attended Monday night\u2019s meeting in Jeddah acknowledged that continuing to weigh the options and talking further with the two exchanges during the next month may yield better results for the company, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions.According to another person familiar with the discussions, the choice of venue is complicated by the royal court\u2019s reluctance to potentially put key economic relationships at risk by rejecting the exchanges of countries with which Saudi Arabia wants to court for investment or trade.A listing in New York, along with one on the Tadawul exchange, has long been the favored listing option for Prince Mohammed, who is driving the IPO as part of a broader push to overhaul and diversify the country\u2019s economy.Aramco also could decide to list on more than one exchange in addition to Tadawul as an alternative solution. Proceeds from the IPO are to be invested as part of the economic diversification plan.The back-and-forth over where to stage the listing highlights the singular nature of the effort to sell shares in the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing company. The involvement of secretive royal family in decision-making, and the tight interconnections between the family, the company and the kingdom\u2019s government, combine to make the deal stand out from other efforts around the world to privatize government assets.For some of the bankers involved, the slow pace of decision-making has been a frustration, because settling on the venue is a key step in moving the IPO process toward regulatory requirements for a listing.The company\u2019s size has also made the listing unique. The prince has pegged the value of the company at $2 trillion. While some officials working on the deal put its value closer to $1.5 trillion, even at the lower end of that range, Aramco would stand to raise at least $75 billion from the issue.The NYSE and the LSE represent two of the deepest pools of capital and are both home to the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies. NYSE energy listings include             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             ConocoPhillips,       while LSE\u2019s big-capitalized energy stocks include             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC and             BP                   PLC. The NYSE has argued in its pitch to Aramco that Shell and BP trade more on NYSE than LSE through American depository receipts, a security through which foreign-listed company can trade on U.S. exchanges.Any effort to relax U.K. rules for the Saudi listing may be met with investor protest. \u201cWe will be lobbying strongly against any concessions being granted should there be a formal attempt to IPO Aramco in the U.K.,\u201d Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said last week.\u201cAs long-term investors in the U.K. equity market we fear this precedent could lead to a slippery slope,\u201d he said. Royal London oversees about \u00a3104.5 billion ($133 billion) in assets.The indecision over the listing venue comes at a time when Saudi Arabia has severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, alleging the Persian Gulf emirate is harboring individuals and groups that support terror, an accusation Qatar has called baseless. Qatar Investment Authority, an investment arm of Qatar, is one of the LSE\u2019s largest shareholders with a 10% stake.Some observers have suggested that ownership could push Saudi Arabia to favor the NYSE over the LSE. However, two of the people familiar with the matter said the Saudi-Qatar diplomatic rift hasn\u2019t become an issue for bankers following the IPO.Aramco\u2019s concerns about the U.S. center mostly around the more litigious climate. Last year there were 300 securities class-action lawsuits filed in U.S. federal courts, up 32% from 2015 and the most since 2001, according to NERA Economic Consulting.Some officials have also expressed concern about a U.S. law that allows American terror victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\u2014Bradley Hope and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi Divide Slows Aramco\u2019s IPO.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 20:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-ipo-divided-over-where-to-list-1497459211", "news_title": "Saudi Aramco IPO Plans Slowed Over Where to List   ", "keywords": "$2 trillion ipo,saudi arabia state oil company,saudi aramco ipo,saudi aramco listing,worl's biggest ipo,world's biggest ipo,Saudi Arabian Oil,BP,BP.LN,Exxon Mobil,XOM,Intercontinental Exchange,ICE,London Stock Exchange Group,LSE.LN,Royal London Asset Management,ConocoPhillips,COP,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,UK:LSE,Thomas Farley,Xavier Rolet,Ashley Hamilton Claxton,Mohammed bin Salman,Khalid al-Falih,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,investing,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Federal prosecutors have filed charges against at least 10 members of Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       security detail who are accused of having played a role in last month\u2019s beatings of demonstrators protesting the Turkish leader\u2019s visit to the U.S. capital, officials said Wednesday.The charges, which one official said include felony assault against some of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s guards, are likely to inflame existing tensions between Turkey and the U.S., which will have to decide whether to seek extradition of the suspects, or to bar them from returning to America.The clash, which District of Columbia Police Chief Peter Newsham characterized as an unprovoked and \u201cbrutal attack on peaceful protesters,\u201d triggered widespread condemnation from U.S. lawmakers and unanimous approval for a House resolution denouncing the assaults. Some urged the U.S. to take the dramatic step of expelling Turkey\u2019s ambassador.Nine people were hospitalized after members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s security detail joined local supporters in beating demonstrators gathered outside the ambassador\u2019s residence to protest the Turkish leader\u2019s visit, according to eyewitnesses and analysts who studied the video. One police officer and two members of the U.S. Secret Service also were injured.Video images of the attacks captured by news crews and by people using cellphones provided prosecutors with evidence to pursue charges, which were filed in D.C. Superior Court, which handles local crimes in the city.The Turkish Embassy didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night on the charges, which were earlier reported by the             New York Times.Last month, the embassy accused the demonstrators of \u201caggressively provoking\u201d supporters of Mr. Erdogan and said they responded in self-defense.Videos of the incident showed men in suits with sidearms, later identified by independent analysts as members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s security detail, punching and kicking demonstrators. One video showed Mr. Erdogan conferring with a security guard, getting out of his car and watching the demonstration unfold before heading into the ambassador\u2019s residence.The bloody beatings marred Mr. Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington for his first Oval Office meeting with President       Donald Trump.       Mr. Trump has been looking to reset relations with Mr. Erdogan, who has embarked on a sweeping crackdown on domestic dissent that chilled his already strained relationships with former President       Barack Obama       and other Western leaders.The melee in Washington has created an early test for the two leaders.The U.S. State Department called in the Turkish ambassador as a signal of its concern over the beatings. Ankara responded by calling in the U.S. ambassador for a similar dressing down.The U.S. could seek extradition of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s security guards, but that could create a diplomatic crisis with Turkey, which is a pillar in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State.Turkey allows American pilots to use its Incirlik Air Base as a major launching pad for airstrikes against Islamic State, which is the focus of intensifying U.S.-led military offensives in neighboring Iraq and Syria.Turkey is unlikely to agree to any such extraditions, especially since the country is demanding that the U.S. hand over Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania that Mr. Erdogan has accused of orchestrating last summer\u2019s failed coup.Mr. Gulen has denied playing a role in the attempted coup, and U.S. officials have long said that Turkey faces an uphill challenge in winning his extradition.Instead of seeking extradition, the U.S. could effectively bar the suspects from returning to America by denying them visas. But U.S. officials said Wednesday they would wait to see how the cases proceed before deciding how to respond.In Washington, police say they arrested two other American citizens who are expected to face assault charges for their alleged role in beating demonstrators.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com and Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Files Charges in Turkish Embassy Melee.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 20:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-charging-at-least-10-turkish-security-officers-in-embassy-melee-1497482426", "news_title": "U.S. Charging at Least 10 Turkish Security Officers in Embassy Melee", "keywords": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan,assault,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,risk news"}, {"content": "PHOENIX\u2014The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, denounced the \u201calt-right\u201d movement and white supremacy on Wednesday, following a dramatic 24-hours during which the organization openly wrestled with whether to make such a statement.With thousands gathered here for the denomination\u2019s annual meeting, Southern Baptists\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0initially declined to move forward with a resolution denouncing the alt-right, a political term, short for alternative right, that describes a loose agglomeration of groups with far-right ideologies, some of which embrace the tenets of white supremacy.But within hours, the conservative evangelical denomination reversed course, following pleas on the convention floor that failing to take some action would leave Southern Baptists open to charges of racism.A rewritten resolution condemning \u201cthe anti-gospel of alt-right white supremacy\u201d was overwhelmingly approved on the convention floor on Wednesday.\u201cWe regret and apologize for the pain and the confusion that we created,\u201d said       Barrett Duke,        chair of the Committee on Resolutions, before the floor vote on Wednesday. His committee originally didn\u2019t recommend moving forward with a resolution denouncing the alt-right.\u201cPlease know that it is not because we don\u2019t share your abhorrence of racism and especially the particularly vicious form of racism that has manifested itself in the alt-right movement,\u201d Mr. Duke said. \u201cWe do.\u201dThe fight over whether to address the alt-right unleashed chaos on the first day of the Southern Baptists\u2019 annual meeting on Tuesday, and exposed racial and generational divides within the denomination.It also displayed the convention\u2019s democratic\u2014and sometimes messy\u2014processes.William Dwight McKissic, Sr., a prominent black Southern Baptist pastor, of Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, initially proposed a resolution, which he published before the convention, condemning the alt-right.\u201cThere has arisen in the United States a growing menace to political order and justice that seeks to reignite social animosities, reverse improvements in race relations, divide our people, and foment hatred,\u201d it said, in part.That proposal was rejected by the Committee on Resolutions, which cited confusion about who the \u201calt-right\u201d referred to. In addition to his apology on the convention floor, Mr. Duke later also apologized personally to Mr. McKissic.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that things have ended up like they have,\u201d Mr. McKissic said after the vote. \u201cI\u2019ve been encouraged to see a generation of Southern Baptists\u2014many of them younger but some of them not so younger\u2014say, we will not take this sitting down.\u201dStill, he expressed dismay that it took so long to get a resolution against white supremacy approved. He said that on Tuesday, he was getting texts messages from pastors around the country saying they would leave the convention if the resolution wasn\u2019t approved. He encouraged them to stay.\u201cThe convention is still owned and all the decision s are still made my white males,\u201d he said, adding that trouble had stemmed from a lack of diversity in leadership positions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201dThe denomination, which long struggled with race relations, is growing more diverse. Though 85% of Southern Baptists are white, according to a 2015 Pew Research study, racial minorities have been elected to denominational leadership positions in recent years. Last year, the convention called on Christians to stop displaying the confederate flag.But many Southern Baptists here\u2014especially younger ones\u2014worried that taking no action would be seen by outsiders as an endorsement of white nationalist groups.Members of the alt-right movement had taken aim against the Southern Baptists on social media over the weekend, as the committee was debating the initial resolution, briefly overrunning the annual meeting\u2019s             Twitter                   hashtag with denunciations of multiculturalism.On Tuesday, Richard Spencer, who heads the Montana-based National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group, and popularized the term \u201calt-right,\u201d wrote on Twitter: \u201cSo apparently the Southern Baptists Convention *didn\u2019t* denounce the Alt-Right after all. Interesting development!\u201dCharles Hedman, a pastor at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., said on the convention floor Wednesday that Twitter had been \u201cfull of the alt-right calling Southern Baptists heroes\u201d for failing to pass a resolution the day before. \u201cWe must issue an apology that we did not act on this yesterday,\u201d he said.There were, however, a string of procedural hurdles to clear, after the committee originally rejected to resolution.On Tuesday, Mr. McKissic tried to override the committee\u2019s decision not to move forward with the resolution, but he was voted down on the convention floor Tuesday.Then, several other pastors also pressed the convention to do something, warning that the convention would be labeled racist if no action was taken.A second vote on whether to move forward with an anti-alt-right resolution was held, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to overturn the committee\u2019s decision.Denomination leaders, seeing a potential crisis, maneuvered to change direction. Late in the day, young people streamed back into the convention hall, hoping that there would be another vote.\u201cI did contact our president, and did simply say, \u2018Look, I think we\u2019re headed for a train wreck,\u2019\u201d said Danny Akin, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.In an unusual step, at around 10 p.m. Tuesday, Steve Gaines, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, encouraged everyone in the hall to vote for it. Almost everyone assembled did, paving the way for a final vote to denounce the alt-right Wednesday.The resolution that the convention ultimately approved on was substantially altered from Mr. McKissic\u2019s original draft, highlighting many steps Southern Baptists had already taken in recent years to approve race relations. But Mr. McKissic said he was happy with it, because it called out and condemned the alt-right by name.Some noted that Southern Baptists hadn\u2019t, at any point, actually voted down a resolution condemning the alt-right: All of the votes Tuesday had been procedural.\u201cI believe with all my heart that the Southern Baptist Convention is not racist, and does not stand for the alt-right,\u201d said Stephen Fountain, a pastor at First Baptist Church of Buford in Buford, Ga. \u201cI breaks my heart that we\u2019re evening having this debacle, because it\u2019ll hurt the efforts of Southern Baptist churches in racially diverse communities to reach those communities with the gospel.\u201dWrite to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 20:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/southern-baptists-grapple-over-calls-to-condemn-alt-right-1497461944", "news_title": "Southern Baptists Grapple Over Calls to Condemn Alt-Right   ", "keywords": "alt-right,conference,phoenix,resolution,sbc,southern baptist convention,vote,white supremacy,Southern Baptist Convention,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,human rights,civil liberties,racism,social issues"}, {"content": "Add fiscal restraint to the list of losers in last week\u2019s British election.       Theresa May       has already started bidding for votes in the next general election by abandoning the restraints on spending imposed by her predecessor,       David Cameron.The new spending is the result of the loose coalition agreement Mrs. May\u2019s Tories have reached with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party (DUP). The best element will be a lower corporate-tax rate of 12.5% for Northern Ireland, equal to the rate in Ireland and competitive against the 17% that will apply in the rest of the U.K. by 2020. It\u2019s odd that the government would want to give business more incentive to invest in Belfast than Birmingham, but that\u2019s what happens when you have to buy votes in Parliament.As for spending, the Northern Irish tax cut will come without any reduction in the block-grant funding that Northern Ireland receives from other U.K. taxpayers. Mrs. May\u2019s plan to end the Cameron-era guarantee that pension payouts increase by 2.5% annually is also now running into DUP resistance.Meanwhile, Tories such as new May adviser       Gavin Barwell       complain that voters gave them an earful about government-employee pay freezes, so a raise for state employees may also be on the way. And backbench Tories are warning that entitlement reforms are now off the table.All this is a reversal of the policies pursued by Mr. Cameron and Chancellor       George Osborne.       They cut the corporate-tax rate from 28%, one of the main reasons the British economy has grown by more than 2% a year and revenues have boomed. They also reformed entitlements for working-age recipients, which is good for the fisc and employment. They allowed government employment to fall by 15% from its peak in 2009.Their main failure was political, notably in selling their economic policies as \u201causterity\u201d rather than aimed at growing the economy faster for broader prosperity. Their policies weren\u2019t all that austere in any case considering how much they increased pensions. Although the government headcount is lower, it still accounts for 17% of the workforce, compared to 15% in the U.S. (2% for the federal government). The British government\u2019s share of GDP has fallen below 43% from 48% since 2010, but that\u2019s still roughly the same as in Germany.The austerity label let voters conclude that spending restraint was temporary, with normal political largesse to resume after the financial crisis ended.       Jeremy Corbyn       responded in the recent campaign by saying the time for sacrifice is over, and now Mrs. May is moving in Labour\u2019s direction.The new Tory coalition is precarious but its success won\u2019t be measured in larger public benefits. It will depend on emerging from Brexit with policies that promote faster growth and persuade voters to rethink the role of the state in the economy. Tories like       Ruth Davidson       and perhaps now even Chancellor       Philip Hammond       are right that the focus must be on jobs and the economy.The alternative, which Mrs. May seems more inclined to pursue, is Labour-lite spending promises that dodge the austerity label but aren\u2019t sustainable without faster growth. This will undo Mr. Cameron\u2019s hard work in convincing voters that responsible budgeting is a virtue, and it\u2019s a recipe for economic anemia that could doom the Tories in the next election.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 20:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-truth-about-austerity-1497485597", "news_title": "The Truth About Austerity", "keywords": " austerity,britain, david cameron, election, george osborne, jeremy corbyn, parliament, philip hammond, ruth davidson, theresa may, tories,David Cameron,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,editorials"}, {"content": "International investors have rediscovered a love for Europe after a year\u2019s hiatus\u2014but this time, they love the euro, too.Once, investors who wanted to bet on Europe\u2019s stocks and bonds often did so while hedging against sharp changes in the euro\u2014a sign they weren\u2019t confident about the currency. But this year so far, $13 billion has flowed into U.S. exchange-traded funds focused on European shares without any such safeguards. For their hedged peers, inflows have run to a mere $275.4 million.In the first half of 2015, when investing in Europe was last popular in the U.S., $32.7 billion entered the same group of Europe-focused ETFs domiciled in North America. Of that, 63% was hedged against currency risk.\u201cIt looks like North American investors, in particular, have regained their appetite for European investments,\u201d said       Simon Colvin,        research analyst at             IHS Markit.       \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re now seeing a lot more political clarity, and there\u2019s been an overwhelming preference for unhedged products.\u201dThe risk that anti-euro nationalist       Marine Le Pen       would triumph in France\u2019s presidential election has now been removed, lifting a political obstacle to buyers.Unlike the last time European stocks became popular with U.S. buyers, the euro has appreciated recently, magnifying returns for American investors who haven\u2019t hedged their exposure to shifts in currency markets.The Euro Stoxx index, which is priced in euros, has returned\u00a012%\u00a0since the start of 2017. But because of the rise in the European currency\u2019s value, for U.S. investors exchanging their euro returns into dollars, it has returned\u00a019%.By comparison, in the first six months of 2015, the Euro Stoxx index returned 13% to European investors. But in dollar terms, the euro\u2019s fall meant that a buyer would have made only 4%.The decision not to hedge is now fueling the recent rise in the euro and helps explain why the currency has broken a traditional relationship with interest rates and bond yields.When U.S. investors buy European assets, they need to buy euros to acquire them, which drives up the value of the currency.But if they hedge their foreign-exchange risk in the forward market, they agree to sell euros at a specified dollar price in the future\u2014effectively canceling out the original purchase and muting the impact on the exchange rate.So despite huge inflows to European stocks during the first months of 2015, the euro actually fell, to as low as $1.05 in March 2015 from around $1.216 at the end of 2014.This time around, the euro has rallied with inflows, and the currency\u2019s conventional relationship with interest rates and bond yields has weakened.The gap between U.S. and German 10-year government-bond yields has barely changed since the week before the first round of the French presidential election, when U.S. two-year yields were 2.07 percentage points above their German peers. On Monday, the yields were 2.06 percentage points apart. But during that time the euro has risen by more than 5% against the dollar, climbing above $1.12.Currencies tend to track differences in bond yields because the yields work as a proxy for expected interest rates. Investors tend to move money to areas where interest rates are higher, driving up the domestic currency.One reason why interest-rate expectations have barely budged despite investors having piled into European stocks is that growth seems to be firming more quickly than inflation in the eurozone. Without a pickup in inflation, the European Central Bank may feel in no rush to raise interest rates to meet its target for inflation, which is to be near but below 2%.\u201cIt drives capital inflows into equities if you see an economy doing well, but you have this divergence between growth and inflation,\u201d said             Goldman Sachs                   strategist       Christian Mueller-Glissmann.       \u201cIt depends how much the ECB cares about growth, relative to how much they look at core inflation, which is still muted.\u201dThe ECB expects growth of 1.9% this year and 1.8% next year, but for inflation to reach just 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively. In June, it raised its growth forecasts but cut its outlook for inflation.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission says investors have the most bullish position against the euro in more than six years, with 74,009 more long contracts\u2014betting on the currency\u2019s appreciation\u2014than short contracts on the euro registered in the week to June 9.Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 20:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-love-european-stocksnow-they-love-the-euro-too-1497447702", "news_title": "Investors Find Renewed Faith in Euro", "keywords": " currencies, dollar, etfs,euro, foreign exchange, fx, markets,Simon Colvin,Marine Le Pen,Christian Mueller-Glissmann,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. and Qatar signed a preliminary agreement for the sale of dozens of             Boeing Co.       F-15 jet fighters to the Persian Gulf monarchy, in a transaction that risks further ensnaring the Trump administration in an escalating dispute between leading Arab countries.Qatar\u2019s Defense Ministry valued the contract at $12 billion and said it would create 60,000 American jobs. The preliminary deal was signed at the Pentagon on Wednesday by U.S. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       and his Qatari counterpart, Khalid al-Attiyah, said U.S. and Qatari officials.\u201cThis agreement underscores the longstanding commitment of the State of Qatar in jointly working with our friends and allies in the United States in advancing our military cooperation,\u201d Qatar\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries severed diplomatic relations with Qatar last week, and sealed their air and land borders, after charging the gas-rich emirate of financing terrorism and promoting extremist ideologies.Qatar is home to the Al Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East. American energy and defense companies have major investments in the country.The dispute between U.S. allies has placed the Trump administration in a diplomatic bind and resulted in conflicting statements coming out of Washington.President Donald Trump has appeared in recent days to side with Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., publicly accusing Qatar of financing terrorism at the \u201chighest levels.\u201d At the same time, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       has called for easing of the Arab states\u2019 economic squeeze on Qatar and offered to mediate the dispute.In private, U.S. officials have said the Trump administration is trying to take an evenhanded approach.A senior administration official on Wednesday said the Boeing sale has been in the works for a long period of time and officials realized a White House move to block the deal, or slow its progress, would have appeared as an attempt to undermine Doha.\u201cWe want to try and reintegrate Qatar amongst its neighbors,\u201d said the U.S. official. \u201cObviously, blocking it would have made the opposite statement.\u201dThe Obama administration last year first approved the possible sale of 72 F-15s for an estimated $21.1 billion, a deal which would keep the Boeing production line in St. Louis moving into the next decade after a previous dearth of new deals had threatened its closure. Mr. Trump has prioritized generating American jobs as part of his foreign-policy approach.A completed deal had come into question following the sanctions imposed against Qatar last week, said people involved in the process.Boeing claimed it had secured $50 billion in potential sales of jets, helicopters, munitions and other equipment to Saudi Arabia during Mr. Trump\u2019s recent state visit to the kingdom. The U.A.E., another big Boeing customer, backs Qatar\u2019s isolation.Qatar didn\u2019t detail Wednesday how many planes were involved in the current negotiations, though analysts had expected them to acquire an initial 36, with a potential follow-on deal for another 36.The proposed deal is a government-to-government negotiation, and a letter of agreement would entail the start of Pentagon talks with Boeing to facilitate a sale.Boeing declined to comment.Tensions between Qatar and its neighbors have shown little sign of easing in recent days.Saudi and Emirati officials said they are considering more sanctions against Doha. And they have so far rebuffed Mr. Tillerson\u2019s calls to soften their approach.The U. A.E\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, on Tuesday suggested that the U.S. consider moving its operations out of Qatar. He said the facility provides the country\u2019s ruling family leverage against the U.S. and its other allies.Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have charged Qatar of providing funds to al Qaeda-linked groups fighting in Syria and Libya. They also accuse Qatar\u2019s Al Jazeera television network of promoting radical ideologies across the Mideast. Qatar and Al Jazeera have denied those charges.\u201cMaybe someone in Congress should have a hearing and just say, you know, \u2018Should we consider moving it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Otaiba said of Al Udeid. \u201cAnd maybe not moving the entire base.

The probe centers on whether Mr. Wu was involved in bribery and other economic crimes at Anbang, these people said.Politically connected tycoons such as Mr. Wu, who has been married to a granddaughter of former leader       Deng Xiaoping,        have become a focus for China\u2019s leaders as the Communist Party gets set to hand President       Xi Jinping       a second five-year mandate at a high-level conclave this fall. Mr. Xi\u2019s political standing depends in part on party views of his signature anticorruption campaign, now nearly five years old.The investigation has been under way for months but is still in its early stages, and doesn\u2019t mean that charges will be brought, said the people familiar with the matter.In a statement Wednesday, Anbang said Mr. Wu, its 50-year-old chairman, is \u201ctemporarily unable to fulfill his role for personal reasons\u201d and has authorized other senior executives to manage the business. The company declined to comment further, and Mr. Wu couldn\u2019t be reached.Mr. Wu isn\u2019t the first prominent Chinese financier to drop from sight. Tomorrow Group\u2019s Xiao Jianhua has been missing since January. Hong Kong police and his businesses say he crossed the border into mainland China and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. His businesses say they have no information about him, and Chinese authorities haven\u2019t commented.Fosun Group\u2019s Guo Guangchang vanished briefly in late 2015 to help authorities with what the company later said were investigations. It spooked investors at the time, but there has been little apparent impact on Fosun after his re-emergence.A Chinese property mogul living in the U.S., Guo Wengui, has focused attention on the issue by making sweeping allegations of corrupt links between China\u2019s business and political elites, including high-ranking party officials. Mr. Guo, a billionaire with ties to a former deputy chief of China\u2019s domestic spy agency, has offered scant evidence. Chinese authorities have described Mr. Guo as a \u201ccriminal suspect\u201d and dismissed his claims as falsehoods, while the tycoon has denied wrongdoing.Mr. Wu\u2019s detention comes at a sensitive time for Mr. Xi, who has emphasized economic and financial stability for China ahead of the fall leadership meeting. If insurers like Anbang run into trouble\u2014either corruption or business problems\u2014investors could demand their money back, leaving the companies, which have invested in long-term assets such as real estate, struggling to raise for cash to repay short-term investors.The big risk for the Chinese leadership is that a company failure could set off a domino effect in a financial system struggling with high debt. So far there is no evidence of that happening, and a market selloff in reaction to Wednesday\u2019s Anbang news was limited to stocks in the company\u2019s portfolio.Mr. Wu was detained by a joint team of antigraft investigators and police officers specializing in economic crimes, said the people familiar with the matter. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption watchdog, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.In building Anbang, Mr. Wu was aggressive and detail-oriented, said people who have done business with him. \u201cHe\u2019s very hands-on, very quick in decision making,\u201d said the head of an Anbang-controlled European company who sees Mr. Wu a few times a year in Beijing.Anbang claims assets approaching $300 billion. The structure of the company is complex, and it has no key business units listed on a stock exchange. That keeps Mr. Wu off lists of the country\u2019s richest tycoons.\u201cThe shareholder structure is so obscured that it\u2019s impossible to see who owns it,\u201d says       Rupert Hoogewerf,        who runs a Shanghai wealth-tracking service called Hurun Report.After a string of takeovers following the global financial crisis, Anbang shot to international recognition in 2014 when it agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy New York\u2019s historic Waldorf Astoria hotel from             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.       President Xi stayed in the hotel for the following year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly.Disclosure concerns this year thwarted Mr. Wu\u2019s bid to expand into the U.S. insurance sector. Anbang\u2019s $1.5 billion bid to take control of Iowa-based             Fidelity & Guaranty Life                   unraveled after it failed to win approval from New York insurance regulators, who had found Anbang\u2019s answers about shareholders and funding insufficient, according to people involved and official statements. Disclosure was also an issue for the multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. when it looked at the bid, according to a person familiar with the situation.Last year, Anbang and its partners walked away from a $14 billion bid to buy Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. In March, New York real-estate developer Kushner Cos. said it had ceased talks with Anbang for a planned $7.5 billion redevelopment of a mixed-use skyscraper in Manhattan.       Jared Kushner,        a senior White House official and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been running the family-controlled Kushner business before last year\u2019s election.Anbang was one of China\u2019s fastest-growing insurance companies. The insurance sector came under scrutiny late last year after many insurers increased their investments in risky assets and became aggressive buyers in the equity market. Chinese insurers held about $175 billion in deposits associated with universal-life policies at the end of 2016, more than triple the amount two years earlier, according to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.Mr. Wu\u2019s aggressiveness was exhibited in Anbang\u2019s efforts to change how insurance is sold in China. Instead of offering commissions to agents who sell home and life coverage, Anbang pulled in revenue through banks and online platforms by selling products called universal life that function more like short-term deposits than insurance policies.The Anbang chairman defended his company\u2019s foreign-investment strategy in an interview published by state-owned Beijing News earlier this year, a time of insurance-sector turmoil that included a 10-year ban for a competitor and the toppling of the top regulator.The interview showed Mr. Wu still in control of Anbang, but signaling his willingness to get in step with government priorities by pursuing more traditional business lines such as pensions, which he called its \u201cnew starting point.\u201d\u2014Lingling Wei, Chao Deng and Carolyn Cui contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Chinese Tycoon Held In Corruption Probe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 19:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-deal-maker-held-in-corruption-probe-1497483659", "news_title": "Chinese Deal Maker Held in Corruption Probe", "keywords": "anbang,anbang insurance,china,china corruption,china government,guo guangchang,guo wengui,wu xiaohui,xiao jianhua,Anbang Insurance Group,Fidelity & Guaranty Life,FGL,Hilton Worldwide Holdings,HLT,Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide,Fosun Group,Tomorrow Group,Wu Xiaohui,Xiao Jianhua,Guo Guangchang,Guo Wengui,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,real estate,property,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,hotels (except casino),motels,insurance,financial services,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "In the 1990s, Western liberalism\u2019s triumph seemed inevitable. The Soviet empire had disintegrated.       Francis Fukuyama       had proclaimed the \u201cend of history.\u201d By the end of the decade, the U.S. economy was surging, fueling higher living standards at every income level. More and more countries were seeking to establish the liberal political and economic systems that would allow them to share in the prosperity. At home and abroad, the future seemed bright, almost boundless.In hindsight, however, the 1990s look less like the ascent of Western liberalism than its heyday. As it turned out, the late \u201990s represented the only period since the early 1970s in which Americans enjoyed the benefits of economic growth so broadly; for more than four decades, with the exception of those at the top of the wealth distribution, incomes have remained mostly stagnant. Around the world, since the turn of the millennium, some 25 democracies have failed, and movements to liberalize\u2014most notably, the Arab Spring\u2014have generally ended in violent collapse.In 2016, simmering fear and frustration boiled over as American voters elected a political outsider who expressed no interest in promoting the U.S.-led liberal order. And while optimists view       Donald Trump       as a historical accident, British journalist       Edward Luce       begs to differ. In \u201cThe Retreat of Western Liberalism,\u201d he warns that Trumpism could prove less an accident than a portent in the United States and across the West.\u201cWestern liberalism\u201d can be a mushy term, and even though his book is premised on it, Mr. Luce offers no clear definition. He instead points to elements that, one presumes, are supposed to add up to a whole\u2014texts like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the belief in democracy in the hearts of Westerners and the spread of democratic systems over time. Whatever this whole is, Mr. Luce sees it under assault. America has elected an essentially illiberal president who is \u201ca big fan of walls and a big admirer of       Vladimir Putin.      \u201d Overseas, democratic capitalism\u2019s broken promises have made the quick-fix pledges of demagogues more appealing. Britain\u2019s \u201cleft-behinds\u201d voted against the London elite and opted for Brexit; right-wing autocrats mounted serious campaigns in France, the Netherlands and elsewhere across Europe (albeit with mixed success). In every year since 2008 more countries have restricted freedom than have expanded it, according to the global watchdog organization Freedom House.By Edward Luce  Atlantic Monthly Press, 234 pages, $24Mr. Luce devotes much of his book to why this global rebellion is happening, and why now. His thesis is straightforward. While the rich enjoy greater opulence, living and working among themselves in isolated enclaves, half to two-thirds of Westerners have been \u201ctreading water\u2014at best\u2014for a generation\u201d as globalization and robotics have combined to limit wages and eliminate jobs. Productivity growth fueled the economic surge that doubled living standards from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, but the productivity gains that the digital revolution was supposed to deliver haven\u2019t materialized. Meanwhile, the costs of health insurance and higher education\u2014both essential to upward mobility\u2014have continued to rise, putting them increasingly out of reach of the classes that would benefit from them most and making social stratification more pronounced.How does this growing inequality affect the liberal project? \u201cLiberal democracy\u2019s strongest glue is economic growth,\u201d Mr. Luce argues. \u201cWhen groups fight over the fruits of growth, the rules of the political game are relatively easy to uphold. When those fruits disappear, or are monopolised by a fortunate few, things turn nasty.\u201d Across the West, Mr. Luce explains, the non-rich losers in this zero-sum game have started to turn against the status quo. For the United States, Mr. Luce cites as evidence the fact that \u201cevery single one of America\u2019s 493 wealthiest counties, almost all of them urban, voted for       Hillary Clinton.       The remaining 2623 counties, most of them suburban or small-town, went for Donald Trump.\u201dU.S. foreign policy and international economic arrangements have contributed, too. Overseas, the Great Recession delivered a body blow to democracy as a global brand. So did       George W. Bush\u2019s       messy war in Iraq and       Barack Obama\u2019s       reluctance to support democratic movements abroad. Meanwhile, the out-of-touch Davos crowd urges more support for the very policies\u2014e.g., more trade and more decision-making by international bodies\u2014against which the West\u2019s frustrated masses are revolting.Mr. Luce acknowledges that the future isn\u2019t preordained, but he\u2019s worried that we\u2019re headed the wrong way, running out of time to correct course and not nearly concerned enough about where we\u2019ll end up. He suggests some policy ideas that he thinks can help: universal health care, a simplified tax regime, and immigration policies that are more humane but restore \u201cthe link between public benefits and citizenship.\u201d He notes, though, that even if they can be enacted these changes will only mitigate the pernicious effects of flat-lining wages. They won\u2019t address the underlying problem.The sad truth is that we don\u2019t know how to solve the underlying problem. We don\u2019t know how to ensure that the fruits of economic growth are more broadly shared or how to prevent automation from killing more jobs than it creates. Policy makers have been grappling with anemic wage growth and the angry politics it can breed for more than four decades. Hardly a revelation, Mr. Luce\u2019s book is instead a compendium of telling anecdotes that enrich our understanding of a long-term trend.In this sense, Mr. Luce offers a useful wake-up call to elites, urging them to focus on the very real struggles of America\u2019s besieged middle class before we all lose the freedom and democracy we cherish. If he doesn\u2019t have all the answers, at least he\u2019s asking the right questions in this concise, accessible and valuable work.Mr. Haas is the author, most recently, of \u201cHarry and Arthur:       Truman,       Vandenberg,        and the Partnership That Created the Free World.\u201dAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Holding the West Together.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lights-out-for-the-west-1497483205", "news_title": "Lights Out for the West", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "While       Jeff Sessions       was testifying Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Sen.       Ron Wyden       suggested that the attorney general had recused himself from investigating Russian electoral meddling because of unknown, \u201cproblematic\u201d reasons. \u201cThere are none\u2014I can tell you that for absolute certainty,\u201d Mr. Sessions shot back, dismissing the supercilious charge as \u201csecret innuendo.\u201dGood for Mr. Sessions. But since Democrats seem intent on preparing the battlefield for the 2018 midterm elections, expect more such baseless charges. Never mind the damage they do to public trust.Consider the accusation that President       Trump       obstructed justice in the FBI investigation of former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.       According to former FBI Director       James Comey,        the president told him: \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no question he abused power,\u201d House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       said last week. Two Democratic backbenchers, Reps.       Al Green       of Texas and       Brad Sherman       of California, have even drafted articles of impeachment based on the charge.But I talked to four legal experts\u2014two former Justice Department officials, a former White House lawyer and a former U.S. attorney\u2014who all agreed Mr. Trump has the rightful power, as head of the executive branch, to order the FBI to end any investigation.One expert raised this thought experiment: If President       John F. Kennedy       had ordered FBI Director       J. Edgar Hoover       to stop investigating Martin Luther King Jr., would that have constituted obstruction of justice?It\u2019s also far from clear Mr. Trump ordered anything. His words were vague. A hope is not an order. The president said he wanted to get to the bottom of Russian election meddling. He added that he hoped Mr. Comey would discover whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201csatellites\u201d\u2014an apparent reference to people who worked in his presidential campaign\u2014had done anything wrong. Both statements suggest Mr. Trump wanted the Russian investigation to go forward and believed it would clear his name.The statute that describes obstruction of justice speaks of \u201ccorrupt\u201d conduct. Yet there is no evidence Mr. Trump acted with criminal purpose\u2014for example, that he was bribed to shut down the Flynn investigation, or that he was trying to hide some personal financial interest in Mr. Flynn\u2019s foreign lobbying. No wonder Mr. Comey, when discussing the conversation at the time with other officials, didn\u2019t claim obstruction.Still, Mr. Trump has created a potential problem for himself. At a Friday press conference, ABC\u2019s       Jonathan Karl       asked the president whether he would be \u201cwilling to speak under oath to give your version of those events.\u201d Mr. Trump replied: \u201cOne hundred percent.\u201dThe president had better hope that       Robert Mueller,        the special counsel now looking into potential Russia-Trump ties, is nothing like Patrick Fitzgerald, the special counsel appointed in 2003 to investigate the leaking of a CIA official\u2019s name to the columnist       Robert Novak.Mr. Fitzgerald knew within days, if not hours, of his appointment that the leak had come from Deputy Secretary of State       Richard Armitage       but that it violated no law since the CIA employee was no longer a covert operative.Despite no underlying crime, Mr. Fitzgerald spent more than three years obsessed with trying to justify his existence by prosecuting someone in the Bush White House for lying under oath. I was one of those in his sights.He focused on me because, while I could not remember a brief call in 2003 from a Time reporter, I had ordered my staff the following year to search for any evidence I had talked to the journalist. That was supposed to be proof I had lied. Mr. Fitzpatrick gave up hunting me only when he learned that my lawyer had directed me to search my files after hearing from the reporter\u2019s colleague that I had talked with him.Instead Mr. Fitzpatrick indicted the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, a very good man, on a disagreement over who said what, when and to whom.Today, given what we know, Mr. Trump is not vulnerable on obstruction of justice. But if Mr. Mueller turns out to be another Mr. Fitzgerald and finds no underlying offense, he may decide that he must still get someone for something, even over inconsequential differences of memory.Promising to speak under oath is dangerous for Mr. Trump, since any trial would be in Washington, D.C. There were no Republicans on Mr. Libby\u2019s jury, and Mr. Trump received a mere 4% of the vote there. The president better pray Robert Mueller is more responsible than Patrick Fitzgerald.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of \u201cThe Triumph of       William McKinley       \u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Appeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 19:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-trump-has-to-fear-from-mueller-1497483110", "news_title": "What Trump Has to Fear From Mueller", "keywords": "jeff sessions,patrick fitzgerald,perjury,russia,scooter libby,trump,valerie plame,vice president cheney,white house,FBI,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court will convene Thursday afternoon for a tradition-rich ceremony welcoming its newest member. Like a civil wedding, Justice       Neil Gorsuch\u2019s       investiture will be short and sweet. After the attorney general reads aloud the formal commission, Justice Gorsuch will be escorted up to his seat, the chief justice will make a few welcoming remarks, and the court will adjourn.Entirely symbolic, the ceremony comes during the court\u2019s busiest season, with the frenetic rush to decide the remaining cases from the term that began last October. After his rancor-filled confirmation process, Justice Gorsuch joined the court in mid-April, in time to participate in the final 13 cases. On Monday the court issued his first opinion, in Henson v. Santander. It was unanimous.Predictions about judicial behavior are frequently off-base, but Justice Gorsuch so far comes across as an energetic jurist in the Scalia mold. He set a rookie record for the number of questions asked\u201422\u2014in a first appearance at the high court. Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       previously held the mark at 15.On the substance, Justice Gorsuch seems committed to honoring       Antonin Scalia\u2019s       legacy. In a lecture last year at Case Western Reserve University, then-Judge Gorsuch proudly embraced his predecessor\u2019s approach to the law: \u201cThough the critics are loud and the temptations to join them may be many, mark me down too as a believer that the traditional account of the judicial role Justice Scalia defended will endure.\u201dWhen Scalia ascended to the high court in 1986, he saw the danger of a runaway judiciary, as embodied in the Warren Court and to a lesser extent the Burger Court. The judges were \u201cmaking it up\u201d as they went along. Justice Gorsuch used those words in his first oral argument, a case involving a complex interplay of federal statutes. Like Scalia, Justice Gorsuch searched for an authoritative answer in the text alone. That approach, textualism, was Scalia\u2019s way of restoring the judiciary\u2019s proper role.Statutory interpretation provides daily grist for the judicial mill, but the stakes are far higher in interpreting the Constitution. To the textualist school, \u201cmaking it up\u201d is the ultimate judicial sin.In contrast to Scalia, Justice Gorsuch came of age as a lawyer not in the freewheeling Warren Court era, but during the more judicially restrained leadership of Chief Justice       William Rehnquist.

James Hodgkinson,        a 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois, began to fire on the dozens of Members and staff assembled on the field. He struck Mr. Scalise in the hip at second base and wounded a lobbyist and one House aide before the officers returned fire and were hurt themselves.The officers shot and subdued Hodgkinson, who later died of his wounds, but imagine the carnage had the officers not been armed and ready to act on the spot. Their response is a reminder of the bravery of police who must be trained to respond in an instant when tedious routine becomes a mortal threat. The remarkable good fortune\u2014the wounded are all expected to recover\u2014also teaches again that the best defense against marauding men with guns is other men and women with guns.Police haven\u2019t disclosed a motive, but the evidence suggests it was political. Hodgkinson had multiple social-media posts expressing fury at President       Trump       and Republicans. Rep.       Ron DeSantis       of Florida said that as he left the practice field early he was approached by a man who asked if those on the field were Republicans or Democrats. Mr. DeSantis later recognized the man as Hodgkinson, who had been a volunteer for the       Bernie Sanders       presidential campaign.Politically motivated attempts at mass murder aren\u2019t common but they do happen and too often they\u2019re exploited for partisan ends. The good news is that on Wednesday most political leaders rose to higher ground.President Trump offered gracious condolences to the wounded, praise for the officers, and a call to national unity. Speaker       Paul Ryan       and Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       united to denounce the attack, and Mr. Sanders disavowed and denounced Hodgkinson. Mr. Ryan said the baseball game will go on as scheduled\u2014to a thunderous ovation.These are divisive political times, when verbal abuse and physical harassment are all too frequent against political opponents. The duty of political leaders and the rest of us is to keep the divisions in the perspective of our shared values of free debate and democratic consent. One way to contribute to a better political climate would be to stop claiming as a reflex that victory by the opposing party is illegitimate, and another would be to stop portraying political assassination as entertainment.Congress has already imposed tougher security restrictions on access to the Capitol since 9/11, but the Members have to think about more far-reaching security when they appear in public. We admire those who represent Americans without fear, and maybe that\u2019s the risk we have to take in a free society.

Progressives who used to deride the GOP for incompetence are now panicked that they may really succeed, and thus the faux tantrums.The distortion du jour is that the GOP is operating \u201cin secret.\u201d This week Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of working \u201cbehind closed doors, writing a bill they won\u2019t let the public read. . . . Today, no Member of Congress can read the bill because we don\u2019t know what it is.\u201dDespite       Mr. Schumer\u2019s       bewilderment, he still knew enough to assert that the Senate bill will \u201cgreatly hurt the American people.\u201d Well, which is it? And if Republicans are trying to suppress a public debate about repealing and replacing       Obama      Care, then they haven\u2019t prevailed, either now or across the presidential campaign. Health care has been central to U.S. political debate for nearly a decade as Democrats created a new entitlement with little public support.Compared to that effort, the Senate this time has been a model of deliberative democracy. On Dec. 19, 2009, a Saturday, then Majority Leader       Harry Reid       tossed the 2,100-page bill the Senate had spent that fall debating and offered a new bill drafted in an invitation-only back room. Democrats didn\u2019t even pretend to care what was in it while passing it in the dead of night on Dec. 24, amid a snowstorm, in the first Christmas Eve vote since 1895.Liberals excused this legislative sausage-making as the price of making history, which was an insult to sausages. MIT economist and ObamaCare architect       Jonathan Gruber       told an academic audience in 2014 that \u201clack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201dMr. Gruber has since re-emerged to complain of the current debate that \u201cI\u2019m just worried about the speed they\u2019re moving at for what that implies, because it implies no effort to actually get this right.\u201d The professor had apologized for what he called his \u201cinexcusable\u201d remarks in 2014 but he\u2019s betting he can con Americans again.The irony is that the GOP negotiations are so time-consuming because Senators are trying to improve the product as they build a consensus that can get 50 votes. They\u2019re trying to answer the House bill\u2019s critics on the left and right, not that they\u2019ll get any credit.One objection is that the House\u2019s tax credits aren\u2019t generous enough to help the working poor; the Senate is likely to increase their value. Another is that the House\u2019s Medicaid expansion wind-down is too disruptive for Governors to manage; the Senate will probably create a longer off-ramp. When they reach an agreement, they\u2019ll release the specifics.The policy parameters are known to anyone paying attention, including those like Mr. Gruber who are arguing in especially bad faith because no bill the Senate could possibly produce would satisfy them. Even as the GOP moves the bill toward the political center, reflexive liberal opposition increases.Mr. Schumer claimed Republicans have \u201csolicited zero bipartisan support,\u201d which is hilarious. Democrats opted for total pre-emptive resistance to the       Trump       Administration, and in January Mr. Schumer and       Nancy Pelosi       announced together that \u201cwe are a united caucus. We are two united caucuses. And we\u2019re united in our opposition to these Republican attempts to make America sick again,\u201d as he put it. House Republicans hadn\u2019t even released a bill at that point and the ObamaCare exchanges were already in increasing distress, but Democrats refused to participate.This is also a notable change from 2009-10, when Democrats froze out centrist Republicans who wanted to cut a bipartisan deal of the kind       Orrin Hatch       and       Ted Kennedy       had struck on the children\u2019s health insurance program. The Obama White House preferred a far more liberal program that would complete the entitlement state.

The real surprise Wednesday is that the government\u2019s measure of inflation fell in May to below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.The Fed\u2019s governors and regional presidents might have been spooked by that decline in the price level to below their target, and a year or two ago they would have been. But the economy has now reached its eighth anniversary of expansion, and the Fed is still holding its target interest rate of 1%-1.25% below the increase in the consumer price index. The real rate of interest is still negative, even as the national jobless rate has fallen to 4.3% and the global economy seems to be accelerating.In other words, the Fed hardly seems at risk of tightening too quickly even if the dangers of price inflation are receding. Much of the price decline is due to the fall in oil prices in recent weeks, and the Fed\u2019s decision makers should see how that moves through the overall economy in the coming months.Monetary conditions have even eased since the Fed\u2019s last move as long-bond rates have fallen. Investors bid up bond yields after they anticipated pro-growth tax policies from the new Republican Congress and President, and they have bid them back down as they grow more doubtful of that result. The Open Market Committee\u2019s estimates for future interest rate levels suggested one more increase through the end of 2017, but the committee can adjust that pace if the economy slows.The Fed also released more detail of its plans to begin winding down the huge balance sheet it acquired during and since the financial panic. Sometime this year the Fed will stop reinvesting all of the principal proceeds of its securities as they mature. The Fed will initially cap its roll off at $6 billion a month for Treasury bonds and $4 billion a month for mortgage-related debt and securities.The idea seems to be to go slow given that the Fed has never attempted this kind of policy reversal.

Yet these \u201cFed watching\u201d discussions aren\u2019t necessarily productive. It would be better to rethink the Fed by evaluating its strategy, structure and accountability.How can the institution be restructured to better achieve its goals of financial and price stability? The late economist       Allan Meltzer,        a scholar and historian of the Fed, gave the central bank high marks in these objectives in only about a quarter of its years in operation. An understanding of why the Fed succeeded and failed in the past is a natural guide to reform.Economists emphasize two factors accounting for periods of Fed failure: political influence on Fed decisions and adherence to false models of the financial system and the economy. In the first, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet or regulatory power may be hijacked in service of the government\u2019s near-term electoral or fiscal objectives. In the second, ignorance of economic conditions or doctrinaire attention to false models may blow Fed policy off course.Independence, sometimes put forth as the key insulation against politicization of the Fed, has not proved sufficient to guarantee stability. Policy errors during the Great Depression, the inflationary period of 1965-79, and the accommodative run-up to the 2007-09 financial crisis all occurred during times of substantial independence. Nor is ostensible freedom an antidote to politicization, as political pressures certainly figured in the 1960s and \u201970s.Milton Friedman       recognized the limits of independence\u2014given the choice of an independent central bank with complete discretion, a commodity standard, and a monetary rule, he chose the rule. For today\u2019s debate, I would say an institution capable of executing a framework for price and financial stability needs independence from formal government control. But such a framework must be clear and credible at all times: specifying an analytical approach, laying out how departures from normal financial and economic conditions will be addressed, and explaining those departures when they occur. Call it \u201cmaintain and explain.\u201dStructural reforms of the Fed can mitigate political influence. First, a credible, simple monetary framework can offer significant insulation from political pressure, while increasing the likelihood of success in achieving the Fed\u2019s objectives. Inflation targeting\u2014that is, a commitment to conduct monetary policy consistent with a target long-run inflation rate\u2014is a familiar example for a goal. Likewise, the Fed should describe the balance-sheet size it believes it requires for the conduct of monetary policy. And it should spell out mechanisms it will use in lending during times of stress or crisis.The Fed should also specify an operating framework. This could include, for example, following a variant of the Taylor rule, which sets an ideal level for the federal-funds rate based on output and inflation. Another crucial step: a mechanical path for normalization of the balance sheet and clarity about the assets the Fed will hold. Limiting itself to only Treasury securities, for example, would prevent opportunities for political pressure to be brought on the Fed not to acquire or sell them.Allowing Fed officials discretion to deviate in times of stress would enhance their credibility\u2014but only if such decisions are explained clearly in advance and are consistent with the overall framework. This maintain-and-explain process would enhance understanding of the Fed\u2019s success in achieving its objectives and enforce accountability when it is not. Such discretion also would grant flexibility in monetary policy and lender-of-last-resort actions in periods of stress.While a clear and consistent framework gives the Fed a strategy, structure remains important. Giving the Fed a larger role in financial regulation has proved to be fraught with opportunities for political pressure, since elected officials can review such regulatory actions. This was the case after the financial crisis, when the Fed\u2019s regulatory power expanded and its political scrutiny did too.Strategy and structure matter, but ultimately personnel is policy. Including regional bank presidents in the Federal Open Market Committee brings intellectual and political diversity to the Fed decision-making process. Choosing Fed leaders committed to the maintain-and-explain framework and to resisting political influence is essential as a last line of defense.The false-model account of Fed failure played a role in the Great Depression, the inflationary \u201960s and \u201970s, and the pre-financial-crisis years. During the Depression a failure to discriminate between real and nominal interest rates, as well as the now-discredited \u201creal bills doctrine,\u201d were enabling failures. The Fed\u2019s emphasis on the simple Phillips curve also built in a policy bias toward accelerating inflation several decades later. And the Fed from 2002-05 placed too little weight on financial imbalances encouraged by an easy-money policy.Three steps can bolster defenses against false models. The first is to strengthen research inside and outside the Fed on the integration of finance and monetary policy and the economy, an intellectual gap exposed by the financial crisis. Second, Fed officials should interact more with market participants and businesspeople to understand financial innovations and economic developments better. Policy should be more reflective of proactive data gathering than reactive data dependence. Finally, Fed governors should be chosen with varied life experiences to broaden economic perspectives and encourage a healthy skepticism about prevailing models.The Fed faces a challenge in crafting and explaining normalization of the extraordinary measures undertaken during the financial crisis. There is now also an opportunity to make personnel decisions that shape the Fed\u2019s strategy, structure, and accountability.

One popular idea\u2014supported in the past by President Trump, and by 80% of the public in some polls\u2014is for Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices directly. But such negotiation would work only if there were some limitations on the drugs available to patients, raising many questions about the feasibility of creating a national formulary. Would beneficiaries accept that?To gain insight, look to the Department of Veterans Affairs, where I practice as a physician. The VA has maintained a national formulary for two decades, and it is one of the most well-respected and high functioning aspects of this oft-maligned agency. Drugs not on the formulary are available, but reserved for when the formulary drug is inappropriate or ineffective. Before prescribing Byetta for your diabetes, for example, your doctor will prescribe formulary drugs like metformin or Jardiance. That should sound familiar to most Americans with private insurance, who increasingly face \u201cprior authorization\u201d to rein in drug costs.The VA formulary ensures high-quality prescribing while lowering costs for patients and taxpayers. Patients with hepatitis C pay an out-of-pocket maximum of $33 for a full course of Harvoni in the VA, compared with around $6,000 in Medicare Part D. Humira, a chronic therapy for arthritis and bowel disease, costs Medicare patients more than $1,500 annually, compared with less than $132 in the VA. These low copayments are set by the underlying law. But it is the formulary that enables the VA to negotiate these low prices, keep copayments low, and provide generous medication benefits.The VA formulary works for doctors as well as patients. Although it is national, there is local control over how it\u2019s implemented, and every step is electronic. To order a nonformulary drug, I enter a clinical justification for its use into the computer. The request is quickly reviewed by a pharmacist in my facility, whom I know and can easily talk to. This experience is far preferable to that of doctors in the private sector, who have to fax forms to unknown insurance-company employees for approval.A national formulary is not something to fear when it can be managed locally, electronically and transparently. While it would be impossible to have every physician group in Medicare adjudicate the formulary itself, small regional units could be developed within states, with local health-care providers adjudicating nonformulary requests from their own colleagues. Importantly, these requests would be infrequent because the vast majority of patients would do perfectly well on drugs that are on the formulary, as they do in the VA.There are trade-offs. With a national Medicare formulary, there would be no option to switch insurers to access specific nonformulary drugs. But insurance products would undoubtedly be created to address nonformulary drugs, akin to Medigap coverage, and elected representatives would surely be active in addressing formulary concerns. Medicare could also choose to institute a national formulary for only a small subset of expensive drugs, deferring other formulary decisions to private plans.A national formulary is compatible with high-quality, efficient and safe health care, as demonstrated by independent analyses comparing the VA with the private sector. A national formulary could save the country billions on its prescription bill, and the VA could serve as a model.Dr. Gellad is director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.

After Donald Trump used a tweet to revive his long-running feud with the mayor of London amid the June 3 killings, CNN personality       Reza Aslan       tweeted that Mr. Trump was a \u201cpiece of s\u2014.\u201dSome take comfort that these displays did not go unpunished.

But the Trump phenomenon only accelerated forces that were plummeting in this direction before the 2016 election.Social media\u2014a permanent marinade for the human brain\u2014is causing a vast, mysterious transformation of how people process experience, and maybe someday a future       B.F. Skinner       will explain what it has done to us.Impossible to miss, though, is how jacked up emotional intensity has become in American politics. The campaign rallies of both Mr. Trump and       Bernie Sanders       often sat on the edge of violence. Reporters describe political town hall meetings as full of \u201cangry\u201d voters. Shouting down the opposition in these forums or on campus has been virtually internalized as standard behavior. Refusal to reason is the new normal. And then the unreason is euphemized as free speech.Explaining away these impulses as a routine turn of the populist political cycle is insufficient. Something more permanent is happening.I remain fascinated with the case of the 10 incoming Harvard freshmen who celebrated their achievement by posting a series of remarkably repulsive, violent photographic memes on Facebook. One said abusing children was sexually arousing; another described the hanging of a Mexican child as \u201cpi\u00f1ata time.\u201dWhat those no-longer Harvard students had done was create a \u201cprivate\u201d Facebook messaging board, where they somehow felt free to mock and subvert current social convention. They aren\u2019t alone. The website Reddit, which has about 500 million monthly visitors, became known for similar \u201canonymous\u201d bulletin boards on which men, for example, exchange outrageous sexual postings.We negotiate much of daily life now in tense, parallel universes: One is overflowing with individual political and social behavior that is deviant\u2014flights from the norm\u2014at a time when broader norms of political and social behavior are enforced with a vengeance. Today you can get shamed, sued or fired for almost any conceivable offense.In reaction, millions of people\u2014including the president\u2014seem to regard social media as a kind of wildlife refuge, where they can run naked against society\u2019s dammed-up personal and political opinions.The possibilities for psychological dislocation are limitless. Kathy Griffin justified her beheaded-Trump stunt by arguing, \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with older white guys trying to keep me down my whole life.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0This is a woman thing.\u201dWe know that political anger and violence can become mystical in its attraction, especially at the margin for people like political shooter James Hodgkinson. This is a good moment to dial it back. The Public Theater\u2019s management could cancel their staged Trump assassination in Central Park. But they won\u2019t. Like so many others with political disorder syndrome, they no longer can.Write henninger@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 19:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-disorder-syndrome-1497482088", "news_title": "Political Disorder Syndrome", "keywords": "donald trump,james t hodgkinson,julius caesar,public theater,republican congress,steve scalise,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "President       Trump       has voiced a widely shared\u2014but incorrect\u2014belief that the global economy is a zero-sum game. \u201cOne by one,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address, \u201cthe factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.\u201d In his first White House meeting only a few days later, Mr. Trump warned a roomful of CEOs that companies sending factories overseas would face a new border tax.Mr. Trump assumes that when U.S. multinationals expand abroad, it necessarily reduces the number of people they employ in the U.S. But this assumption is wrong, and tariffs would hurt American workers, not help them.Academic research has repeatedly found that when U.S. multinationals hire more people at their overseas affiliates, it does not come at the expense of American jobs. How can this be? Large firms need workers of many different skills and occupations, and the jobs done by employees abroad are often complements to, not substitutes for, those done by workers at home. Manufacturing abroad, for example, can allow workers in the U.S. to focus on higher value-added tasks such as research and development, marketing, and general management. Additionally, expanding overseas to serve foreign customers or save costs often helps the overall company grow, resulting in more U.S. hiring.The ultimate proof is in the numbers. Between 2004 and 2014, the most recent year for which U.S. government data are available, total employment at foreign affiliates of U.S. multinationals rose from nine million to 13.8 million. Yet the number of jobs at U.S. parent companies rose nearly as much, from 22.4 million to 26.6 million.Over the same period, the value-added and capital investment grew faster among U.S. parent companies than in their foreign affiliates. In fact, on these two measures the American parent companies outperformed the overall U.S. private sector. This suggests that having overseas affiliates gives companies a competitive advantage that allows them to invest more at home. More than ever, jobs in America are connected to the world.One can always find anecdotes of a company closing an American facility and moving the work it does overseas. But these anecdotes are not representative of the overall synergies between parent companies and their affiliates. Consider             Caterpillar Inc.,       the American manufacturer of heavy machinery whose main facility for research and development is in Peoria, Ill. In recent years the company has established several research-and-development facilities outside the country. Yet Caterpillar\u2019s engines lab in Peoria still runs two shifts a day. Before closing up for the night, the Illinois engineers send data to their colleagues in Chennai, India, who process it overnight. When the Peoria workers come back the next morning, the refined data is waiting for them.Dow Chemical\u2019s       largest global investment is Sadara, a $20 billion joint venture with Saudi Aramco to construct a fully integrated petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia. This facility, which will be one of the world\u2019s largest, has created American jobs not only at Dow but at its supply-chain partners as well. Since 2007, Sadara has generated more than $1 billion in contracts for 18 U.S. companies that have provided engineering, design and other high-value services. In recent years approximately 700 Americans at leading engineering companies have supported Sadara\u2019s work.In 2011,             IBMbecame the first company to earn more than 6,000 U.S. patents in a year. These inventions were generated by more than 8,000 employees in 46 American states and 36 countries. IBM inventors abroad collaborated on more than 26% of that year\u2019s patents. The same is true across IBM. For example, its WebSphere business software is based near Raleigh, N.C., but relies on client-facing consultants and software labs around the world.President Trump is right that America needs millions more good-paying jobs. But he does not seem to realize they can be created by U.S.-based multinationals that know how to invest capital, operate globally and create knowledge. In 2014, U.S. multinationals undertook 45.4% of all private-sector capital investment, were responsible for 49.5% of all U.S. goods exports, and conducted a remarkable 78.9% of total U.S. private-sector research and development.The 26.6 million domestic employees of U.S.-based multinational companies earned an average compensation that was 34.2% higher than the private-sector average. These parent companies also create millions of good jobs for their suppliers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, fully 89.2% of all inputs of goods and services purchased by U.S. parents\u2014$8.8 trillion\u2014were from other U.S. companies, not imports.Limit the ability of U.S. multinational companies to flourish abroad and you limit their ability to create high-paying jobs in America. Washington should base its policies on data and research, not anecdotes and assertions.Mr. Slaughter is dean at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.

Board Director       David Bonderman       stepped aside\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0after making a sexist remark during a company all-hands meeting. There is little precedent for Uber\u2019s transition of power in the corporate world, but some management experts say the closest approximation is \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the television show depicting mythical fights for control among several clans.\u201cIf your bet is that Travis will come back, you want to show that you\u2019re his man or woman,\u201d said       Sydney Finkelstein,        a management professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and author of \u201cSuperbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent.\u201dThe history of business successes where rule is split between more than a single CEO is spotty.             Oracle Corp.       has been operating with co-CEOs since 2014 when       Larry Ellison       relinquished the top job\u2014the stock is up about 13% since then\u2014and             Samsung Electronics Co.       remains the top global seller of smartphones by market share under three CEOs.At other companies, the results have been less stellar. BlackBerry maker             Research In Motion Ltd.       battled investor discontent for years over its co-CEO structure and ultimately put in a single leader, though the business still plunged into irrelevance.Similar co-CEO\u00a0arrangements at             Citigroup Inc.,       Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. and             Workday Inc.       were quickly scuttled.Last year,             Whole Foods Market Inc.,       too, eliminated the co-CEO structure after six years.             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       Zappos unit has been experimenting with an unusual management philosophy called Holacracy, in which titles and bosses are eliminated, since 2013. But the structure sowed confusion and when the shoe seller offered severance in 2015 for those who wanted to quit, 14% took the offer.Rarer still are firms led by committee. Watch and jewelry maker             Cie. Financi\u00e8re Richemont SA       has been operating without a CEO since       Richard Lepeu       stepped down in March.Top executives report into the chairman and decisions are made by consensus. DPR Construction has senior leaders rotate through an eight-member management committee. Employees at those firms have said committees can sometimes make decisions painstaking and cause infighting.At Uber, the transition will be particularly tricky since Mr. Kalanick has structured the San Francisco company to funnel big day-to-day decisions through him, say people familiar with the matter.Mr. Kalanick, known for his relentless and punishing will to win, was also reluctant to be challenged as CEO and could lash out at what he felt was insubordination, these people say.Without a central leader, executives may jockey to be atop the heap in deference to Uber\u2019s 14 leadership principles, which include \u201calways be hustlin\u2019\u201d and \u201ctoe stepping.\u201d (Mr. Holder\u2019s recommendations included reformulating those principles.)Uber said it would divide the management committee into four units: business; people and organization; product and engineering; and legal safety and policy and communications.The 14 executives include       Rachel Holt,       Andrew MacDonald       and       Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty,        the heads of operations in the U.S. and Canada; Latin America and Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa, respectively.Also included are       Ryan Graves,        the first Uber CEO, a board member and senior vice president of operations; CTO       Thuan Pham      ; Chief Security Officer       Joe Sullivan      ; communications and policy chief       Jill Hazelbaker      ; product-management head       Daniel Graf      ; chief of self-driving vehicle development Eric Meyhofer; product leader       Jeff Holden      ; HR boss       Liane Hornsey      ; and Chief Legal Officer       Salle Yoo.The group also includes two new additions to upper management at Uber:       David Richter,        who was promoted just this week to fill Mr. Michael\u2019s role, and recent hire from Harvard Business School,       Frances Frei,        a senior vice president of leadership and strategy.Mr. Finkelstein of Dartmouth said he expects two or three managers to rise to the top of Uber\u2019s new committee of leaders, and that there may be a division in the company\u2019s top ranks between those who support Mr. Kalanick\u2019s vision for the startup, and those who prefer to steer it in new directions. \u201cThe ones that campaign to bring him back, or discretely seek his advice, may see an opportunity to take over while the CEO is in the penalty box,\u201d he said.\u201cHaving two people making joint leadership decisions is a big mistake for companies, but 14 is setting up a war for succession,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no CEO, all of these people know they\u2019re candidates for the job.\u201dWrite to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com and Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 19:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-14-bosses-one-corporate-game-of-thrones-1497468304", "news_title": "Uber: 14 Bosses, One Corporate \u2018Game of Thrones?\u2019 ", "keywords": "vc industry news,Uber Technologies,Amazon.com,AMZN,Citigroup,C,DPR Construction,Oracle,ORCL,Compagnie Financiere Richemont,CFR.EB,CH:CFR,BlackBerry,BB.T,BBRY,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Workday,WDAY,Travis Kalanick,Andrew MacDonald,Richard Lepeu,Emil Michael,Ryan Graves,Thuan Pham,Daniel Graf,Jeff Jones,Joseph Bower,Larry Ellison,David Bonderman,Eric Holder,Jeff Holden,David Richter,Eric Meyhofer,Frances Frei,Jill Hazelbaker,Joe Sullivan,Liane Hornsey,Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty,Rachel Holt,Sydney Finkelstein,Salle Yoo,management,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,workplace diversity,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "The Trump administration\u2019s plan to get the economy growing at a 3% annual rate has a skeptic: the Federal Reserve.Fed officials updated their long-run growth forecasts\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0and the numbers show officials aren\u2019t convinced the economy is near revving up. Output has expanded at an annual rate of less than 2% for the past decade, and the Fed sees that continuing.The Fed\u2019s latest forecasts show the central bank views the likely longer-run pace of growth at 1.8%, unchanged from their view in March when officials last submitted forecasts. While the rate of gross domestic product bounces around from quarter to quarter, it hasn\u2019t seen sustained annual growth above 3% in more than a decade.President Donald Trump wants to boost sustained economic growth above 3% through a combination of tax cuts and other policy changes that his economic advisers believe can boost investment, productivity growth and labor-force participation.\u201cFundamentally, we believe that we can get back to 3%\u00a0sustained economic growth,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       told the Senate Budget Committee this week.\u201cThat\u2019s not this year, and that\u2019s not next year, but we can get there. And that\u2019s going to be a combination\u2014through tax reform, regulatory relief and trade,\u201d he said.Many economists doubt the viability of the target given sluggish growth in the size of the labor force and slow gains in worker productivity\u2014the basic building blocks of economic growth.According to the Fed\u2019s median forecast, which barely budged at the Fed\u2019s June policy gathering, the economy should expand at about 2% a year through 2019 and settle at a 1.8% pace in the longer run.Economists are largely on board with the Fed; most forecasters in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s most recent monthly survey expect the economy to grow slightly above 2% for the next couple of years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in\u00a0January\u00a0predicted long-run growth would average about 2%, too.The disconnect between the central bank and the government could be explained by their views on the potential supply-side effects of proposed fiscal, regulatory and trade policy overhauls. Analysts point out that Fed officials have said in recent months they only will update their economic projections once they see concrete action on fiscal policy overhauls. Infrastructure spending; deregulation; and tax, immigration and trade policies are all up for reconsideration, but the size, composition, timing and financing of the moves remain vague.\u201cThe reality is if we get a well-designed tax package and relief on the regulation side, the result is going to be somewhere in the middle [of 2% and 3% growth],\u201d said       Stephen Stanley,        chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.Much now depends on the political agenda, and whether recent investigations into Trump associates and Russia will stall the White House\u2019s plans to rework fiscal policy.At her press conference in Washington\u00a0on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       noted that \u201cmany forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the expected policy changes, such as changes to tax policy or fiscal policy more generally,\u201d in response to a question on whether her view of the outlook has changed in recent months.Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 18:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-forecasts-at-odds-with-trump-administrations-growth-target-1497481113", "news_title": "Fed Forecasts at Odds With Trump Administration\u2019s Growth Target", "keywords": "fed,fed meeting,fed projections,fed sep,sep,trump,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,Stephen Stanley,Steven Mnuchin,monetary policy,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Oil-services company CGG Group filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday in the U.S. and France after reaching a restructuring deal with lenders and bondholders that will eliminate about $2 billion in debt from the company\u2019s books.Under the deal, bondholders will swap nearly $2 billion in debt for most of the equity in a reorganized CGG, the company said. The restructuring plan calls for up to $500 million of new money to be raised from a $125 million rights offering and the issuance of $375 million in new debt.CGG\u2019s senior lenders, owed about $800 million, will extend the maturity on their loans in return for $150 million payment from the proceeds of the new money investment. Existing shareholders, who will be able to participate in the rights offering, will see their investments reduced to a 4.5% stake in the restructured CGG following completion of the debt swap, according to filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.Beatrice Place-Faget,        general counsel of parent company CGG SA, said in court papers the prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices left the company unable to pay its debts.CGG\u2019s 2016 annual revenue was roughly one-third of what it was before the current downturn began, she said. In 2012, before oil prices dropped, the company had total operating revenues of more than $3.41 billion. By 2016, that number was $1.195 billion.In addition, the company has been losing money for years, including losses of $1.14 billion in 2015 and another $404.7 million last year.CGG was founded in 1931 as \u201c            Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de G\u00e9ophysique        CGG -1.49%      \u201d and focuses on seismic surveys and other techniques to help energy companies locate oil and natural-gas reserves.

Steve Scalise       (R., La.) and three others, which cast a pall over the Capitol all day. Stunned lawmakers, some still in their practice clothes, with arms scraped after diving for cover, moved through Congress in shock. House votes were canceled for the day and Mr. Scalise was in critical condition after surgery.The alleged gunman, whom a law-enforcement official identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66 years old, of Illinois, was shot by police and died from his wounds.\u201cWe must play this baseball game,\u201d said Rep.       Roger Williams       (R., Texas), who helps run the GOP team and was on crutches after twisting his ankle during the shooting. \u201cIf we don\u2019t play this baseball game and we go home, then they win,\u201d he said, at a news conference in which he fought back tears.\u201cThis is America, the greatest country in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you punch us, we will punch back and we\u2019re going to play baseball tomorrow.\u201dThe decision to proceed with the game, which will be held at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals baseball team, marked a show of defiance in the face of the attack. It also offered a glimpse into the ability of Republicans and Democrats to unify during a crisis, and to use the baseball game to step back from the vitriol that has characterized the nation\u2019s politics in recent years.\u201cBefore this House returns to its business, I want us to slow down and reflect, to think about how we are being tested right now,\u201d House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) said on the House floor. \u201cBecause we are. I ask each of you to join me in resolving to come together\u2026to lift each other up. and to show the country\u2014show the world\u2014that we are one House.\u201dMr. Ryan got a standing ovation when he announced in a lawmaker briefing that the game was going forward.The congressional baseball game has taken place each summer for more than 100 years. The game raises money for charity and is one of the last truly bipartisan social events on Capitol Hill. Republicans have been practicing every morning since late April. The practice sessions also provide one of the few opportunities for lawmakers to form deep friendships.It was at baseball practice that Mr. Williams, as a newer member of Congress, demonstrated his knack for developing winning players, helping Republicans snap a yearslong losing streak against the Democrats last year. It was at baseball practice that Rep. Ryan Costello (R., Pa.) emerged as one of the party\u2019s top athletes, and where Republicans talked nervously about Rep.       Cedric Richmond       (D., La.)\u2014a pitcher who is a star for the Democrats.Rep. Patrick Meehan (R., Pa.), one of the pitchers for the Republican baseball team, said that playing on the squad is \u201cone of the things that makes you feel more normal\u201d in Washington.\u201cThe camaraderie that we have in the mornings, when we are there, is such a change from the pressures that we all feel on a regular basis and sort of a return to the fun things. You know, Scalise is the whip, but out there on the field, we treat each other like we are back in high school again.\u201dMr. Richmond, who pitches for the Democrats, went to see Mr. Scalise at the hospital. The two were in the Louisiana legislature together and are friends.\u201cSaddened by the horrific news from GOP baseball practice,\u201d Mr. Richmond said on Twitter on Wednesday.In contrast to Washington\u2019s climate of scripted remarks, Wednesday offered plenty of unguarded moments. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.) said he left practice early to beat traffic into the city. By the time he got to the House gym to shower, he noticed two of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s security detail talking to the Wisconsin Republican in the gym. \u201cPaul looked concerned,\u201d said Mr. Duncan. \u201cI knew something had happened.\u201dWhen he got out of the shower, Mr. Duncan saw Mr. Ryan still looking pained. \u201cI said Mr. Speaker, is everything OK?\u201d Mr. Ryan replied, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get my head wrapped around it.\u201d Mr. Duncan wasn\u2019t clear on what Mr. Ryan was referring to. It wasn\u2019t until former Rep. Steve Southerland (R., Fla.) called him to ask about the shooting that Mr. Duncan realized what had happened.Rep. Martha McSally (R., Ariz.), who represents the district where former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot, said the shooting should be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to lessen political vitriol.\u201cWe saw this in my community in 2011,\u201d said Ms. McSally, who earlier this year received death threats. She said that she has felt \u201cin this environment, it\u2019s only a matter of time before an act of violence.\u201dIn a sign of the day\u2019s spirit, Pennsylvania Rep.

Those methods include use of Stingray devices, which collect cellphone data and can determine one\u2019s location, and the department\u2019s security camera apparatus and license plate readers.\u201cThere are New Yorkers out there that appropriately question what level of surveillance is being done in their name and their tax dollars,\u201d said Mr. Garodnick, a Democrat. \u201cAnd they deserve to know\u2026that you have policies, you\u2019re following policies.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time the NYPD\u2019s surveillance practices were questioned.The NYPD has been the subject of lawsuits in recent years accusing the force of unfairly monitoring Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. And last year, the New York Civil Liberties Union criticized the police department\u2019s use of Stingrays.Police officials\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0said they have taken measures to be transparent and already have enough oversight. The NYPD in March enlisted a former federal judge to monitor its surveillance practices as a result of the settlement of the civil-rights lawsuits.The deputy commissioner of legal matters,       Lawrence Byrne,        said the police are required to get a court order to use surveillance technology unless time is especially sensitive, such as in a kidnapping or the hunt for a missing child.But council member       Rory Lancman       said in a back-and-forth with the police officials that, even if the technology is permitted, New Yorkers may still be uncomfortable with the practices.Mr. Miller said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it may be the limits of my own intelligence but I\u2019m failing to wrap my head around the question about what the public knows or understands about something we talk about often.\u201d\u201cI would never challenge your intelligence,\u201d Mr. Lancman said. \u201cSo perhaps you\u2019re being strategically obtuse.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d Mr. Byrne rebutted, adding Mr. Lancman was misunderstanding the privacy rights of residents.The discussion on Wednesday highlighted the different ideologies, and at times the level of mistrust, between the mostly liberal city council and the police department.In recent years, the lawmakers have introduced a series of bills to curb police powers, like one that would have toughened guidelines for police stops, and another that would have required officers to identify themselves to those they stop.\u201cAll New Yorkers\u2026have a right to know that whatever their police department is doing, whether it involves technology or not, is being done lawfully and pursuant to policy and respectfully,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cWhere the line stops is, I don\u2019t think they have the right to know how particular surveillance technology can be used with our operational capabilities.\u201d\u2014Mara Gay contributed to this article.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 18:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nypd-city-council-clash-over-surveillance-bill-1497479787", "news_title": "NYPD, City Council Clash Over Surveillance Bill ", "keywords": " cellphon surveillance ,police surveillance, stingray device,New York Police Department,Public Safety Committee,Dan Garodnick,John Miller,Lawrence Byrne,Rory Lancman,Vanessa Gibson,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "A buyout group backed by a Chinese company has been declared the winner at a bankruptcy auction for the Mountain Pass rare earths mine, the sole U.S. source of elements essential to electronics devices.With a winning bid of $20.5 million, investment firms JHL Capital Group and QVT Financial were selected to take control of Mountain Pass, along with China\u2019s Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Shareholding Co., according to sources present at the competition Wednesday.JHL Capital, a Chicago investment firm, couldn\u2019t immediately be reached to discuss the plan for Mountain Pass, an open pit mine in California.Rival bidder       Tom Clarke,        a Virginia entrepreneur, said he intends to challenge the auction outcome when the sale is presented for court approval later this month, drumming on the national security implications of the deal.China controls most of the global supply of rare earths, elements used in small amounts in electronics, from cells phones to weapons systems. In the event of a tightening in Chinese trade policy, the Mountain Pass mine in California would be an important national resource.Mr. Clarke bid up to $20 million for Mountain Pass, before dropping out. He said he would make a case in bankruptcy court that the JHL, QVT and Shenghe deal for the mine will founder, because of national security sensitivities.Shenghe has been described as a technical partner for JHL and QVT, a company with the expertise to mine rare earths. A translation of a press release Shenghe issued in May, which was filed in bankruptcy court, says the Chinese company is a co-investor with JHL and QVT, putting $50 million into the venture. Shenghe will provide technical and sales services, in exchange for a share of profits, distribution rights and a period of exclusive sales rights for product mined at Mountain Pass, according to the press release.Idled and in bankruptcy because of low prices for rare earths, the Mountain Pass mine became a hot property after the election of President       Donald Trump       spurred speculation about a possible trade war with China. Even in the pre-election political climate, courtroom discussions about selling Mountain Pass recognized the need to appease the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a collection of federal agencies topped by the Department of the Treasury.The committee reviews any deal with national security implications, and has the power to order them unwound or changed. A source with the winning bidding group said CFIUS has been aware of details of the deal for some time.Mr. Clarke also has lined up international allies as part of his strategy for reviving the mine, but was bidding for his own domestic company on Wednesday, he said. If market conditions call for operations to restart at Mountain Pass, Mr. Clarke has agreed to work with Pala Investments, a Swiss fund backed by Russian-born billionaire       Vladimir Iorich,        as well as with Australian mining company Peak Resources. Pala officials say Mr. Iorich doesn\u2019t manage the fund and professionals make the decisions on which mines are worth an investment.The Mountain Pass mine, an open pit in a remote area of California, was owned by Molycorp Inc., a rare-earths company that boomed when Chinese trade policy crimped the world supply but failed when policies changed and prices fell. JHL was a Molycorp backer and emerged from Molycorp\u2019s bankruptcy in charge of a company that controls the mineral rights at the Mountain Pass mine.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 18:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jhl-qvt-shenghe-win-mountain-pass-mine-auction-1497479594", "news_title": "JHL, QVT, Shenghe Win Mountain Pass Mine Auction   ", "keywords": "auction,bankruptcynews,bankruptcy sale,bidders,bidding,california,mountain pass,open pit mine,rare earth mine,sale,winning bid,QVT Financial,JHL Capital Group,Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Shareholding,bankruptcy,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,divestments,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,basic materials,resources,financial services,investing,securities,mining,quarrying,rare earth metals"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014An Iranian Navy vessel confronted three U.S. ships and pointed a laser at a Marine Corps helicopter over the Strait of Hormuz Wednesday, U.S. military officials said, another in a series of incidents the military considers dangerous and unprofessional.An Iranian Navy vessel encountered the three American ships traveling through international waters in the Strait of Hormuz on Wednesday, U.S. military officials said. The Iranian boat shined a spotlight on two of the ships, the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship, and the guided-missile destroyer the USS Cole, said Cmdr.       Bill Urban,        a spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, in a statement.The dry cargo ship the USNS Washington Chambers also was part of the formation of American ships. The Iranian vessel came to within about 800 yards of the small flotilla, Cmdr. Urban said.More worrisome, he said, was the use of a laser that members of the crew of the Iranian vessel pointed at a Marine Corps helicopter accompanying the ship formation in the area.\u201cNaval Forces Central Command assesses this interaction as unsafe and unprofessional due to the Iranian vessel shining a laser on one of the formation\u2019s helicopters,\u201d Cmdr.

While other sectors attack the effort with television ads and strongly worded letters, the insurers\u2019 low-key approach has allowed them to remain involved in internal GOP discussions, the trade group says.That could pay off, especially now that the Senate is working on its own version of the health bill.\u201cIn this case, the members of Congress have not really wanted to play publicly\u2014they\u2019ve wanted to talk through it privately,\u201d said       Marilyn Tavenner,        president of AHIP. \u201cIt\u2019s a different approach. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t share what we like and what we don\u2019t like. We just don\u2019t do it publicly.\u201dBut some insurers, especially those strongly opposed to the Republican plan, question the wisdom of staying mum.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen as clear a message that this is a bad idea from the trade associations as we would like,\u201d said       John Baackes,        chief executive of L.A. Care, a California-based insurer and an AHIP board member. \u201cI see [the Republican effort] as a threat to access for our members and a threat for providing adequate compensation for our providers.\u201dOther insurance chiefs say privately that they are worried the legislation will cause them to lose customers.Some health insurers, including L.A. Care, who are primarily invested in the Medicaid market, fear the cuts Congress is considering. The House bill would reduce Medicaid funding by $834 billion over a decade and cover 14 million fewer Americans who use Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Other insurers, with a larger stake in the individual market\u2014selling to people who get insurance on their own, not through the government or an employer\u2014hope some of the measures under consideration would benefit them.Senators are considering a $15 billion market stabilization fund over two years beginning in 2018 that would flow directly to insurers, for example, as well as several provisions loosening the rules on the types of plans insurance firms can sell.Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem Inc., a major player in both Medicaid and the individual market, said he would have voted for the House bill, to send the legislation to the Senate so lawmakers could \u201cwork together to create the final and best outcome possible.\u201d Mr. Swedish is also the chairman of AHIP\u2019s board.Ms. Tavenner said her group has conveyed both points of view: telling lawmakers it is \u201cappreciative of the improvements\u201d to the individual market, while voicing concern over the extent of the Medicaid cuts.This position contrasts with the more vocal approach the industry has taken in the past. Health insurers helped doom President       Bill Clinton\u2019s       health overhaul with their attention-grabbing \u201cHarry and Louise\u201d ads, depicting an ordinary couple despairing at the bureaucracy the proposal would ostensibly create.Insurers\u2019 vigorous public lobbying also helped shape the ACA under President       Barack Obama.       AHIP helped kill the idea of a publicly financed insurance option under the law, while backing the requirement that most Americans get insurance or pay a penalty.It hasn\u2019t been lost on lawmakers that this time is different. \u201cThe health insurers have been missing in this profoundly significant debate, and their voice is profoundly important but absent,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), whose state is home to several insurers.AHIP says its low-key approach is working. Insurance lobbyists are among the few outsiders regularly involved in Capitol Hill meetings, congressional aides say. The White House invited industry leaders to a meeting in late February, a courtesy not extended to hospital groups and other industries that are openly opposing the GOP effort.In April, the Trump administration released a rule aimed at curbing some of the losses insurers have faced in ACA marketplaces. The administration also has continued to make monthly payments to insurers to help offset subsidies to lower-income customers.AHIP so far hasn\u2019t been successful in persuading the Trump administration to make a firm commitment to continue those payments and hasn\u2019t persuaded lawmakers to pass legislation that allocates funding. The subsidies are among its top priorities.Staying out of the limelight has also helped the industry dodge a new concern: landing on the wrong end of a presidential tweet. And Ms. Tavenner said the legislation\u2019s final form will justify her group\u2019s tactics.\u201cWhat matters is the progress, not the amount of publicity you have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt it was important to stay at the table with the House, and we think that\u2019s going to be critical over the next few weeks.\u201d\u2014Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 18:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-take-low-key-approach-in-health-law-debate-1497479071", "news_title": "Insurers Take Low-Key Approach in Health-Law Debate", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,health care overhaul,America's Health Insurance Plans,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "In \u201cThe Diminishing Returns of a College Degree\u201d (op-ed, June 5),       Richard Vedder       and Justin Strehle are right about the declining value of the college degree, but they might have further stressed that the nature of college education changed as it went from something that a fairly small percentage of the population pursued into a mass phenomenon that was widely taken as an entitlement.Before the federal government began aggressively pushing higher education with grants and easy loans, the students who went to college were largely those who truly wanted to improve their knowledge and skills\u2014their human capital. With the generally rigorous standards of the time, mostly they did. But as an increasing number of high-school graduates flooded into college, many of them with marginal academic ability and little interest in advanced study, most schools adjusted to their new \u201ccustomer\u201d base by letting their standards fall.Huge numbers of college graduates now glut the labor market. Whereas a college degree used to indicate serious effort and learning, many degrees today show nothing more than the mild persistence it takes to accumulate enough credits to graduate. Inevitably, many of those degree holders have to settle for the kinds of jobs high-school grads or even dropouts can do. In short, we have oversold college.George LeefJames G. Martin Center forAcademic RenewalRaleigh, N.C.Most people think of colleges strictly as institutions of higher learning, when in fact they\u2019re businesses selling a product like every other business. That product is a \u201csuccessful future.\u201d Parents have been conned into spending thousands of dollars on college education just so they can tell family and friends that their children went to college, when in many cases the kids have no clue what they want to do. Government-sponsored student loans have enabled this scam, allowing college tuition costs to far outpace inflation. Many colleges have become nothing more than left-wing indoctrination centers. Worst of all, many boomers have forfeited their retirements to fund this. When kids graduate with a four-year college degree and are working at McDonald\u2019s, maybe it\u2019s time to do a value analysis of what that degree is really worth.Chuck McGeeMoultonborough, N.H.The general competence of today\u2019s holder of a college degree has the employment capabilities that a high-school graduate had back when I got a diploma about 70 years ago.

He is majoring in business management\u2014and the apprenticeship is in a landmark skyscraper that houses             Aon                   PLC, one of the largest professional-services companies in the world.In addition to free tuition and training, the Chicago resident earns $38,500 a year. He is among a small but growing number of young people apprenticing in fields that require a suit and tie instead of coveralls and gloves.President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Thursday that would add additional funding for apprenticeships and make the federal system less onerous for participating businesses, in part by shifting the responsibility to certify apprentice programs to industry groups from the Labor Department, according to several people familiar with the White House\u2019s plan.The aim is to expand apprenticeship programs into nontraditional industries in an effort to fill a record level of open jobs and draw back millions of Americans who have left the workforce.To help fund the apprenticeship program, the White House aims to use the money from fees paid by companies to bring in foreign workers. The additional funding would more than double the amount spent on apprenticeships to about $200 million, the people familiar with the plan said. The plan echoes       Mr. Trump\u2019s       \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign. But despite the rhetorical appeal of tying the two programs together, it is unclear how significant the reallocation would be given that some of that money is already directed to job-training programs and given that the visa program\u2019s fees are set in law.Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and assistant, and several cabinet secretaries met with executives from             Amazon.com Inc.,CVS Health Corp.      ,             Northrop Grumman Corp.       and more than a dozen other business leaders Wednesday to discuss workforce programs.\u201cOne of the things we need to do in government is take the initiatives already occurring in so many of your businesses and really expand that,\u201d Ms. Trump said at the start of the meeting.The government has promoted apprenticeships since the Franklin Roosevelt administration. The Obama administration spent $90 million last year intended to expand apprenticeships to nontraditional fields, including restaurants and hotels.The move toward white-collar apprenticeships comes as the number of U.S. job openings hit a record 6.04 million in April and the cost of a college degree has scared off many potential students.That tightening of the labor market has prompted corporations to increase the amount of money they spend on training. That, in part, is fueling the expansion in apprenticeships, particularly for middle skills jobs which don\u2019t require a college degree.Traditionally, apprenticeships in the U.S. have been rooted in the skilled trades.\u00a0More than\u00a0two-thirds of federally registered apprentice programs are in construction and manufacturing, according to the Labor Department. And many of those are associated with unions, which provide the training to future members. Only 13 of more than 8,000 federal programs are in the finance and insurance field.The administration sees the model working in fields as diverse as retail, paralegal work and policing.Unlike most internships, apprenticeships involve training toward a specific job and a promise to get one at the end.In Germany, roughly half of high-school graduates opt for apprenticeships rather than college degrees. One draw: almost certain employment.\u00a0In the U.S., 87% of apprentices are employed after completing their training, according to the Labor Department.In the U.S., however, many high-school students and their parents are reluctant to embrace a career as plumber or welder over a college degree.Wells Fargo                   & Co. is rolling out an apprenticeship program this summer, starting with 50 openings for military veterans. Participants\u2019 GI Bill benefits help cover the cost of the training and stipend, said Lance LaVergne, a senior vice president of talent acquisition who is helping to launch the program.\u201cWe kind of have our own internal university here,\u201d Mr. LaVergne said.The average starting salary of apprentices is about $60,000 a year, considerably more than most college graduates, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said. Mr. LaVergne said a majority of the apprentices at Wells Fargo would earn that much depending on the job they trained for. Among those on offer: branch manager, collections manager and financial crimes specialist.At Aon, which funds the Labor Department certified program itself, Mr. Gutierrez counts himself lucky to be in the first class of apprentices. The program was championed by Bridget Gainer, vice president of global public affairs for Aon, who was tasked with helping to expand the company\u2019s apprentice program in the United Kingdom.That program, which has been around for a decade, has about 100 apprentices at a time. Those who go through the program are more engaged in their work and stay longer at their jobs, she said.\u201cI thought, \u2018Why not here?\u2019\u201d she said.A Commerce Department report found apprenticeships cost companies between $25,000 and $250,000 a year but the return on the investment is strong for employers because graduates of apprenticeship programs have less turnover.In Chicago, the Aon apprentices will take jobs that traditionally have been filled by employees with a four-year degree, who are often eager to move on to new positions within the company, says Aon. In addition to a salary, the company offers apprentices benefits, support services and tuition\u2014which runs about $7,000 a year at Harold Washington Community College, the nearby school from which the students are all drawn. Total cost per apprentice is around $50,000.\u201cSo far they\u2019re killing it,\u201d Ms. Gainer said, praising the students for their dedication to the two-year program.Mr. Gutierrez, who works in downtown Chicago, said he doesn\u2019t know anyone who has ever worked in any of the skyscrapers that define the city\u2019s skyline.\u201cI had no clue what went on in any of these,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are lot friendlier than I imagined.\u201d\u2014Laura Meckler contributed to this article.Write to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com and Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 18:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apprenticeships-arent-just-for-welders-anymore-1497437397", "news_title": "Apprenticeships Aren\u2019t Just for Welders Anymore", "keywords": "america first,apprenticeship ,president trump,u.s. politics,white house,Aon,AON,Mr. Trump,political,general news,education,university,college,computer services,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Virginia\u2019s primary for governor on Tuesday highlighted a large enthusiasm gap between the two political parties, one that Democrats are banking on providing momentum into next year\u2019s congressional midterms.With both of their candidates running campaigns focused partly on their opposition to President       Donald Trump,        Democrats drew about 176,000 more votes than Republicans. Both Democratic candidates received more votes than the winner of the Republican primary.The results also suggest that, after nearly five months in office and seven months since his election, the president has yet to heal a divide within his own party.Republican       Ed Gillespie,        a well-financed former national party chairman, kept an arm\u2019s-length distance from Mr. Trump. His opponent,       Corey Stewart,        the president\u2019s former state campaign chairman, embraced the president. Mr. Gillespie won the nomination by just 1.2%.The Virginia results mirror the Democratic turnout surge in recent elections across the country. In New Jersey, more than twice as many Democrats as Republicans voted in the state\u2019s gubernatorial primary in June\u2014GOP turnout there was down 28% from the state\u2019s last competitive Republican primary in 2009.And in the two special elections for Congress held in Kansas and Montana Democratic candidates have each run far closer to their Republican counterparts than in recent elections, although their failure to win either is a bright spot for Republicans.A major test for both parties will come next week with a special election in suburban Atlanta to fill a House seat held by Republicans for 38 years. It became open when Rep.       Tom Price       was elevated to Health and Human Services secretary. The Democrat,       Jon Ossoff,        is ahead in local polls.Mr. Gillespie\u2019s campaign argued that GOP turnout in the state lagged behind because the Democrats       Ralph Northam,        the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, and former Rep.       Tom Perriello       saturated the television airwaves with advertising while the Republican contenders didn\u2019t. Mr. Northam defeated Mr. Perriello 56% to 44%.\u201cHad we dumped $2 million to $2.5 million into ads, I guarantee you we would have seen a spike in turnout,\u201d said       Pete Snyder,        Mr. Gillespie\u2019s campaign chairman. \u201cDemocrats spent north of $5 million alerting their hard core voters that there was a primary and to get out and vote. We made a strategic calculation to husband our resources.\u201dYet the Virginia GOP contest revealed the party\u2019s fissures that could continue to hobble candidates.Mr. Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, campaigned on a Trump-like platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, and defending the state\u2019s Confederate monuments. He hasn\u2019t placed the customary phone call to Mr. Gillespie to concede the race.\u201cThere is one word you will never hear from me, and that\u2019s unity,\u201d Mr. Stewart said in his remarks to supporters Tuesday night. \u201cLook, folks, we have been backing down too long. We\u2019ve been backing down too long in defense of our culture, in defense of our heritage and our country.\u201dMr. Stewart acknowledged in an interview Wednesday he had lost but said his supporters would only back Mr. Gillespie if he adopts Mr. Stewart\u2019s causes.\u201cIf he wants to earn their support, he has to fight just like I did to support the president, fight illegal immigration and support Virginia\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Mr. Gillespie, who highlights his tenure working in the       George W. Bush       White House, will spend the coming weeks trying to unite the disparate factions of the GOP. Vice President       Mike Pence       has plans to campaign with him and Mr. Gillespie has said he would welcome help from Mr. Trump.The GOP\u2019s intraparty divide was evident also along educational lines in the Gillespie-Stewart results. Mr. Gillespie won 18 of the 20 cities and counties with highest percentage of college graduates in Virginia. Mr. Stewart carried 14 of 20 cities and counties with the lowest percentage of college graduates.Even in educated areas Mr. Gillespie showed lackluster results\u00a0Tuesday. In Loudoun County, a Washington, D.C., suburb where people who work in government-related fields live and that serves as a battleground in the state\u2019s general elections, Mr. Gillespie received 45,483 votes in the 2014 general election for U.S. Senate, 456 more than Democratic Sen.       Mark Warner.       Mr. Warner ultimately won re-election.On Tuesday, Loudoun County gave Mr. Gillespie just 5,565 votes\u2014and only 12,393 Republicans voted there overall.\u201cThe party has migrated from the country club to the country,\u2019\u2019 said former Rep.       Tom Davis,        who served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee while he represented suburban Northern Virginia in the House. \u201cThis is a rural white party now.\u201dTuesday\u2019s\u00a0result, Mr. Davis said, illustrates the political risks to Republicans who, like Mr. Gillespie, try to keep their distance from Mr. Trump.\u201cIt reminds you where the base is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a warning shot for some Republicans. It is a warning shot that Trump is still the heart and soul of the Republican base.\u201dLuke Albee,        a former chief of staff to Mr. Warner, said the outcome of the GOP primary sent a message to moderate Republicans: \u201cThere is now real peril for walking away from Trump or sugar coating Trump.\u201dFor Democrats, opposition to the president is a rallying cry.Mr. Perriello offered a full-throated endorsement of Mr. Northam in his concession speech\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night and was scheduled to appear at a\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning unity rally. The rally was canceled in the wake of the shooting at the House Republicans\u2019 baseball team practice Wednesday\u00a0in Alexandria, Va.Mr. Northam, who initially tried to run a traditional campaign, switched gears and wound up labeling Mr. Trump a \u201cnarcissistic maniac\u201d\u00a0in his television advertisements.\u201cThose were the two words that changed the election,\u201d Mr. Albee said. \u201cThat\u2019s all anyone remembers about the primary.\u201d\u2014Dante Chinni contributed to this article.Write to Reid J.

Here are some reactions from economists:Although we continue to expect another hike this September with balance sheet runoff being announced in December, there are risks to that call. First, the statement acknowledged the weak inflation, but the Committee seems to be looking through it. Ongoing soft inflation could delay another step to normalization. Second, the lean in the paragraph about the balance sheet increases somewhat the likelihood that the Committee runs off its balance sheet in September, rather than December, but for now, we are retaining our call of a December runoff.  --      Seth Carpenter,       Samuel Coffin       and       Robert Sockin,        UBSFitch believes the Fed is increasingly comfortable with its normalization process\u00a0and less data-dependent following recent inflation readings that have been slightly lower than consensus expectations (although they remain close to target). The interest rate hike showed the Fed was prepared to look through weak first quarter consumption and GDP and underlines Fed concerns about unemployment falling too far below its equilibrium rate.\u00a0  --      Brian Coulton,       Mark Brown,        Fitch RatingsThe unemployment rate has dropped by half a point in the past four months,\u00a0but the Fed now expects, comically, no further decline across the rest of the year.

It also would require President       Donald Trump       to seek congressional permission to relax the current regime of sanctions against Russia, possibly limiting his leeway to improve relations between Washington and Moscow.The 97-2 vote by the GOP-led Senate came as a rebuke to a Republican president\u2019s policy on Russia, limiting his power to act on sanctions without congressional approval. Mr. Trump repeatedly has said he would like to pursue better relations with Russia after years of frosty relations and geopolitical rivalry over issues in the Middle East, Europe and beyond.The White House hasn\u2019t said whether Mr. Trump would sign a bill that contains new Russia sanctions and limits his power to act.

Those years of bond buying took the Fed\u2019s portfolio of securities and other holdings from around $800 billion in 2007 to its current level of $4.5 trillion.The theory was that purchases would lower borrowing costs and increase risk taking\u2014encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow, spend and invest more than they otherwise would in an era of post-financial-crisis risk aversion. The Fed got steady but disappointingly slow growth, together with gradual declines in unemployment.QE wasn\u2019t entirely a Fed innovation. The Bank of Japan tried it in the 2000s to revive its moribund economy. But Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke saw a flaw in the approach of the BOJ, which focused its purchases on short-term securities.Mr. Bernanke thought long-term securities purchases would pack more punch in markets and for the economy. He sought to dump the name QE. His term, \u201cLong-term Securities Asset Purchases,\u201d never caught on, but before long, other major central banks, including the Bank of England, European Central Bank and the BOJ itself were all trying variations of it.The Fed turned to long-term bond buying because it had little choice. Officials slashed their short-term, interest-rate target to near zero levels in the final days of 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis and worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Long-term asset buying became the most visible aspect of policy stimulus, especially because Congress and the Obama administration couldn\u2019t agree on fiscal measures. Fed critics warned, erroneously, that Fed efforts to \u201cprint money\u201d would fuel an epic surge of inflation. Instead inflation ran below the Fed\u2019s 2% goal for years.Bond buying came in several major episodes, as Fed officials dealt with enduring economic weakness and learned from experience.The first chapter started in November 2008 with what turned out to be a relative modest effort to buy $600 billion mortgage-related debt in a targeted effort to help restart the battered housing market. In March 2009, the Fed said it would expand that program to $1.25 trillion in mortgage-bond purchases, $300 billion in Treasury-bond acquisitions, and purchases of the corporate debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In November 2010, the central bank said it would add another $600 billion in long-dated Treasury bonds on top of existing purchases.The autumn of 2011 brought a fresh wrinkle to the Fed\u2019s efforts with the announcement of the so-called Operation Twist. Then, policy makers committed to buying even more long-term Treasurys while it sold off short-dated government bonds, in a bid to further lower long-term borrowing costs relative to briefer borrowing terms.September 2012 brought perhaps the most aggressive phase, as the Fed announced open-ended longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage purchases. The purchases came to a gradual end in 2014.Since then, the Fed has continued with bond buying, but only in enough size to replace maturing holdings and keep the portfolio size steady. With no plans to sell securities, the Fed will be progressively reducing the rate of that buying starting this year, which will allow holdings to passively shrink as its holdings mature and don\u2019t get replaced.Officials are unsure how large the portfolio will be in the end, other than to say it will be larger than where it was in 2007.The Fed may not have seen the last of long-term bond buying either. With short-term interest rates not expected to rise much from current levels, a number of officials have said they are likely to resort to expanding the central bank\u2019s balance sheet when the next downturn inevitably arrives.\"We have learned that it works, it\u2019s a valuable part of a tool kit,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said on Wednesday.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-requiem-for-bond-buying-a-look-back-at-how-the-fed-supersized-its-balance-sheet-1497475589", "news_title": "A Requiem for Bond Buying: A Look Back at How the Fed Supersized Its Balance Sheet", "keywords": " balance sheet, bond buying, central bank,federal reserve, financial crisis, qe, quantative easing,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "A bipartisan group of state attorneys general is jointly investigating the marketing of prescription painkillers and the causes of widespread opioid addiction, according to people familiar with the matter, in another sign of growing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry.The probe, which includes a majority of U.S. states, is expected to be publicly announced in the coming days, the people said. The investigation is focused on manufacturers of prescription painkillers, one of the people said, and, like other opioid investigations launched in recent years, will focus on the allegedly deceptive marketing of the drugs. The full range of targets of the investigation isn\u2019t yet clear and could change.Widespread addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, is causing nationwide alarm and driving U.S. overdose death rates to all-time highs.\u00a0The public-health crisis has become a major political issue in most states, with voters calling for greater government action to combat the problem.Public-health officials have long blamed aggressive painkiller marketing and lax prescribing for sparking the crisis, which began in the late 1990s. Many people who became addicted by taking powerful opioid painkillers progressed to heroin and other illicit opioid drugs.The multistate investigation adds to the public focus on the issue. Late last month, Ohio filed a lawsuit in state court against five pharmaceutical companies, alleging they fueled widespread addiction by misrepresenting the addictive risks of their painkillers. The lawsuit closely mirrored one filed by Mississippi in December 2015.Both suits target parent companies and various subsidiaries, including Purdue Pharma L.P.;             Johnson & Johnson                  ;             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.      ;             Allergan                   PLC; and             Endo International                   PLC\u2019s Endo Health Solutions unit. Johnson & Johnson denied the allegations, saying it \u201cacted appropriately, responsibly and in the best interests of patients.\u201d Purdue said: \u201cWhile we vigorously deny the allegations\u2026we share public officials\u2019 concerns about the opioid crisis and we are committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.\u201dAllergan said the company \u201chas a history of supporting\u2014and continues to support\u2014the safe, responsible use of prescription medications. This includes opioid medications, which when sold, prescribed and used responsibly, play an appropriate role in pain relief for millions of Americans.\u201dTeva said it is \u201ccommitted to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids.\u201d Endo declined to comment.The multistate effort is months in the making, according to people familiar with the matter, and subpoenas have already been issued against some targets. The probe is in the investigatory stage and could lead to litigation, though such investigations can be protracted and don\u2019t necessarily lead to lawsuits in every instance.The full range of states involved may not be fully evident in the initial announcement, as some states are constrained by law from discussing ongoing investigations. The District of Columbia is helping lead the group.Some individual states have already publicly pressed ahead with their own investigations into opioid marketing. New Hampshire, for instance, issued subpoenas in August 2015 against Actavis Pharma Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Purdue Pharma, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. seeking information on the scope of their marketing of opioids.The companies have resisted turning over any documents and have challenged New Hampshire\u2019s ability to hire an outside law firm under a contingency-fee agreement. That issue is now before New Hampshire\u2019s highest court, and a decision is expected at any time. In a statement, Purdue said it objects to the \u201cdelegation of law-enforcement authority to a private law firm with a financial interest in the outcome.\u201dJames Boffetti, the chief of the consumer protection and antitrust bureau in New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald\u2019s office, said the state\u2019s investigation continues despite the holdup and has narrowed to Purdue.Alaska last month began an official search for a law firm to represent it \u201cin the investigation and potential litigation of claims relating to the manufacture, distribution, advertisement and marketing of opioid pain killers,\u201d according to a copy of the state\u2019s solicitation document, provided by the state.Individual cities and counties, including in California and New York, have filed their own lawsuits over the marketing of prescription painkillers. Teva agreed in May to pay $1.6 million to settle misleading marketing claims brought by California\u2019s Orange and Santa Clara counties, the counties said in a statement. Teva said it denied any wrongdoing and agreed to the settlement to show commitment \u201cto addressing the important public health issues relating to opioids.\u201dState attorneys general often team up on investigations as a way of both increasing the impact and helping smaller jurisdictions pool limited resources. Such probes often lead to settlements, like a $1.375 billion deal with Standard & Poor\u2019s in 2015 resolving claims the firm inflated residential mortgage bond ratings and a $25 billion deal reached in 2012 with the nation\u2019s five largest mortgage servicers. Both deals involved large groups of states and the federal government.Multistate probes can bring some efficiencies for the targets of the investigation, said       Lori Kalani,        the co-chair of law firm Cozen O\u2019Connor\u2019s state attorneys general practice, who isn\u2019t involved in the opioid case. Instead of fielding requests for information from multiple fronts, it \u201cmay be beneficial to have one discrete investigation of one issue that could wrap up rather quickly,\u201d Ms. Kalani said.Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com and Jeanne Whalen at jeanne.whalen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Attorneys General Launch Probe of Opioid Marketing.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-launch-bipartisan-probe-of-opioid-marketing-and-addiction-1497474841", "news_title": "States Launch Bipartisan Probe of Opioid Marketing and Addiction ", "keywords": " addiction, investigation,opioid, painkillers,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,drug,substance usage,political,general news,society,community,health,medication abuse,misuse,social issues,pharmaceuticals,analgesics,health care,life sciences,specialized drugs,medications"}, {"content": "New YorkAlexei Ratmansky\u2019s       two-act \u201dWhipped Cream\u201d\u2014part of American Ballet Theatre\u2019s current season at Lincoln Center, following its premiere in March in Costa Mesa, Calif.\u2014has roots in \u201cSchlagobers\u201d (meaning \u201cwhipped cream\u201d), a no longer seen ballet by       Heinrich Kr\u00f6ller,        named for its now little-known score by       Richard Strauss,        that had its debut in Vienna in 1924.ABT\u2019s eye-filling and visually enchanting effort runs under 100 minutes with intermission. The lavish production has candy-colored settings and marvelously confected costumes by pop-surrealist artist       Mark Ryden.       Mr. Ratmansky, ABT artist in residence, reworked the original narrative, tweaking it somewhat from Strauss\u2019s to tell the story of a Viennese boy who, on the day celebrating his first communion, overeats whipped cream and finds himself ill and fantastically delirious. He ends up in a hospital from which he dreamily escapes into the realm of a Praline Princess, where he finds himself recovered and celebrated.Act one follows the communicants\u2014with adult dancers, albeit mostly short ones, playing these children with intermittent credibility\u2014as they visit a deluxe sweet shop and gorge themselves. From the start, Mr. Ryden\u2019s designs aim to distinguish the action\u2019s children from its adults by having the latter performed by dancers costumed with outsize heads, like delicately painted bobblehead dolls.After the young characters depart, with a central one, The Boy, carried off on stretcher, the stage is set for the shop\u2019s delicacies to come to life and animate the scene with often playful and fanciful dancing. In turn, we meet Princess Tea Flower, Prince Coffee, Prince Cocoa and Don Zucchero, as well as subsidiary characters of Marzipan, Sugarplum and Gingerbread.Besides inventing classically felicitous moves (a recurring partnered configuration has the woman repeatedly spun, with her extended leg and arm evoking a stick candy\u2019s stripe), Mr. Ratmansky works to humanize these inanimate essences. So far, in the array of casts put on by ABT, only a few of the dancers in this scene provided much beyond clear dancing. The Prince Coffee of       Cory Stearns       proved the most individually flavored, as his palpable infatuation with the lithe and delicate       Hee Seo       as Princess Tea Flower notably infused his dancing and partnering to tell of an abiding flirtation.The first act wraps up memorably as 16 women enter Mr. Ryden\u2019s scenic surround to evoke swirls of whipped cream spilling from a confectioner\u2019s bowl. Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s kaleidoscopically configured waltz presents these dancers as sprites embodying the ballet\u2019s air-filled title. In Mr. Ryden\u2019s inspired, sleek and simple white costumes, fitted with ponchos of gauzy fabric that float about them like dry-ice vapor, the corps de ballet chains and curls and amasses itself in responsive rapport with Strauss\u2019s stirring, sometimes staccato music.At this point, however, it seems a missed bet that The Boy who disappeared early on isn\u2019t part of the fantastic scene to remind us of his plight. When, at the start of act two, he does reappear, in his hospital bed, we have to reacquaint ourselves with the ballet\u2019s storyline.Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s use of a dozen women as dancing nurses brandishing hypodermic needles the size of bazookas gives the sickroom scene a wittily nightmarish touch. Eventually, scenes of a more dream-like and felicitous dimension transpire. A procession of droll characters attend the appearance of the narrative\u2019s main ballerina, Princess Praline, including a four-legged Snow Yak and a no-legged Worm Candy Man, all of which shows Mr. Ryden at his most inventive as Mr. Ratmansky gives this simple parade the impact of a coup de theatre.Once a trio of liquors, enacted by dancing bottles of spirits in a near-slapstick interlude, has put the stern doctor and his sidekick nurses into inebriated stupors, The Boy finds himself clad in gold and happily recovered as the center of attention amid a glowing old-world city square. Mr. Ratmansky has generalized Strauss\u2019s original scenario here by doing away with any number of 1920s details, such as the leaflet distributing and rabble-rousing activities that Vienna\u2019s citizens would have recognized during the hardly easy-living times following World War I.The finale and closing waltz of today\u2019s \u201cWhipped Cream\u201d become an ebullient showcase for The Boy as he joins in the general merriment amid wave upon wave of dancing by all the fantasy characters who have returned for the occasion. At select moments the teeming mass of characters stands back and clears the way for The Boy to circuit the stage with acrobatic jumps intermixed with dizzying turns.For the season\u2019s penultimate week, ABT has programmed an eight-performance run of \u201cWhipped Cream.\u201d It\u2019s a sweet prospect that could be sweeter still if the featured dancers take the opportunity to personalize their parts in this pretty confection.\u2014Mr. Greskovic writes about dance for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 17:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whipped-cream-review-a-gluttons-fantasia-1497474619", "news_title": "\u2018Whipped Cream\u2019 Review: A Glutton\u2019s Fantasia", "keywords": "arts in review, dance, heinrich kroller, mark ryden, richard strauss,whipped cream. american ballet,political,general news,dance,ballet,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "BELLEVILLE, Ill.\u2014The man killed by police after shooting a top House Republican at a congressional baseball practice\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0morning was a 66-year-old home inspector from downstate Illinois who belonged to several anti-Republican groups and last year volunteered for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville walked onto a ballfield in Alexandria, Va., with a rifle and shot at Republicans and staffers during their practice, according to police. Several people were transported to local hospitals, including Rep.\u00a0Steve Scalise, 51, the House\u2019s third-ranking member.On a             Facebook                   page that appeared to belong to Mr. Hodgkinson, he wrote on\u00a0March 22\u00a0that \u201cTrump is a Traitor. Trump has destroyed our democracy. It\u2019s time to destroy Trump & Co.\u201dOn the same day, he signed a petition calling for the \u201clegal removal\u201d of the president and vice president.Mr. Sanders released a statement\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning condemning the shooting.\u201cI have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Sanders said campaign records showed that Mr. Hodgkinson had rsvp\u2019d to volunteer at a few campaign events but they had no record of him actually working at those events and were unaware of any staffers who knew him.Bill Schaumleffel, 77, who lives across a cornfield from Mr. Hodgkinson, described him as a man who kept to himself and didn\u2019t cause any trouble until one day in late March, when he \u201cdecided to have target practice in his yard.\u201d\u201cOur grandkids were playing in the sandbox and we heard shots,\u201d he said in an interview at his home. When Mr. Schaumleffel recognized it was a high-powered rifle, he told his neighbor to stop shooting, gesturing to his grandkids in the yard. But Mr. Schaumleffel said it wasn\u2019t clear if Mr. Hodgkinson had heard him.Mr. Schaumleffel called the sheriff and lodged a report, and said he hadn\u2019t heard any shots since then.\u201cWe knew all the neighbors except for them,\u201d he said. \u201cHis picture on TV was the first time I actually saw the guy\u2019s face.\u201dMr. Schaumleffel, who has lived in Belleville since 1989, estimates Mr. Hodgkinson moved there about two decades ago.According to a police report from the incident, Mr. Hodgkinson had a valid firearms identification card. Officers advised him not to fire his gun because there were homes in the area, the report said.In 2006, a neighbor called the police after he allegedly broke into her house and damaged property. According to the police report, he said he was trying to get a foster daughter to return home.Dale Walsh, a longtime friend of Mr. Hodgkinson who went to school with him, described him as a man who believes in his convictions.\u201cWhatever he thought, he put his whole body behind it,\u201d he said, adding that in his younger days, Mr. Hodgkinson would get into bar fights over his political views. \u201cOnly this time, he went too far.\u201dMr. Walsh, 65, stressed that his friend \u201cwasn\u2019t a monster,\u201d guessing that he may have snapped. He knew the shooter as someone who was easygoing and a \u201cjokester,\u201d though he hadn\u2019t socialized with him in some months.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t evil,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has caught all of us by surprise.\u201dStanding next to Mr. Walsh as he burned leaves in his front yard, Dave Hanvey, 63, said that he feels that he had lost a friend. He too went to the same schools as Mr. Hodgkinson.\u201cStill, you can never justify what he did,\u201d said Mr. Hanvey. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anything can get that bad.\u201dAccording to the Facebook page, Mr. Hodgkinson worked as a home inspector and mold and air-quality tester until last year. He also wrote that he was a former student at\u00a0Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and had studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College in 1971.Mr.\u00a0Hodgkinson appears to have written several letters to the\u00a0Belleville News-Democrat,\u00a0his hometown newspaper, according to an article Wednesday on the paper\u2019s website. In them, \u201che often railed against Republican and tax policies, and at least once advocated for legalizing marijuana,\u201d the paper said.The letters were all from 2012. In the most recent one, dated Sept. 12, 2012, he praised \u201cAftershock,\u201d a book by Robert B.

But the U.S. currency still ended lower on the day.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against 16 others, fell 0.2% from late Tuesday to 88.12 but rebounded from a loss of 0.6% before the Fed announcement.Central-bank officials said at the close of a two-day meeting that they would raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as widely expected by investors, and laid out plans for slowly shrinking the balance sheet. Though the officials still expect one more rate increase this year, they lowered their inflation forecast for the year.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen in a press conference said the U.S. economy is doing \u201cvery well\u201d and said gradual rate increases remain appropriate.Those comments indicate that the Fed\u2019s plans for further interest-rate increases haven\u2019t been derailed by a recent slowdown in inflation, said       Eric Donovan,        a managing director in foreign exchange and interest rates at INTL FCStone. \u201cIf the Fed was really concerned about the [inflation] data, they would have at least tempered their language,\u201d he said. \u201cThat shows me that those numbers are not being taken as seriously as they would have in the past.\u201dEarlier in the day, the dollar was sent tumbling by disappointing inflation and retail-sales data. The Labor Department\u2019s consumer-price index fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from the prior month, while economists had expected prices to hold steady. Growth in so-called core prices were also softer than expected.Before Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting, investors had grown worried that the softening in U.S. inflation would prevent the Fed from picking up the pace of rate increases. A separate report Wednesday showed retail sales fell 0.3% from a month earlier, the steepest drop since January 2016.Higher rates typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.The dollar fell 0.4% against the yen Wednesday to \u00a5109.58.

The company had more than 80 stores in early 2016.The company\u2019s chapter 11 filing on Friday marks its second recent bankruptcy. It emerged from the first in January.The retailer has faced the same problems that have plagued many operators in the sector in recent months: an increasing shift to online shopping, a fickle teen customer base and empty malls.\u201cThis is a very challenging retail market, as seen in the business news reports every day,\u201d Mr. Dobin said.Traffic Shoes did not have enough money to make a $350,000 payment to landlords, suppliers and other creditors as part of its earlier bankruptcy filed in January 2016, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami. Several landlords have already asked a bankruptcy judge for the power to evict the retailer, accusing its managers of misleading them about the retailer\u2019s financial health.Traffic Shoes was scheduled to make a debt payment in February under a plan that the company\u2019s lawyers negotiated to end its previous bankruptcy.Traffic Shoes\u2019 first store opened in 1989 in Miami to sell \u201cthe hottest in teenage footwear to a fashion forward, budget conscious consumer,\u201d according to court papers filed during the first bankruptcy. Many of its stores are in malls.During the earlier bankruptcy, majority owner       David Goodman       negotiated with landlords to arrange more affordable lease agreements that would save about $7 million in rent a year, according to court papers.Judge       Robert Mark       approved the retailer\u2019s repayment plan on Dec. 28. Under the plan, unsecured creditors owed about $4.65 million were scheduled to get roughly 27% of the money they were owed.Several landlords and other creditors who monitored the earlier bankruptcy are unhappy about the missed payments. Wholesaler Sandy\u2019s Discount Shoes Inc. asked Judge Mark to put in new leadership, saying that previous managers \u201cintentionally misled the court through the use of inaccurate data and projections.\u201d\u201cWithout the immediate appointment of a trustee, the [company\u2019s] ongoing operations and business will fail,\u201d Sandy\u2019s lawyers said. \u201cWith this failure, the [company\u2019s] numerous employees would be left stranded and without a job.\u201dIn court papers,             Simon Property Group                   pushed for the power to evict Traffic Shoes from roughly a dozen locations.             General Growth Properties Inc.       also filed statements to the court that reflect a lack of confidence in the retailer\u2019s ability to survive.\u201cGGP has endured a lengthy and contentious chapter 11 and at this point simply wants and is entitled to evict and get its property back,\u201d its lawyers said in court papers.In response, Mr. Dobin said he is negotiating with landlords and vendors on deals that would \u201ckeep the company afloat in these difficult market times.\u201dHe added: \u201cAt the time the projections were made, it would have been virtually impossible to anticipate that the retail market would have this unprecedented collapse.\u201dJudge Mark set a June 21 hearing to consider General Growth Properties\u2019 request.Write to Katy Stech at katherine.stech@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 17:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/traffic-shoes-files-for-bankruptcy-amid-retail-industrys-downward-spiral-1497474093", "news_title": "Traffic Shoes Files for Bankruptcy Amid Retail Industry\u2019s Downward Spiral   ", "keywords": "traffic shoes bankruptcy,Traffic Shoes,bankruptcy,capacity,facilities,marketing,markets,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,facility closures,usage,consumption statistics,retail,wholesale"}, {"content": "Engineers would say technically sardines are still packed tighter. But the difference between a can of oily fish and a coach cabin of sweaty airline passengers is getting smaller.There\u2019s growing variation in legroom, hip room and headroom as airlines find more ways to cram seats into planes. Travelers had best pay attention: The bad seats aren\u2019t always where you might think.Some airlines are down to 28 inches of space from the back of your seat to the seat back in front of you in their basic coach rows, down from the once-standard 32 inches of what\u2019s called seat pitch. That\u2019s a difference felt right in the kneecap. Airlines considered full-service have shrunk down to 30 inches and American Airlines, which 15 years ago gave each row of coach seats 34 inches of space, considered going to rows with as few as 29 inches.They backed off Tuesday. Still, the new planes, the same size as 737-800s but called 737 Max 8, will have 172 seats, with two more rows of seats squeezed in compared with their existing 737-800s. Space will shrink to 30 inches from 31. American first flew that plane with 150 seats, then upped it to 160 in 2015.Slimmer seats with flexible backs and bottoms make the pinch possible. But American\u2019s announcement of 29-inch rows raised eyebrows and ire as the first big airline to break below 30 inches.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected a full-service carrier to go that low. That\u2019s very, very tight pitch, even with a slim-line seat,\u201d says       Jami Counter,        vice president of flight at SeatGuru and its parent             TripAdvisor.After hearing customer complaints, American said it agreed and would avoid dropping to 29 inches. \u201cWe\u2019ve reassessed what\u2019s appropriate\u201d for 737 coach seating, President       Robert Isom       said in a message to employees Tuesday. \u201cThis is the right call for customers and the right call for our team members who take care of them.\u201dSources: The airlines; SeatGuruSouthwest Airlines                   is taking delivery of the same 737 Max 8 as American, and using the same             Rockwell Collins                   Meridian slim-line seats. But Southwest, which has no first-class or extra-legroom rows, has decided to keep its seat count at 175, the same as its other 737-800s, with 32-inch pitch. The airline says there are operational efficiencies to keeping the same number of seats. In addition, \u201cwe were focused on offering a great customer experience at an affordable price for everyone onboard,\u201d says       Mike Van de Ven,        chief operating officer.Travelers say dense packing has done as much as baggage fees and overhead-bin anxiety to make flying coach a more miserable experience.\u201cWhen someone leans back, we all have to lean back,\u201d says       Jim Chud,        a frequent flier from Los Angeles who recently was on a plane packed so tightly that passengers kept hitting him while maneuvering into and out of a bathroom. \u201cIt\u2019s a hassle to fly to begin with, and then they squeeze you into a cattle car.\u201dCramming cabins really started after the post-2001 travel slump, when fares were low and airlines were losing lots of money. As travel recovered, discount carriers spread broadly, putting cheap fares in many markets. Rival carriers figured more seats would let them match cheap prices and still make money.Sources: The airlines; SeatGuruAt the same time, seat manufacturers found ways to make coach seats lighter and smaller. New metals and composite materials make skinny frames stronger. Three-dimensional computer modeling aided seat design, manufacturers say. Instead of hard backs and seat pans, manufacturers started using mesh covered with thin layers of foam. (Think Aeron office chairs.) Magazine pockets were moved up high on the seat back and seat bottoms changed shape to open up shin room.Take 3 inches out of padding out of a seat back and you can push the seats several inches closer together without reducing personal space. In many cases, the new seats are more comfortable.\u201cComfort is not just about the dimensions and the measurements.

Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices rose only 0.1% from April.From a year earlier, consumer prices rose 1.9%, the third straight month annual gains have eased and the lowest reading since November. Prices were up 1.7% on the year when excluding food and energy, the weakest mark in two years.For now, Fed officials don\u2019t appear overly concerned with the recent downward path, attributing it at least in part to one-time drops in prices for things like wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.\u201cWith employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2% over the next couple of years in line with our longer run objective,\u201d Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said Wednesday. \u201cNonetheless, in light of the softer recent inflation readings, the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\u201dMs. Yellen spoke at a press conference after Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates and outlined plans to start slowly shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Officials have penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with their forecast.Ms. Yellen\u2019s assessment of the broader economy was largely upbeat, though separate data out Wednesday showed a slowdown in key components of consumer spending.Retail sales\u2014reflecting spending at stores, restaurants and websites\u2014fell 0.3% in May, the biggest decline since January 2016, the Commerce Department said. While that in part reflected cheaper gasoline prices, Americans also cut spending at department stores, car dealerships, electronics retailers and restaurants.Sales are still up 3.9% this year compared with the same period in 2016, led by spending at online retailers, and Fed officials appeared to look past May\u2019s weak numbers.\u201cHousehold spending which was particularly soft earlier this year has been supported by solid fundamentals, including ongoing improvement in the job market, and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The unemployment rate hit a 16-year low in May, underscoring steady improvement across the labor market, though wage gains have remained subdued.The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, poked above the central bank\u2019s 2% target in February for the first time in nearly five years but settled down to 1.7% in April, the most recent month for which data is available.Fed officials on Wednesday lowered their projection for inflation this year to 1.6% from 1.9%, though they still expect it to hit 2% by the end of 2018.The Fed is tasked with maintaining full employment and stable prices.Fed officials \u201care highlighting that inflation is expected to remain below the 2% target in the near term and that they expect it to rise toward that target, but if it doesn\u2019t they would adjust monetary policy in response,\u201d said       Gus Faucher,        chief economist at PNC Financial Services.The consumer-price index tends to run a little bit higher than the personal consumption index, reflecting different methods for calculating inflation. Both gauges have followed the same pattern, with price gains peaking in February and then easing.In the May CPI report, gasoline was the main culprit behind falling prices. The gasoline index decreased 6.4% from April but was up 5.8% from a year earlier. Food prices climbed 0.2% last month and were up 0.9% from a year earlier.Shelter costs\u2014which account for about a third of the overall price index\u2014increased 0.2% on the month and rose 3.3% on the year.Elsewhere, inflation was weak. Monthly prices fell for apparel, airfare, communication and medical care services, the Labor Department said.A separate Labor Department report showed average weekly earnings for private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, increased 0.3% in May from the prior month. From a year earlier, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings were up 0.6%.\u2014Josh Mitchell contributed to this article.Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-prices-down-0-1-in-may-1497443500", "news_title": "U.S. Consumer Price Slumber Clouds Rate Picture", "keywords": " consumer price index, consumer prices, core cpi,rate outlook, retail inflation,u.s. cpi, u.s. economic expansion, u.s. inflation, u.s. prices,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,employment,unemployment,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,consumer price index,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,labor department"}, {"content": "A group of the International Bank of Azerbaijan\u2019s bondholders say the troubled lender\u2019s multibillion-dollar debt restructuring shouldn\u2019t be recognized and enforced in the U.S., citing a \u201cfundamental lack of fairness to non-Azeri creditors.\u201dIn court papers filed Monday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, bondholders owed about $220 million said the proposed restructuring is designed to benefit the bank\u2019s owners at the expense of its foreign creditors. The bondholders have asked a judge to deny the bank\u2019s request for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law, which would help it implement its debt-cutting plan.\u201cThe Azeri proceeding is rife with abuses sufficient to compel this court to deny enforcement of that proceeding in the U.S.,\u201d lawyers for the bondholders said in court papers.Last month, the state-owned bank sought chapter 15 protection\u2014the section of the bankruptcy code that deals with international insolvencies\u2014in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York to help it restructure some $3.3 billion in debt. Chapter 15 provides foreign companies with the full benefits of U.S. bankruptcy law, which halt lawsuits and block creditors from seizing assets, but the protections require a judge\u2019s signature.If approved, U.S. recognition would help the bank steer clear of potential disruptions from creditors during and after it emerges from bankruptcy. Judge       James Garrity Jr.       has already approved provisional protections for the bank, with another hearing slated for June 21.The International Bank of Azerbaijan is the country\u2019s largest lender and has been grappling with a steep decline in oil prices and subsequent currency fluctuations. Despite a series of capital injections from the Azerbaijani government, a formal restructuring process began in Azerbaijan in April, court papers show.Bondholders expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d in court papers about the Azeri proceeding, which they say is being carried out under a new, tailor-made law that went into effect earlier this year. Under the bank\u2019s proposed plan, unsecured creditors, owed $2.38 billion, would effectively take a 20% hit, while the bank\u2019s owners would be left unimpaired, according to bondholders.In particular, bondholders say a voting process has been skewed to benefit the bank\u2019s owners and that noticing requirements fall far short of what is expected in U.S. judicial proceedings.The objecting bondholders include funds and accounts managed by Fidelity Management & Research Co., Franklin Templeton Investment Management Ltd., Promeritum Investment Management LLP and VR Global Partners LP.The bank says getting approval of its U.S. bankruptcy petition is critical to a debt restructuring that it says is essential to its financial stability and to the economy of Azerbaijan, a small oil-rich country on the Caspian Sea.A spokesman for the bank declined to comment Wednesday. In a statement earlier this month, the bank said \u201cthere is a strong track record for the international recognition of bank restructurings conducted under legal regimes similar to the Azerbaijani bank restructuring legislation.\u201dThe bank is based in Baku, Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, and has subsidiaries in Russia and Georgia, court papers show. Established in 1992, it now has 36 branches in Azerbaijan and employs about 1,800 people. The bank is carrying at least $2.3 billion in debt and says it will also restructure a $1 billion deposit from the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, the nation\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund.Write to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/azerbaijani-banks-restructuring-draws-u-s-creditor-objection-1497473519", "news_title": "Azerbaijani Bank\u2019s Restructuring Draws U.S. Creditor Objection   ", "keywords": "azerbaijan,bankruptcynews,bondholders,chapter 15,international,u.s. bankruptcy court,International Bank of Azerbaijan,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Mexico\u2019s peso traded at its strongest level in more than a year Wednesday, gaining against the U.S. dollar for an eighth-consecutive day as both domestic and external risks to the currency continue to decline.One dollar bought fewer than 18 Mexican pesos for the first time since mid-August 2016, and closed in Mexico City at 17.9295 pesos, according to Infosel, below 18 pesos for the first time since May of last year. The peso briefly gave back some ground after the Federal Reserve\u2019s quarter-point interest rate increase, although the Bank of Mexico is widely expected to match the move at its June 22 meeting.Risks ranging from the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement to a left-wing nationalist party winning Mexico\u2019s 2018 general elections have subsided, helping to make the peso the world\u2019s best-performing emerging market currency this year. The peso is up about 23% from the record-low 22 to the dollar reached in January.The latest string of gains began after the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party held power in a key state gubernatorial election on June 4, despite a strong showing by the Morena party led by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. A Morena win could have given greater impetus to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who opposes the opening of the country\u2019s energy industry to private and foreign investment and is expected to make his third bid for the presidency next year.\u201cIn the short term, there is much less political risk. The market will likely discount reduced chances of Morena winning the 2018 election,\u201d said Benito Berber, a Latin America strategist at Nomura Securities who is changing his year-end forecast for the peso to 18 to the dollar from 20, and sees the peso ending the second and third quarters at 17.75 to the dollar.Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has had the lowest approval ratings of any president in recent decades, due in large part to increasing criminal violence and corruption scandals that have overshadowed his administration\u2019s achievements like overhauling the energy sector, lowering telecommunications costs through increased competition, and 15 consecutive quarters of economic growth.\u201cMexico\u2019s economy is holding up better than many expected; private consumption remains robust, while business sentiment and activity are both improving. External accounts show a similar picture, with workers\u2019 remittances trending higher and the trade balance showing signs of improvement,\u201d UBS said in a recent report. \u201cThe negotiations with the U.S. regarding Nafta\u2019s future are important, but our base case foresees an agreement where both countries could benefit.\u201dThe Nafta talks remain a risk, although with U.S. Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       seeking to complete the negotiations quickly ahead of elections in Mexico and U.S. midterms next year, \u201cit suggests that what they want to negotiate isn\u2019t that much\u201d said Mr. Berber.Other factors in favor of the peso include the Mexican government\u2019s commitment to a primary budget surplus this year, and its intention of using funds from the central bank to lower debt, reducing the likelihood of a sovereign credit downgrade. Another concern was allayed by foreign direct investment of $7.95 billion in the first-quarter, up slightly from a year before despite fears that investment would dry up with President       Donald Trump\u2019s       criticism of U.S. companies that move production abroad.Goldman Sachs                   sees the peso\u2019s fair value just above 17 to the dollar. \u201cBut given that growth remains somewhat sluggish it serves the economy well to have a currency that remains competitive, but is not excessively undervalued,\u201d the bank\u2019s Latin America economist Alberto Ramos said in a note.Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexicos-peso-rallies-as-risks-recede-1497469904", "news_title": "Mexico\u2019s Peso Rallies as Risks Recede ", "keywords": " currency, currency pairs, dollar, dollar-peso, enrique pena nieto, forex,mexican government budget,mexican peso, mexico, nafta, peso-dollar,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,economic zones,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "For anyone who collects a paycheck, there\u2019s some bad news, and some worse news.First, the bad: Unemployment may be at a 16-year low and the economic expansion may be third-longest on record, yet wage growth is miserable, clocking in between 2.5% and 3% for the past year. When unemployment was this low in the late 1990s and the mid-2000s, wages grew 4%.Now, the worse: If a labor market this tight can\u2019t generate better pay, quite possibly it never will. In Japan and Germany, where unemployment is plumbing generation lows, wages are moribund. This suggests the problem transcends borders: Minimal corporate pricing power, lackluster productivity growth and an aging workforce have all undercut employers\u2019 ability to pay better.This confronts the Federal Reserve with an intensifying dilemma. It has long assumed that once unemployment drops to its long-run \u201cnatural\u201d level or lower, inflation will pick up.       Janet Yellen,        the chairwoman, reiterated that Wednesday after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled plans to continue raising them through 2019. Fed officials predict unemployment, now 4.3%, will stay well below their estimate of the natural rate of 4.6% at least through 2019.Yet that assumption looks shakier by the month. Inflation has run below the Fed\u2019s 2% target almost continuously for five years and shows little sign of rising. Indeed, consumer price inflation excluding food and energy slipped to 1.7% in May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday, a two-year low. The Fed targets a different index, which shows even lower \u201ccore\u201d inflation.\u201dFor most of the past eight years, the Fed\u2019s assumption was a decent base case. Lousy pay was easily explained by a deep recession that left a glut of spare workers, many uncounted in the most common measure of unemployment, which robbed those with jobs of bargaining power. That explanation no longer washes. Broader measures of underemployment are close to their 2007 lows. Some 4% of jobs are vacant, matching the highest recorded since 2000. Anecdotes of worker shortages are too pervasive to ignore: Maine has released some prisoners early as tourism struggles to fill jobs, and in the western U.S., some farmers threw out crops for lack of workers to harvest them.Which raises the obvious question: If employers are so desperate for help, why not pay more? Because pay is closely tied to what employers can recover by raising prices (inflation) or sales per employee (productivity). Since 2012, U.S. businesses\u2019 selling prices have risen by 1.4% and worker productivity by 0.6% a year. At 2%, the sum of those two figures\u2014a proxy for sustainable wage growth\u2014is the lowest in more than 60 years.Worker pay has actually grown faster than that subdued 2% benchmark, because employers have absorbed the excess in their profit margins, which have fallen from record highs. As a result, labor\u2019s share of the total economic pie has been recovering and isn\u2019t far from its long-run average.Raises may also be more prevalent than the subdued average pace of wage gains lets on. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta looks at how much respondents to the monthly household employment survey say their pay has risen in the last year and finds the median raise has doubled since 2010 to 3.5%, meaning half of workers saw pay rise by more, half by less. Why the median is so much higher than the average is unclear but may reflect the changing composition of the workforce. Employers hold on to their best employees in recessions. As the expansion matures they hire less-skilled and experienced workers. Because they come on board at much lower pay levels than incumbents, these newly hired workers\u2019 raises don\u2019t move the average much.The same phenomenon happened late in the last expansion. This time there\u2019s an added wrinkle: Baby boomers have retired in droves since 2008, and their replacements are typically less experienced and thus earn less.This is good news for many workers at the bottom. The median raise for a low-skilled worker has risen from 1% in 2013 to 3% now, and for a young worker (aged 16 to 24) from 3.5% to over 7%. But it spells trouble for the economy as a whole. As more low-skilled workers join the workforce, its average quality suffers, which is bad for productivity. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and       Bart Hobijn       at Arizona State University predict that in the next few years, labor quality would continue to deteriorate, assuming more of the newly hired come from the fringes.That doesn\u2019t dictate worse productivity and pay, but it sure doesn\u2019t help.For wage gains to grow sustainably faster, either prices, productivity or both have to grow much faster. But inflation is below the Fed\u2019s 2% target and has lately actually drifted lower. Even if it returned to 2%, higher real (i.e., after inflation) wages requires better productivity growth. It did edge above 1% in the last year, and with business investment picking up, that pace may be sustained.Experience abroad, however, is not encouraging. In Japan, unemployment is the lowest in decades and labor shortages are rampant. Yet wage growth hovers around zero in part because retirees are taking menial jobs to supplement their pensions.Germany has the tightest labor market in two decades, but pay gains are below 2%. Like the U.S., both countries are grappling with the interrelated problems of lackluster productivity and an aging labor force whose most experienced and best paid workers are retiring.Inflation is subdued in both countries.For now, the Fed remains confident unemployment this low will eventually get inflation back to 2%. Productivity growth is also long overdue for some sort of rebound. Yet for this to get wage growth back to 4% is a stretch, all the more so when an expansion is as long in the tooth as this one. In short, if you just got a raise, enjoy it: It might be as good as it gets.Write to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-tight-labor-market-isnt-generating-better-pay-1497441272", "news_title": "Lousy Pay Raise?

Mr. Kushner\u2019s sprawling \u201cgay fantasia on national themes,\u201d depicting 1980s New York in the grip of the AIDS crisis, mixes comedy and tragedy, reality and hallucination. Mr. E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s opera is a cooler affair. It strips out the humanity in favor of the supernatural, and       Sam Helfrich\u2019s       efficient production at the Rose Theater mirrored that loss of emotional grandeur.Angels in AmericaNew York City Opera  Through June 16The first act is promising.       Mari Mezei\u2019s       libretto introduces most of the characters: Prior Walter, who has AIDS; his lover Louis, who abandons him; Joe, a closeted Mormon lawyer; Joe\u2019s Valium-addled wife, Harper; Joe\u2019s mother, Hannah;       Roy Cohn,        the corrupt lawyer, who also has AIDS and is visited by the quietly vengeful ghost of       Ethel Rosenberg,        whom he sent to the electric chair in 1953; and the Angel who appears to Prior and declares him a prophet. But the second act drops most of their stories to focus on Prior and the Angel. Without them, Prior\u2019s revelation is hollow, the opera loses the messy, often comic, humanity of the original, and the ending doesn\u2019t make sense.To create the perpetual nightmare, Mr. E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s music relies heavily on cacophony, with noisily insistent instruments like bells, saxophones, contrabass clarinet, and electric guitar. One of the most striking and effective elements is a trio of singers in the pit who echo the onstage words and phrases. The vocal writing is varied but inconsistent, and the spoken text seems randomly positioned. All the singers are miked; clumsy sound design made some of them sound artificial, and the stage-pit balances were frequently off.Oddly, for an opera about gay men, it was the women who had the most presence. Sarah Beckham-Turner\u2019s lovely, wide-ranging soprano illuminated Harper, making her feel like the heart of the piece, as well as Ethel, who is coerced into singing a Yiddish lullaby to the dying Roy.       Kirsten Chambers       was compelling in the Angel\u2019s Straussian dramatic soprano explosions, and she looked like       Karita Mattila       in a flowing white trouser suit by       Kaye Voyce.Aaron Blake\u2019s       lyric tenor made the usually unsympathetic Louis touching, and bass-baritone Wayne Tigges was nastily funny as Roy but didn\u2019t have enough singing to do. Neither did countertenor       Matthew Reese,        since the role of Belize, the gay nurse, is underwritten, and his second role, as Mr. Lies, the travel agent whom Harper hallucinates, is a throwaway.       Andrew Garland       (Prior Walter),       Sarah Castle       (Hannah),       Michael Weyandt       (Joe) and the pit trio of       Cree Carrico,       Sarah Heltzel       and Peter Kendall Clark completed the cast; Pacien Mazzagatti was the capable conductor.Mr. Kushner has written that the plays should be produced in a bare-bones, actor-driven way, and Mr. Helfrich\u2019s production certainly was.       John Farrell       created a black-tiled box that looked like a morgue in Purgatory that brightened only when Derek VanHeel\u2019s Stygian lighting turned pink or green for hallucinations; the Angel\u2019s arrival on a suspended window-cleaner platform was the first suggestion that the setting is actually New York. This makes sense for a while, but the plays and the opera promise an escape from the nightmare, and the staging, with its makeshift tinsel crowns for the parliament of angels in heaven, and just a speaker\u2019s podium for the 1990 epilogue, seems to suggest the we can hope only for more of the same.\u2014Ms. Waleson writes about opera for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-angels-focused-on-the-supernatural-1497473069", "news_title": "An \u2018Angels\u2019 Focused on the Supernatural", "keywords": "aids, angels in america,arts in review, new york city opera company, opera, peter eotvos,tony kushner,P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s,political,general news,arts,entertainment,health,medical conditions,music,opera,sexually transmitted diseases,theater"}, {"content": "The S&P 500 slipped Wednesday in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates.The Fed\u2019s move was widely expected by analysts and investors, though many are skeptical that the U.S. central bank will move aggressively going forward given a recent patch of tepid U.S. economic data.U.S. government bond yields and the dollar pared declines and major U.S. stock indexes swung between gains and losses after the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.2%, to a fresh high of 21374.56.

There have only been six instances of a player reaching double digits in leadoff homers in a single season, led by Alfonso Soriano\u2019s 13 for the New York Yankees in 2003. Heading into Wednesday\u2019s play, Springer was on pace to hit 17.\u201cHe\u2019s a power guy, but he\u2019s a leadoff guy,\u201d said Carlos Beltran, Springer\u2019s teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s got the mentality of trying to get on base.\u201dGiven Springer\u2019s track record and blistering start, it certainly appears realistic for him to challenge Soriano\u2019s record. Springer hit eight of his 29 home runs in 2016 while leading off the first inning, tied with Hall-of-Famer Craig Biggio for the most leadoff homers for an Astros player in a season.This year, Springer is tied for second in the American League with 18 homers, three of which traveled more than 450 feet. His heroics\u2014which included a walk-off home run against the Seattle Mariners on April 5\u2014have helped propel the Astros into first place in the AL West, as they pursue their first division crown since 2001, when they played in the NL Central. (Springer could have some company: Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Corey Dickerson already has six leadoff homers.)All told, Springer has hit 16 leadoff home runs since making his major-league debut in 2014, which ranks 11th among current players. New York Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson and Detroit Tigers second baseman Ian Kinsler are the active leaders with 42 leadoff home runs apiece.But while Springer has plenty of time to chase Granderson, he still has a ways to go before making a serious dent on the all-time leaderboard. Rickey Henderson, widely considered the best leadoff hitter in history, hit 81 leadoff homers in his Hall-of-Fame career\u2014even though he never hit more than nine in a single season.

For-profit schools taught about a 10th of all undergraduates at their peak but have been a disproportionate driver of the run-up to $1.3 trillion student debt and a sharp rise in defaults.One regulation, known as gainful employment, would have denied access to federal funds\u2014most colleges\u2019 main source of revenue\u2014to programs at trade schools if too many of their students leave with high debt levels relative to their earnings. Hundreds of for-profit college programs were in danger of closing in coming years under the gainful employment rule.Another regulation, known as borrower defense, set financial penalties for institutions\u2014be they trade schools, flagship universities or graduate schools\u2014found to have committed fraud, such as making misleading claims in advertisements about graduates\u2019 job placement. The regulation also made it easier for students to sue schools and have their student-loan balances forgiven by the government if their colleges commit fraud.Education Secretary       Betsy DeVos       said the rules were overly burdensome and would have proved costly to taxpayers. Colleges have argued the rules are so broadly written they would have exposed them to frivolous lawsuits and penalties, leading to mass taxpayer forgiveness of student loans even when schools did nothing wrong.Mrs. DeVos has supported private-sector alternatives to public schools in primary and secondary education, and the move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to roll back industry regulations. Mrs. DeVos said her agency would rewrite the rules.\u201cIt\u2019s time for a regulatory reset,\u201d Mrs. DeVos said in a statement. \u201cIt is the Department\u2019s aim, and this Administration\u2019s commitment, to protect students from predatory practices while also providing clear, fair and balanced rules for colleges and universities to follow.\u201dStudent advocates and Democratic groups were quick to criticize the move, saying it would lead to more vulnerable students getting into debt at shady schools. Government investigations into wrongdoing led to the downfall of Corinthian Colleges Inc. and ITT Technical Institutes in recent years, leaving taxpayers on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid student loans.\u201cWe\u2019re backtracking in terms of consumer protection and taxpayers,\u201d said Bob Shireman, a former Obama administration Education Department official, of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts.The Obama administration used the borrower defense regulation to cancel the debt burdens of former students at schools found to have committed fraud. As of mid-January, the Education Department had approved claims from thousands of borrowers to erase $655 million owed by former ITT and Corinthian students. Student advocates worry that the Education Department under Mrs. DeVos will set too high a threshold for students to prove they were defrauded and get reimbursed.Mrs. DeVos said Wednesday that the agency is wading through 16,000 claims for reimbursement and that those claims will be processed under the Obama rules. \u201cPromises made to students under the current rule will be promises kept,\u201d Mrs. DeVos. \u201cWe are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible. Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next several weeks.\u201dSteve Gunderson, head of the industry\u2019s Career Education Colleges and Universities, said he would work with the department on a new gainful employment regulation \u201cthat protects both students from academic fraud and their schools from ideological efforts geared to destroy postsecondary career education.\u201d His group previously sued the Obama administration to block the gainful employment rules.Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-to-scrap-obama-era-rules-on-for-profit-colleges-1497458305", "news_title": "Trump Administration Scraps Obama-Era Rules on For-Profit Colleges   ", "keywords": "betsy devos,education department,for-profit colleges,obama-era rules,student debt,student loans,trump administration,Betsy DeVos,political,general news,crime,legal action,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Oil prices tumbled to the lowest level in seven months Wednesday, as high oil inventories continued to erode confidence in the ability of major producers to ease a global supply glut.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a smaller-than-expected decline in crude-oil stockpiles last week, pushing prices below $45 a barrel and to the lowest levels since November. Meanwhile, gasoline stockpiles rose unexpectedly, compounding concerns about low demand for oil products amid an oversupplied market.Light, sweet crude for July delivery slid $1.73, or 3.7%, to $44.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, snapping a three-session winning streak and closing at the lowest level since Nov. 14. Brent, the global oil benchmark, fell $1.72, or 3.5%, to $47.00 a barrel.Oil has fallen more than 16% this year, despite an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producers to limit production and cut down an overhang of crude in the market. In May, OPEC and 10 other crude-oil producers agreed to extend the deal to cut output by 1.8 million barrels a month until next March.However, signs of persistently high crude inventories have derailed their efforts to boost prices.According to Wednesday data from the EIA, crude-oil stockpiles decreased by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended June 9, falling short of expectations for a 2.6 million barrel drop from analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, stockpiles of oil products increased, with gasoline inventories rising by 2.1 million barrels and distillates building by 300,000 barrels last week. Analysts had forecast a 700,000 barrel decline in gasoline inventories and a 600,000 barrel rise in distillates.That is \u201creally confirming the fact from last week that demand is a lot lower,\u201d said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks in a row of surprising unleaded gasoline builds. That doesn\u2019t happen at this time of year.\u201dOn Wednesday, the International Energy Agency said stored oil in industrialized nations\u2014a proxy for global supply\u2014rose by 18.6 million barrels in April. Inventories were 292 million barrels higher than the average over the past five years, said the agency, which advises governments on energy trends. The IEA expects global oil demand to rise by 1.4 million barrels a day in 2018\u2014but non-OPEC supply alone is set to edge up by 1.5 million barrels.\u201cThat just adds fuel to the fire about the lack of efficacy of those production cuts,\u201d said Gene McGillian, research manager at Tradition Energy.Traders said the pessimism over the supply glut could put further pressure on prices, especially if inventory data doesn\u2019t show substantial progress toward rebalancing supply and demand in the next few months.While oil prices traded between $48 and $55 a barrel at the beginning of the year, the market likely has adjusted to a new base range of about $43 to $49 a barrel, said Mark Waggoner, president at Excel Futures. \u201cIf we get to July. and nothing\u2019s changed, you could see it break $40,\u201d he said.Gasoline futures fell 4.5% to $1.4327 a gallon and diesel futures fell 2.6% to $1.4102 a gallon.\u2014Jenny W.

MAT 2.16%       is cutting its quarterly dividend by more than half, as new Chief Executive       Margo Georgiadis       looks to free up money to help the toy maker modernize its brands for the digital world and expand in emerging markets.The El Segundo, Calif., company said it plans to pay 15 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter. Mattel paid 38 cents a share in previous quarters, but slumping profits have left it paying out more in dividends that it generated in earnings.\u201cWe are right sizing our dividend, which will provide us the flexibility to fund our investments and affect this transformation plan,\u201d Ms. Georgiadis said during a presentation Wednesday to analysts where she laid out her strategy for the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels.Ms. Georgiadis hopes that lowering the payout can help free up money to fund the estimated $250 million to $350 million to move forward on the company\u2019s strategy.Chief Financial Officer       Kevin Farr       said Mattel will look to revert to a dividend payout ratio of between 50% and 60% of earnings. The company\u2019s ratio swelled to more than 160% last year. Recently, Mattel had the second-highest dividend payout ratio among S&P 500 companies.Mattel\u2019s shares were down 2.8% at $22.01.Four months into her job, Ms. Georgiadis is setting Mattel on a course to correct what she called \u201cexecution gaps\u201d that have cost Mattel sales, eaten into profits and caused shares to drop nearly 30% over the past year. The problems include mismanaging key brands like Monster High and American Girl dolls, losing the valuable             Disney                   princess license to             Hasbro Inc.       and an excessive focus on short-term financial metrics.\u201cThese gaps structurally compromised our revenue and margin trajectory,\u201d she said. She added that while the company cut hundreds of millions in costs, it didn\u2019t necessary simplify how the business operates.The former Google executive wants to modernize how Mattel approaches the development of toys, which she says \u201cneed to adapt\u201d to the modern world. She wants all of Mattel\u2019s key brands to be more than just physical toys, and plans broaden them to all having video content, gaming components, licensed goods and live experiences.Mattel still has some problems to work through this year. The company lowered its sales outlook for the year to a low-single-digit rate, as several brands, including American Girl, Mega building blocks and other smaller ones, aren\u2019t seeing a quick pickup in sales.And the plan will require more capital, which Ms. Georgiadis hopes to get by cutting the payout.This isn\u2019t the first time Mattel resorted to a dividend cut to shore up financials. In 2000, then-CEO       Robert Eckert       sliced the company\u2019s payout more than 40% shortly after taking over in the wake of the $3.5 billion acquisition of software maker The Learning Co., which soon starting hemorrhaging money.In that sense, Ms. Georgiadis is following the playbook of Mr. Eckert, with whom she sits on             McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s       board of directors.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-slashes-dividend-as-ceo-frees-funds-for-turnaround-effort-1497465249", "news_title": "Mattel Slashes Dividend as CEO Frees Funds for Turnaround Effort ", "keywords": " kevin farr, margo georgiadis,mattel,mattel ceo margo georgiadis,mattel cfo kevin farr, mattel cuts dividend, mattel dividend, mattel inc,Mattel,MAT,Margo Georgiadis,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,dividends,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,dolls,toys,games,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"}, {"content": "The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government note closed at the lowest level this year on Wednesday as the latest signs of slowing inflation sparked a buying frenzy in the world\u2019s biggest bond market.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.138%, the lowest close since Nov. 10, down from 2.206% Tuesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Buying was the most hectic during the morning session, with the yield at one point falling to 2.103%. The key catalyst was a report showing the consumer-price index last month was up 1.9% on an annualized base, dipping below the Fed\u2019s 2% target again. Excluding food and energy, CPI rose 1.7% over the past 12 months through May, the smallest gain since May 2015.The report prompted some investors to bet that the Federal Reserve could stand pat during the second half of the year after a rate increase this month.The bond market\u2019s rally eased Wednesday afternoon after the Fed raised short term interest rates as expected but made no change to its rate-hike plan for the rest of this year. This disappointed some bond investors and generated a bout of profit-taking, sending yields off from their session lows.\u201cThe Fed is willing to look through the weak inflation data and sticking to its normalization plan,\u2019\u2019 said Bill Irving, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. \u201cThose who had anticipated one hike and done for the year didn\u2019t get it from the Fed.\u201dIn a press conference following the rate decision, Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said it is important not to overreact to a few readings because inflation data can be noisy. Ms. Yellen, though, said rate policy isn\u2019t on a preset course, a sign that her view on inflation could change if more data point to downside risks.The selling following the Fed decision concentrated on short-term Treasurys whose yields are highly sensitive to the Fed\u2019s rate policy outlook. The yield on the two-year note ended the session at 1.343%, down from 1.363% Tuesday but off its session low of 1.290%.As investors sold short-term debt and migrated cash into long-term bonds, the yield premium on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the two-year note fell to 0.80 percentage point Wednesday, the lowest level this year. It was close to 0.75 percentage point last July, which was the smallest premium since 2007.A shrinking premium is known as a flattening yield curve in the bond market. It is usually interpreted by investors as a warning sign that the growth momentum may be slowing down, leading to diminished inflation pressure.Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at             Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s       private wealth management unit, said the curve reflects some concerns that the Fed\u2019s tightening campaign amid slowing inflation could undercut the growth momentum.\u201cIt could be a policy mistake,\u2019\u2019 he said.Reflecting his view, Mr. Pollack said he bought some Treasurys earlier Wednesday and that he wouldn\u2019t rule out that the 10-year yield could potentially fall to 2% or below especially if inflation continues to ease.Inflation chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power from their government bond investments over time and is a big threat to long-term Treasurys. Demand for long-term bonds rises when investors expect inflation to ease.Marc Bushallow, managing director of fixed income at Manning & Napier, said the 10-year note at this low level doesn\u2019t \u201cprovide a lot of value.\u201dMr. Bushallow said he still expects bond yields to rise gradually over the next 12 to 24 months especially with the Fed moving closer to start unwinding its large balance sheet that includes more than $2 trillion of Treasury debt.The risk of a big rise in yields, he said, is likely to be low with the Fed\u2019s signal of slow and cautious approach in winding down the balance sheet.The bond market has caught those betting on higher yields wrong-footed this year. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen from 2.446% at the end of 2016, even as the Fed raised rates three times over the past six months. The bond market is countering against the consensus trade leading into 2017 that yields would extend their climb in late 2016.A number of factors have sent yields lower instead: growing skepticism toward President       Donald Trump\u2019s       fiscal agenda; disappointing economic releases that raised some question toward the growth momentum; and U.S. Treasurys remain a bargain with their yields remaining higher compared with their peers in Germany, Japan and the U.K.A massive pool of negative-yielding government bonds in Japan and Europe driven by those countries\u2019 unconventional bond-buying monetary stimulus highlights global investors\u2019 struggle to get income and drives money flowing into Treasurys. The amount of global negative-yielding sovereign debt outstanding rose to $9.5 trillion as of May 31, from $8.6 trillion on March 1, according to a report from Fitch Ratings Tuesday.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-10-year-note-yield-falls-to-fresh-2017-low-1497447884", "news_title": "U.S. 10-Year Yield Falls to Fresh 2017 Low", "keywords": "bond yields,falling bond yield,flattening yield curve,fomc,inflation,interest rates,monetary policy,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,prices,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary"}, {"content": "The Senate Banking Committee voted Wednesday to advance the nomination of       Kevin Hassett,        President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.Mr. Hassett\u2019s final hurdle before taking office will be a vote of the full Senate.He was approved by a voice vote of the Senate Banking Committee, with only Sen.

Nita Lowey       of New York, the subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat, said that if the administration is focused on efficient spending of taxpayer dollars overseas, \u201cdrastic cuts to institutions that maximize our resources, aide in the sustainability of development programs and create new markets just don\u2019t make sense.\u201dSubcommittee chairman       Hal Rogers       (R., Ky.) also signaled a wariness about the proposed cuts, saying a desire for fiscal constraint had to be balanced against maintaining U.S. global leadership.\u00a0\u201cThese institutions provide opportunities for the U.S. to extend its influence around the globe in the effort to reduce poverty and foster economic stability,\u201d he said.The White House proposed giving the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, or IDA, $1.097 billion a year over the next three years. That is down from the $1.29 billion annual contributions the Obama administration previously committed to the bank\u2019s lending arm and 8% below the last financing round for IDA. The proposed cut represents the majority of the $650 million in funding for multilateral development banks the Trump administration said it plans to cut from past White House commitments.The administration didn\u2019t outline any commitments to the World Bank\u2019s other major lending unit, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which finances middle-income countries. But that is because the bank hasn\u2019t yet asked for new financing. Bank watchers say chances are slim the new administration will back new cash resources for IBRD, however.And while there are no current requests from the IMF for fresh loans from the U.S. to beef up its emergency-lending resources, some fund watchers say it could face a cash crunch if several large emerging markets run into trouble in the near future.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasury-secretary-washington-plans-to-preserve-power-at-the-world-bank-and-imf-1497471400", "news_title": "U.S. Treasury Secretary: Washington Plans to Preserve Power at the World Bank and IMF   ", "keywords": "2018 budget proposal,congress,donald trump,house appropriations,ibrd,ida,imf,international bank for reconstruction and development,international development association,international monetary fund,us treasury,world bank,International Monetary Fund,World Bank,Steven Mnuchin,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,building construction,residential building construction,banking,development banking,credit,construction,real estate,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       said he would nominate       Jessica Rosenworcel       to fill a Democratic seat on the Federal Communications Commission, setting up another possible confirmation drama for the former commissioner.The Trump administration also announced what it termed a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of nominations for U.S. attorneys around the country, as it seeks to speed the so-far-slow process of filling out its ranks.A number of regulatory agencies have been hamstrung by longstanding vacancies, including the Federal Trade Commission, National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The openings have been driving up uncertainty for many businesses.Ms. Rosenworcel, who previously served from 2012 until January of this year, had to leave office after GOP lawmakers declined to act on her renomination last year, fearing it could hand Democrats a majority on the FCC even if Republicans won the White House. That is because the then-chairman of the FCC, Democrat       Tom Wheeler,        declined for months to say whether he would leave office after the new administration took office.This time around, Ms. Rosenworcel\u2019s confirmation prospects appear much better, but she still faces potential complications. The GOP-run Senate might not act on her new nomination immediately, according to people familiar with the matter, because her confirmation would eliminate the Republicans\u2019 current 2-1 majority on the panel.Instead, lawmakers are likely to wait until either the White House nominates a third Republican to the FCC, or the current Democrat on the panel, Mignon Clyburn, resigns. Ms. Clyburn\u2019s term ends in a few weeks, although she can remain in office until the end of next year.Speculation for the third Republican seat has focused on Brendan Carr, the agency\u2019s general counsel and a former top aide to Chairman       Ajit Pai.A spokesman for Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), the Commerce Committee chairman, said the panel would seek more information about the White House plans to nominate a third Republican. Mr. Thune also hopes to use the nomination to spur stalled telecommunications legislation.An administration official said an announcement concerning the third GOP seat is \u201cimminent.\u201dSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who recommended Ms. Rosenworcel, a former Senate staffer, said she is a \u201cgreat pick for the FCC.\u201d He said he looks forward to \u201cworking with her to prioritize consumer protections\u2014including preserving net neutrality [and] expanding rural broadband.\u201dMr. Pai congratulated Ms. Rosenworcel in a statement, adding she \u201chas a distinguished record of public service.\u201dAT&T Inc.       official       Bob Quinn       said that the company \u201cis pleased that President Trump took action to ensure that the FCC will once again benefit from Jessica Rosenworcel\u2019s considerable intellect.\u201dThe administration also announced 8 nominations this week for U.S. attorneys around the country, as Mr. Trump begins filling those important law enforcement posts.If confirmed, the new U.S. attorneys would serve in five states and the District of Columbia. Three would serve in separate Alabama judicial districts, while the others would lead offices in Tennessee, Ohio, Utah, Oklahoma and Washington, D.C.After a round of resignations, Mr. Trump removed almost all of the remaining U.S. attorneys during a March purge. Although the White House signaled it was set to begin replacing several of them in April, the first new appointments didn\u2019t come until this week.\"These candidates share the President\u2019s vision for \u2018Making America Safe Again,\u2019\u201d the White House press secretary said Monday night in a statement announcing the nominations.Write to John D.

They appeared to mark a departure from longstanding U.S. policy and a potential break from other world powers, including Germany and France, which brokered and have supported the cease-fire and peace accords reached in Minsk, Belarus, in 2014 and 2015.\u201cI think it\u2019s important we be given sufficient flexibility to achieve the Minsk objectives,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the government of Ukraine and the government of Russia could come to a satisfactory resolution through some structure other than Minsk, but would achieve the objectives of Minsk, which we\u2019re committed to.\u201dThe Minsk agreements call for local elections in Ukraine\u2019s breakaway Donbas region, the withdrawal of foreign-armed troops, and returning the border with Russia to Ukrainian control, among other points.Pursuing an agreement outside the Minsk accords could allow the two sides to go back to the drawing board and negotiate a pact acceptable to both, possibly without meeting benchmarks set in Minsk. It isn\u2019t clear if such efforts are already under way.Mr. Tillerson has said\u2014including in an April phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president Petro Poroshenko\u2014that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Russia until the Minsk agreements are fully implemented. Washington and European allies have long been united in that demand.Mr. Tillerson most recently reiterated that position to Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       in a May 10 meeting in Washington, according to an account of the meeting by State Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert.\u201cOn Ukraine, Secretary Tillerson stressed the need for progress toward full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Sanctions on Russia will remain in place until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered them,\u201d Ms. Nauert said then.A day later, after meeting separately with Mr. Lavrov and Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister,       Pavlo Klimkin,        President       Donald Trump      called for the parties to make peace, casting the U.S. as something of a neutral arbiter. The Obama administration had presented the U.S. as an advocate for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and demanded that Russia cease its occupation of Crimea and its support for armed rebels in eastern Ukraine.U.S. and European officials often have voiced dismay over the absence of progress on implementing the specific points of the Minsk accords. But Mr. Tillerson\u2019s comments Wednesday were the first time the U.S. has suggested the possibility of brokering an entirely new peace deal.Supporters of the accords say they at least managed to largely freeze the conflict and keep Ukraine\u2019s borders in place. Any move that appears to scrap it could risk a return to full-scale violence, they say.\u201cThe danger is political\u2014it\u2019s clear that none of us are satisfied with the degree to which Minsk has been implemented, but we have been consistent now for nearly three years in holding all the signatories to Minsk accountable for implementing it,\u201d said Daniel Baer, who was the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe during the Obama administration. \u201cWe want to be very careful about giving up one tool especially if we don\u2019t have another in place.\u201dMeanwhile, the Senate on Wednesday approved tougher Russia sanctions that also would require the president to seek congressional permission to relax any part of the current sanctions regime on Russia.Mr. Tillerson told members of the House committee the administration needs flexibility to \u201cturn up the heat when we need to, but also to insure that we have the ability to maintain a constructive dialogue.\u201dHe said he worried about tying U.S. sanctions to Minsk, as the Trump and Obama administrations have said they would.\u201cMy caution is I wouldn\u2019t want to have ourselves handcuffed to Minsk if it turns out the parties decide to settle this through another, a different agreement,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\u2014Paul Sonne contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tillerson-allows-for-russia-ukraine-peace-deal-outside-of-minsk-accords-1497457270", "news_title": "Tillerson Allows for Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal Outside of Minsk Accords ", "keywords": " crimea, donbas,minsk accord, minsk agreement, russian-backed separatists,Rex Tillerson,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,risk news,tariffs,trade barriers,military action"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Europe\u2019s top air-safety regulator issued the most explicit criticism yet of U.S. proposals to ban laptops from the cabins of more foreign airliners destined for American airports, even as officials in Washington indicated they may compromise by accepting less-sweeping security measures.Highlighting the extent of European opposition to an expanded ban on taking large electronic devices in carry-on bags\u2013a measure intended to combat possible terrorist threats\u2013Patrick Ky, head of the European Aviation Safety Agency, on Wednesday said months of laboratory tests likely are required to properly assess the potential fire hazards of flying large numbers of laptops with lithium batteries in cargo holds.In remarks delivered during the kickoff of a joint European-U.S. safety conference here and in a subsequent interview, Mr. Ky also warned that \u201cwe should be very careful\u201d because \u201cby dealing with the security risk we can increase the safety risk\u201d stemming from the possibility of rechargeable lithium batteries catching fire or even exploding.EASA\u2019s executive director vowed to play a greater role in current and future debates over such trade-offs. \u201cThis is going to be a very strong position on our side,\u201d he said.The day before Mr. Ky\u2019s comments, John Kelly, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, suggested the likelihood of an extensive laptop ban was shrinking. He said at a conference in Washington that he had \u201ca fair amount of confidence\u201d that \u201cwe can raise the level overall of aviation security and not inconvenience the traveling public very much, if at all in some cases.\u201dA DHS spokesman said other alternatives to an outright laptop ban include requiring additional passenger information before takeoff or enhancing explosive-detection capabilities at overseas airports. However, he reiterated that a wider ban affecting flights to the U.S. is still possible.DHS Secretary Kelly told lawmakers at a hearing last week that the in-cabin electronics ban now imposed on flights to the U.S. from a limited number of Middle Eastern and African countries could be extended to flights from 71 other overseas airports. But he also said DHS is trying to develop minimum security standards that airports and airlines could meet to avoid being put on that list.The issues are slated to be discussed Thursday and Friday at a meeting of U.S. and European Union security officials in Malta, which the deputy DHS secretary will attend. The DHS spokesman also said the agency is working to get information from the Federal Aviation Administration on the risk of increased numbers of lithium batteries in cargo holds.In the interview, Mr. Ky said experts from the FAA and EASA are running complementary tests to evaluate \u201chow laptops behave in luggage\u201d and what happens if a fire from one bag in the cargo hold spreads to adjacent luggage that also contains a laptop or other electronic device. \u201cToday, we simply don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are looking at worst-case scenarios,\u201d Mr. Ky said after his speech.Past tests by the FAA have shown that relatively few batteries, when packaged together for cargo shipment, can heat up rapidly and create a fire hot enough to melt aluminum structures used on aircraft.On the sidelines of the conference, Mr. Ky said it would be crucial to glean lessons from Middle Eastern airlines subject to the existing ban, ranging from customer reaction to added operating costs for those carriers.Mr. Ky didn\u2019t specifically call on DHS to hold off announcing an expanded ban, explaining in the interview that he and his staff aren\u2019t privy to the details of security threats. But the thrust of his message, while hosting a delegation of high-ranking U.S. safety officials, reflects the extent of European opposition to Secretary Kelly\u2019s earlier statements.In March, the U.S. banned passengers from carrying electronic devices larger than a cellphone, including laptops, cameras, portable DVD players and game units, on board flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Since then, DHS has explored extending the ban to all international flights in and out of the U.S. It has also considered banning the devices in cabins of U.S.-bound flights from 71 foreign airfields and inbound flights from European airports.U.S. authorities worry an explosive charge could be easily hidden in an electronic device and triggered in the cabin, according to people familiar with airline security plans. Pilot union officials also have raised similar concerns, noting that some foreign airlines are collecting passenger laptops before takeoff, and then placing dozens or even hundreds of them tightly together in designated sections of cargo holds.Industry officials, however, in recent months have joined European policy makers in questioning the wisdom of a far-reaching laptop prohibition in cabins.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Susan Carey at susan.carey@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-aviation-safety-chief-warns-u-s-on-expanding-laptop-ban-without-research-1497469519", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Aviation Safety Chief Warns U.S. on Expanding Laptop Ban Without Research", "keywords": "aviation industry ,counterterrorism,department of homeland security aviation rules,european aviation safety agency,homeland security john kelly,middle east airports,u.s. airports,u.s. laptop ban,European Aviation Safety Agency,Patrick Ky,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,terrorism,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,airlines,air transport"}, {"content": "VALLEJO, Calif.\u2014Soaring home prices and apartment rents in Silicon Valley have become a growing headache for technology titans. Google owner             Alphabet Inc.       is taking a step toward addressing the issue.The Mountain View, Calif., company is finalizing an order to buy 300 apartment units from Factory OS, a modular-home startup, in a building likely to serve as short-term housing for Google employees, according to executives from both companies.The expected value of the deal is $25 million to $30 million, according to Rick Holliday, founder and chief executive of Factory OS. It would be the first order for the company.Modular-building technology, essentially factory-built homes that are pieced together onsite, could help reduce the cost of construction in the Bay Area by 20% to 50%, experts said.\u201cAnything that can help us to move forward with a greater knowledge of how we can produce housing more effectively is something we\u2019re interested in,\u201d said John Igoe, director of design and construction at Google. \u201cWe absolutely are confident that it will work. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t become false bravado.\u201dTo be sure, modular-building companies in places like California and New York have failed over the years, and the approval process can be just as difficult if not more so, because the technology is still developing. And so far, the cost savings haven\u2019t been as big as developers have hoped, though experts predict costs will come down sharply as the industry evolves.As Silicon Valley battles its severe housing shortage, tech companies are becoming more active in trying to help solve the problem. Facebook Inc. has pledged to plan and design 1,500 units in Menlo Park, of which 15% will be classified as affordable housing. The project is still in the early planning phase. A spokesman said the company is considering modular housing and is supportive of Mr. Holliday\u2019s project and \u201canything that has the potential to accelerate building housing in the Bay Area.\u201dIn modular construction, also known as prefab, builders construct entire homes, apartment units or individual rooms in a factory and truck them to home sites, fitting them together like puzzle pieces. The process is quicker and usually cheaper than on-site construction, because companies can work through bad weather and bring more order to a job site.\u201cWe won\u2019t have much of a housing market if we don\u2019t figure this out,\u201d Mr. Holliday said. A previous project that Mr. Holliday built using modular technology saved tenants $700 a month in rent because of reduced construction costs, he said.Experts said one of the few ways to reduce housing costs would be to build apartment towers in factories. San Francisco rents have jumped by almost 50% since 2010, while home prices have increased 98% since the bottom of the market in 2009.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a tipping point where costs are just so high that people are desperate to figure out a solution,\u201d said       Carol Galante,        faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation and a former federal housing commissioner.Mr. Holliday, who also is the owner of Holliday Development, a builder of affordable and market-rate housing in the Bay Area, said he became enamored of the idea after years of dealing with labor shortages, chaotic construction sites and difficulty finding workers.The Factory OS facility in Vallejo, a port city northeast of San Francisco, is two to three times as big as most modular-construction facilities, spanning nearly 260,000 square feet, with a central corridor that is three football fields long and a central atrium that is eight stories tall. Mr. Holliday expects to begin production of Google\u2019s order in the fall, and to employ some 300 people.Mr. Holliday has several advantages over his predecessors, housing experts and his investors said. As a developer, he can fill holes in the pipeline with his own projects, which amount to 1,200 units, he said. He is funded mostly by foundations, not venture capitalists, putting less pressure on him to maximize profits from the outset.Mr. Holliday was introduced to modular construction when he pulled off the highway near Sacramento one day to tour the factory owned by a company named Zeta. \u201cThis is way more efficient and way better,\u201d he recalls thinking.Zeta, which was founded at beginning of the housing crisis in 2008, generated buzz in the Bay Area with a handful of successful pilots, when it installed the modules for a four-story building in four days\u2014although it took about five months in total from the start of the project to finish. It would have taken at least nine months using normal construction methods, according to Co-Founder and Chief Executive       Naomi Porat.But Ms. Porat acknowledged the company faced numerous challenges, including venture-capital backers who expected a quick return and difficulty establishing a steady pipeline of work.\u201cYou have to come out first and break through. The pioneers are not always going to be the last standing,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that offsite construction is the method of the future.\u201dWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 16:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-bets-on-modular-homes-to-fill-housing-demand-1497448838", "news_title": "Google Will Buy Modular Homes to Address Housing Crunch", "keywords": "Alphabet Inc.

What if it isn\u2019t?One of the Fed\u2019s aims is to get inflation up to 2%, a rate that it believes minimizes the risks of the economy overheating or stumbling into recession. So it counted as awkward when the Federal Reserve raised rates on the same day the Labor Department reported that inflation continues to cool.Consumer prices edged lower last month, the Labor Department reported Wednesday, driven by a decline in gasoline prices. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation\u2019s trend, came in weak for the third month running, and were up just 1.7% from a year earlier. That implies that the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of core inflation was up just 1.4% on the year, according to             J.P. Morgan\u2019s       calculations, which would mark the slimmest gain since late 2015.The Fed, in announcing its rate increase, indicated a bit more concern about the cool-down, specifying that it is \u201cmonitoring inflation developments closely.\u201d Policy makers also lowered their inflation projections for this year.But the projections also showed policy makers still expect to raise rates once more in 2017. Additionally, they expect to start shrinking their balance sheet this year, which in effect will make monetary policy tighter.Part of why inflation is so low is that wage growth, despite the low unemployment rate, has been weak. The Fed is working under the assumption that the tight labor market will eventually flow through into faster wage growth. But as Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       pointed out in the press conference following the Fed\u2019s meeting, inflation may be less sensitive to unemployment-rate declines than in the past.There are some one-time changes in prices weighing on inflation\u2014Ms. Yellen noted cellphone service pricing\u2014but the weakness has occurred across enough categories that it is hard to deny that overall inflation has weakened.Scars consumers still carry from the financial crisis may be playing a role, as might the ease with which technology allows people to ferret out bargains. Whatever the reason, just as the economy remains in a slow-growth rut, inflation might be stuck below 2%.Investors are betting that is the case. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to its lowest level since November and the dollar is at its lowest level versus other major currencies since October.If so, today\u2019s low inflation readings shouldn\u2019t be read as a sign that deflation risks are elevated, and that the Fed ought to counter them. But at the same time, they call into question why the Fed thinks it is a good idea to keep on raising rates. The economy is cool enough already, and the danger is that the Fed will only make it colder.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 15:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/isnt-that-awkward-the-fed-moves-one-way-inflation-another-1497462012", "news_title": "Isn\u2019t That Awkward?

The deal is expected to close Friday.The deal will hand J&J a clutch of promising new drugs that will bolster its portfolio of rare-disease treatments as its top-selling drug, Remicade, faces new competition. Actelion sells five PAH drugs, a gel for a rare form of skin cancer and a treatment for a rare genetic condition known as Gaucher disease. In addition to Actelion\u2019s marketed drugs, J&J will acquire a handful of late-stage research programs.J&J\u2019s pharmaceutical arm Janssen is organized into five units, each dedicated to a particular disease area. Actelion will become the sixth, focused on PAH, a rare artery disorder that causes breathing difficulties, Ms. Griffiths said.Each of those units behaves like a self-contained drugmaker, spanning early-stage research and development through to commercial operations. Ms. Griffiths, currently group chairman at Janssen\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa business, said she wanted to \u201cmirror that same therapeutic area structure\u201d with the Actelion business.To begin with, the new unit will have only late-stage research and marketed drugs, but Ms. Griffiths said she planned to build drug discovery and early-stage research operations, too. \u201cThe [drug] discovery people have not come across, but we have some people with deep knowledge of PAH that can act as a nucleus,\u201d she said. \u201cOr we may need to augment it.\u201dMs. Griffiths also said she would review the fate of two non-PAH drugs in Actelion\u2019s late-stage pipeline\u2014one for multiple sclerosis and one for C. difficile infections\u2014when she takes charge of the business.\u201cFor the moment, they stay in Actelion,\u201d she said, adding that experts from elsewhere in Janssen will be looking at these drugs to help decide whether they would be better placed in another therapeutic area unit.Meanwhile, Actelion\u2019s early-stage research and development organization will become an independent company run by the Swiss company\u2019s co-founder,       Jean-Paul Clozel.

It did pare gains later, with prices in after-settlement electronic trading up just 10 cents a troy ounce.The Federal Reserve announced it would raise short-term interest rates, which dragged gold back after the 2 p.m. EDT announcement. Investors had been selling gold in recent days expecting that result, but for most of Wednesday there was a much larger emphasis on the central bank\u2019s maybe-decreasing ability to keep the increases coming, brokers and analysts said.\u201cRight now the market is doubting they\u2019re going to be able to do a hike in September. That\u2019s because U.S. economic data has been weak,\u201d said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.U.S. retail sales\u2014reflecting consumer spending at stores, restaurants and websites\u2014fell 0.3% in May from a month earlier, the steepest drop since January 2016, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The Labor Department\u2019s consumer-price index declined a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from the prior month, while economists had expected prices to hold steady.The U.S. dollar tumbled in response, with the WSJ Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies recently down 0.2% to 88.12, near lows for the year. A depreciating dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities like gold cheaper for traders who are based in countries using other currencies, and those commodities prices often rise as the dollar falls.\u201cThe weak retail sales data is weakening the dollar, but it also tails back expectations for more [interest rate] hikes to come,\u201d another factor that is helpful for gold, said       Bill Baruch,        senior strategist at Chicago brokerage iiTrader.Further, political uncertainty could help gold long term. Strife in Washington is draining away traders\u2019 belief in the U.S. president\u2019s ability to pass his legislative agenda, according to Investec\u2019s Hunter Hillcoat. And there are questions about stability in the U.K. after Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in the general election.\u201cWith how long it\u2019s going to take the conservatives to form a government there, that uncertainty could prove support\u201d for gold, said Warren Patterson, commodities strategist at ING Bank.Copper prices slid again on Wednesday, with rising stocks helping the metal continue to unwind from an improvement in sentiment late last week.

During the same period in April, a month in which an NJ Transit train derailed at Penn Station, 70% of trains arrived at the terminal on time.NJ Transit\u2019s evening rush-hour performance at the terminal in May was better. About 72% of trains operated on-time, a two percentage-point fall from the previous month\u2019s performance.Robert Lavell,        NJ Transit\u2019s general manager of rail operations, said that on-time performance was better in the evening because Amtrak\u2019s speed restriction is focused on the western end of the station, where it mainly disrupts inbound trains.Amtrak will close several tracks at the terminal over eight weeks beginning July 10. The closures will reduce capacity at the station by up to 20%.Because of the closures, NJ Transit will divert all Morris and Essex Lines Midtown Direct trains to Hoboken where thousands of commuters will be forced to transfer to the PATH rail system and ferries to reach Manhattan.The Long Island Rail Road, which also uses Penn Station, will divert thousands of its passengers to stations in Brooklyn and Queens where they will transfer to the subway.The governors of New York and New Jersey have warned that many people will search for alternative ways to reach work, including bus, rail and car, which could lead to overcrowding and congestion.

Crew Group Inc. and             Nordstrom Inc.,       one player continues to defy gravity: Zara. And the rapid-fire design-and-production system that has allowed the Spanish giant to outpace rivals is now giving it a powerful platform to succeed online, an outlet that has confounded its lumbering rivals.On Wednesday,             Inditex SA,        ITX 1.48%       Zara\u2019s parent company, reported \u20ac654 million (about $733.3 million) in net profit for the first quarter, an 18% jump over the same period last year. Total sales at the world\u2019s largest fashion retailer by sales climbed 14% to \u20ac5.57 billion.The results are in contrast to the deep pain afflicting many of Zara\u2019s rivals amid sea changes in the way consumers shop. Fewer shoppers visiting malls and online retailers squeezing the profits of traditional bricks-and-mortar outlets are upending the sector\u2019s longstanding business model.Chains such as             J.C. Penney Co.       and Sears Holdings Corp. are closing hundreds of outlets to stanch their losses. Just this week, J. Crew reported its 11th consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, days after its longtime chief       Mickey Drexler      announced he will step aside.By contrast, Zara\u2019s pace-setting fast-fashion model is powering ahead.Parent company Inditex makes 60% of its garments in Spain and nearby countries. That allows it to respond quickly to feedback from its store managers around the world, who feed daily updates to a 600-strong design team in Spain on what is selling and what isn\u2019t. The creative crew whips up fresh ideas that go into production in days. The company\u2019s Spain-based logistics centers are then able to constantly refresh the stores with small batches of new designs.Inditex is leveraging that model into a winning online strategy, which it launched in 2010.Zara\u2019s quick turnaround time from design to the rack means fresh fashions are readily available\u2014something that is particularly attractive to shoppers surfing for something new. While other fast-fashion retailers are starting to move their suppliers closer, most still order the bulk of their clothes far from home and order them several months in advance.\u201cThis works online as it works offline,\u201d       Andreas Inderst,        an analyst with Macquarie Group, says. \u201cPeople are drawn to the homepage of Zara because they offer newness, which most other fashion retailers are not able to offer because of long lead times and the slow reaction to current demand.\u201dInditex upgraded some of its technology platforms to accommodate online orders, which it processes at its logistics headquarters and then ships out.\u201cThe systems were always used to handling individual orders coming in from store managers, which in principle is similar to handling orders coming in from individual online customers,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analyst       Anne Critchlow       said.Moreover, Zara has tightly integrated its physical stores with its online platform, giving it an edge in a market where free delivery and seamless returns are paramount. About a third of online deliveries are made in Zara stores, and the customers can return online purchases to physical stores.Zara also hits a sweet spot in pricing that supports its online business. Its prices are higher than fast-fashion rivals like Sweden\u2019s             Hennes & Mauritz                   AB. For instance, the most frequently seen price of a dress at Zara in the U.K. is \u00a329.99, according to a survey by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, more than double that found at H&M.Prices at another rival, Primark, owned by             Associated British Foods                   PLC, are so low that the retailer doesn\u2019t have an online business at all. Zara\u2019s pricing, along with the efficiency of its design and logistics operations, goes a long way to preserving its margins and helps offset the free delivery and returns that online consumers expect.Inditex doesn\u2019t break down figures for online sales, but Mr. Inderst estimates the company generates about 7% of annual group sales, or around \u20ac1.7 billion, online. He expects that figure to reach 12% of sales by 2020.Inditex, which brands also include Massimo Dutti and Bershka, said Wednesday it had launched online platforms for Zara in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam during its first quarter, which elevates its internet presence to 45 countries. It plans to go live in India in September. It also said Wednesday that it will focus on opening more flagship stores, letting websites do the job of smaller stores.Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Inditex Defies Broad Retail Slump.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 15:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-zara-is-defying-a-broad-retail-slump-1497467742", "news_title": "How Zara Is Defying a Broad Retail Slump", "keywords": "fast fashion,first quarter,inditex,retailcarousel,retail sales,sales,zara,Inditex,ITX.MC,J.

AVP 1.68%       Chief Executive       Sheri McCoy       is expected to step down, according to people familiar with the matter, after her effort to turn around the beleaguered cosmetics seller faltered.Ms. McCoy is near a decision to retire, according to the people, who cautioned that terms of her departure are still being worked out and no final decisions have been made. Either way, Ms. McCoy, who has run Avon since 2012, is expected to stay on for several more months. It is not clear who might succeed her.The move comes after Avon in early May posted a surprise loss that sent its stock tumbling. That same day, shareholder activists Barington Capital Group LP and NuOrion Partners AG, which together own more than 3% of the company\u2019s stock, said Avon\u2019s turnaround needs to go faster and it should find a new CEO.Avon in late 2015 agreed to two deals that gave troubled-firm investor Cerberus Capital Management a 17% stake in the company, three board seats and control of its struggling North American business. The business Ms. McCoy runs sells outside the U.S. and is London-based.Those agreements were meant to give Ms. McCoy, 58 years old, time to execute a turnaround of the door-to-door sales operation, once one of the most prominent brands in the U.S. but which has been laid low by online competition and other factors. The company is roughly halfway through a three-year transformation plan started then.Ms. McCoy\u2019s departure is the latest sign of distress for the 131-year-old company, whose revenue has been in decline for years\u2014and came in at $5.7 billion in 2016. Its shares, which once traded above $40, changed hands for less than $3.50 Wednesday afternoon after having given up much of the gains they notched in the wake of the Cerberus deals. The stock dropped 22% to $3.62 on the day when Avon reported the surprise loss.The company, which has lost legions of its signature door-to-door sales representatives, reported an adjusted first-quarter loss of 7 cents a share, compared with an average analyst forecast of a 1-cent gain.The expected move highlights a recent shift by activists, who are increasingly targeting chief executives as they seek new ways to boost the shares of targets. Since January, the investors have helped push out the leaders of insurance giantAmerican International Group Inc.,railroadCSX Corp.      , aerospace-parts makerArconic Inc.,restaurant chainBuffalo Wild Wings Inc.       and now Avon.As part of its succession planning, Avon on Tuesday announced that former             Herbalife Ltd.       executive Miguel Fernandez would become global president, effective Aug. 14. He is to succeed company veteran       John Higson,        who plans to retire in September as executive vice president and chief commercial officer.Write to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 15:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/avon-products-ceo-sheri-mccoy-expected-to-step-down-1497466848", "news_title": "Avon Products CEO Sheri McCoy Expected to Step Down", "keywords": "avon ceo,avon chief executive,chief executive,executive moves,management,Avon Products,AVP,Sheri McCoy,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,cosmetics,toiletries,skin care products,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances"}, {"content": "OPEC is running smack into a wall of crude-oil storage.The global oil glut is proving immune to the limits set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its big-producer allies like Russia, fueling the idea that output caps withholding almost 2% of world crude supply were a miscalculation.Both Brent, the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. price setter, fell almost 4% to their lowest levels of 2017 on Wednesday after the release of fresh data about inventories. Overall, prices are down over 17% since the beginning of the year.In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stockpiles fell last week by 1.7 million barrels, less than the 2.6 million drop forecast by a Wall Street Journal survey. At the same time, gasoline inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels, compared with the survey\u2019s expectation of a 700,000 decline, underlining worries about the oversupply extending to crude oil\u2019s products.Oil stockpiles in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a club of 35 countries with industrialized economies\u2014rose by 18.6 million barrels in April and were higher than they were when OPEC agreed to its cut late last year, said the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group that advises governments on energy trends.\u201cThere\u2019s still so much crude in storage,\" said Doug King, chief investment officer at RCMA Asset Management and manager of that firm\u2019s $200 million Merchant Commodity hedge fund. \u201cOPEC needs much deeper cuts to draw inventory.\u201dAdding to oil traders\u2019 angst: U.S. oil production has come roaring back to life. The IEA said U.S. crude supply will grow almost 5% on average this year, and nearly 8% in 2018, potentially vaulting American producers ahead of Saudi Arabia in daily output.\u201cSuch is the dynamism of this extraordinary, very diverse industry it is possible that growth will be faster,\u201d the IEA said.With shale producers humming and storage tanks still brimming full of crude, the production limits that OPEC, Russia and others have approved through March 2018 are coming under heightened scrutiny. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets, the Nordic bank, called it an \u201cerror.\u201d\u201cIt would stimulate production in the U.S. too much and this is basically what we are seeing,\u201d he said.OPEC and its leader, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest exporter, had resisted cutting output when oil prices began crashing in the summer and fall of 2014, reasoning it couldn\u2019t stop the market slide on its own. It changed course late last year after bringing Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers on board for almost 600,000 barrels a day in cuts.But even those combined efforts have done little to drain oil in storage. Eugen Weinberg, an oil analyst at Commerzbank, said OPEC needed to end its production cut.\u201cThe only option that OPEC has for the next five years is to let the market go,\u201d said Mr. Weinberg.OPEC representatives said Wednesday that the rising inventories were concerning but that they couldn\u2019t abandon the production-cut deal. They pointed to a problem of rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which were exempted from obligations.\u201cThe market fundamentals are improving and there are signs that stocks are going down, but only time would tell if we have made the right decision or not,\u201d said a senior OPEC official from a Persian Gulf oil-producing country.Saudi energy minister       Khalid al-Falih       said this week that the production cuts would start having an impact this summer, accelerating a drop in stored oil that OPEC said began in January. He has said OPEC and Russia would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to bring supply back in line with demand.Daniel Yergin,        vice chairman of             IHS Markit                   and a long-time oil market watcher, said OPEC wouldn\u2019t abandon its production-cut agreement, which took almost a year to put together through 2016.\u201cWhen OPEC and the other producers agreed to this deal, they hoped that, as the old adage says, time heals all\u2014and time will heal the inventory problem,\u201d Mr. Yergin said. \u201cThey should now take a deep breath and realize this will take a lot more time.\u201dOPEC this week acknowledged that its efforts weren\u2019t working as quickly as it thought. In its own monthly market report, the cartel on Tuesday blamed U.S. shale for slowing its rebalancing efforts.The cartel set a tough goal last December, when its officials said they wanted to cut oil-storage levels to the five-year average.OPEC said OECD storage levels actually have been falling but by only 88 million barrels in the first four months of 2017. At that pace, it would take until March 2018 for stockpiles to fall another 250 million barrels to the five-year average.In 2018, non-OPEC production is set to increase by 1.5 million barrels a day, the IEA said, more than the 1.4 million barrels of growth forecast for world consumption. That means OPEC could have to sacrifice more market share over a longer period to maintain its output cuts.\u2014Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Oil Glut Exposes OPEC\u2019s Limits.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 15:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-stumbles-in-face-of-oil-glut-1497467587", "news_title": "OPEC Stumbles in Face of Oil Glut ", "keywords": "crude prices,oil glut,oil market,oil prices,oil production,oil production cuts,opec,opec cuts,shale,OPEC,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "Rep. Gabrielle\u00a0Giffords was badly wounded in 2011; Puerto Rican nationalists shot multiple congressmen in 1954.There have been several major incidents in which gunmen targeted U.S. lawmakers, but the baseball field attack marked the first time in more than 60 years that multiple congressmen have been targets in the same attack.In Wednesday\u2019s incident, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a congressional aide and a former aide, along with two Capitol Police officers, were shot by a gunman at an early morning practice at a field in Alexandria, Va. The gunman, confronted by police, later died.Here is a rundown of shooting incidents from recent history involving lawmakers.Four Puerto Rican nationalists shot five congressmen in 1954 in the U.S. Capitol\u2019s House chamber. The congressmen, Reps. Alvin Bentley of Michigan, Kenneth Roberts of Alabama, George Fallon of Maryland, Ben Jensen of Iowa and Clifford Davis of Tennessee, were wounded when the nationalists opened fire from a House gallery.Three of the shooters were overpowered by people in the building; the fourth escaped. All four were eventually apprehended and convicted in federal court for the shooting, receiving sentences ranging from 16 to 75 years.President Jimmy Carter granted the nationalists clemency in 1979 at his Attorney General\u2019s recommendation and against the wishes of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Rep. Leo Ryan (D., Calif.) was shot dead during a 1978 trip to Guyana to investigate cult leader Jim Jones and his Peoples Temple religious movement.After interviewing Peoples Temple members, Ryan and his entourage arrived at a Guyanese airstrip, where several temple members opened fire, killing Ryan, three journalists and a defecting temple member while wounding others, among them Ryan\u2019s then-congressional staffer, Jackie Speier. Today, Ms. Speier represents California\u2019s 14th Congressional District.Hours later, more than 900 Peoples Temple members died in the Jonestown mass murder-suicide by lethal ingestion of cyanide-spiked grape drink, forced injection and gunfire.Larry Layton, one of the gunmen and brother of a Peoples Temple leader, was convicted in 1986 of conspiracy in the murder of Ryan. Mr. Layton , the only person convicted of criminal charges from the murders, spent 18 years in Guyana jails and U.S. federal prisons and was released in 2002.In 1998, a gunman entered the office of former Rep. Tom Delay (R., Texas), shooting and killing two Capitol Police officers, Jacob J. Chestnut and John M. Gibson,\u00a0and wounding a tourist.Russell E. Weston Jr., a former mental patient from Rimini, Mont., stormed through a security checkpoint and opened fire before Capitol Police shot and injured him, ending his rampage.Mr. Weston told a court-appointed psychiatrist he stormed the Capitol to prevent the U.S. from being annihilated by disease and legions of cannibals, according to the Washington Post.The next year, a judged deemed Weston incompetent to stand trial in the murders of the two police officers and the injury of the tourist, Angela Dickerson.\u00a0He is currently in a federal mental health facility in Butner, N.C.A mass shooting outside a Tucson, Ariz., grocery store in January 2011 left six dead and 13 wounded including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D., Ariz.).Rep. Giffords was holding a constituent meeting at a Safeway when the shooter, Jared Loughner, shot her in the head and continued firing into the crowd. When he stopped to reload his gun and dropped the loaded magazine, bystanders were able to restrain him.Ms. Giffords has spent years recovering from the injuries sustained during the attempted assassination, undergoing an induced coma and surgeries and has since been a vocal gun-control advocate.Mr. Loughner plead guilty to 19 charges in exchange for which the government didn\u2019t seek the death penalty in 2012.

Rick Snyder\u2019s       administration to face charges in the 17-month-old criminal probe.Chip Chamberlain, a lawyer for Mr. Lyon, called the charges \u201cbaseless,\u201d saying, \u201cthe true facts simply do not support the prosecution\u2019s claims.\u201dMichigan Attorney General       Bill Schuette       said the latest charges reflected the determination of investigators to hold government officials responsible for Flint\u2019s water crisis.\u201cThere are those who assumed this would be swept under the rug,\u201d Mr. Schuette said. \u201cThat arrogance that people would want to sweep this away, that there were nameless, faceless bureaucrats that caused this, is outrageous.\u201dThe four other individuals charged\u00a0with manslaughter Wednesday, including       Darnell Earley,        a former Flint emergency manager appointed by Gov. Snyder, had previously been charged with other felonies related to the city\u2019s lead contamination.In addition, Mr. Schuette\u2019s office also brought obstruction charges against the state health agency\u2019s chief medical executive,       Dr. Eden Wells.       Prosecutors said she lied to an investigator and allegedly tried to withhold funding for programs designed to aid victims of the water crisis unless the program stopped investigating a Legionnaire\u2019s disease outbreak.Jerold Lax, an attorney for Dr. Wells, said she \u201cvehemently denies the charges and the charges will be vigorously defended.\u201dA. Scott Bolden, an attorney for Mr. Earley called the new charge against his client \u201cextremely disappointing, false and excessive\u201d and said he would vigorously fight them.Gov. Snyder issued a statement saying that Mr. Lyon and Dr. Wells are instrumental to Flint\u2019s recovery and that both have his confidence and will remain in their positions.The governor noted that some state employees charged last year have been suspended and are still awaiting trial. \u201cThey still have not had their day in court,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not justice for Flint nor for those who have been charged.\u201dMr. Schuette said the investigation was shifting now into a prosecutorial phase, with trials expected to begin in the fall. He called for the governor\u2019s office and legislators to ensure that his team had enough resources to prosecute the cases.Mr. Schuette said his team has filed a total of 51 charges against 15 current or former state officials. He said investigators have interviewed more than 200 individuals and didn\u2019t rule out the possibility that more charges could be filed.The manslaughter charges, tied to a contemporaneous outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease, significantly increase the legal jeopardy for the individuals who now face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.The manslaughter charges are tied to the death of       Robert Skidmore       in December 2015. Prosecutors say the state officials caused Mr. Skidmore\u2019s death when they failed to alert the public to a Legionnaire\u2019s outbreak in Flint.The individuals charged\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0include former Flint Water Department Manager       Howard Croft,        and two past officials with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, former drinking-water chief       Liane Shekter-Smith       and former water supervisor       Stephen Busch.Mr. Croft\u2019s attorney Jamie White said his client maintains his innocence. \u201cMr. Croft is a member of the Flint community and has worked diligently in their best interests and looks forward to being exonerated from all of these allegations,\u201d Mr. White said.Lawyers for the other individuals charged\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0couldn\u2019t immediately be reached to comment.Some experts have linked an outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s to poor water quality in the Flint area during the time of the lead contamination.Flint\u2019s drinking water became contaminated when the city switched to using the\u00a0Flint\u00a0River as its water source from April 2014 to October 2015.During that time, state regulators failed to require the use of a chemical to prevent pipe corrosion, and lead leached into drinking water from aging lead service lines running to homes.In September,       Corinne Miller,        a former Michigan state epidemiologist, agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor count of willful neglect of duty for failing to report\u00a0an epidemic of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in Genesee County\u00a0in 2014 to health-care providers and the general public.Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 14:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/michigan-health-chief-charged-in-flint-water-probe-1497445962", "news_title": "Michigan Health Chief, Four Others Charged in Flint Water Probe", "keywords": "flint,lead contamination,legionnaires\u2019 disease,michigan,nick lyon,water quality,Nick Lyon,political,general news,crime,legal action,natural environment,health,murder,manslaughter,outbreaks,epidemics,politics,international relations,domestic politics,air,water,land quality,regional politics"}, {"content": "The Washington Post, which has adopted \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d as its slogan, reports on the person who allegedly launched a violent daylight attack this morning on democratically-elected Members of Congress, their staffs and a security detail:The Facebook page believed to be Hodgkinson\u2019s also featured a post critical of an energy pipeline and the following statement: \u201cDemocratic socialism explained in three words: We the People.\u201d Recent attempts by this column to return to the page have resulted in a message from Facebook that the \u201ccontent isn\u2019t available right now.\u201dYour humble correspondent happened to be on       Maria Bartiromo\u2019s            Fox Business Network                   television program when news of the shooting broke this morning.

Initially, the Fed would allow $6 billion of Treasury securities to roll off its balance sheet monthly once they mature. That amount would rise by $6 billion every three months over the course of year, at which point the central bank will be rolling off $30 billion in Treasurys a month.The Fed said it would roll off its mortgage-backed assets more slowly, at a rate of $4 billion a month, with the caps rising by $4 billion every three months until reaching $20 billion a month.The Fed said the moves would begin later this year \u201conce normalization of the level of the federal-funds rate is well under way,\u201d but did not specify a date.The caps would remain in place until the Fed holds \u201cno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy,\u201d the statement said. It didn\u2019t specify the final size of the balance sheet but said it would be \u201cappreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.\u201dOfficials said they wanted to maintain using short-term interest rates as \u201cthe primary means\u201d of making monetary policy but they didn\u2019t rule halting the balance sheet run-off if a downturn caused the Fed to reduce interest rates once more. In a separate move, officials also voted to raise its benchmark federal-funds rate Wednesday to a range of between 1% and 1.25%.The Fed had previously said it planned to use caps to shrink its balance sheet but had not disclosed the details of its plans.Three rounds of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, swelled the Fed\u2019s portfolio to $4.5 trillion in the years following the financial crisis.

But many instead are coming under growing pressure as Americans tighten their spending and look for bargains.Retail sales\u2014reflecting consumer spending at stores, restaurants and websites\u2014fell 0.3% in May, the biggest decline since January 2016, the government reported Wednesday.While much of that reflected less spending on gasoline\u2014the average price for a gallon fell in May\u2014Americans cut spending broadly. Sales suffered at big-box stores, car dealerships, electronics retailers and restaurants.The decline may have been a blip\u2014sales are still up 3.9% this year compared with the same period in 2016. But many economists are puzzled that consumers aren\u2019t shelling out more, given the stability in the labor market and solid household finances. Unemployment, at 4.3%, hit the lowest level since 2001 last month, the stock market has marched to record levels and surveys show high household confidence in the economy.Shrinking profit margins and declining foot traffic have forced many retail chains to scale back. On Sunday, children\u2019s clothing seller Gymboree joined a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy this year. Since the beginning of the year, several department stores and specialty chains have announced plans to close hundreds of stores.Last week,             Ascena Retail Group Inc.,       which owns Ann Taylor, Loft and Lane Bryant, said it could close more than 600 stores by 2019, citing traffic declines and intense promotional activity. \u201cWe expect these factors will remain major headwinds for the foreseeable future and reflect an accelerated shift to consumer demand toward e-commerce,\u201d said Ascena CEO       David Jaffe.The glut of stores and shift to online shopping have made consumers more closely attuned to pricing. Some companies such as J.Crew Group Inc. and             Target Corp.       have set forth plans to offer more competitive pricing.             Amazon.com Inc.       recently began offering food-stamp program users a $5.99 monthly Prime membership\u2014a move that could put further pressure on             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       and other discount chains.Last week,             Macy\u2019s Inc.warned that gross margins for the current quarter and full year would be lower than expected due in part to heightened promotions\u2014sending shares of the department store chain to their lowest close in more than six years while dragging down other retailers as well.To woo price-sensitive shoppers, Macy\u2019s plans to open more Backstage discount stores inside its traditional locations after observing shoppers visiting stores with Backstage spaces more often. \u201cOur assumption is that traffic will continue to be challenged,\u201d said Macy\u2019s CEO       Jeffrey Gennette,        so \u201cwhatever we put into that box that gets additional trips\u201d will help.Retail sales are a big component of consumer spending, which in turn accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic output. Despite strong job growth, a booming stock market and surveys showing high household confidence, Americans aren\u2019t shelling out at the rate that many economists expected this year. The subdued spending is helping to keep the economy in the sluggish 2%-growth that has marked the nearly eight-year economic expansion.A big factor behind last month\u2019s decline in overall retail sales is a slowdown at car dealerships. Car sales, after hitting a record in 2016, have fallen nearly 2% over the past three months. They are still up by a healthy margin from a year ago, and they remain at a high level historically. But the slowdown could mean that the economy will have to rely on other sectors for stronger growth ahead.Economists said May\u2019s decline was likely a blip and that they expect consumers to step up spending in coming months. Retail sales have climbed 3.9% this year compared with the first five months of 2016.\u201cThe fundamentals for consumers remain solid,\u201d Gus Faucher, PNC\u2019s chief economist, said in a note to clients. \u201cMore jobs, rising wages, low inflation, rising home sales, and low interest rates will continue to push consumer spending forward in 2017.\u201dNot all retailers saw a decline last month. Nonstore retailers\u2014a group led by websites such as Amazon.com\u2014posted higher sales last month. Spending at those outlets has grown 11% over the past three months compared with the same period a year earlier.

They also laid out a plan to reduce their $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The Fed\u2019s so-called \u201cdot plot,\u201d which compiles the interest-rate projections of all sitting Fed officials, showed only very modest changes in how officials are looking at the path of interest rates.The median projection for the Fed\u2019s interest rate target remained at 1.4% for 2017, while 2018\u2019s view also held steady at 2.1%. Officials\u2019 median long-run interest rate expectations--essentially where policymakers see their rate rise campaign ending at--remained at 3% overnight target rate.On the economic front, the Fed now expects inflation to be lower this year, but to rise to the official target of a 2% increase by 2018. Officials trimmed their median estimate of the expected rise for price pressures this year to a 1.6% gain, from 1.9% in March.On the jobs front, officials appeared to react to the latest data showing a drop in the jobless rate in May to 4.3% by lowering their estimate of 2017 unemployment to that same level, from March\u2019s estimate of 4.5%. For 2018, officials\u2019 median forecast is for a 4.2% jobless rate.On the growth front, officials\u2019 median projection for 2017 growth now stands at 2.2%, from March\u2019s 2.1% estimate.Changes in the central bank\u2019s forecasts had been widely expected given recent economic data that have showed a weakening inflation trend and surprising strength in the labor market.A notable wildcard for the Fed\u2019s latest forecasts were personal shifts among the Fed leadership. April saw the exits of Richmond Fed leader       Jeffrey Lacker       and Fed Governor       Daniel Tarullo.       The former was an advocate for aggressive rate rises while the latter shared no such appetite.Their absence may have affected the Fed\u2019s interest rate outlook, if only at the margins.The June forecasts also see the entrance of a new voice with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s       Raphael Bostic,        who took office this month. Little is known about his economic and monetary policy views, but his bank said he would be providing his outlook to the June release.Write to Michael S.

Haas is ranked No. 302 and is now 6-8 this season.Federer hasn\u2019t lost to an opponent ranked that low since 1999, when he was beaten by a player ranked No. 407, according to Tennisabstract.com.

In 2004, Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. Five years later, after some judicious reforms to its labor market, it was Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse. Four years ago, Spain was widely dismissed as an economic basket case, one step away from national bankruptcy and euro exit. Yet since mid-2013, it has been growing at around 3% a year and created two million jobs.That points to a second aspect to economic turnarounds: They are rarely obvious at the time, even to the economists, policy makers and pundits paid to spot these things. Famously, 364 distinguished economists\u2014among them       Mervyn King,        who later became governor of the Bank of England\u2014wrote to the Times in 1981 to warn that Prime Minister       Margaret Thatcher\u2019s       policies were doomed to fail. Yet history shows that Britain\u2019s recovery began at almost exactly that moment, and five years later its economy was booming.This unpredictability is worth bearing in mind as one surveys the current European economic landscape. At the time of last year\u2019s Brexit referendum, it was taken as axiomatic by many in the U.K. that France was one of the leading contenders for the unwanted title of \u201csick man\u201d of what was widely assumed to be a doomed eurozone; Britain, in contrast, was Europe\u2019s most dynamic economy, one that needed only to unshackle itself from the continental corpse to seize opportunities in a globalized world and reach even greater heights of prosperity.Yet following the very different outcomes of this month\u2019s elections in France and the U.K., the tables have been well and truly turned.The gloom about France was always overdone. The French economy has some significant strengths that the U.K. can only envy, not least a growing native working-age population and high productivity: The average French worker produces in four days what a British worker produces in five, according to figures from the U.K.\u2019s Office for National Statistics.France\u2019s problem centers on rigid labor laws and high taxes, particularly on companies, that have held back investment and hiring, leading to unacceptably high levels of unemployment. The previous government of President       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande       made some modest steps to tackle these problems. Now President       Emmanuel Macron       is proposing to go much further, with plans to cut corporate taxes, cap the costs of firing employees and make it easier for wages to be set at firm level rather than nationally.Mr. Macron has been consistently underestimated. First, the doubters said he couldn\u2019t win the presidency; then they said he couldn\u2019t get a parliamentary majority. Now that he appears on the cusp of winning a landslide in Sunday\u2019s second round of parliamentary elections, they say he his reforms will be defeated by the unions on the streets.That is of course a risk, but Mr. Macron has a powerful mandate and a record of delivering reforms. If he succeeds, an analysis of similar reforms in other countries suggests his plans could boost France\u2019s potential annual growth rate from its current 1% to 1.5% over the next five years, reckons Gilles Moec, chief European economist at             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch. Factor in a strong cyclical recovery and plenty of spare capacity and France could easily grow well above potential without overheating over the coming years.In contrast, the case for the U.K. was never as rosy as claimed. The economy\u2019s recent strong growth performance was largely driven by immigration and foreign direct investment, both of which have been thrown into doubt by the Brexit vote: The Conservative government wants to reduce immigration to below 100,000 a year in five years, while its Brexit plans require the U.K. to quit the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union, which will inevitably result in new barriers to EU trade and disruption to supply chains.Indeed, the economic fallout from Brexit is already emerging. Consumer spending, which buoyed the economy after the referendum, is stalling as higher inflation caused by the pound\u2019s slump eats into living standards. Average earnings fell by 0.6% in real terms in the three months to April compared with the previous year; growth slowed to just 0.2% in the first quarter, with surveys pointing to a similar outcome in the second. That compares to eurozone first-quarter growth of 0.4% in France and 0.6% in the wider eurozone.Now the U.K. election has created fresh political risks. The chances have risen sharply of a chaotic Brexit, whether because Britain fails to reach a deal with Brussels or is unable to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure businesses can keep trading. Britain also now has a weak and wobbly government that is one political crisis away from yielding power to a       Jeremy Corbyn      -led left-wing Labour Party whose re-nationalization and taxation plans are likely to have a chilling effect on investment.Meanwhile, the U.K.\u2019s greatest strength\u2014its currency flexibility\u2014risks becoming a weakness as tough decisions are ducked in favor of periodic devaluations in the manner of pre-euro Italy, notes       Ian Harnett,        chief economist of Absolute Strategy Research.

The U.S. had 42 spots, compared with 43 positions last year; 20 U.S. schools lost ground in the ranking.At No. 11, the University of Tokyo now is considered to have a better global reputation than Ivy League Columbia University. Columbia came in at No. 12 this year, compared with No. 9 last year, while Tokyo moved up from No. 12.And Tsinghua University and Peking University in China overtook the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University this year.

Legal challengers say Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses are benefiting from his presidency, and that Mr. Trump, by retaining his financial interest in those businesses, is benefiting, too.The president\u2019s conduct \u201cdeprives the American people of assurance that their highest elected official is pursuing their best interests with undivided loyalty,\u201d the lawsuit says. It argues Mr. Trump is violating a constitutional provision that prohibits U.S. officials from receiving \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\u201d without Congress\u2019 consent.Rather than divest his business assets, Mr. Trump decided to place them into a trust.

Judges also are likely to consider whether the cases raise political questions, not legal ones, meaning they should be resolved by branches of government other than the courts.The Justice Department, representing Mr. Trump, last week asked a judge to dismiss the New York lawsuit, saying the president is allowed to maintain ownership interests in private commercial businesses. Constitutional prohibitions only apply to gifts and compensation that are based on the president\u2019s official position, the department said.The congressional Democrats are asking a judge to issue an injunction requiring the president to obtain congressional permission before accepting benefits from foreign states.The lawmakers, among other things, voiced concern about foreign diplomats staying at Mr. Trump\u2019s new downtown Washington hotel to curry favor with the president, and they said entities owned by foreign states have recently become tenants of Trump Tower in New York. They also said Mr. Trump has an ownership interest in ventures around the world, and that foreign governments could bestow regulatory benefits on them because Mr. Trump is president.Mr. Trump, through his lawyers, has pledged to donate to the U.S. Treasury all profits from foreign-government payments made to his hotels and similar businesses, though the policy applies only to customers who identify themselves as foreign officials.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus and Joe Palazzolo contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 13:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congressional-democrats-sue-trump-over-business-with-foreign-officials-1497461130", "news_title": "Congressional Democrats Sue Trump Over Business With Foreign Officials", "keywords": "constitution emoluments provisions,democratic party,democrats,department of justice,donald trump,donald trump lawsuits,donald trump trust,president of the united states,trump administration,trump organization,u.s. constitution,Trump Organization,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading industry news,suggested reading \u2013 hotels,restaurants,casinos,wsj pro industry - law,hotels,lodgings,hotels (except casino),motels,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "Federal law enforcement agents have arrested 39 alleged MS-13 gang members from New York City and Long Island during the past month, officials said Wednesday.The arrests were part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s newly launched Operation Matador aimed at cracking down on the transnational gang that police say is responsible for a spate of brutal murders on Long Island.\u201cTransnational gangs like MS-13 bring nothing but violence and conflict to our communities and their presence will not be tolerated,\u201d said Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York.An additional six men, who allegedly belonged to other gangs, also were arrested, including members from 18th Street Gang, Latin Kings and Los Ni\u00f1os Malos, ICE officials said.

Of those, 12 crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, ICE officials said.Under the federal unaccompanied minor program, immigrants younger than 18 who enter the country without parents or legal guardians, and lack proper immigration papers, are placed with family or friends until a court settles their status.ICE officials said 33 of the men arrested in Operation Matador lived in Suffolk County on Long Island, where police say MS-13 is responsible for 27 murders since 2013.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, Mr. Comey said he had felt directed by the president to drop an investigation into former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.       Mr. Trump denies he gave such instructions.The White House initially said Mr. Comey was removed for performance reasons, but Mr. Trump later suggested he was dismissed in part over the continuing Russia investigation.Mr. Grassley\u2019s letter came in response to a push from       Dianne Feinstein,        the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Ms. Feinstein has asked for Judiciary to conduct its own probe in addition to the other investigations unfolding on Capitol Hill. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over federal law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The announcement marks the latest intensification of congressional scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions in the early months of his administration. Mr. Trump has called the inquiry into whether his associates colluded with Russia a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dA White House spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Grassley\u2019s announcement.The Senate and House intelligence committees are already probing whether Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. Mr. Grassley\u2019s announcement means another congressional panel will be examining the separate question of how and why Mr. Trump came to fire Mr. Comey.Mr. Grassley said actions taken under the Obama administration would be examined by the committee as well, specifically whether former Attorney General       Loretta Lynch       acted improperly in the investigation into       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       use of a private email server while in government.The FBI opened a probe of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s actions while she was serving as secretary of state after classified material was found on her server. Launching the probe was a highly charged move given that Mrs. Clinton was, at the time, expected to run for president as the Democratic nominee, something she eventually did.Mr. Comey testified that Ms. Lynch \u201cdirected me not to call it an \u2018investigation\u2019 and call it a \u2018matter\u2019\u2014which confused me.\u201dThe Clinton campaign would insist for most of 2015 and 2016 that the FBI probe was a \u201csecurity review\u201d rather than a criminal investigation.

While the ad industry has been grappling with a lack of diversity for decades, a string of scandals last year caused a fresh bout of soul searching among industry executives.       Kevin Roberts,        the executive chairman of ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi and \u201chead coach\u201d at parent group Publicis, left the company last year following comments he made that were dismissive of the raging debate over gender diversity on Madison Avenue.Before joining Publicis in 2014, Ms. Serrano headed marketing agency Naked NA and was president of New-York based Berlin Cameron and Partners.Ms. Weill spent 21 years at J.P.

His colleagues were relieved to learn that he will also relinquish command of the office thermostat.Mr. Immelt, who said this week he will end his 16-year captaincy of the conglomerate, is famous for preferring refrigerator-like temperatures in GE offices and meeting rooms. \u201cHe keeps it very cold,\u201d one person who has regularly endured the chill says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the Immelt lore.\u201dAs head of one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, Mr. Immelt dines with heads of state and jets around the globe to seal multibillion-dollar deals. He also gets to mess with the air conditioning, often asking for a setting that feels like the low 60s. Some colleagues feel so chilled that they wrap themselves in a scarf or shawl to attend a meeting with the GE leader.\u201cIn the middle of summer, half the room would have a fleece vest on,\u201d says an adviser who has worked closely with GE executives.Why the cold treatment? Maybe the 6-foot-4-inch former Dartmouth football player doesn\u2019t like to sweat. Some say the veteran manager thinks it helps people pay attention. Mr. Immelt wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.Turns out the 61-year-old executive has had arctic preferences since he was just a boy growing up in Ohio.\u201cWe did not have air-conditioning when Jeff was little,\u201d said his older brother Stephen, who is CEO of international law firm Hogan Lovells. \u201cWhen we finally got AC it made such a difference for a muggy Cincinnati summer that I think Jeff decided that cold was for him.\u201dStephen also has a preference for the colder temperatures, \u201cbut I live with someone who does not and life is all about compromises.\u201dThe GE boss seems to hesitate on moving the thermostat in any direction but down, according to people who have worked with him for years. GE\u2019s roughly 300,000 workers will have to wait until August to learn whether his successor,       John Flannery,        has similar preferences. Mr. Flannery wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.Earlier this month, Mr. Immelt tweeted \u201cClimate change is real.\u201d He was referring to global efforts to combat rising temperatures. Folks inside GE might be forgiven for thinking their boss was simply reiterating his longstanding position on air conditioning.Mr. Immelt often gets teased about his predilection for cold meeting rooms by GE associates. They recognize this habit as \u201ca Jeffism\u201d\u2014along with his tendency to start meetings several minutes early if every participant is present.\u201cLet\u2019s get going,\u201d the early-starter CEO typically declares\u2014even if everyone hasn\u2019t gotten a cup of hot coffee yet, according to a person who has been in the meetings.Mr. Immelt will nudge the thermostat up a bit \u201conce in a while\u201d when attendees complain about their frosty surroundings, this person says. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018It\u2019s f\u2014ing cold,\u2019\u201d and Mr. Immelt would laugh as he replied, \u2018I know, I know,\u2019\u201d this person recalls.The executive isn\u2019t doing it to drum up business. GE doesn\u2019t sell air-conditioners anymore\u2014it sold its GE Appliances business in January 2016 to a Chinese company as part of Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy to refocus on industrial machinery.This year, the company hosted its annual shareholder meeting at a factory in Asheville, N.C., where it produces jet-engine parts. One investor who stood up to lodge a protest wasn\u2019t upset about sagging profits. \u201cJeff, I just want to tell you one thing. I come from Florida, and why don\u2019t you put some heat on in the building? I\u2019m freezing my rear end off back here.\u201dOne former GE executive says the cold never bothered him, but he contends that is probably because \u201cI have a lot of body fat.\u2019\u2019Mr. Immelt believes \u201cthat if the room is too warm, it makes people sleepy,\u2019\u2019 the former executive says.While people tend to think warm rooms make them sleepy, some research shows the opposite is true. Keeping a meeting room too cool hurts attentiveness, according to an ergonomics expert.\u201cWhen you start to feel cold, you feel distracted,\u2019\u2019 says       Alan Hedge,        director of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University. \u201cYou\u2019re not focusing on what people are saying.\u2019\u2019Distracted behavior typically happens in rooms cooler than 68 degrees, he says. Employees make fewer errors and complete more computer tasks with office temperature set between 76 and 78 degrees, Prof. Hedge concluded, based on several studies he has conducted since 2004. A room must be pretty warm \u201cto get people falling asleep in meetings\u2014unless it\u2019s super, super boring,\u2019\u2019 Prof. Hedge says.Unfortunately, he adds, Cornell doesn\u2019t let faculty members change thermostats in their classrooms. The rooms are usually set to 72 degrees in the winter and to 74 degrees in summer to follow guidelines set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers.For many years, Mr. Immelt hosted GE\u2019s annual meeting for financial analysts on the set of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in 30 Rockefeller Center at the company\u2019s former Manhattan headquarters. The soundstage features robust air conditioning in part to offset heat given off by TV lights.The company continued to use the studio for several years after it sold its interest in NBC and the frigid temperature at the analysts\u2019 meeting was an open secret among regular attendees, who spoke of dressing warmly to prepare for the hour-plus event.People at cold Immelt meetings \u201claugh about it\u201d but hardly ever register complaints, according to another person familiar with the situation. \u201cJeff does not spend a lot of time worrying where the thermostat is,\u2019\u2019 this person says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cold.\u2019\u2019But some do speak up. At a GE analyst meeting in the SNL soundstage in December 2013, an analyst questioned whether the building\u2019s new owner was paying its heating bill, according to a transcript of the event. \u201cI ask for this, this cool, this refrigerator treatment here,\u201d Mr. Immelt responded.\u201cI wonder if we can cut this short,\u201d the analyst joked. \u201cSo we can all get out of here and go warm up outside.\u201dThe high temperature that day in Manhattan was 37 degrees.Write to Joann S.

Since last summer the government has arrested more than 60,000 people many of suspicion of ties to Mr. Gulen under the country\u2019s counterterrorism laws.Mr. Akay denies any connection to Mr. Gulen. His lawyers and family say they believe the trial was a sham and that he is collateral damage in what many in Turkey\u2019s political opposition see as a witch hunt by the government to rid the country of critics of President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan.       They have appealed to the Turkish constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights.\u201cThere has not been a fair trial so far and the judges, I believe, are scared to issue fair decisions,\u201d said Yaman Akdeniz, a constitutional law scholar and a member of Mr. Akay\u2019s defense team.The head judge overseeing Mr. Akay\u2019s case read out the conviction Wednesday afternoon to a packed courtroom in Ankara. While he called the defendant a terrorist, he also suspended Mr. Akay\u2019s sentence pending appeal, allowing him to return home from jail for the first time in nine months. A spokesman for the family said they look forward to vindicating Mr. Akay.The trial illustrates the extent to which the Turkish state is evaluating loyalty and guilt in its voracious hunt for traitors under a continuing state of emergency called after the summer\u2019s failed coup.Mr. Akay\u2019s case has sparked criticism from the head of the U.N. war crimes appellate court in The Hague, where Mr. Akay works. The court there has ruled that Turkey should be sanctioned by the Security Council, saying Mr. Akay\u2019s prosecution violates his immunity as a U.N. official.The Turkish government has argued that such immunity is limited to issues related to the U.N. court\u2019s case work and doesn\u2019t apply to Mr. Akay\u2019s actions in Turkey. The judge dismissed motions by his defense team to throw the case out owing to his diplomatic immunity.Mr. Akay, 66 years old, hails from a secular nationalist family. After an early stint in private practice as a lawyer, he spent a career in Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry defending the state against human rights allegations. He later was nominated by his government to sit on the U.N. court for war crimes in Rwanda and reappointed for the appellate war crimes tribunal for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.Turkish officials linked him to the Gulenist organization because his phone appeared on a list of more than 200,000 Turkish citizens who downloaded ByLock, a smartphone chat app the Turkish intelligence agency believes was developed by the Gulenist organization as a means of communication used by followers of the cleric.Mr. Akay testified that he had downloaded ByLock on the request of a friend, but he rarely used it, as he found the app complicated.Mr. Akay was detained last September from his home in Istanbul after a vacation to Israel. He was held without charge until February.Before the indictment, a Turkish intelligence official said Mr. Akay\u2019s career and lifestyle didn\u2019t match the usual profile of a so-called Gulenist. But the official said Mr. Akay\u2019s use of ByLock indicated he was a \u201cfunctional\u201d member of the group.During his trial, prosecutors submitted to the court several printed pages that they asserted were ByLock chat messages between the judge and a Turkish acquaintance who managed a school in Africa affiliated with the Gulenist movement. The text messages spanned a time frame between June 2015 and January 2016. The subject matter largely consisted of social greetings, news about common acquaintances and plans about arranging face-to-face meetings.Turkish intelligence officials previously told The Wall Street Journal that ByLock wasn\u2019t used by the coup plotters, and that by 2015 the app had fallen out of favor among Gulenists.Mr. Akay\u2019s defense team argued that downloading an app isn\u2019t a crime. They also argued that some of the chats appeared forged, as they discussed matters and facts that they said were untrue, such as a bank account that didn\u2019t exist. The defense asked for the originals of the messages to evaluate technical aspects of the messages, but the Ankara judge denied that motion.The prosecutor didn\u2019t offer further evidence of terrorism. In his closing arguments he said that ByLock is \u201can app that cannot be downloaded by normal means by normal people\u201d and its use is synonymous with terrorism. He recommended a sentence of 15 years.Approximately two dozen Turks have been convicted on terror charges in addition to Mr. Akay owing to ByLock useWrite to Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of this article misspelled President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s name.

They were caught flat-footed and crude surged.Less than six months into that agreement, and weeks after it was extended for another nine months, financial models are being furiously updated again. Wednesday brought three new pieces of data that all point in a bearish direction.The International Energy Agency\u2019s monthly oil market report showed that petroleum inventories in the developed world grew in April, leaving them nearly 300 million barrels above their five-year average.\u201cSuch is the dynamism of this extraordinary, very diverse industry it is possible that growth will be faster,\u201d said the report.Most extraordinary has been U.S. shale, the quickest type of supply to bring online or take offline in response to prices. The IEA expects U.S. output to grow by 480,000 barrels a day this year and 780,000 next year or a cumulative 1.26 million barrels a day. To put that in context, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies pledged to reduce supply by 1.8 million barrels a day.Another inventory report, this one more current, added to the gloom Wednesday morning. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude inventories last week fell less than expected. Crude futures plumbed new seven-month lows after the report.As if that weren\u2019t distressing enough for oil bulls, even OPEC producers are creating headaches, albeit within the confines of the agreement. That was the conclusion of the cartel\u2019s own monthly report.Nigeria, which is exempt from quotas, saw output rise to 1.68 million barrels a day in May, the highest in over a year. Libyan output of 730,000 barrels a day was 87% higher than its average in 2016. The one bright spot\u2014for the agreement, though certainly not the producer itself\u2014is Venezuela\u2019s continued slide. It produced only 1.96 million barrels a day in May, down 9% and 17% compared with 2016 and 2015 average production, respectively.For now, the best OPEC can do is put a brave face on its deal. It has wisely highlighted inventories rather than prices as its target and there is reason to look past recent trends. One is that the term structure of futures has moved from contango, or upward sloping, to flat. That usually suggests a less-glutted market and also eliminates financial incentives to build physical inventories and simultaneously sell futures.Looking ahead, though, the recent price decline and rising service costs may at least take some of the steam off of the U.S. shale boom. Meanwhile, investment cutbacks in recent years for expensive, long-term conventional projects outside of OPEC are starting to nip supply. And, finally, political woes in Venezuela and a resurgence of problems in Libya or Nigeria, or even in OPEC\u2019s Persian Gulf heartland, could unexpectedly reduce supply.Things look bleak, but oil bulls nursing losses should take solace in the fact that the consensus view in this market is usually wrong.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the pump jack pictured as an oil rig.

That was a 2.5% increase over the same period last year, pulling back after year-over-year surges of 26% and 12% in March and April.\u201cThese May numbers are anything but encouraging,\u201d said       Jock O\u2019Connell,        an international trade economist.Meanwhile, two of the largest port authorities on the East Coast\u2014Virginia and Georgia\u2014saw their import volumes grow last month by 8.8% and 13.5% from the same month a year ago.The slowing import growth on the West Coast comes as those ports, which handle most of the U.S. cargo trade with Asia, are seeing big changes to their daily operations driven by shake-ups and consolidation among global ocean carriers. Beginning in April, new ocean carrier alliance agreements went into effect, meaning the vast majority of cargo on major routes is now carried by one of three entities rather than the four that had previously dominated the sector.Those three alliances are increasingly sending containers on larger ships to the U.S. West Coast but making fewer port calls.\u00a0\u201cThe awkward May numbers for the California ports may be a late echo of the alliance realignment,\u201c Mr. O\u2019Connell said, \u201despecially if the shipping lines are continuing to transition to larger vessels calling less frequently.\u201dAt the same time, the shipping lines are sending bigger vessels from Asia to the U.S. East Coast through an expanded Panama Canal to get more goods closer to population centers along the Atlantic seaboard.According to ocean shipping consultancy Drewry, the number of container ships capable of carrying 13,000 TEUs or more\u2014known as \u201cmegaships\u201d\u2014on routes between Asia and the U.S. West Coast has doubled since the beginning of the year.Larger ships remain in port longer and unload more cargo, which can create bottlenecks on the land side. Some agricultural producers in the U.S. have said delays related to megaship logistics can add time to their export shipments, causing problems with their customers abroad and potentially damaging their products.May export volume was down in Los Angeles and Long Beach compared with the same period last year. Dockworkers handled 288,425 loaded export TEUs at the Southern California ports in May, a decline of 4.2% from May of 2016.For the year so far, imports and exports have increased through the Southern California ports, and both the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said 2017 was their busiest May on record.Write to Erica E.

The shares rose 13% Wednesday morning after the company said it \u201cregularly evaluates various opportunities to optimize the company\u2019s positioning and shareholder value.\u201d It now has an enterprise value of more than $19 billion.Any acquirer is likely to have to pay at least this, favoring the largest industrial groups\u2014names like             General Electric,        GE 0.19%Honeywell,        HON 0.71%Siemens        SIEGY -1.24%       and         ABB.       Will they be interested?With more than 120 acquisitions since Chief Executive       Ola Roll\u00e9n       took over in 2000, Hexagon transformed itself first into a capital-goods company focused on surveying and other measurement instruments, then into an industrial-software group. Its deal-driven strategy has been phenomenally successful, with the shares up 47 times over since the start of 2001.But this success doesn\u2019t necessarily make the company an appealing acquisition itself. Its portfolio is now a mixture of hardware and software; industrial groups might want the higher-margin software, which would tie in with moves to digitize operations, but not the legacy capital-goods businesses that come with it. Synergies would be hard to come by, given the wide range of niche products and industries served.Above all, the underlying performance of companies built through acquisitions is notoriously hard to pin down. Software businesses are infamously prone to accounting issues, given the ambiguity of when to book revenue. That Mr. Roll\u00e9n faces a court battle in Norway later this year over insider-trading accusations, which he rejects, adds a level of unpredictability.Moreover, the plausible buyers are under pressure to slim down and focus rather than embark on risky acquisitions. Buying Hexagon would be a very daring statement for the new boss of GE, which has made much of its platform for collecting and analyzing industrial data, called Predix.Siemens has been moving into software under Chief Executive       Joe Kaeser,        and hasn\u2019t been afraid of big\u2014some would say overpriced\u2014acquisitions in the past. But Mr. Kaeser also is intent on proving to investors that Siemens is a more focused and accountable institution than it used to be. Buying Hexagon would risk a hard-won reputation for financial discipline.With its Swedish roots, ABB is perhaps the most likely buyer. Last year it appointed a Cisco manager as its first chief digital officer in an effort to foster a more tech-savvy approach to industry.

Mr. Clancy has served as finance chief at             Biogen                   for 10 years. Alexion shares rocketed 7% higher on Wednesday morning.There is good reason for that rally: The rare-disease specialist has struggled with a late securities filing, a slew of executive departures, revelations of aggressive marketing practices for its main drug, the blood-disorder treatment Soliris, and a high-price acquisition that turned sour. All those problems have caused its shares to drop more than 40% from their 2015 high, even after recent gains and Wednesday\u2019s jump. Mr. Clancy\u2019s coming on board gives a significant credibility boost to the company\u2019s turnaround effort.Investors shouldn\u2019t expect the bad news to stop entirely, though. For example, it is likely that the company will have to write down its 2015 purchase of Synageva for $8.4 billion, a deal that has resulted in almost no incremental revenue.Furthermore, given that new Chief Executive       Ludwig Hantson       has placed a new emphasis on ethical practices, future revenue guidance is at risk of being lowered. Analyst consensus still calls for double-digit annual sales growth rates through 2021, according to FactSet.That doesn\u2019t mean the rally has to stop here, though. For starters, there is no clear competitor for Soliris coming to market soon. The stock trades at roughly 20 times forward earnings. That is hardly dirt cheap but not unreasonable if long-term growth turns out to be, say, 5% instead of 10%.The company also has a clean balance sheet. Alexion carries less than $1 billion in net debt on its books and generates significant cash flow. Despite that financial condition, share repurchases were just $68 million in the first quarter.

Red-faced, gold-bearded and exuberant, Rok\u2014one of the waiters at Pirat restaurant in Piran, a pastel-colored Baroque town of 4,000 on Slovenia\u2019s Adriatic coast\u2014had gotten used to my daily lunchtime order: a warm seafood stew of net-fresh mussels and clams, thick with garlic and wine, known as buzara; and saut\u00e9ed bietola (chard). If I agreed to marry him, he insisted, he would grow bietola fields in my honor. He knew I was a city girl, he said, unused to village life. \u201cBut here in Piran, we are a city in a village.\u201d Over time, this border-town has been Venetian, Austro-Hungarian, Yugoslavian, Slovene and, briefly, Napoleonic French.Your guide to mastering the lazy summerMy tongue-in-cheek courtship may have been whirlwind. But time moves differently in Piran. Most visitors\u2014often staying in the adjacent, somewhat gaudy casino-resort town of Portoro\u017e\u2014come for a day or two, at most. They wander the marbled Tartini Square, its Venetian-style palazzos, complete with winged lions, a testament to the onetime presence of those doges in this city. They climb the hill for a glimpse of the 14th-century Franciscan Piran Minorite Monastery. They dine at one of the waterside restaurants that line both sides of the sardine-shaped peninsula at the town\u2019s edge, drinking elderflower-scented Hugo cocktails and Aperol spritzes imported from Italy, a 40-minute drive away. They may indulge in a few of Piran\u2019s Balkan specialties, like flaky, borek pastries stuffed with cheese, or visit the kitschy Sarajevo \u201984 restaurant for cevapcici (grilled sausages without casings) and Bosnian coffee, or walk along the seaside Via Lenin (a jarring reminder that this isn\u2019t your typical Adriatic beach town). The more culturally inclined may visit the nearby Se\u010dovlje salt pans, the exportation and trade of which gave Piran its wealth and funded its splendor. But, ultimately, they move on.Not me.On the hunt for an inexpensive, quiet place to write up a meandering doctoral thesis, I\u2019d chosen to return for a month to Piran, where I\u2019d previously just spent weekends: paying $800 to rent a stonewalled studio through Airbnb for 30 days in high season. For my first two days in town, I strolled along the harbor; lingered over a cappuccino on the peninsula\u2019s less-developed, northern side; and walked a mile beside the cliffs to Fiesa, a hamlet with pebble beaches, plastic chairs and red-umbrella cafes. I relished the kind of peacefulness that derives from the absence of anything formal to do whatsoever (aside from my thesis, that is). Then I began to worry that Piran\u2019s relentless pleasantness might turn, after a week or more, to stultification: death by 30 identical dishes of buzara, 30 identical dips in the sea.But spending a month in a day-trip town, I came to discover, meant discovering its rhythm: the ebbs and flows of energy that rendered Piran\u2019s apparent pink-hued uniformity increasingly complex. I started to notice the differences between the two- and three-story houses clustered along the harborfront: the pistachio-green one with its Venetian-style roofs, the ones whose grand wooden doors were overlooked by art nouveau-style statues. Passing along \u017dupan\u010di\u010d Street for the fourth or fifth or 10th time, I noticed a tiled alcove shrine to the Virgin Mary nestled beneath an archway, candles lit.Outside the cavernous, dome-ceilinged Caf\u00e9 Galerija, a 19th-century-style space with paintings of Charlie Chaplin on most of the walls, artists and lavender sellers spread their wares on stone tables. But some Friday nights, the piazza transformed into an open-air cocktail party\u2014the tables supporting free buffets of cheeses, sweets, wines. One Saturday, I passed by at 1 a.m. to find an Irish folk band leading a raucous, foot-stamping singalong. Another night I came to the statue-flanked cistern in Piran\u2019s First of May Square to find speakers arranged for a dance party: an elderly man with shoulder-length gray hair served as DJ as a dozen children invented gleefully un-self-conscious dance moves to Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cBlurred Lines.\u201dAs the days ran into one another, and sunset followed sunset on the swimming promenade between Piran and Portoro\u017e, I came to tell the passing of time by the number of children scampering around the rocks outside the Hotel Piran\u2014where ladders from the concrete pier dropped straight into the sea; by the number of half-beleaguered parents holding ice creams (a weekend phenomenon); and by whether or not my local morning-and-late-night workspace, the Caf\u00e9 Teater, in a reclaimed art nouveau performance space right on the water, was playing live jazz or tango or simply screening a football game.\u2018Some Friday nights, the piazza transformed into an open-air cocktail party.\u2019But Piran\u2019s greatest pleasure, I found, was its regularity. I learned from \u201cMitch\u201d (Mitya) Pilih, the Caf\u00e9 Teater\u2019s night-shift waiter and my postwork confidante, that I was one of two writers to occupy the prime table next to one of the few power outlets; a Japanese journalist took the \u201cafternoon shift.\u201d The morning-shift waiter memorized my breakfast-order, pre-emptively sending me away to the bakery if he\u2019d run out of croissants; Mitch in turn, knew my customary evening order (an optimistic espresso, followed by a resigned prosecco or three). I came to know the other regulars, too: an eccentric Viennese composer in his 50s, whom I knew only as Berghardt, convinced me to take a midnight swim with him off the pier (Mitch, long-suffering, watched my laptop).But my favorite home in Piran, inevitably, was at Pirat, with Rok and his fellow waiters. Along with the fantastically fresh buzara, Rok served up daily meditations (on Dave Matthews Band, opera and James Joyce). Later in my stay, Rok urged me to try more experimental morsels. \u201cEverything is the same in Piran,\u201d he said, \u201cI try to mix it up.\u201d Out of the kitchen came stockfish pur\u00e9e, a piquant squid salad, cold octopus. He brought me far more than I had asked for\u2014putting the excess (clams in prosecco, shots of Malvasia-wine liquor, a sorbet) on the house. Soon, he told me, the bietola fields would be ready. Perhaps by next summer. \u201cThen you\u2019ll return,\u201d he said. \u201cAll summer long.\u201dI promised him I would.Getting There Fly into Slovenia\u2019s capital, Ljubljana, or Trieste, Italy. Rent a car or hop on a bus\u2014the drive from Ljubljana takes about two hours; 90 minutes from Trieste. An irregular ferry also runs three-hour trips in summer months from Venice (about $78, sloveniaforyou.com/Ferry.htm).Staying There The grandest hotel in Piran is the 19th-century-influenced Hotel Piran, right on the water (high season rooms from $135 a night, hotel-piran.si), though Hotel Tartini, on the main square, feels more intimate (from $130 a night, hoteltartini.si/en). You\u2019ll find less expensive rooms at sister-venues Hostel Pirano and Hostel Piran (despite the name, neither offers dormitories; 3 Alma Vivoda and 9 Vodopiv\u010deva, respectively, from $66). Airbnb apartments are plentiful and can be even cheaper.Eating There Pirat, the town\u2019s best seafood restaurant, specializes in inventive takes on local cuisine (26 \u017dupan\u010di\u010deva ulica). For a more upscale environment, Rizibizi, just outside of town, serves dishes made with local truffles; truffle tasting menu, $60 per person (10 Vilfanova ulica). For those sick of seafood, the ultracheap Sarajevo \u201984 offers hearty Balkan fare with dishes starting around $5 (41-43 Tom\u0161i\u010deva ulica).", "news_time": "2017-06-14 11:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hide-away-this-summer-in-slovenia-the-easiest-vacation-1497455828", "news_title": "Hide Away This Summer in Slovenia: The Easiest Vacation", "keywords": "best destinations in europe in summer,best seaside towns in europe,best towns in the balkans,best vacation spots in central europe,european hidden gem towns,off the beaten path europe,quiet holiday destinations for couples,romantic european getaways,slovenia popular destinations,summer destinations in europe,summer vacation destinations in eastern europe,political,general news,consumer deals,living,lifestyle,personal finance,consumer spending,budgeting,travel deals,packages,travel"}, {"content": "Irish lawmakers elected the country\u2019s first openly gay prime minister\u2014and the youngest\u2014on Wednesday, a sign of the fast-changing attitudes in a once staunchly conservative country.At a time of upheaval in many other democracies, Leo Varadkar\u2019s appointment is also a reflection of the unusual stability of Irish politics. Like his 13 predecessors, Mr. Varadkar, 38, is a member of one of the two center-right groups that have governed the country since its independence from the U.K. in 1922.He is also committed to an economic strategy that goes back at least four decades, relying on attracting U.S. businesses seeking access to European Union markets.The son of an Indian doctor and an Irish nurse, Mr. Varadkar\u2019s boosters say be represents a new face for a country that was once the most socially conservative in Europe, and dominated by the Catholic Church.\u201cHe represents a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland, and speaks for them like no other,\u201d said       Enda Kenny,        the departing prime minister, who nominated his successor.Mr. Varadkar, whose Fine Gael party runs a minority government supported by a group of independent lawmakers, received 57 votes, while 50 lawmakers opposed his appointment.

Mr. Varadkar has recently launched a campaign to cut down on people claiming benefits they weren\u2019t entitled to.Accepting the office, Mr. Varadkar dismissed the distinction between right-of-center and left-of-center as a relic of the 1980s, and not relevant to the challenges of the 21st century.\u201cThe government I lead will not be one of left or right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government I lead will be one of the European center.\u201dMr. Varadkar\u2019s greatest challenge will be the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU. Ireland has closer economic, political and cultural ties with Britain than other members of the bloc and expects the consequences of Brexit to be mostly negative. Agricultural exports to the U.K have already been hit by the weaker pound, and policy makers fear worse is to come if new trade barriers follow Brexit.Mr. Kenny leaves his successor in a relatively strong position as the bloc prepares for Brexit talks, having secured an acknowledgment of Ireland\u2019s \u201cunique circumstances\u201d from fellow leaders when they agreed to guidelines for the negotiations.Mr. Varadkar is unlikely to depart from the government\u2019s established approach. In his election program, he said he would argue that Northern Ireland\u2014which is part of the U.K.\u2014should be allowed to remain within the EU\u2019s single market for goods and services, and have access to its agricultural subsidies as well as a number of other programs.However, he may face difficulties his immediate predecessor was largely free from. Following inconclusive U.K. elections, a new British government is set to rely on Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party for its survival.Some architects of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of violent conflict in 1998, fear that may place the province\u2019s peace in peril. The agreement requires the British government to be \u201cimpartial\u201d in its dealings with unionists who favor remaining in the U.K., and nationalists who want the province to join instead with the Republic of Ireland.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 11:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/irish-lawmakers-elect-first-openly-gay-prime-minister-1497455527", "news_title": "Irish Lawmakers Elect First Openly Gay Prime Minister", "keywords": "brexit,gay rights,ireland politics,u.k. election,u.k. politics,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Procter & Gamble Co.

Faris Radhi,        a top official in Iraq\u2019s Federal Police.Underscoring the resilience of the estimated hundreds of Islamic State fighters still in the Old City, the militants swept into the Dendan neighborhood and set houses on fire, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky in what police said was an attempt to hamper air support for Iraqi government forces on the ground.The death toll of civilians and combatants wasn\u2019t immediately known, as government forces continued to search the area late Wednesday, Col. Radhi said. In a statement from its media arm, Islamic State said it killed 40 police and seized weapons in the attack.Col.       Ryan Dillon,        spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition fighting Islamic State, said no ground had been lost to Islamic State in Wednesday\u2019s fighting. He didn\u2019t respond to questions whether smoke from the burning houses impaired efforts to provide coalition air support for government ground forces.Since driving Islamic State from eastern Mosul in January, Iraqi forces have seized large swaths of territory in the west of the city and have largely bottled up the militants in a small area of the Old City.Dendan abuts the southern edge of the Old City\u2019s southern edge and was retaken by government forces from Islamic State months ago. Federal Police established defenses there, and some people had moved back into their homes nearby.The government\u2019s campaign to take out Islamic State from Mosul began in October and in recent weeks, government forces have sought to complete and tighten their encirclement of the Old City, where tens of thousands of civilians are also believed to be holed up in addition to the militants.The fighting to remove Islamic State from its last stronghold in the city is expected to be especially brutal because of the neighborhood\u2019s densely packed buildings and narrow, twisting streets.Write to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 11:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/isis-fighters-launch-counterattack-in-mosul-1497455295", "news_title": "ISIS Fighters Launch Counterattack in Mosul", "keywords": "iraq islamic state,iraq military,mosul islamic state,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "When \u201cThe Mummy\u201d opened Friday, Brian Tyler, who composed the movie\u2019s music, performed his usual ritual. He headed to cinemas around Los Angeles to observe audiences. When screenings of the Tom Cruise action film let out, he lingered in the multiplex, taking extra time on the escalator and in the rest room to hear whether anyone was unconsciously humming his music.\u201cI\u2019ll wash my hands for a long time,\u201d says Mr. Tyler, who has composed music for four Hollywood films coming out this year. \u201cI was happy to hear some people leaving the theater humming the theme.\u201dIt\u2019s getting harder for Mr. Tyler and some of his colleagues to stay under the radar. Film composers are stepping into the spotlight in a new documentary, \u201cScore,\u201d which opens June 16. The movie celebrates the storytelling ability and emotional power of a film\u2019s score\u2014the original music composed to complement scenes in a non-musical film, rather than pop-music tracks a director might insert.Composers such as Mr. Tyler, who is featured in \u201cScore,\u201d also are taking rock-star turns in concerts. In May, he conducted a 75-piece orchestra and 60-person choir, performing music from \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and his other films for an arena audience of 15,000 in Krakow, Poland. He also performed some of his original electronic music, under his alter-ego name Madsonik, at a dance club in San Diego.Another movie maestro in the documentary is Hans Zimmer, who has scored more than a hundred films from \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d in 1989 to the coming \u201cDunkirk.\u201d Mr. Zimmer rocked the Coachella music festival in April, playing electric guitar with a backing orchestra and kicking off a global tour that this month has him filling arenas across Europe. He returns to the U.S. in July for his first North American concert series. \u201cPeople are realizing that film music can stand on its own two feet,\u201d Mr. Zimmer says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of storytelling in the music. It\u2019s not necessarily the story you saw on the screen. You can make your own movie in your head.\u201dThe documentary reveals the film-music creation process, practitioners, and history. It explores the impact of Bernard Herrmann\u2019s screeching violins in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho,\u201d John Barry\u2019s \u201cJames Bond\u201d theme, Ennio Morricone\u2019s spaghetti western sound, and Thomas Newman\u2019s ethereal score for \u201cAmerican Beauty.\u201d There is footage of John Williams and Steven Spielberg working on music for \u201cE.T.\u201d as well as Mr. Spielberg\u2019s reaction to Mr. Williams\u2019s two-note motif for the \u201cJaws\u201d shark. Initially, the director thought it was a joke.Movie music is all about manipulating the audience. \u201cThe whole purpose of your job as a film composer is to be the emotional voice of what the director wants in the scene,\u201d Mr. Tyler says. \u201cIt\u2019s the wordless narrative, so you try to jump into their head as much as possible. \u201c Director James Cameron (\u201dTitanic\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d) says in the documentary that a composer \u201chas to act almost like a therapist\u201d to extract a director\u2019s feelings.Live movie-score performances, sometimes accompanied by films, have become a summertime staple. The Harry Potter Film Concert series hits cities across North America this summer. \u201cTitanic Live\u201d continues its world tour, and the New York Philharmonic plays a \u201cStar Wars\u201d Film Concert Series in September. Orchestras regularly perform John Williams\u2019s music (including \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d), with the 76-year-old composer stepping in at times as conductor.For composers, moving between films and other work keeps ideas cross-pollinating. Mason Bates is composer-in-residence at Washington\u2019s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. His classical symphonies tend to tell stories. For the 100th anniversary of John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth in May, he composed a piece that integrated JFK\u2019s moon-shot speech into a symphonic work about American exploration. His first opera, \u201cThe (R)evolution of       Steve Jobs,       \u201d premieres in Santa Fe this summer. Director Gus Van Sant heard a recording Mr. Bates did with the San Francisco Symphony and asked him to try his hand at scoring the film \u201cThe Sea of Trees,\u201d which premiered at Cannes in 2015. Working on movie music that\u2019s tied so closely to dramatic narrative \u201callows one to think more theatrically\u201d about other music, Mr. Bates says.Today\u2019s arena performances might not surprise film composers who started out in the rock world. Danny Elfman graduated from the band Oingo             Boingo                   to score films including \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and \u201cSilver Linings Playbook.\u201d Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails won an Oscar for composing the score of \u201cThe Social Network\u201d with Atticus Ross.But the arena-size crowds still astonish some composers. \u201cOutside of John Williams doing his big concerts\u2014and he\u2019s kind of always the exception to the rule\u2014I don\u2019t think any of us thought that this was possible,\u201d Mr. Tyler says.Mr. Zimmer has some rock roots. He played synthesizer and appeared in the video of the 1979 Buggles song \u201cVideo Killed the Radio Star,\u201d which launched MTV. This month he and Buggles frontman Trevor Horn, with a 60-piece orchestra, performed the song live for the first time in decades in Frankfurt. Mr. Zimmer has been joined on tour by Nile Marr, son of The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. His light show is done by Marc Brickman, lighting designer for Pink Floyd.\u201cI\u2019m so not the rock-star type,\u201d Mr. Zimmer says. \u201cI\u2019ve surrounded myself with people who really know how to do it.\u201don film: Tyler\u2019s scores include \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me\u201don stage: Gives wild electronica concerts as his alter-ego \u201cMadsonik.\u201d In Krakow, Poland, Mr. Tyler recently conducted a symphony orchestra, playing his film compositions.

The fund forecasts that China will grow 6.7% this year and expand by 6.4% on average between 2018 and 2020.The National Bureau of Statistics reported Wednesday that industrial output, a rough proxy for economic growth, rose 6.5% in May from a year earlier, matching April\u2019s pace, that retail sales also held steady at double-digit growth rates while fixed-asset investment decelerated modestly.China\u2019s bid to gradually adjust to slightly lower growth has been helped by a still-robust property market, solid consumption and trade, while factory inflation, industrial output and industrial profits have weakened.\u201dThe economy at this moment is relatively stable,\u201d said Macquarie Group Ltd. economist       Larry Hu.       \u201cBut I think it will slow in the third quarter, causing policy makers to shift their focus to growth from financial restructuring.\u201dBeijing has sought in recent months to stem financial excess and real estate speculation without undercutting growth, a key priority in advance of a Communist Party congress this fall when top leaders are chosen in a meeting held once every five years, economists said.Some companies on the front lines are already feeling a chill. Lower steel prices have cut into profits and squeezed cash flow, according to the state-owned Baogang Group, based in the northern city of Baotou. The company also faces something of a dilemma, said company director Hao Zhizhong: While the central government wants steel companies to limit overcapacity, local governments want firms to help spur economic growth.\u201dIf prices drop too much, we can end up losing money on every ton we produce,\u201d Mr. Hao said.Short-term interest rates have increased recently and economists are watching to see how Beijing responds to an expected Federal Reserve decision Wednesday to raise U.S. interest rates, which could prompt China to follow suit to stem capital outflows.In a rare statement accompanying data showing new lending rose slightly in May from April, the People\u2019s Bank of China said measures to reduce debt is having a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on risk even as sufficient bank lending flows to the real economy. It said total social financing, which includes shadow lending, fell to 1.06 trillion yuan [$155.9 billion] last month, down from 1.39 trillion in April.In a bid to boost private investment and reduce companies\u2019 financial burden, Beijing last week announced a reduction in corporate fees and some taxes, but economists say China continues to heavily favor state-owned firms. In its latest survey, the World Bank ranked China 78th of 183 economies in its ease-of-doing-business index, behind Tunisia.Economists warn that tighter property restrictions in coming months could put a chill on housing purchases and also blunt spending on furniture and house renovations.Property investment and sales decelerated modestly in the first five months of 2017 compared with the January-April period.Economists expect investment to slow in the coming months as aggressive public infrastructure spending decelerates, the property market weakens and financing costs rise. Government spending ebbed in May. \u201cWith a relatively stable economy, it makes no sense for policy makers to waste their ammunition now,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Liu Aihua,        a spokeswoman with the statistics bureau, said quality is more important than quantity in assessing China\u2019s investment data, which remains quite stable.\u2014Pei Li and Liyan Qi contributed to this article.Write to Mark Magnier at mark.magnier@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 11:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-industrial-output-growth-holds-steady-in-may-1497411930", "news_title": "China\u2019s Economic-Growth Revamp May Be Working", "keywords": "china economy, china growth,china housing sales,china industrial output,china industrial production, china markets,china money supply,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,money supply,industrial production,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Steve Bolze,        once a top candidate to be the next chief executive of General Electric Co., is retiring from the company after not getting the top job.The head of GE\u2019s Power business is the first high-profile executive to exit after the company disclosed Monday that       John Flannery,        the head of GE Healthcare, will succeed Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt       on Aug. 1.Like Mr. Flannery, Mr. Bolze is a GE lifer and he told employees Wednesday that he had agreed to step aside if he didn\u2019t the get the top job.

He didn\u2019t disclose what he would do next and couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.The Boston-based company\u2019s succession planning process was narrowed to four internal candidates in 2015: Mr. Flannery, Mr. Bolze, finance chief       Jeff Bornstein,        and       Lorenzo Simonelli,        head of the oil and gas business.All four candidates had briefed the GE board at a meeting in May on their plans for running the conglomerate if they got the job, people familiar with the matter said. The board selected Mr. Flannery at a meeting last Friday, which has raised questions about the future role of several senior GE executives.On Monday, Mr. Immelt said he hoped the transition would be smoother than when he took the top job and several other top contenders, including       Robert Nardelli       and James McNerney, left to run other businesses. The company gave Mr. Bornstein, who will continue to serve as finance chief, a special stock award and named him a vice chairman, but otherwise didn\u2019t disclose retention awards for senior leaders. Mr. Simonelli will run GE\u2019s oil and gas business, which is being merged with         Baker Hughes Inc.Mr. Immelt said he had prepared for potential departures among his lieutenants by grooming potential replacements. \u201cIn the last four or five years we have really filled in the next generation jobs in the company,\u201d he said in an interview Monday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really about four people but about 20 or 30 people at the top to get people positioned.\u201d\u201cI think we have done a great job of getting the next generation team in place,\u201d he said.Russell Stokes,        CEO of GE Energy Connections, will be the next leader of GE Power, which makes and services massive turbines used to produce electricity in power plants. It became the company\u2019s biggest division after the merger with             Alstom SA\u2019s       power business.A 20-year GE veteran, Mr. Stokes, 45, has led the Energy Connections unit for the last 18 months and was previously head of GE Transportation.

Symphony concert? Very white. Math fair in Southern California? Many Hispanic and Asian people. Art school? Very diverse but with particularly many Asian people.After the Women\u2019s March in January some people celebrated how \u201cdiverse\u201d the movement was while other people lamented how white it was. What was the disagreement? Were there different demographics in different places, were people seeing only what they chose to see, or do people simply have different baselines for what counts as diverse?There is a mathematical theory of diversity that can help us to make this buzzword more precise. Ecologists study diversity of ecosystems by taking a sample area and counting how many creatures of each species they find. There are then various ways to quantify the diversity.One is simply to count how many species are present. This is called species richness. Another compares how abundant each species is. If an area is dominated by rabbits, but there is also one hedgehog, this is different from an area with equal numbers of rabbits and hedgehogs. This notion of diversity is called species evenness. An even more nuanced measure of diversity takes into account how related the species are, so that a slug and a snail will yield less diversity than a slug and a rabbit.For many observers of the Women\u2019s March, diversity involved counting how many different races were simply present (ignoring, of course, the thorny question of what counts as a different race). By that measure, the march was quite diverse.Diversity as evenness, by contrast, would consider the abundance of people of different races. The march would count as less diverse if there were only small numbers of minority races present, even if many different races of people were there. Imagine a city with 1,000 steak houses, plus just one each of Italian, French and Thai restaurants. The dining options would feel much more varied if there were 250 of each type of restaurant. That is the difference between species richness and species evenness.Another interesting measure takes segregation into account. This could be measured by the probability that any individual was standing next to a person of a different race. If there was just one pocket of nonwhite people in a white crowd, that would register as less diverse than if those same nonwhite people were spread throughout the crowd.Another question is whether we are measuring diversity relative to some standard. We might instinctively measure it relative to the diversity we generally see around us. So if you live your whole life in a city with only one Italian restaurant out of 1,000, you might be very pleasantly surprised to visit a city with 10.What if we measure the diversity of a group relative to the overall population? This is the question of whether the group is representative, a measure related to diversity but different from it.In the 2015 census, 62% of the U.S. population was white, 17% Hispanic or Latino, 13% African-American, 6% Asian-American and 1% American Indian and Alaska Native. A gathering would be more diverse in terms of evenness if it had equal numbers from all those groups of people, but it would not be representative of the general population.We can use these same measures to examine the U.S. Congress. Neither the Senate nor the House is very diverse in terms of evenness, but the House fares better if we look at how representative it is.A more interesting statistic is the rate of change. The racial composition of first-term members of Congress is quite representative of the overall population.

But any sign of unanticipated hawkishness and gold could take a big knock, some analysts say,The gold price tends to fall when rates go up because it becomes less competitive\u00a0against yield-bearing assets and because U.S. increases boosts the dollar, which makes the greenback-denominated commodity more expensive for most buyers.If the U.S. central bank raises\u00a0rates\u00a0as expected, Fed funds futures are only pricing in two more rate increases until the end of next year, according to\u00a0      Carsten\u00a0Menke,        a\u00a0commodities analyst at\u00a0Julius Baer.\u201cIf the rhetoric is hawkish, then that will support the dollar and have an impact on treasury yields,\u201d said Xiao Fu, an analyst at BOCI Global Commodities. \u201cThat, in turn, will have a lead on impact on gold.\u201dA hint at any more than two additional rate increases before the end of 2018, could see gold slump to $1,200 a troy ounce -- which would be a nearly 5% fall and lows not seen since the middle of March, Mr. Menke said.Gold has benefited as U.S. political uncertainty has put pressure on the dollar and sent investors into gold, which is also a traditional safe-haven.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, has fallen more than 5% year-to-date.Even if the effect of a Fed rate raise is small, it could combine with other factors and catalyze\u00a0a sell off.\u201cThe summer season tends to see gold slightly soften, with a lack of festivals in India and China and slower period of demand in the Muslim parts of the world,\u201d said       James Moore,        an analyst at FastMarkets.\u201cThis early-summer softness could coincide with hawkish language from the Fed to take gold as low as $1230 an ounce [a 3% drop],\u201d Mr. Moore said.The price of gold was up 0.62% at $1,273.88 a troy ounce in early afternoon trade in London.Write to David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 11:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hawkish-fed-tone-could-take-nugget-from-gold-price-1497453541", "news_title": "A Hawkish Fed Tone Could Take Nugget From Gold Price ", "keywords": " fed, gold,gold price, interest rates, safe haven,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,commodity markets,metals markets,gold markets,commodity,financial market news,precious metals markets"}, {"content": "We live in a random universe where order tends to fall apart and stable structures (say, a planet) are relatively few and far between. Cast into this entropy, our brains spontaneously try to impose structure\u2014or, as a charming recent paper reports, look for a beat in the cacophony of it all.All cultures have music that is rhythmic, and these rhythms show universal properties, as summarized in 2011 by Steven Brown and Joseph Jordania in the journal Psychology of Music. Wherever you go in the world, rhythmic music has regularly spaced beats, emphasizes some beats over others (for example, \u201cdownbeats\u201d in Western music) and contains two- and three-beat motifs (like marches and waltzes, respectively). Another commonality is that the time intervals between beats tend to be multiples of 200 milliseconds. From a marching band in Peoria to a tribal drummer in the tropics, these patterns keep popping up.Does the human brain automatically generate them?       Andrea Ravignani       of Belgium\u2019s Free University Brusseland colleagues tackled this question in a study published late last year in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The authors used a computer to create 32 rhythmic patterns that sounded like a snare drum. Each consisted of 12 beats, averaging about five seconds long. Crucially, the spacing between beats and strength of each one were totally random.The authors then allowed these random rhythms to \u201cevolve\u201d experimentally with 48 student volunteers from the University of Edinburgh, divided into six chains. In each chain, the first subject listened to one of these random patterns and tried to repeat it as accurately as possible on an electronic drum pad. His recorded imitations were played for subject No. 2, who tried to repeat them. The second subject\u2019s recorded imitations went to the third subject for imitation\u2014all the way until subject No. 8.A perfect chain of imitations would mean that No. 8\u2019s drumming pattern would be identical to the original one. But rhythms drifted with each repetition. If such drift was random, the rhythm patterns of each subject No. 8 would have differed randomly from each subject No. 1. But instead, with each round of attempted repetition, the imitator imposed more structure\u2014until, by the eighth generation, subjects produced patterns that conformed to the universals of rhythmicity that I described.These patterns were structured. The first eight beats predicted the rest. Beats were regularly spaced and contained two- or three-beat motifs. The intervals between beats were statistically likely to be around 200 or 400 milliseconds. Just like in real music.This might seem unimpressive. After all, though the subjects were nonmusicians, they undoubtedly knew rhythmic music. So maybe they were just generating familiar rhythms. But each subject\u2019s goal was to perfectly repeat what he or she had just heard. Instead, unconsciously, each participant drifted toward those universals of rhythm. This is as unlikely as an eight-person game of telephone starting with random strings of nonsense syllables and always producing, by the eighth generation, a sentence mentioning both the Alamo and strawberry Pop-Tarts.This isn\u2019t the only instance of universal structure emerging from the complexity of our brains. Take the evolution of language. Linguistic history has shown that people speaking a hodgepodge of languages (for example, West African slaves in the Americas) soon create simple pidgin communication systems built from fragments of the individual languages. But their children then evolve the pidgins into creole languages that are grammatically similar world-wide, as       Derek Bickerton       of the University of Hawaii and others have shown.Our brains are the universe\u2019s supreme anti-entropy machines. From \u201ctell me what you see in this inkblot\u201d to perceiving scatterings of stars as a centaur or winged horse, we turn randomness into patterns.

His sled passed under a moving car and shot out the other side safely, but the car\u2019s underside sheared his scalp. He needed 100 stitches. That\u2019s when I realized life can be taken away in the blink of an eye.I grew up in Newburgh, N.Y., in the 1950s and early \u201960s. My grandparents had built a small restaurant and, behind it, a house and two cottages. My family first lived in one of the cottages\u2014two parents and three kids in two small bedrooms.I loved walking in the woods and making up adventure stories about Indians\u2014no cowboys. We lived there until I was 6. Then we moved into another tiny two-bedroom house\u2014the kind you wouldn\u2019t notice driving by.My father, Charles, had grown up in Newburgh\u2019s poorhouse. His mother was a charwoman, and for cleaning bathrooms there, she and my father were given a single room. He was naturally smart and went on to attend Hamilton College on a scholarship.My father never knew his dad, so he wasn\u2019t fully aware of his role as a parent. The guy tended to be emotionally cautious and withholding. The only time I remember him giving me a hug was on his deathbed.My maternal grandparents assumed a parental role. \u201cYou won\u2019t play in the NBA,\u201d my grandmother told me, \u201cbut you can achieve other things you want to do.\u201dMy grandfather was similarly encouraging. Before he built his restaurant, he drove a delivery truck. Once a week in the summer, I\u2019d accompany him.As we drove over Storm King Mountain on our way to West Point, he\u2019d sing in his horrendous voice. He said, \u201cWhatever you do in life, make sure you\u2019re singing when you go over the mountain to work in the morning.\u201d I still do.My Newburgh neighborhood was a combination of African-American children, farm kids and the offspring of military families stationed at nearby Stewart Air Force Base. That was a sad thing for me. I lost many close friends when they moved away to other Air Force bases.When I was 11, my father gave up driving a bread truck to sell insurance. We moved into a two-story house on North Street that was built in the 1930s and overlooked the Hudson River. I loved the view.My mother, Isabelle, taught in the local Catholic school that I attended, and I served Mass each day. Because I was a teacher\u2019s kid, an altar boy and first in my class, I tended to be bullied. One kid slapped me around two or three times a week.I asked my father to teach me to box, but he said, \u201cJust stand up for yourself.\u201d So the next time I was roughed up, I threw as many slaps and punches as I could. Many landed, and the kid didn\u2019t bother me again.During my senior year in high school, my father received a promotion at the insurance company to run its office in Belmont, Mass. He wanted me to finish high school in Newburgh first and to go on to college.Right after my senior year, I tried selling encyclopedias but quit after a day. I learned the tricks to get people to buy them, but I couldn\u2019t knock on doors and shame strangers into spending money they didn\u2019t have.Instead, I landed a job as an aide at a psychiatric hospital in Belmont.

Walter Thompson in New York. He was a friend of a friend. I also brought along two short stories. He read one of them during our meeting and hired me as a junior copywriter.I first lived in New York\u2019s Washington Jefferson hotel on West 51st Street, which had a bright red cross outside my window that blinked all night. The wallpaper had little pendants. Someone had drawn an \u201cX\u201d in every one of them. I had to get out of there.Within a few years, when I was 34, I became the agency\u2019s creative director. One of the lines I came up with was \u201cI\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Kid.\u201d Then in 1984, I became CEO of the agency\u2019s U.S. operations.While working there in 1976, I sold my first book, \u201cThe       Thomas Berryman       Number,\u201d to Little, Brown. I left Thompson in 1996 to write full time.The big turning point in my writing career was the Alex Cross character I created for \u201cAlong Came a Spider.\u201d It convinced Larry Kirshbaum, the head of Time Warner Books, the owner of Little, Brown, to make me a two-book deal.

Now father and son are business partners, with Mr. Bapis based primarily in New York City and his father based in Utah.His practice: A Barron\u2019s top-ranked adviser, Mr. Bapis manages about $1 billion in client assets. He and his team specialize in working with athletes, as well as actors and other entertainers. Mr. Bapis says the focus on athletes evolved out of some older friendships going back to his college days, as well as his own interest in helping younger high-income individuals preserve assets.On managing money requests: \u201cIt intrigues me how many people start pulling at a person as soon as they become wealthy,\u201d Mr. Bapis says. The increase in requests for money from friends, family and others makes it important for a successful athlete to have an adviser they can trust to help manage each request properly. To build that trust, Mr. Bapis suggests advisers not be star-struck and resist the urge to talk too much with clients about their public careers. Instead, he suggests focusing on conversations about investing and how you\u2019ll help protect their assets.On planning between contracts: Aside from his clients\u2019 high profiles, Mr. Bapis says that inconsistent income distinguishes them from other high-net-worth individuals. An actor might sign a huge new contract but not get paid for two years while they film the movie, he says. In cases like these, the task for advisers is helping clients spend wisely and make savings last between gigs. \u201cWe\u2019ll build a plan for the duration of the contract,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, when they get the next contract or endorsement deal, we\u2019ll build a new plan. With each phase comes a different investing structure.\u201dFlipping the risk timeline: Conventional wisdom holds that younger clients with more time for their assets to grow should take on more risk. But for many of Mr. Bapis\u2019s clients, the opposite is true. \u201cWe start them out on a very conservative risk profile, then move moderate,\u201d he says. That\u2019s because unlike a traditional salary, compensation for young athletes and entertainers often arrives in a lump sum. So rather than promoting risk-heavy investments to tap long-term growth, advisers should focus on helping these clients preserve large balances and adopt healthy planning and saving habits, he says.On the biggest industry challenge: Mr. Bapis believes the biggest challenge facing advisers is the rapid change brought on by technological advances. \u201cPeople now access information at a much faster rate,\u201d he says. \u201cSo advisers need to maintain customer-centric service models and ensure clients they\u2019ll achieve long-term financial security despite the disruptive threats technology can create.\u201d\u2014Compiled by Jacob Meade", "news_time": "2017-06-14 10:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/preserving-assets-for-athletes-1497450601", "news_title": "Preserving Assets for Athletes", "keywords": "Michael N.

NRG proposed last month to place GenOn under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.NRG purchased GenOn in 2012 for $1.7 billion in stock.Creditors of GenOn have lobbed allegations over the past year that NRG has treated the unit like a piggy bank, siphoning cash away from creditors under a services agreement the benefit of shareholders.A noteholder group sued NRG in December, accusing the Princeton, N.J.-based parent of plundering GenOn\u2019s assets since 2013. Owners of two Maryland power generation plants that lease the facilities to another GenOn unit sued NRG last week, saying the sponsor had raided restricted sources of cash to finance a favorable bankruptcy settlement.GenOn\u2019s proposed chapter 11 plan would release NRG from liability in exchange for a $261.3 million cash payment\u2014up from a previous $243 million offer\u2014while placing control of GenOn in the hands of its creditors, according to a Wednesday securities filing.The plan\u2019s sponsor also agreed to provide a $330 million cash-funded letter of credit to support GenOn\u2019s cash needs while under bankruptcy protection.Holders of 93% of GenOn\u2019s unsecured notes support the restructuring framework, the company said.But the proposal doesn\u2019t cover creditors of GenOn Mid-Atlantic LLC, which owes $935 million under lease contracts covering its Morgantown and Dickerson plants. These are long-term leveraged leases in which the owners charge rent as the lessor.The lessors have accused NRG of raiding GenOn for years, including a $320 million cash payment they say was upstreamed to the sponsor\u2019s shareholders in 2014.The company listed assets of $2.44 billion and debts of $2.1 billion in its petition filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. GenOn\u2019s collapse into bankruptcy follows similar financial pressures at other power generators including             FirstEnergy Corp.       and ExGen Texas Power LLC that sell electricity to utilities.The company has hired the firms of Kirkland & Ellis, King & Spalding, Rothschild Inc., McKinsey RTS and PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP to advise it on its restructuring.

GM 0.11%       will extend the typical summer shutdown at certain U.S. factories to deal with slumping sales and bloated inventory, a sign the industry\u2019s hot streak is grinding to a halt.The No. 1 U.S. auto maker in terms of sales will idle its Chevrolet Malibu factory near Kansas City, Kan., for five weeks starting in late June,       Vicky Hale,        president of the United Auto Workers Local 31, said. Job cuts will be needed if GM is forced to slow production after the summer shutdown.Additional downtime is also slated for a small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, that has already experienced deep layoffs amid a pullback in demand for passenger cars. A GM spokesman declined to comment on specific plans.Auto makers traditionally schedule two-week factory breaks in midsummer, often to prepare for model changeovers. Car sales, however, are decelerating after a seven-year run, and most major car companies have responded by curtailing output ahead of summer months that usually are the busiest for the industry.Ford Motor Co.       has announced production slowdowns at certain plants. While Ford\u2019s trucks are selling at a brisk pace, its sedans are accumulating at dealers as gasoline prices remain low.GM enters the summer with a glut of unsold inventory after running production lines at relatively high rates to prepare for factory downtime related to plant upgrades. WardsAuto.com estimates GM\u2019s production increased 2.9% over the first four months of 2017, even as the broader industry pulled back.As a result, GM\u2019s inventory at the end of May was almost 44% higher than a year earlier. It has nearly 1 million vehicles sitting on dealer lots, WardsAuto.com estimates, representing 101 days\u2019 worth of supply, or 23.4% of total industry stock.GM\u2019s holds about 17% market share. It is emerging from a tough May when Ford\u2014traditionally the No. 2 seller\u2014took a rare lead in the overall market due to its strong truck sales and a jump in fleet sales.Workers at GM\u2019s car plants, including the 2,850 employees at the Malibu plant near Kansas City, are feeling the brunt of the pain. GM earlier this year cut thousands of jobs to counter falling sales of family sedans and smaller cars.The Lordstown plant, which cut a work shift earlier this year, will close for three weeks in July to curb Chevy Cruze production, said       Robert Morales,        president of a United Auto Workers local that represents some Lordstown factory workers.A preference for trucks is only part of the industry\u2019s passenger-car problem.People are now returning increasing numbers of sedans to dealerships as leases expire. That has created ample supply of cheap, late-model used cars, making new cars even tougher to sell.Tommy Brasher, a Chevy dealer in Weimar, Texas, said his Malibu inventory is \u201ca little heavy\u201d and business has slowed across the board in recent months.\u201cWe just haven\u2019t been seeing much foot traffic or internet traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cApril was slow, May was worse and June started the same.\u201dWall Street analysts say concerns about the market have weighed on GM\u2019s stock price, as investors study how the auto maker weathers the next downturn. RBC Capital estimates GM could slash up to $1 billion in annual labor costs if U.S. sales were to slip 20%.GM executives expect an uptick in the second half of 2017, and as recently as April said industry sales in the U.S. will match the record 17.5 million light vehicles sold in 2016.The auto maker, however, has said more flexible union contracts signed over the last decade give it more wiggle room. Nearly one-third of GM\u2019s U.S. hourly workforce, for instance, can be let go at relatively little cost.In the past, \u201cthe manufacturing cost was very sticky,\u201d GM Chief Financial Officer       Chuck Stevens       told analysts in April. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case now.\u201dGM built up stocks of pickup trucks and some crossover SUVs in the first half of the year ahead of some factory closures in the second half to prepare for new models.Factory downtime will dent third-quarter results. Weak sedan sales could add further pressure.GM had expected to boost profitability by offering improved versions of the Malibu and Cruze, which have received accolades from automotive critics since rolling out over the last 18 months.

He hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing.Podemos\u2019s focus on alleged kickbacks has resonated in Spain, where corruption has been a top public concern for several years. Spaniards named corruption as the second greatest problem facing the country after unemployment in an April survey by Spain\u2019s Center for Sociology Research.As corruption investigations and trials of Popular Party members have gathered steam, voter support for the party fell to 26% by the beginning of June from 33% in January, according to Madrid-based pollster Metroscopia. Support for the Socialists stood at 22.8%, with Podemos and its allies at 19.2%.In the same survey, 51% of Spaniards said they disapproved of the no-confidence vote against Mr. Rajoy, while 46% supported it.Mr. Rajoy said on Tuesday that Podemos leaders knew the no confidence vote would likely fail and were instead staging a political spectacle.More than 15 hours of verbal volleys between Mr. Rajoy and Podemos leaders and other lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday exemplified the political hurdles Mr. Rajoy faces at the helm of a minority government.His center-right party was able to pass Spain\u2019s 2017 budget in the lower house of parliament at the end of May, but lawmakers and political analysts think that hard-won achievement won\u2019t be easy to repeat. That is because Mr. Rajoy had to cobble together support from several different parties, some of whom don\u2019t want to be viewed by the public as go-to allies of the prime minister.That means Spain is unlikely to make major legislative changes, such as addressing problems in labor market policy, which European and international institutions say would help the country boost growth and bring down its 19% unemployment rate.Mr. Rajoy also accused Podemos leaders of political opportunism against the Socialist party, which is trying to rebuild itself after a painful internal power struggle. Podemos and the Socialists are vying to be the pre-eminent left-wing opposition party and analysts say the no-confidence vote was in part a bid by Podemos to show it is willing to take to task Mr. Rajoy, who is highly unpopular among leftist voters.The no-confidence vote was Spain\u2019s third since the country returned to democracy in the late 1970s after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. The other two attempts also failed.Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 09:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spains-prime-minister-survives-confidence-vote-but-under-fire-over-corruption-claims-1497446861", "news_title": "Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Survives Confidence Vote but Under Fire Over Party Corruption Claims  ", "keywords": " mariano rajoy, pablos inglesias, podemos party,spain non-confidence vote, spain popular party,Popular Party,Mariano Rajoy,Irene Montero,Pablo Iglesias,euro zone,currency,economic news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Five months into President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the federal agency that referees disputes between unions and business is still controlled by Democrats, complicating the White House\u2019s effort to roll back government oversight of the labor market.National Labor Relations Board decisions during President       Barack Obama\u2019s       tenure resulted in some big victories for labor, including an easier path for employees at franchise businesses and contractors to join unions. The board\u2019s position in the months ahead will shape how far these efforts go, with big implications for chains like             McDonald\u2019s                   and others.With two of the board\u2019s five seats vacant since August 2016, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to flip the board controlled by two Democrats into Republicans\u2019 favor. The president may make nominations as soon as this week as part of a focus on labor policy, but Senate confirmation might not occur until well into the fall.Mr. Trump has elevated the sole Republican,       Philip Miscimarra,        to chairman. That move slowed issuance of agency decisions, since he can control which cases are decided but lacks the votes to win rulings.The board \u201cfunctions best with a full complement of five Board members, and I hope that our two existing vacancies will be filled as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Miscimarra said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cMy primary focus is to facilitate the board\u2019s timely resolution of our cases, and to support the agency generally. This will be enhanced when we return to having five confirmed Board members.\u201dThe White House is considering William Emanuel, an attorney representing employers at the Littler Mendelson law firm, and Marvin Kaplan, counsel at the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, according to people familiar with the vetting process.Mr. Emanuel has a background similar to the chairman\u2019s; both spent much of their careers at major law firms representing large companies in employment-law cases. Mr. Kaplan previously was \u200bpolicy \u200bcounsel\u200b to the \u200bHouse Education and the Workforce \u200bCommittee.Mr. Emanuel declined to comment through his firm. Mr. Kaplan didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A White House spokesman said the administration doesn\u2019t comment on personnel matters.Through the first five months of this year, the board has decided about 40% fewer cases compared with the same period in 2016. This year, it hasn\u2019t issued any \u201cnotable decisions,\u201d the designation given to cases that are of broad interest to employers and unions. Last year, 10 such decisions were issued before June.\u201cThe delays are concerning,\u201d said Robert Cresanti, president of the International Franchise Association trade group. Uncertainty about how the board could rule in future cases is keeping firms from expanding and leaving it unclear how much involvement a franchise can have in its franchisee\u2019s employment policies, Mr. Cresanti said.Cases decided before the board don\u2019t in themselves set precedent, but that \u200bcan change if rulings are challenged in federal court. NLRB decisions also guide businesses and unions on how the board could rule in future cases.Filling out the board has been a politically fraught process in the past. The board had only two members from January 2008 until March 2010, meaning President Barack Obama didn\u2019t have a body controlled by Democrats until more than a year after he took office. President       George W. Bush       didn\u2019t see the board turn to Republicans\u2019 favor until January 2002, a year after his inauguration. President       Bill Clinton       faced a similar wait for a return to a Democratic majority.For each of the three prior administrations, the board was split for at least a portion of the time.Business groups such as the franchise association and Chamber of Commerce say they are anxious to have the board take another at look organizing rules revised in recent years\u2014and to find a case that would overturn a ruling that made it easier for contract workers and employees of franchises to collectively bargain.The board in 2015 found that contract workers at a recycling facility had the right to bargain with the company that owned their facility, Browning-Ferris Industries, not just the local contractor that paid them.Franchise businesses are concerned the case opened the door to the determination that employees of franchised locations\u2014like McDonald\u2019s restaurant\u2014could bargain with the parent brand.A case involving McDonald\u2019s is in the board\u2019s pipeline, still pending before an administrative law judge. Based on the judge\u2019s ruling, that case would likely be elevated to the full board.The board\u2019s general counsel, a Democrat in place until November, has sway over which cases are allowed to proceed to administrative judges.Kristie Arslan, owner of the Popped Republic popcorn shop in Alexandria, Va., said she decided not to expand her brand through franchises after learning about the board\u2019s joint-employment ruling.It could make her legally liable for employees of her franchisees. She now lobbies on behalf of small businesses against such policies.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to take the slow-and-steady approach even though franchising could help us grow much quicker,\u201d she said. \u201cRegulation is holding back small-business growth.\u201dSome say that businesses are overstating the reach of recent board decisions.Craig Becker, general counsel at the AFL-CIO labor federation, said major rulings during the Obama administration were mostly about interpreting a 1930\u2019s law in the context of the modern work force.That included looking at rules around use of employer email systems and how bargaining applies to a modern workforce that makes greater use of contract labor. Mr. Becker, a Democrat, served on the board from 2010 to 2012.\u201cAttempting to reverse everything that has been done, doesn\u2019t advance the agency\u2019s mission,\u201d he said. \"The board should figure out how the law is best applied going forward.\"", "news_time": "2017-06-14 09:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-labor-trump-remains-outmanned-by-democrats-1497445380", "news_title": "On Labor, Trump Remains Outmanned by Democrats ", "keywords": "collective bargaining,fast food workers,labor board,labor relations,labor unions,national labor relations board,nlrb,unions,McDonald's,MCD,National Labor Relations Board,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Don\u2019t look now, but Japan\u2019s central bank is slowing its vast bond-buying exercise.The Bank of Japan bought just \u00a57.89 trillion ($71.6 billion) worth of Japanese government debt last month, according to             J.P. Morgan.       While that sounds like a lot, it is the least outright buying\u2014not accounting for maturing bonds\u2014since October 2014, when the central bank surprised markets by saying it would increase its asset purchases.The latest figure raises a question: Is the BOJ trying to rein in its ultraloose policies by stealth?Certainly, the decrease highlights the contradictions in the central bank\u2019s current approach. The main reason it is buying fewer bonds is its \u201cyield curve control\u201d policy, which aims to keep the yield on 10-year government bonds at zero. This implies it can buy fewer bonds when the yield is close to that target. Wednesday, the yield was at 0.06%. Bond yields fall when their prices rise.The central bank has kept in place its target of increasing bond holdings each year by \u201cabout\u201d \u00a580 trillion\u2014a net figure, meaning taking into account maturing bonds. At the current rate of buying, though, the holdings are set to rise this year by only about \u00a555 trillion, based on the J.P. Morgan data.The central bank is \u201ctechnically tapering,\u201d said       Hiroshi Shiraishi,        senior economist at             BNP Paribas                   in Tokyo.BOJ Gov.       Haruhiko Kuroda       has acknowledged the slowdown, but has been quick to declare this doesn\u2019t signal a retreat from easy-money policies.\u201cAt this stage, we are not exiting,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council meeting in Tokyo on May 16.The BOJ wariness at heralding an exit is understandable, given the country\u2019s still-fragile economic position. Central banks buy government bonds to pump money into the economy, which should in turn fuel inflation. But while Japan\u2019s economy is on its longest run of growth since 2006, core inflation is rising at a rate of just 0.3%, with wage growth proving stubbornly low.Central bankers around the world have been cautious about discussing an end to easy-money policies, for fear of a disorderly market reaction. When the Federal Reserve indicated in 2013 that it was getting ready to wind down its bond-buying program, U.S. stocks, Treasurys and emerging-market assets swung wildly in an episode now called the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201dAnalysts expect the BOJ to reiterate its \u00a580 trillion target in its next monetary-policy decision, due Friday. Sticking to guidance can help limit market shocks by making it clear the central bank is prepared to buy government bonds heavily if there is an economic meltdown, said BOJ policy board member       Yutaka Harada,        an advocate of reflationary policies, at a recent news conference.The Bank of Japan faces some practical limits, notably that it already owns 43% of all Japanese government bonds, Capital Economics estimates, and could run out of bonds to buy eventually.The inflation outlook is the crucial factor in determining the central bank\u2019s pace. The yen\u2019s strength this year\u2014up 6.1% against the dollar\u2014and a drop in oil prices make it less likely the BOJ\u2019s bond purchases will continue to slow near-term. When Japanese consumer prices rose for the first time in more than a year in January, costlier oil was a major reason.\u201cThe dollar-yen outlook and oil price both suggest the BOJ should stop tapering,\u201d said       Tadashi Matsukawa,        head of fixed income at PineBridge Investments in Tokyo, adding that he\u2019s buying long-dated Japanese government bonds.Write to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com and Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'Quietly, BOJ Is Purchasing Fewer Bonds.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 09:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shhhthe-bank-of-japan-is-buying-fewer-bonds-1497445342", "news_title": "Shhh\u2026The Bank of Japan Is Buying Fewer Bonds ", "keywords": "boj,boj bond-buying,boj easy money,boj policy,boj stimulus,bond-buying,easy money,monetary stimulus,taper,Bank of Japan,Haruhiko Kuroda,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news"}, {"content": "The consumer group Public Citizen said it has found new, \u201cserious ethical lapses\u201d in a premature-infant study that it contends should lead a federal medical-research watchdog agency to expand an investigation into the research.Public Citizen said it has unearthed documents showing that oxygen-measurement instruments used in the baby study gave inaccurate readings, which could have harmed the babies. The group called for the federal Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) to look into the matter.The move is the latest in a four-year battle over the conduct of the clinical trial, called SUPPORT, that began a decade ago. The research looked at how much oxygen is optimal for premature infants. It was known that too much oxygen could lead to a type of blindness, and that too little could result in death.The study was conducted at a wide range of mostly U.S. hospitals and was funded by the National Institutes of Health. SUPPORT stands for Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Oxygenation Randomized Trial.The SUPPORT study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, concluded that a relatively low level of oxygen given to the infants \u201cincreased mortality while substantially decreasing severe retinopathy,\u201d which can lead to blindness. The children were followed for years until recently.In 2013, OHRP concluded that leading universities didn\u2019t adequately inform parents of the risks of the research. Public Citizen has been questioning the ethics of the study since 2013, and filed suit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeking documents relevant to the research.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.OHRP, which is part of HHS, said it has put on hold any actions against investigators in the study.Public Citizen said that in litigation against the federal Department of Health and Human Services, it obtained emails showing that researchers were aware that oxygen-measuring equipment was getting inaccurate readings.

That means households, on average, owed 1.67 Canadian dollars ($1.26) for every dollar of after-tax income earned.National net worth\u2014which combines the value of nonfinancial assets with Canada\u2019s net foreign asset position\u2014climbed 2.6% in the quarter on an unadjusted basis, to C$10.51 trillion, on the strength of higher house and commodity prices. On a per capita basis, Canadian net worth rose to C$287,000 in the first quarter from C$280,600 in the final three months of 2016.With Canada\u2019s national-balance sheet data, the focus tends to largely be on household-debt readings. The Bank of Canada said last week rising household debt and frothy real-estate markets remain the top concerns for financial stability in the country, with conditions exacerbated in the past six months by significant house-price gains in Toronto and the surrounding area.The central bank, in its financial-stability review, said borrowing\u2014the bulk in mortgages and drawdowns on home-equity lines of credit\u2014has climbed at a roughly 6% pace from a year ago in recent months, or well above wage gains.Research from             Royal Bank of Canada                   suggests interest payments for consumer credit\u2014in the form of lines of credit and auto loans\u2014are equal to the total interest paid on mortgages. Because this debt tends to be tied to variable rates, any increase in interest rates could leave households exposed, RBC said. In recent days, the Bank of Canada has signaled it is prepared to raise rates on stronger and broader economic activity, with Gov.       Stephen Poloz       saying rate cuts it delivered in 2015 amid the oil-price shock \u201chave done their work.\u201dThe overnight-index swap market is now pricing in a greater than 60% likelihood of a Bank of Canada rate increase in October, according to TD Securities.The RBC research also indicated one-third of Canadian households are debt free and 25% owed less than C$25,000. Mortgage delinquencies are also low, at 0.32% as of the end of the first quarter.On a seasonally-adjusted basis, households in the first quarter borrowed C$27.47 billion, down from C$27.62 billion in the previous three-month period.On an unadjusted basis, the data agency said the ratio of total household credit-market debt to gross domestic product fell to 99.5% in the first quarter from 100% in the previous quarter. Total household-credit market debt reached C$2.04 trillion as of March 31, and mortgages made up nearly two thirds of all borrowing.The data agency noted the first quarter marked the first time since it first began collecting these figures that the portion households spend on mortgage principal payments exceeded mortgage-interest payments. This is due to the prevalence of historically low interest rates since 2008, or when the financial crisis hit the global economy.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 08:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-household-debt-dips-in-first-quarter-1497445121", "news_title": "Canadian Household Debt Dips in First Quarter ", "keywords": " bank of canada,canada, canadian household debt, household debt, national net worth, statistics canada,Statistics Canada,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,government finance,government borrowing,economic news"}, {"content": "Saudi Arabia is slashing its U.S. oil exports to a nearly three-decade low for this time of the year, intensifying its efforts to reduce a global supply glut that has been pummeling crude prices.State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. expects sales to the U.S. will drop below 1 million barrels a day in June, then slide to about 850,000 barrels a day in July, according to people familiar with the matter. The July figure would be its lowest export total to the U.S. for that month since 1988, based on figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Saudi Aramco expects its August exports to the U.S. to decline by another 100,000 barrels a day, these people said, which would be the lowest export amount for that month since 2009.The shift comes as crude markets test some of their lowest prices of the year. Oil traders have been questioning whether Saudi Arabia and other members in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can change that. The group cut output this year in an effort to ease a longstanding glut, but U.S. companies have rushed to fill any void left by OPEC.U.S. crude prices tumbled more than 9% over the past three weeks and are down about 13.5% this year, back near where they were before OPEC\u2019s deal was first announced in November.On Tuesday, U.S. crude prices added 0.8% to $46.46 a barrel ahead of data on U.S. oil stockpiles due to be released Wednesday. Global benchmark Brent rose 0.9% to $48.72.Some say Saudi Arabia\u2019s decline in exports to the U.S. is a direct effort to ensure OPEC\u2019s cuts have the intended effect: reducing bloated inventories of oil around the world, and particularly in the U.S., that have kept prices down.Declining exports to the U.S. show that Saudi Arabia is \u201cgetting serious\u201d about addressing the supply glut, said       Jan Stuart,        global energy strategist at             Credit Suisse Group AG      . \u201cAnd what we in the markets are looking for are concrete signs they are getting serious.\u201dYet skeptics say Aramco cutting shipments to the U.S. doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the global glut is shrinking. Traders are increasingly focused on U.S. inventories, in part because data there are easier to come by than in other places. When the EIA reported an unexpected increase in U.S. oil supplies last week, prices fell more than 5%.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to hide these barrels in other parts of the world rather than sending them into the U.S.,\u201d said       Michael Tran,        commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually going to cut back on exports substantially.\u201dAnd the fall in Saudi exports could reflect a number of other factors, such as rising U.S. production, which means domestic refiners need less of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude. Saudi exports usually fall during the summer months because the kingdom requires more crude to generate electricity.Some analysts say it is unclear where the oil that would have flowed to the U.S. will end up: feeding Saudi power plants, shipped to other markets or stashed in storage tanks.But others say Saudi Arabia can\u2019t increase global exports and meet its own power needs without breaking its promise to cut output, which they say the country is unlikely to do.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if they\u2019re cutting from the U.S. and it ends up somewhere else,\u201d said       Gary Ross,        head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a forecasting and analytics unit of S&P Global Platts.Aramco has raised the prices it charges Asian customers. The company\u2019s shipments to Asia are on track to fall about 230,000 barrels a day in June and 300,000 barrels a day in July, according to a person familiar with the matter. An Aramco spokesman didn\u2019t respond to request for comment.The lack of clarity into the global supply picture, and lingering doubts among some investors about whether OPEC members are cutting as much as they say, are reasons why oil prices have been so volatile in recent months.When the cartel announced late last year that it would cut output in coordination with Russia and other major producers, many believed it would help work off the global glut relatively quickly. That briefly sent crude prices rising.But U.S. producers quickly took advantage of those higher prices, and their output has increased rapidly. Global stockpiles have come down but remain well above the levels OPEC is targeting. Even the group\u2019s announcement in May it would continue to curtail production through March failed to excite investors.The Saudi export declines could change that, some analysts said. Aramco has been raising prices to its U.S. customers as part of its effort to stop them from stockpiling so much oil in the world\u2019s most closely watched storage tanks. Earlier in June, it boosted prices for its light and medium grades by 50 cents for July shipments.Saudi Energy Minister       Khalid al-Falih       said in May exports to the U.S. would decline for three reasons: increased competition, the Saudis\u2019 need to hoard some oil for summer domestic use and the breakup of its American refining partnership with             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC. Under the breakup, Shell kept two Louisiana refineries that are now taking less Saudi crude.Even with the falling exports, Many analysts remain skeptical after years of oversupply.\u201cThe market will only believe it when they see it,\u201d said       Amrita Sen,        chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects. \u201cRight now sentiment is very bearish.

Its Georgian-style house measures about 23,000 square feet with nine bedrooms, Mr. Lowham said. Merrywood was renovated but a number of original details remain, such as elaborate plaster moldings, Mr. Lowham said.

With the annual advertising festival officially kicking off Saturday, there\u2019s not much time left to get that linen dry-cleaned and think up a witty out-of-office message before boarding your fully booked flight down to the south of France.As expected, Verizon\u2019s $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo closed Tuesday. Now Yahoo will merge with AOL to form a new content and advertising unit called Oath. I spoke to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who said Oath\u2019s strategy will be \u201cdigital brand building, where we help consumers find brands they love and we help brands find consumers.\u201d The deal has been so long in the making that I imagine there will be more specific product announcements waiting to burst out soon, as Mr. Armstrong alluded to in our interview. He also shared a fun tidbit: The \u201cOath\u201d brand was conceived internally and not by a branding agency, would you believe it. The other big, but unsurprising, news Tuesday: Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer has resigned from the company. I wonder where she\u2019ll end up next?

The ride-hailing company\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, is taking an indefinite leave of absence to grieve his mother and to \u201creflect, work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reports. His email to staff came ahead of a companywide meeting to discuss changes being made to Uber\u2019s allegedly chauvinistic culture.--An absolute howler--In that meeting, board member Arianna Huffington began discussing how one woman on a board can encourage more women to join a board. Fellow Uber board member, TPG partner David Bonderman, responded: \u201cActually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201d Mr. Bonderman resigned from the board hours after. Uber\u2019s board said it would unanimously adopt the recommendations of a law firm\u2019s report into fixing its culture. Those changes will take time, but right now, morale is on the floor, employees are leaving, and Uber\u2019s reputation is in dire need of mending. In summary, as Uber board member Bill Gurley reportedly said in the meeting, \u201cYou often hear people talk about the Wall Street Journal test.

The layoffs come less than two months after the company took itself off the block. Time Inc. isn\u2019t shy about slimming down its workforce: In 2014, it cut 500 jobs, and it laid off around 30 staffers in January of this year.

Time Inc. CEO Rich Battista said that while he is \u201cnot assuming print revenue is going to go up,\u201d he thinks the company \u201ccan stabilize it.\u201d With fewer staff and a focus on digital, might that mean some magazines could leave Time Inc., too?The decline of print also is contributing to a slowdown in world-wide advertising revenue growth, according to Magna Global, as Alexandra Bruell at CMO Today reports. The U.S. is expected to see the slowest rate of ad sales growth this year (3.4%) since 2014, which the market grew just 1.6%. National TV and out-of-home spending also took unexpected hits. So what\u2019s been going on? Magna says there has been an \u201cabrupt slowdown in economic activity,\u201d and advertisers are tightening their belts on TV spending.

The startup built a number of consumer apps, including chat app Chatous, Q&A app Kiwi, local classifieds app Plaza, and Melon, an app for meeting and chatting with people.These apps, with about 50 million users combined, provide the company with reams of data.Castle Global then built an internal product to identify objects within images in its apps--for things like offensive content.That technology became Hive AI, which the company has launched and sells to a variety of media companies. It hopes to expand to other verticals. Customers include GIF company Tenor, Yellw.co, a social app in Europe, and unnamed large media companies.Castle Global, with 90 people, has raised $15 million, including a $13 million Series A led by 8VC with participation from Founders Fund and General Catalyst, as well as a $2 million seed led by General Catalyst.Media companies can use Hive AI\u2019s API to identify celebrities, actors, musicians and politicians, and identify brands or other objects within images or videos.Media companies can use Hive AI to identify when viewership increases or decreases during a television show, news show or television or video ad--based on which people are on screen. It\u2019s also used for user-generated content.Automatically extracting this type of data from large stores of photos or videos is not easy, but Hive can do this quickly, said Kevin Guo, co-founder and chief executive at Castle Global.\u201cWe go frame by frame and find this scene with this person who was on for 3 minutes and see what happened to viewership,\u201d Mr Guo said. \u201cTypically it\u2019s hard to tag that manually. We can find every logo present. We dynamically do all this to find trends and patterns.\u201dThe company initially built the product by building its own form of Mechanical Turk with workers to identify objects, such as a dog or a cat. Then it uses that data with machine learning for Hive to identify objects on its own.This technology for labeling data is just as critical as the large amount of data it has amassed to identify images, Mr. Guo said.\u201cIt surprised us, to be candid, how powerful the technology has been and the accuracy and breadth of its use cases,\u201d said Alex Kolicich, a member of the investment team at 8VC.Write to Tomio Geron at tomio.geron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hive-ai-automates-image-recognition-for-media-companies-1497439804", "news_title": "Hive AI Automates Image Recognition for Media Companies", "keywords": "Castle Global,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Mike Davis was on the 18th green after last year\u2019s U.S. Open at Oakmont when public sentiment toward the USGA became clear.Moments earlier, the USGA executive director had been confronted by golf legend Jack Nicklaus over the rules controversy that overshadowed Dustin Johnson\u2019s victory. Now, as the trophy presentation for Johnson got underway, Davis was hearing it from the crowd.\u201cThere was a point when somebody was introduced from the USGA and there were almost boos,\u201d he said.There are 156 players in the field this week at Erin Hills, but none of them need a good week at the U.S. Open quite like the organization that runs it. The USGA has in recent years drawn the ire of everyone from major champions to casual fans, never more so than at its signature event.In 2015, it was the condition of the greens at Chambers Bay that prompted an outcry from players, who called them farcical, disgraceful and ridiculous, among other adjectives.In 2016, it was the spectacle of Johnson vying for the title without knowing whether he would receive a one-stroke penalty for the slight movement of his ball before a putt. After nearly the entire PGA Tour blasted the USGA\u2019s handling of the situation\u2014Rory McIlroy called it \u201camateur hour\u201d\u2014the organization said the next day that it \u201cregrets the distraction.\u201dIn 2017, if all goes to plan, the talk about the USGA won\u2019t just be kinder. It\u2019ll be quieter.\u201cIdeally, what you want the U.S. Open to be is about the players and about the golf course, and that ultimate test of golf,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t want some credit, or if we deserve some blame, to get it. But the story should not be about us.\u201dIt is one of the quirks of the sport that the American national championship is run by a rulemaking body that is unaffiliated with the pros that compete in it. PGA Tour stars may be the faces of the game. But when it comes to the rules they must play by, the equipment they are allowed to use and the conditions under which they play the U.S. Open, they are at the mercy of the USGA.Add to that the USGA\u2019s desire to make the Open unique in its brutality, and it is little wonder that player complaints are a rite of June.\u201cWhen was the last time you met an individual that ever had anything nice to say about what\u2019s happening in Washington?\u201d Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what side of the aisle you sit on. People don\u2019t like to be governed, generally speaking.\u201dWhat has unfolded in recent years reflects more than just that inherent tension. The best golfers in the world have become openly disdainful toward and dismissive of the USGA.The organization\u2019s 2013 decision, along with the R&A, to ban anchored putting\u2014in which players pressed the end of the club into their body for stability\u2014was met with widespread resistance from PGA Tour players, who considered forming their own set of rules. Issues at the last two U.S. Opens have only further strained the relationship.In theory, that shouldn\u2019t affect the USGA too much. No player is about to boycott a major championship. National championships are only part of the USGA\u2019s work, which also includes administering the amateur handicap system and funding an array of research related to the long-term sustainability of the sport.But the U.S. Open is the non-profit USGA\u2019s primary financial engine. In fiscal year 2016, it reported nearly $152 million in revenues related to the 13 national championships it conducts. That represents a $30 million increase from 2014, just before the start of a new broadcast rights deal with Fox Sports, and accounted for 75% of the USGA\u2019s total revenue.More than just a cash cow, the U.S. Open is a perception driver. Davis said the organization received around 15,000 emails and phone calls from people upset over the Johnson episode.\u201cIf you miss a ruling, if you miss a golf course setup issue, if you don\u2019t handle suspension of play properly, it does affect the credibility of the entire organization,\u201d Davis said.Since last year, the USGA has tried to repair that credibility\u2014and its relationship with Tour players\u2014in several ways. Along with the R&A, it eliminated the penalty that nearly cost Johnson the title. It solicited input on its pending modernization of the rule book from Tour players and amateurs alike. And it increased the prize money for this year\u2019s tournament from $10 million to a record $12 million, making it the biggest purse in golf.Davis has met personally with a handful of players, including a February lunch with McIlroy. He and other USGA officials have also gone on a mini-road show, appearing twice in recent months at meetings of PGA Tour players to explain how they spend the revenue the Open generates. Among other things, they pointed to $10 million spent on amateur championships, $7 million spent on technology for the handicap system and other do-good areas such as junior golf and decreasing water usage.\u201cA lot of things we do, people don\u2019t even know about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we didn\u2019t do those things, you\u2019d see a lot of aspects of the game that just wouldn\u2019t be as good.\u201dThat has not stopped the criticism. When asked last month how this year\u2019s U.S. Open might improve players\u2019 view of the USGA, Phil Mickelson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if doing one thing right is going to fix that.\u201d Earlier this month, Adam Scott told reporters that the USGA had \u201creally dropped the ball with where the game is at.\u201d On Sunday, Kevin Na posted an Instagram video from a practice round in which he grumbles about the length of the fescue grass, some of which was mowed down on Tuesday.A smooth week at Erin Hills will only accomplish so much.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the last time we get something wrong,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.

The upshot is that the world of leveraged loans appears to be going slightly mad.Loan sales are running ahead of the pace of the past three years, fueled by a rush of money into the sector. Retail investors have piled back into U.S. funds that specialize in loans, with more than $25 billion of inflows over the past year after two years of outflows, according to Lipper. Total assets in retail U.S. loan funds have risen to $95 billion, although that is below 2014\u2019s peak of $112 billion. Big managers in the sector include well-known names such as             BlackRock,       Fidelity and             Pimco.The return of investors has helped companies like Dell International, which last September raised a $20.6 billion leveraged loan to help fund its takeover of EMC, the biggest in 2016, according to         Thomson Reuters.       Deals this year include financing for Lone Star\u2019s $2.3 billion purchase of German materials company, Xella, from PAI Partners and             Goldman Sachs.Borrowing costs have also declined. European yields on new deals are at record lows of less than 4%, and U.S. yields are at 5%, their lowest in two years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Leveraged loans are popular because they pay higher yields than investment-grade bonds, are secured against borrower assets and give investors protection from changes in underlying interest rates. But they are also relatively risky because borrowers are usually heavily indebted.Lenders used to get extra protection by attaching conditions to the loan, known as covenants, which allowed them to take action if a borrower\u2019s earnings deteriorate, for example. These days, most loans are \u201ccovenant lite\u201d meaning lenders get less influence over a borrower\u2019s actions.This was a big concern before financial crisis, during the last credit boom. In 2007, almost 30% of U.S. loans and not quite 8% of European loans were covenant lite, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s LCD research unit. Last year almost 60% of European deals and 75% of U.S. deals were covenant lite.Huge competition to invest in loans is the culprit. In addition to retail loan funds, specialist debt funds for institutional investors have also grown strongly. Such funds globally are sitting on more than $200 billion of cash they are yet to invest, according to Preqin, a research firm. That dry powder has grown by 56% since 2012 as funds have kept raising new money faster than they can put it to work. Most of that is in U.S. funds too, but dry powder at European funds has more than doubled since 2012 to $56 billion.Even this underestimates the amount of institutional money because these funds can themselves use leverage to boost their appetite.This isn\u2019t new in the U.S., but it is increasingly coming to Europe too. Data is scarce on exactly how much the funds are borrowing, but some bankers worry that it is growing. The most aggressive fund managers can borrow up to three-times the value of their funds, according to research house bfinance, but the average is about 1.25-times the fund.For indebted companies this is great: They can refinance with cheaper or more aggressive terms while so much money is sloshing around. But investors ought to be careful, it looks very much like they might be storing up trouble for the future.Write to Paul J.

But along West 67th Street, just off the park, an enclave of buildings constructed by and for artists continues their traditions more than a century later.The block is lined with \u201cstudio buildings\u201d erected, beginning in 1903, in what has become known as the West 67th Street Artists\u2019 Colony Historic District\u2014typically ornate live-work spaces with 14-foot-high windows facing north in double-height rooms.Most were built by cooperatives of artists, musicians and other creative sorts, who occupied some of the apartments and rented out others to cover the expenses of operating the building.The largest and most imposing of these is the Gothic-inspired Hotel des Artistes, an 18-story building at 1 West 67th St. that opened in 1917. Its brick, limestone and terra-cotta facade is adorned with gargoyles of sculptors, painters and writers.Isadora Duncan,        the dancer and choreographer, moved in soon after it opened.       Norman Rockwell       lived there, as did Noel Coward, the playwright; actor       Rudolph Valentino      ; the expressionist artist LeRoy Neiman, and former New York City Mayor       John Lindsay.      Howard Chandler Christy,        the artist and illustrator, was a resident and painted a series murals of nymphs in a street-level restaurant in the building, long known as the Cafe des Artistes. It is now the Leopard at des Artistes.To celebrate its centennial, the co-op board at Hotel des Artistes brought in dancers from the Word Dance Theater on a recent Sunday to perform Ms. Duncan\u2019s dances, in spaces throughout the building. Wearing flowing Grecian gowns they performed for small groups in the lobby and around a basement swimming pool fringed with rose petals and candles. The audience rotated through the building.Amid the celebration it appears that some of the connection to the building\u2019s creative past is fading, as older artists die off and apartments fetch high prices, including a three-apartment combination that sold for $7 million in 2007. Last year, a two-bedroom apartment owned by the late       David Garth,        the political consultant, sold for $3.9 million, and a unit on the market for $4.5 million is now listed in contract.Still,       Pamela Johnson,        a longtime resident who chaired the Centennial Committee, said many apartment owners still have a strong link to the arts or creative fields.Her late mother       Cecile Johnson,        a painter, lived and worked in an 8th floor north-facing apartment decorated with ornate carvings, including gamboling nudes and cherubs, where three other artists previously lived.Of the 72 apartments, she said, a recent building census found that the owners of 35 have a connection to the arts, not including collectors. There are 10 painters, a sculptor, five architects, and five writers, along with four dancers, three producers, and four art-and-antique dealers, she noted. Artists are still encouraged to display their work in the hallways.The tally counts       Peter Gelb,        the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, among its two musicians.\u201cOur building is a lovely eclectic bunch,\u201d said       Emanuel Stern,        the board president, who is a son of the developer       Leonard Stern       and a former president and chief operating officer of Hartz Mountain Industries. The younger Mr. Stern is now the managing principal of Tall Pines Capital LLC, a real-estate investment firm.Mr. Stern owns two units at Hotel des Artistes, including one with a double-height space that his wife, Elizabeth Stern, uses as a studio for painting and sculpture. \u201cOur building enjoys it when prospective buyers are part of the arts,\u201d he said.West 67th Street was a street of stables and small industrial sites when the artists moved in at the beginning of the last century. The 150-foot wide lot for 1 West 67th St. was purchased by a group of artists in 1914 for $250,000. The construction costs were reported at the time to be about $800,000.Cheryl Daly,        a broker at Halstead Property who lives in the building and worked with Ms. Johnson to organize the centennial, said the founders were by no means struggling artists. The building has a medieval-inspired lobby with a beamed ceiling and gothic ornaments. There is a 35-foot swimming pool, a squash court, a roof deck and several exercise rooms.Though it was never a hotel, the original apartments had no kitchens, and meals were served in a second floor dining room or sent up via dumbwaiters.Ms. Daly said that in recent years the building had a strong appeal for architects. \u201cThey appreciate the architecture, she said. \u201cThey like the light and the high ceilings.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-14 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/manhattan-artists-enclave-survives-a-century-of-changes-1497438000", "news_title": "How a Manhattan Artists Colony Survived a Century of Changes  ", "keywords": "hotel des artistes,upper west side real estate,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "Good morning,The world\u2019s most valuable startup has a tough road ahead. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said he would take an indefinite leave from the ride-hailing giant as it revealed sweeping changes to its workplace culture in response to a series of scandals. Mr. Kalanick said in an email to Uber\u2019s 12,000 employees Tuesday that he would shift his responsibilities to members of the company\u2019s leadership team while he is away, stepping in only for major strategic decisions. The decision creates another void in Uber\u2019s already thinning executive ranks and came just as the company released partial results of a nearly four-month investigation into its culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s law firm. The report\u2019s summary, made public as company officials addressed employees at an all-hands meeting at its San Francisco headquarters, made broad recommendations that were approved by Uber\u2019s board. Even that meeting was not without scandal: Private-equity billionaire David Bonderman resigned from the board hours after he made a disparaging remark about women during the gathering.Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a Senate panel Tuesday that he didn\u2019t meet with any Russian officials last year to discuss the presidential campaign and that any suggestion that he colluded with them to help President Trump was \u201can appalling and detestable lie.\u201d Mr. Sessions defended his role in firing former FBI Director James Comey, saying his decision to step aside from campaign-related investigations didn\u2019t apply to broad oversight of the Justice Department. He refused to discuss the content of any conversations he had with Mr. Trump on the subject. Mr. Sessions alternated between strong denials and hazy recollections, saying he couldn\u2019t recall whether he had a passing encounter with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington or any other undisclosed interactions with Russian officials. Elsewhere, the White House pushed back on suggestions that Mr. Trump has considered firing Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The White House is set to begin its search for the next Federal Reserve chief, according to a senior official, and it will be managed by Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, a former Wall Street executive who some market strategists believe could be a candidate for the post himself. Officials won\u2019t publicly outline any timetable for their decision or shortlist of candidates. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen\u2019s term runs through January, and President Trump didn\u2019t rule out her reappointment in an April interview. Ms. Yellen\u2019s reappointment isn\u2019t an outcome many observers expect because of Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce criticism of her during the final weeks of last year\u2019s presidential campaign. However, his willingness to consider her speaks to the amicable relationship they have forged since Mr. Trump took office, observers say. The Fed today is likely to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point, the fourth such increase since December 2015.The notion that suitors need to ask the bride\u2019s father for permission to marry went out with the buggy whip\u2014or did it? Couples are often already living together and some have bought rings and booked wedding venues before they seek parents\u2019 approval. Still, some 77% of suitors ask for parents\u2019 permission to wed their daughters, according to one poll. Many couples plan to marry regardless of the answer, but they are retooling old scripts to fit the modern marriage\u2014slipping the request into casual conversations and asking Mom as well as Dad. As a result, popping the question before the question can get awkward. One groom wishes he had picked a more private moment to broach the subject; another chose to ask for a blessing rather than permission from his future in-laws.Trainers and strength coaches are using power tools for turbocharged robo-massage.

Nike licenses the rights for F\u00fatbol Club Barcelona\u2019s merchandise, while Sanrio is the licensor of rights for Hello Kitty. Universal Studios, a unit of             Comcast Corp.\u2019s       NBCUniversal, is the licensor of rights for the movies \u201cMinions\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d the EU said.The probe comes after the commission\u2019s competition directorate in May published the findings of its two-year long probe into the e-commerce sector. The EU then reiterated previous warnings that consumer-product makers and digital-content owners could face antitrust probes for restricting the way retailers sell the companies\u2019 goods online.Earlier in June, the commission launched an in-depth investigation into             Guess?

Total sees electricity as a hedge against oil\u2019s eventual decline and is assembling a new business around it, WSJ\u2019s Russell Gold writes. Total Chairman and Chief Executive       Patrick Pouyann\u00e9       wants to turn the company into one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of electricity, or what he often calls \u201cthe energy of the 21st century.\u201d Already a large producer of natural gas, Total is diversifying, snapping up a French maker of industrial batteries, a utility supplier in Belgium and a stake in a U.S. maker of solar panels. It\u2019s a big change from Total\u2019s core business since power grids tend to be regional while oil can be shipped globally. Even as Total doubles down on electricity, the International Energy Agency says consumer demand for oil will keep growing for another two decades unless governments move faster to curb emissions.Saudi Arabia is slashing its U.S. oil exports in a bid to reduce a global supply glut that has been hammering crude prices. The reductions could be a step to ensure production cuts by the OPEC as intended, WSJ\u2019s Alison Sider Summer Said and Timothy Puko report. The November deal to rein in oil output was supposed to reduce bloated global inventories, but U.S. companies have rushed in to fill the void. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is the world\u2019s largest oil producer and crude exporter, and the projected July drop in exports would amount to a near three-decade low for this time of year. Analysts say Aramco\u2019s plans show Saudi Arabia is getting serious about addressing the supply glut, although some investors remain skeptical.Panama cut ties with Taiwan in favor of Beijing, citing China\u2019s importance as a user of the Panama Canal and its role as the No. 1 supplier of goods in the Colon free-trade zone. The move gives China another victory in its efforts to isolate the island, which could be crippling to Taiwan\u2019s economy, WSJ\u2019s Eva Dou and Jenny W. Hsu write. Taiwan remains a key link in the global technology supply chain, but its exports have fallen in recent years, displaced in part by Chinese competitors. China\u2019s maritime power is growing, meanwhile, and plays a major role at the Panama Canal and at the country\u2019s burgeoning free trade zone. China\u2019s growing economic heft has pushed more of Taiwan\u2019s allies to switch their diplomatic recognition to Beijing.Chinese online retailer             JD.com Inc.       plans to use artificial intelligence  and robots to cut costs and \u201ccreate a business model that is almost totally out of human control,\u201d Chief Executive       Richard Liu       tells WSJ\u2019s Li Yuan.

In a terse statement Wednesday, Anbang Insurance Group said its chairman is \u201ctemporarily unable to fulfill his role for personal reasons\u201d and has authorized other senior executives to manage the business. Mr. Wu can\u2019t be reached and Anbang declined additional comment.A 50-year-old born near the eastern Wenzhou, Mr. Wu is a Chinese archetype: the highflying financier who appears to have come from nowhere.He\u2019s not the first to then tumble out of sight.In addition to going toe-to-toe with the likes of private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, Mr. Wu was known for top-shelf political links in China.Other tycoons who fit that mold include Tomorrow Group\u2019s       Xiao Jianhua,       \u200bwho has been missing since January, and Fosun Group\u2019s Guo Guangchang, who briefly vanished in late 2015 to help in an investigation.In Mr. Wu\u2019s case, one political connection was his marriage to a granddaughter of former leader Deng Xiaoping.Politically connected tycoons in China are a double-edged sword for the leadership in Beijing, and a focus as the Communist Party gets set to hand President       Xi Jinping       a second five-year mandate at a meeting this autumn. His political standing depends in part on party views of his signature anticorruption campaign, now nearly five years old.China\u2019s policy makers have long directed business to trusted associates, including family members, to ensure jobs are done properly\u2014and sometimes to line their own pockets. But China\u2019s fast-growing economy can quickly produce massive wealth that transforms the associates into power centers of their own.Mr. \u200bWu was detained by a joint team of antigraft investigators and police officers specializing in economic crimes, the people familiar with the situation said. The investigation has been going on for months but is still in its early stages, they said, and doesn\u2019t mean charges will be brought. They said the probe in part centers on possible bribery or other economic crimes by Mr. Wu at Anbang.The China Insurance Regulatory Commission and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.A sign of the political sensitivity emerged late Tuesday when Chinese authorities ordered a report that Mr. Wu had been detained deleted soon after it was published online by the widely read magazine Caijing.In building Anbang, Mr. Wu was aggressive and detail-oriented, say people who have done business with him. \u201cHe\u2019s very hands-on, very quick in decision making,\u201d says the head of an Anbang-controlled European company who sees Mr. Wu a few times a year in Beijing.Anbang claims assets approaching $300 billion, but the structure of the company is complex and it has no key business units listed on a stock exchange. That keeps Mr. Wu off lists of the country\u2019s richest tycoons.\u201cThe shareholder structure is so obscured that it\u2019s impossible to see who owns it,\u201d says       Rupert Hoogewerf,        who runs a Shanghai wealth-tracking service called Hurun Report.Disclosure concerns this year thwarted Mr. Wu\u2019s bid to expand into the U.S. insurance sector: Anbang\u2019s $1.5 billion play to take control of Iowa-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life and the deal unraveled after it failed to win approval from New York insurance regulators, who had found Anbang\u2019s answers about shareholders and funding insufficient, according to people involved and official statements. Disclosure was also an issue for the multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States when it looked at the bid, according to a person familiar with the situation.At times, Anbang has criticized scrutiny of its shareholder base. Mr. Wu has told staff that a level of secrecy is needed for competitive reasons, a trait common to insurers but taken to the extreme at Anbang.After a string of takeovers following the global financial crisis, Anbang shot to international recognition in 2014 when it agreed to pay nearly $2 billion for New York\u2019s historic Waldorf Astoria hotel from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. President Xi stayed in the hotel for the following year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, while Barack Obama broke with U.S. presidential tradition and went elsewhere.In 2015, Mr. Wu offered rare public insight into his thinking with an appearance at Harvard University. He played down his skills as a deal maker, describing himself as \u201ceven a bit simple, like a child,\u201d according to a transcript posted to the company\u2019s website but since deleted. \u201cIn the future, Anbang will be an internet-based financial institution providing full services via internet,\u201d he said.Mr. Wu\u2019s aggressiveness was exhibited in Anbang\u2019s efforts to change how insurance is sold in China. Instead of offering commissions to agents who sell home and life coverage, Anbang pulled in revenue through banks and online platforms by selling products that look more like short-term deposits than insurance policies.The Anbang chairman defended his company\u2019s strategy in an interview published by state-owned Beijing News earlier this year, a time of insurance-sector turmoil that included a 10-year ban for a competitor and the toppling of the top regulator. The interview showed Mr. Wu still in control of Anbang, but signaling his willingness to get in step with government priorities by pursuing more-traditional business lines, like pensions, which he called its \u201cnew starting point.\u201dMr. Wu made a public appearance on May 15, hoisting a champagne flute at an event at the Belgian Embassy in Beijing. Anbang owns both a bank and an insurer in Belgium.\u2014Lingling Wei and Chao Deng contributed to this article.Write to James T.

Those inventories were 292 million barrels higher than the five-year average, said the IEA, which advises governments on energy trends.Oil prices fell slightly after the report\u2019s release and were down overall on Wednesday morning in London. Brent was down 0.8% at $48.31, while WTI fell over 1% to $45.99\u2014close to the lowest on record this year.Oil traders were also looking ahead to the release of fresh weekly data about American stockpiles of crude, to be released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.The high storage levels are a sign that there is more oil in the world than can be consumed, helping depress crude prices at levels lower than desired by oil producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the 14-nation cartel that controls about 40% of global crude output.OPEC teamed up with 10 other big producers outside the cartel to cap their production through March 2018 at roughly 1.8 million barrels a day lower than levels in October 2016.But the IEA said the effort is taking longer than expected, in part because U.S. oil producers have come roaring back to life this year. The IEA said it expects U.S. crude supply to grow by 430,000 barrels a day this year, and will grow by 780,000 barrels a day in 2018.\u201cSuch is the dynamism of this extraordinary, very diverse industry it is possible that growth will be faster,\u201d the IEA said.OPEC members Libya and Nigeria have also increased production, as allowed under the cartel\u2019s output deal because their oil industries had faced violent disruptions. OPEC crude oil output rose by 29,000 barrels a day in May to 32.08 million barrels a day, the highest level so far this year.If current trends hold, stored oil will begin dropping this year but it won\u2019t fall to the five-year average\u2014a key goal of OPEC\u2014until March 2018, when the production deal ends.\u201cWe have regularly counseled that patience is required on the part of those looking for the rebalancing of the oil market,\u201d the IEA said.Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister       Khalid al-Falih       has said that the producer coalition is determined to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to achieve the of bringing stock levels back to the five-year average.\u201c\u2018Whatever it takes\u2019 might be the mantra, but the current form of \u2018whatever\u2019 is not having as quick an impact as expected,\u201d the IEA said.Despite relatively low oil prices, producers are still pumping healthy amounts of oil, the IEA said.Total production from producers outside OPEC is expected to grow by 700,000 barrels this year and 1.5 million barrels in 2018, which is slightly more than the expected increase in global demand. Last month alone, global oil supply rose by 585,000 barrels a day as both OPEC and non-OPEC countries produced more.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 05:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-oil-glut-wont-subside-in-2017-says-iea-1497427203", "news_title": "Global Oil Glut Won\u2019t Subside in 2017, Says IEA", "keywords": " global oil supply,iea report, non-opec, opec, opec deal, opec production cut,International Energy Agency,OPEC,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "The signs are mounting that the Philippines is now a primary target for Islamic State.The southern reaches of the mostly Roman Catholic country have long been home to Muslim insurgents seeking to carve out an independent state. Until now, counterterrorism officials and experts have largely viewed local declarations of loyalty to Islamic State founder       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       as little more than pleas for attention. That is changing.One of the newest insurgent groups shocked the country three weeks ago by marching into Marawi City and waving black Islamic State flags; they are still holding around 20% of the town along with hundreds of hostages. The standoff with the Philippine military so far has claimed the lives of at least 58 security forces, nearly 200 rebels, and dozens of civilians.Since the May 23 attack, Islamic State has taken a stronger interest in the Philippines, profiling some of the militants in its propaganda magazine Rumiyah and falsely claiming responsibility for the burning of a Manila casino that left 37 people dead; police say it was in fact a botched robbery by a heavily indebted gambler.On Sunday, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said \u201cit appears that al-Baghdadi himself, the leader of ISIS, has specifically ordered terrorist activities here in the Philippines.\u201d Mr. Duterte didn\u2019t say how he knew about Mr. Baghdadi\u2019s instructions.Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, in an audio recording circulated on Tuesday, appeared to single out the Philippines for further attacks and praised the assault on Marawi.The battle for Marawi is being waged by one of the region\u2019s most powerful militias, and its aftermath could determine whether Islamic State can lay down a marker in the Philippines.Some intelligence officials now worry that the Philippines\u2019 growing profile in jihadist circles could bring more foreign fighters to its shores as Islamic State loses ground in Syria and Iraq. Amid the losses in the Middle East, Islamic State has said it was behind an array of attacks around the world, in a bid to sustain its power.Governments across Southeast Asia and Australia already are watching the Philippines with concern as militants from Indonesia, Malaysia, Yemen and Saudi Arabia join the fight. The U.S. is getting involved: U.S. Special Operations Forces are providing support for the Philippine military in Marawi.The danger, said an intelligence official in the Philippines, is that \u201cthe southern Philippines is becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre again.\u201dThe potential for recruiting the Philippines\u2019 Muslim minority, whose lands were gradually taken over by waves of settlers under Spanish then American colonizers, has long drawn the interest of foreign jihadists.Osama bin Laden was in regular contact with the late Muslim separatist leader Hashim Salamat, while the architect of the September 11 attacks on the U.S., Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, planned an attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II in Manila in the 1990s and railed against the U.S.\u2019s support for the Philippine government in a letter to then-President       Barack Obama       in 2015 from detention at Guantanamo Bay.The Philippines\u2019 porous borders and lax immigration control also make it an attractive destination for foreign extremists, according to       Sidney Jones,        a terrorism expert at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta. Fighters are also attracted, in part, because some of the combatants have extensive networks, Ms. Jones said.\u201cThey\u2019re really quite sophisticated and have a lot of resources to draw on, and that\u2019s attractive,\u201d she said.The Islamic State\u2019s emir in the Philippines is       Isnilon Hapilon,        a 51-year-old commander with the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, which was seeded in the 1990s with help from al Qaeda. He swore loyalty to Islamic State in 2014, and since then has built an alliance with the Maute family, an aristocratic landowning clan who are able to command hundreds of followers.Ms. Jones said the Mautes are likely the brains behind the Marawi operation, particularly 37-year-old       Omarkhayam Maute.Once the captain of the school baseball team in Marawi City, Omar, as he is known, studied Islam in Egypt and later married the daughter of an influential conservative cleric in Indonesia and has strong ties there. Indonesian armed forces chief Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo told reporters Monday that there were Islamic State sleeper cells in nearly every province of the country.Omar returned to the southern Philippines where he and his brother       Abdullah Maute       took the reins of the family\u2019s local militia. The militia had been used to help settle local political scores, but in 2015, the brothers publicly aligned it with Islamic State.Their ultimate goal, senior Philippine officials said, was to take control of Marawi, the Philippines\u2019 largest Muslim-majority city.Militants had initially planned to take over two or three towns in all, according to foreign-affairs secretary Allan Peter Cayetano, and declare a province of the Islamic State caliphate among the rugged mountains and forests around Lake Lanao on the island of Mindanao.Armed forces chief Gen. Eduardo A\u00f1o said the military caught a break when soldiers inadvertently interrupted the planning for the operation by raiding a safe house in Marawi where they believed Mr. Hapilon was holed up. That forced the Maute group to take up arms prematurely to help him escape.\u201cThey were not able to fully deploy all their forces,\u201d Gen. A\u00f1o told reporters.Military officials said they are trying to determine whether the Maute brothers are among several guerrillas killed in a battle with troops on Saturday. Their parents have been arrested as troops continue trying to clear militants from Marawi.Mr. Duterte has already declared martial law in the area. \u201cI did not expect it to be that bad,\u201d he said.Write to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-stakes-claim-to-philippines-1497432604", "news_title": "Islamic State Sinks Its Teeth Into the Philippines ", "keywords": "abu sayyaf,isis,islamic state,marawi,mindanao,muslim insurgency,southern philippines,Abdullah Maute,Omarkhayam Maute,Isnilon Hapilon,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "With crosstown rivals focusing on a future of electric cars and self-driving vehicles, Detroit\u2019s smallest auto maker has created a product line that is largely fixated on the rearview mirror.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 0.67%       NV\u2019s highest-profile launches for the new model year are the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon and Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. Both come loaded with the horsepower and sex appeal that put Motor City on the map decades ago.Small cars, bread-and-butter family sedans and a long-range electric car are either hard to find at Fiat Chrysler dealerships or completely absent from its showrooms. Passenger cars, which help boost auto makers\u2019 average miles-per-gallon ratings, have fallen out of favor with buyers in favor of crossovers, sport-utility vehicles and trucks. Chief Executive       Sergio Marchionne       has said compact cars no longer make financial sense.Last year, the company killed off its Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart sedans as well as the Patriot small SUV. Instead, the auto maker has doubled down on V-8 engine-powered SUVs and pickup trucks.\u201cThe one thing not everyone has is performance, and people are willing to pay for it,\u201d       Tim Kuniskis,        a top Marchionne lieutenant in charge of passenger cars, said in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a quantifiable, easy-to-identify differentiator.\u201dBut it comes at a cost: Fiat Chrysler has the worst fuel-economy performance of any mainline car company. As of May, its vehicles averaged 21 miles per gallon, the lowest of any major automotive brand after sports-car specialist             Porsche AG      , according to WardsAuto.com, an industry data provider and trade publication.Regulators say the auto maker might need to spend $2,613 per vehicle to meet proposed government fuel-economy standards planned over the next decade\u201444% higher than the projected industry average. That reflects incremental costs to meet current standards through 2021 and a prospective target through 2025 contested by the auto industry.Fiat Chrysler says its fuel-efficiency ratings are comparable to rivals within segments it competes in, adding that the proposed 2025 light-vehicle fuel-economy standards are unrealistic. The Trump administration has said it would reconsider the targets, which were approved late in President       Barack Obama\u2019s       tenure.Mr. Marchionne, who says he plans to step down as CEO in early 2019, has taken a more cautious approach to introducing electric-vehicle and self-driving technology than             General Motors Co.       and             Ford Motor Co.       He says the debt-saddled company must carefully consider the trade-offs between earning money today and investing in the future.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet payroll\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0Wednesday and\u00a0Friday,\u201d he\u00a0told reporters recently.So far, that strategy appears to be working. Margins are gradually improving, including a record first-quarter performance since the 2009 merger of the Italian and U.S. auto makers. But even if Fiat Chrysler meets a goal of becoming debt-free by next year, the auto maker has no intention of competing with Silicon Valley to develop next-generation smart vehicles.\u201cWe cannot delude ourselves by believing we can replace or displace the technology giants,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said. \u201cWe as an industry are in the process of being completely disintermediated.\u201dThat pessimism sets Fiat Chrysler apart from its Detroit-based rivals. Before former Ford Chief Executive       Mark Fields       was fired in May, he had outlined heavy investments in electric vehicles and self-driving technology to take on             Tesla Inc.       But Ford\u2019s share price continued to slip amid uncertainty over the payoff for those moonshot ventures. His successor,       Jim Hackett,        is charged with accelerating innovation.GM CEO       Mary Barra       has also laid several technology bets, including investing more than $1 billion last year in startups specializing in autonomous cars and ride sharing. The Chevrolet Bolt long-range electric car, which the company hopes will further its technological bona fides, went on sale in January.Fiat Chrysler, meanwhile, has outsourced its autonomous-technology research to             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Waymo unit. Mr. Marchionne routinely points out that the company loses money on each Fiat 500e, the only pure electric car it sells in the U.S.\u2014to the tune of about $20,000 a car. The auto maker said it would rely instead on hybrid technology, first popularized by             Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s       Prius nearly two decades ago, to catch up.The company in April started selling a plug-in hybrid version of its Pacifica minivan. A so-called mild-hybrid Ram\u00a0pickup\u00a0truck has been promised, and Mr. Marchionne says a bulk of the eight-vehicle Jeep lineup will get a hybrid engine option over the next three years.At the same time, Fiat Chrysler is hard at work on a cross between a Jeep and a Ram, a throwback to the short-lived sports-utility trucks popular a decade ago.One of its primary strategies to improve fuel efficiency\u2014a line of EcoDiesel engines\u2014has run into roadblocks. Fiat Chrysler has been sued by the U.S. Justice Department following allegations that Jeep and Ram trucks with those engines used software designed to cheat emissions tests. Adding pressure, West Virginia University researchers found significant emissions discrepancies between on-road performance and lab tests, and the Environmental Protection Agency has delayed certification of its 2017 model-year vehicles with EcoDiesel engines. Fiat Chrysler has denied wrongdoing.\u2014Christina Rogers contributed to this article.Write to Chester Dawson at chester.dawson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiat-chrysler-looks-to-bring-muscle-back-to-motor-city-1497432606", "news_title": "Fiat Chrysler Looks to Bring Muscle Back to Motor City", "keywords": "alphabet,alphabet inc. waymo,autonomous cars,cars,dodge challenger srt demon,ecodiesel engines,fiat chrysler,ford ,fuel economy,gm,horsepower,hybrid cars,jeep,jeep grand cherokee trackhawk,motor city,muscle cars, ram, ride sharing, self-driving cars, sergio marchionne,tesla,tm kuniskis,v-8 engine-powered pickup trucks,v-8 engine-powered suvs, waymo,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,Tim Kuniskis,Sergio Marchionne,regulation,government policy,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,sports utility vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,retail,wholesale,etailing,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Small Business Administration said Wednesday it is teaming up with New Orleans-based Liberty Bank to guarantee loans for black business owners, the first such partnership between the agency and a black-owned bank.The government agency and the U.S. Black Chambers plan to back as much as 50% of some business loans provided by Liberty Bank in an attempt to remedy one of the most widely voiced complaints from black business owners\u2014that they can\u2019t get adequate capital for their enterprises when they need it.Just 47% of black business owners got the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites, according to a survey of entrepreneurs conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014, the latest data available.Exacerbating the credit gap, many black business owners forgo seeking capital in the first place. The fear of being rejected was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek capital, with 59% saying they didn\u2019t think they would be approved.In general, lending backed by the Small Business Administration helps shield banks from loans that are considered riskier, typically labeled as such if the bank lacks adequate capital or if the business owner has a lower credit score or business revenues. The backstop gives banks the ability to lend to small-business owners who typically wouldn\u2019t qualify for traditional business loans.The formula for deciding whether a loan is risky includes three factors that continue to plague black-owned banks and businesses. Black-owned banks have significantly less capital on hand than other banks, and black business owners statistically have lower credit scores and revenue than their white counterparts.\u201cMost lenders have a box, and the access to it is so high that many businesses are unable to reach it and are left out, specifically African-American businesses,\u201d said       Ann Duplessis,        vice president of Liberty Bank. \u201cThis allows us to be flexible.

MAT 2.16%       earlier this year, including a stalled turnaround, angry investors and dispirited staff.But one of the first decisions the former Google executive will face is whether the company can afford to maintain its generous shareholder dividend and make the investments needed to fix the home of Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. The toy industry newcomer is expected to share her strategy at a meeting with analysts in New York on Wednesday.With an annual payout of more than $500 million, Mattel has failed to earn enough income to cover its dividend in each of its past three years. Last fiscal year, its profit was $318 million. Mattel\u2019s stock, down more than 28% in the past year, puts its dividend yield at 6.8%, the second-highest among all S&P 500 companies.Cutting the dividend this week would remove an overhang that has kept some investors on the sidelines, and it would free Ms. Georgiadis to invest in marketing and product development, some analysts said. Others believe that Mattel, with hopes for a sales surge from toys tied to the coming \u201cCars 3\u201d film and Christmas still too far out, has time to make a call.\u201cWhile we would welcome such a move, we are still not convinced a cut will occur owing to the board\u2019s dogged support of the dividend in the past,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson wrote this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a coin flip at this point.\u201dMs. Georgiadis has said the board will review the dividend payment periodically. Through a spokesman, Mattel executives declined to comment ahead of the investor meeting.Ms. Georgiadis, age 53, is getting acclimated to an industry with multiyear development cycles and long holiday buildup. That is different than the tech world of             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, where for the past six years she led commercial operations and advertising sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.What she does bring to Mattel is a better understanding of e-commerce\u2014a dire need for Mattel as the store-based way of selling toys quickly shifts online. \u201cShe\u2019s smarter than anyone at Mattel in terms of the digital world,\u201d said Jim Silver, editor of TTPM.com, a toy review website.Ms. Georgiadis has already made some changes to address a corporate culture that current and former employees say is still stuffy, slow and without accountability.In March, she reached outside the toy industry to find a new leader for Fisher-Price, hiring Julie Masino, former CEO of the Beverly Hills bakery chain Sprinkles Cupcakes. In late May, she dismissed Mattel\u2019s head of human resources,       Richard Gros,        and is searching for a replacement. Mr. Gros didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mattel cruised through most of 2016 under the leadership       Chris Sinclair,        who was in the second year of a turnaround effort. But the company\u2019s fortunes reversed in the fourth quarter as retailers had far more Barbie dolls and other Mattel toys than they needed. Mattel had to pump extra money into retailers to clear merchandise. The fourth-quarter wiped out annual bonuses for top executives.Mattel hired Ms. Georgiadis for the job in January, passing over Chief Operating Officer       Richard Dickson,        who was given a $1 million retention bonus and $5 million in grants to stay on. Mr. Sinclair, meanwhile, moved into the executive chairman role, where he will collect a $1 million salary and remain eligible for bonuses.In securities filings, Mattel said it wanted to keep Mr. Sinclair on for continuity and institutional knowledge of Mattel, and Mr. Dickson for his marketing skills and oversight of brands. Still, current and former executives said they were frustrated by the lack of accountability regarding senior leaders who oversaw last year\u2019s holiday slide.Ms. Georgiadis is aware of the frustration, a person familiar with the matter said. But in a sign that the top two executives are working closely together, she shares the CEO office at the company\u2019s El Segundo, Calif., headquarters with Mr. Dickson.

Qatar has denied the allegations.Soon after the crisis erupted, residents of Doha emptied supermarkets to stock up on food items such as milk and chicken, before the government stepped in to quell concerns about potential shortages.\"There is a mode of fear everywhere you go,\u201d said       Manal Abdullah,        a 29-year-old citizen of Bahrain, who has been living in Doha for two years. \u201cI have personally bought about a month\u2019s supply of food items, just like everyone here.\u201dShippers that supply Qatar with food, clothing and electronics remain wary of accepting cargo to and from the country, brokers say.If the Arab sanctions remain in place for more than six months, inflation in Qatar could be twice as high as it would be if the crisis were resolved immediately, and the growth rate for Qatar\u2019s gross domestic product could be cut in half from 2016, to 1.1%, the Institute of International Finance estimates.The main index of stocks in the Qatari stock market has dropped more than 8% since June 4, the day before the decision was announced, through Tuesday, and Qatar\u2019s debt rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s, potentially increasing its borrowing costs.The dispute between Qatar and its Arab neighbors is fraught for the U.S., because Qatar hosts the largest American military base in the region.U.S. military officials have expressed concern over prospects for the base, saying current operations have not been interrupted or curtailed, but that long-term planning may be hindered.\u201cWe\u2019re watching that very, very closely, but we\u2019ve had good cooperation from all the parties to make sure that we can continue to move freely in and out of Qatar,\u201d Gen.       Joe Dunford,        chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified Tuesday at a Senate hearing on the military budget.Qatar has focused on ensuring that air and sea routes remain open. Its only land border is with Saudi Arabia.Qatar\u2019s main ports management company said it has established a direct shipping route between Doha\u2019s Hamad Port and Sohar Port in Oman, which has stayed out of the Gulf rift. The new shipping service will operate three times a week.\u201cThe company is keeping an eye on the developments and is well equipped to ensure that the country\u2019s requirements\u201d are handled, said Captain       Abdul Aziz al Yafei,        director of Hamad Port in Qatar.Some ships carrying Qatari liquefied natural gas to Europe, meanwhile, are bypassing the Suez Canal, even though Egypt hasn\u2019t closed the waterway for Qatari ships. Qatar, which depends on energy exports for a major chunk of its budget revenues, is the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG with a 30% market share.A Suez Canal official said the decision to change routes for some Qatari ships was \u201cprobably a message to Egypt that Qatari shipments don\u2019t really need the Suez Canal and can survive without it regardless of the cost.\u201dQatar Petroleum, a major oil company, on Saturday said its operations haven\u2019t been impacted by the transport ban.\u2014Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-seeks-new-air-sea-links-amid-rift-1497432605", "news_title": "Qatar Seeks New Air, Sea Links Amid Rift", "keywords": " bahrain, egypt, gulf rift, middle east rift, persian gulf rift,qatar, saudi arabia, uae,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014An esoteric requirement that bankers and some U.S. officials have long said discourages firms from participating in the derivatives market\u2014and makes the financial system less safe\u2014is on the regulatory chopping block.At a private meeting in Washington this spring, senior bankers from             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and other large U.S. financial firms pressed policy makers for changes to the rule. Their concerns were highlighted in a blueprint for a broad regulatory overhaul released by the Trump administration late Monday. The report from the Treasury Department recommends \u201csignificant adjustments\u201d to the capital requirement in question, among other changes to capital rules.The Federal Reserve, amid pressure from banks and some U.S. officials, has already begun laying the groundwork to ease the rule, according to people familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking. The Fed, which helped craft the rule, has yet to reach a decision on how exactly to refashion it, but is taking a fresh look at the measure, holding staff-level discussions with other regulators and teeing up a potential rollback late this year, as the Trump administration continues to fill regulatory posts with officials amenable to easing Obama-era rules. No decision is imminent, these people said.The rule calls for banks to hold additional capital against collateral, known as margin, that they collect from clients on certain swaps transactions. Banks and some U.S. officials say the rule makes it uneconomical for banks to participate in such transactions.Swaps are derivatives contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Companies use these contracts to hedge risks or make bets in such areas as fuel prices or interest rates.The swaps at issue are routed through so-called clearinghouses, entities that take fees to guarantee swaps transactions should one side of a trade go belly up. Banks, which pay to be members of clearinghouses, post margin to a clearinghouse on behalf of their customers. Banks manage the margin for the duration of the swap, which can be several years.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the multitrillion-dollar swaps market, hosted the April meeting where the bank officials and regulators raised concerns about the capital rule\u2019s effects on the swaps market. CFTC officials have warned for years that the existing requirements are driving banks away from the low-margin business of managing customers\u2019 cleared swaps.As fewer banks offer such services, that could increase prices for businesses that enter into these contracts to hedge business risks, CFTC officials say. As banks stop serving smaller clients because it doesn\u2019t make sense for them financially, the officials say, that undermines a key plank of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law requiring that most swaps be cleared.The rule the Fed is now thinking of relaxing is called the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio,\u201d which the central bank and two other banking regulators completed in 2014. The leverage ratio is one way of curbing bankers\u2019 risk-taking. It measures capital\u2014funds that banks raise from investors, earn through profits and use to absorb losses\u2014as a percentage of assets. By holding banks to a minimum ratio, regulators effectively restrict banks from making too many loans without adding new capital.Under the leverage ratio, U.S. banks must maintain capital equal to roughly 3% to 6% of any asset, including loans, investments and real estate. That includes the margin that banks hold for their customers\u2019 cleared swaps transactions.The leverage ratio itself has broad support, but many U.S. officials and industry executives have come to believe that the U.S. version is too strict when it comes to swaps margin. U.S. firms point out that the margin is legally \u201csegregated\u201d\u2014meaning banks can\u2019t touch the cash. Nevertheless, the leverage ratio increases the amount of capital banks must use to fund so-called swaps clearing activities.Acting CFTC Chairman       J. Christopher Giancarlo      has urged banking regulators to change the rule, saying collateral from bank customers should be excluded from the leverage calculation. He estimated easing the rule would significantly reduce capital costs for banks\u2019 clearing units, though he said those changes would translate into only a small capital reduction at the bank holding company level.\u201cThis dramatic reduction in costs on a service imperative to managing systemic risk in swaps is entirely worth the trade-off of a minuscule reduction in balance sheet protection,\u201d he said in a speech at an industry conference in Lisbon last month. \u201cThe financial system will be safer and more stable for it.\u201dMr. Giancarlo\u2019s message\u2014echoed by his Obama-appointed predecessor       Timothy Massad      \u2014has resonated with some at the Fed, including       Jerome Powell,        who recently took over as the central bank\u2019s regulatory point person. In public remarks, Mr. Powell has said the Fed ought to take another look at how the rule is calibrated, warning it can lead to \u201cexcess costs\u201d at banks.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of undermining that clearing mandate and the ability of smaller customers to get their products centrally cleared or to have access at all to hedging,\u201d Mr. Powell said at an April industry conference in Washington. \u201cI think we need to look again at the calibration of the leverage ratio in the United States for the large institutions, and I think there are a number of ways to get at that.\u201dThe Treasury Department agrees. In its report Monday, the administration recommended a series of possible changes to the capital requirements, from excluding customer margin from the leverage ratio to \u201crecalibrating\u201d the ratio so that it imposes less of an overall burden on banks.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-considers-easing-capital-rule-seen-as-hampering-swaps-market-1497432602", "news_title": "Fed Considers Easing Capital Rule Seen as Hampering Swaps Market", "keywords": "capital,cftc,clearinghouse,collateral,derivatives,dodd-frank,fees,margin,ratio,regulatory,supplementary leverage ratio,swaps,Federal Reserve,JPMorgan Chase &,JPM,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,debt,bond markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,financial investments,commodity contracts brokering,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "In a windowless conference room in Newark, NJ Transit officials recently discussed a rise in negative perceptions regarding service.\u201cYou hear from other outlets that\u2026NJ Transit is just a terrible operation,\u201d said Steven H. Santoro, executive director of NJ Transit. \u201cOur customers do not convey that. They have an understanding that things aren\u2019t going to go perfect all the time.\u201dIn the past few months, NJ Transit has encountered a series of small derailments and regular service delays, problems that stem from its dependence on aging, outdated New York Penn Station, according to an NJ Transit spokeswoman. Penn Station, the country\u2019s busiest station, is owned by Amtrak and shared with Long Island Rail Road.The run of NJ Transit problems have stoked rider ire on everything from delays to overflowing bathrooms and persistent overcrowding, on social media and elsewhere. NJ Transit commuters tried to organize a campaign to withhold fares from the agency in May. And a local talk-radio station has established a \u201ccommuter whiner line\u201d for riders to \u201crant and rave.\u201dAs Amtrak undertakes massive repairs this summer to fix its aging infrastructure inside Penn Station, extensive outages are expected, and a commensurate amount of service complaints are likely.NJ Transit\u2019s customer-service department has 117 full-time staff, eight customer-service locations around the region, a dedicated social-media team and call centers that take more than eight million calls annually. The agency handles about 65,000 customer contacts a year, according to NJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder.For the summer, NJ Transit is developing a set of enhanced customer-service initiatives, Ms. Snyder said, including 200 employee ambassadors to assist customers navigating the system during the morning and evening rush. This system has been implemented for past major events such as the Papal visit in 2015, she noted.\u201cAll front-line employees, including ticket agents and train crews, will also be familiar with the service plan to effectively respond to customer inquiries,\u201d Ms. Snyder said.David Spetgang, a 28-year-old who takes the train from Middletown, N.J., to Newark, recently was so frustrated with NJ Transit service that he wrote a letter to the agency. It was one of many customer-service inquiries he has made, then tweeted about, copying in other Twitter users who have made it a mission to heckle NJ Transit.NJ Transit customer service, while responsive, he said, \u201cis like a Band-Aid on a broken leg.\u201d\u201cNothing is ever taken seriously,\u201d said Mr. Spetgang, who works in financial services. \u201cIt\u2019s always, \u2018We\u2019re looking into this,\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019ve forwarded it on to another department.\u2019 It\u2019s never an actual answer.\u201dNJ Transit\u2019s Ms. Snyder said the agency \u201cis committed to responding appropriately to all feedback.\u201dMore riders are looking for answers. NJ Transit had a record number of customer contacts in March, with 72% of the 5,450 contacts categorized by the agency as complaints. Bus and rail gripes centered mostly on overcrowding and employee performance, according to the agency.NJ Transit reported that its \u201csocial sentiment\u201d online was 61.9% negative in March, a climb from February\u2019s negative rate of 56.5%.Comparing Twitter conversations about NJ Transit in May from the same month last year there was a 27% increase in negative posts, according to Networked Insights Inc., a social-analytics firm. Tweets about stressful commuting almost doubled, from 25% in May of 2016 to 48% in May of this year.\u201cActual customers who answered our most recent customer-satisfaction survey for the last quarter gave us the highest scores since the surveys began, six years ago,\u201d Ms. Snyder said.Negative social sentiment online is being driven, in part, by a number of popular NJ Transit specific Twitter users such as @F\u2014NjTransit, which uses the F-word vulgarity in the handle, and @FixNJT.Brian Woodward, who is behind @F\u2014NjTransit, is a 37-year-old fashion designer who works in Manhattan, lives in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., and commutes into Penn Station on workdays, riding in the quiet car of a train.He said he started the Twitter handle years ago with a friend to vent about lousy service. Now, the handle has taken on a humorous life of its own and tilted into public service, he said, as he tries to inform his followers about delays and pass along information he gets from sources inside NJ Transit.\u201cIt\u2019s like a full-time job now,\u201d Mr. Woodward said, during a phone interview. \u201cMy wife will be like, \u2018Can you put the phone down?\u2019 And then she\u2019s like, \u2018How many followers do you have now?\u2019 \u201dThe man behind @FixNJT is in his 50s, lives in Bergen County, works as a freelance editor and is regularly stuck at the Secaucus station, he said.

Officials also will release new projections for the economy and interest rates, and could announce their plan for shrinking the Fed\u2019s portfolio of Treasury and mortgage bonds. The central bank will release a statement\u00a0and the forecasts at\u00a02 p.m. EDT,\u00a0and Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       holds her quarterly press conference at\u00a02:30 p.m.\u00a0Here\u2019s what to watch for:As in previous years, the Fed and markets are at odds over the central bank\u2019s projected path of rate increases. Fed officials in March raised their benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 0.75% and 1%, and penciled in two more quarter-point rate rises this year. The new forecasts to be released Wednesday will show whether they are sticking to that story.\u00a0Investors, though, see a nearly 50% probability that this week\u2019s rate increase will be the last one this year, according to fed-funds futures data from             CME Group.       In the past, the Fed has eventually lowered its expectations to match market estimates.Investors will be particularly attuned to any new Fed information on its plans for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio\u00a0of bonds and other assets. Officials have laid out a tentative plan\u00a0to slowly let those securities run off the balance sheet as they mature. It is still unclear how long and gradual the Fed will want this process to be, or when it will begin. Expect to get a few more answers\u00a0Wednesday, either from the Fed statement or from Ms. Yellen during her press conference.How low can the unemployment rate go? In March, Fed officials anticipated it would end the year at 4.5%. It already is at 4.3% and still could fall farther.\u00a0Clearly, officials are going to have to revisit their employment projections for 2017. And they could lower their 4.7% estimate for the longer-term unemployment rate, the level that signals a fully healthy labor market. If they do, it might help explain why inflation pressures have been so muted.Inflation hit the Fed\u2019s 2% target in February after undershooting it for nearly five years, which appeared to validate officials\u2019 economic outlook. Since then, though, the personal-consumption expenditures price index\u2014the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge\u2014sunk back to 1.7% in April.\u00a0Officials say the recent drop is merely a temporary\u00a0phenomenon. But what if it isn\u2019t? Look to the statement and Ms. Yellen\u2019s press conference for clues about the Fed\u2019s latest thinking on sluggish price gains.Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman ends next February. But her term on the Fed\u2019s board of governors isn\u2019t up until 2024. In the past, Fed chairmen have stepped down once their term at the helm is up to avoid upstaging their successors. Ms. Yellen hasn\u2019t ruled out staying on if she isn\u2019t offered a second term as chairwoman. If she does, it would give President       Donald Trump       one less seat to fill on the seven-member Fed board. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t ruled out reappointing her, but isn\u2019t expected to do so.

This week, the regulator put pressure on the country\u2019s big banks to lend more to small companies and farmers, while the government announced tax breaks for financial institutions that lend to rural households. That follows recent guidance that banks should set up \u201cinclusive finance\u201d units.If the goal of lending to poorer customers sounds noble, the concern is that the execution will only worsen Chinese banks\u2019 existing problems, namely high levels of bad loans and swaths of mispriced credit. Bank lending to small companies is already growing pretty fast, with non-trivial sums involved: It jumped 17% in the year through March to 27.8 trillion yuan ($4.084 trillion). That compares favorably with the 7% rise in loans to large- and medium-size companies over the same period.But lending standards are set to get even looser. Banks have been told they should tolerate higher nonperforming loan ratios for small companies and agriculture-related lending, meaning they need to worry less about credit quality. The regulator also asked banks to keep interest rates on such loans at an \u201cappropriate\u201d level\u2014effectively allowing banks to ignore the proper pricing of risk.This all flies in the face of efforts to cull bad credit from the economy. Chinese banks are already given plenty of leeway to classify loans how they like: The new measures may only encourage them to avoid writing off bad debt. It isn\u2019t clear, either, how allowing small businesses and farmers to borrow even more will help China Inc. cure its addiction to debt-fueled growth.If banks were free to price loans in line with credit risk, more lending to poorer parts of the economy might improve their net interest margins. Chinese banks typically charge small- and medium-size enterprises around 8%-12% on loans, well above the benchmark rate. But if banks prove more lenient on lending rates, in line with the regulator\u2019s demands, even that benefit will be mixed.China\u2019s big banks have rallied an average 10% so far this year and are trading at 0.7 times to 0.8 times their book value.

Business surveys suggest that more rapid pace of growth has continued, and figures for industrial production released Wednesday back them up.The European Union\u2019s official statistics agency said output was up 0.5% from March, and 1.4% from April 2016. It also raised its estimate for March, and now sees growth of 0.2% rather than a contraction of 0.1%.Industry made only a modest contribution to first-quarter growth, with output up just 0.2% across the three months. But that was largely due to weakened demand for heating in response to a milder winter than is usual. There were signs in April that the second quarter will see more normal levels of output from the utilities, with energy production up 4.7% from March.Speaking last week, European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       presented an upbeat view of the eurozone\u2019s economic outlook, saying growth would likely be higher than previously expected over the coming years.But that \u201cstronger momentum\u201d wasn\u2019t showing up in the outlook for inflation, he said, as changes in the way the job market works have kept pay rises low.\u201cThe economic expansion has yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cTherefore a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation is still needed.\u201dIn a separate release, Eurostat said the number of people in work rose by 0.4% in the first quarter, the same rate of increase as in the final three months of 2016.

Another shareholder, Sydney hedge fund Tribeca Investment Partners, recently said it was holding private talks with potential candidates for BHP\u2019s board.In addition, wealth-management firm Escala Partners has questioned the credentials of BHP board members who previously served at companies where shareholder value was lost. Escala is an adviser to some of Australia\u2019s richest families who are BHP shareholders.Elliott stopped short of supporting a specific chairman candidate and a spokesman declined to comment on whether the hedge fund would push for board seats. BHP declined to comment on Elliott\u2019s statement or the search for a successor to Mr. Nasser, who plans to retire in 2018 after eight years in the role.Elliott said board members didn\u2019t prevent BHP from wasting billions of dollars by expanding into U.S. shale oil and gas as well as repurchasing shares at inflated prices. It also wants an independent review of the company\u2019s petroleum division and would like BHP to explore spinning off its U.S. energy operations.The hedge fund said the naming of a new chairman was an opportunity to unlock about $10 billion in tax credits in Australia by unifying BHP\u2019s dual-listed structure.Elliott, which first contacted BHP management last year, has a reputation for running dogged campaigns against its targeted companies. Last month, it secured three more seats on the board of Arconic Inc., a maker of aluminum products, after a five-month campaign that cited the need for accelerated cost-cutting.Also in May, Elliott lost a legal battle to remove the chairman of Akzo Nobel NV, which it tried to push into a multibillion-dollar merger with a rival.Elliott went public with its BHP spat in April. Executives say BHP regularly reviews its strategy and assets. Last month, Chief Executive       Andrew Mackenzie       said the company was considering the sale of some shale assets and had recently shifted focus toward more conventional oil and gas. He also said BHP\u2019s current strategy could increase the company\u2019s value by up to 50% and nearly double its return on capital.BHP has 11 people on its board. Several directors\u2014including former Orica Ltd. Chief Executive       Malcolm Broomhead       and current Westpac Banking Corp. Chairman       Lindsay Maxsted      \u2014were on the board for at least one of the two major shale-asset acquisitions in 2011.

Gov. Ralph Northam won Virginia\u2019s Democratic primary for governor Tuesday, in the most significant intraparty contest between the party\u2019s establishment and insurgent wings since Democrats\u2019 trouncing in the 2016 presidential election.In the Republican primary for governor, the party establishment was rattled anew by the disruptive forces unleashed by President Donald Trump\u2019s election. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who was heavily favored, won by just a single percentage point over Corey Stewart, the Virginia state chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Voters in both primaries rejected the extreme elements that have animated their parties since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Mr. Stewart, who was outraised five-to-one, couldn\u2019t win on a Trump-centric message, while Democratic former Rep. Tom Perriello lost despite support from liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.Mr. Northam in his victory speech in Arlington       \ufeff      promised to rally Perriello supporters and unite the party for a general election fight of national political consequence.\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring all Democrats under the tent starting tonight,\u201d Mr. Northam said. \u201cThis is the bellwether of the country. People are looking at Virginia to see what direction we are going.\u201dMr. Northam, a 57-year-old pediatric neurologist from Norfolk, has been preparing to run for governor since he won a promotion from the state senate to lieutenant governor four years ago.Long before Mr. Perriello made his surprise entry into the race in January, Mr. Northam had been crisscrossing the state amassing political chits for his 2017 campaign.It paid off with support from the state\u2019s entire Democratic political establishment. Gov.       Terry McAuliffe,        who is barred by Virginia law from seeking a second consecutive term, endorsed Mr. Northam and engaged his political muscle to back him. Every Democratic member of the Virginia legislature endorsed Mr. Northam, as did county chairmen in each of the state\u2019s 95 counties and 38 independent cities.Mr. McAuliffe hailed the victory of his lieutenant and framed the general election fight as a choice between building on his successes or advancing the Trump agenda.\u201cThe Republicans\u2019 divisive policies would put up a \u2018not welcome\u2019 sign in Virginia that is contrary to our values and bad for our economy,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said.Surprised by Mr. Perriello\u2019s entrance into the race, Mr. Northam was slow to tap into the Democratic Party\u2019s anti-Trump energy. He aired a television advertisement touting his accomplishments in state government and calling the president a \u201cnarcissistic maniac.\u201dWith virtually no support from Virginia\u2019s elected Democrats, Mr. Perriello turned to national figures to boost his campaign. Sen. Warren of Massachusetts cut a TV ad for him and Sen. Sanders of Vermont appeared at a Perriello campaign event in April.But Mr. Perriello\u2019s bet that he could expand the electorate in what is typically a low-turnout contest was hampered by the primary\u2019s June date\u2014after college students had gone home for the summer\u2014and the strength of the political establishment relative to the new groups formed in recent months to resist the president\u2019s agenda.In the Republican primary campaign, Mr. Gillespie largely kept his distance from the president, while Mr. Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County board of supervisors, campaigned as an unabashed Trump supporter, dubbing the former RNC chairman \u201cEstablishment Ed.\u201dMr. Gillespie vowed to be \u201ca governor for all Virginians\u201d and aired Spanish- and Korean-language TV ads. The Minnesota-born Mr. Stewart made headlines in April with a tweet decrying the removal of Confederate monuments.\u201cNothing is worse than a Yankee telling a Southerner that his monuments don\u2019t matter,\u201d he wrote in April.The unexpected nail-biter in the GOP primary was reminiscent of another big upset in the Virginia GOP. Rep. Dave Brat, a college professor, in 2014 rode the Tea Party wave of anti-establishment activism to topple House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the GOP primary. Mr. Cantor and his allies were ill prepared for the challenge, which was a also a low-turnout affair.Mr. Gillespie\u2019s supporters attributed the close margin Tuesday to Mr. Gillespie not engaging with or attacking Mr. Stewart during the GOP primary contest.\u201cEd Gillespie ran a positive race that didn\u2019t tear down fellow Republicans,\u201d said Pete Snyder, a Northern Virginia technology executive who lost a GOP primary for lieutenant governor in 2013.Turnout statistics pointed to the enthusiasm gap that strategists in both parties have noted across the country since the Trump election.With almost 90% of Virginia precincts reporting, just over 300,000 votes had been cast in the GOP primary and more than 450,000 had been cast in the Democratic primary.Write to Reid J.

Their class-action lawsuit alleged physical and psychological abuse as well as false imprisonment. On average, each inmate will get around A$37,000.\u201cThe people detained on Manus Island have endured extremely hostile conditions, but they will no longer suffer in silence,\u201d said       Andrew Baker,        a lawyer at Slater & Gordon, the firm that spearheaded the two-year lawsuit. \u201cMost were fleeing religious persecution and violence and came to Australia seeking protection, only to be denied their basic human rights.\u201dAustralian Immigration Minister       Peter Dutton       said in a statement that settling the case was considered more prudent than going ahead with a trial expected to cost millions of dollars in legal fees and last more than six months. As part of the settlement the government denied liability, arguing the camp was overseen by the Papua New Guinea government, according to       Rory Walsh,        lead lawyer on the inmate side.Australia\u2019s government recently admitted that Papua New Guinea soldiers opened fire indiscriminately at the Manus center in April, injuring nine people.\u201cOur voices have never been listened to but today we are finally being heard and I hope everyone\u2019s suffering can be over as quickly as possible,\u201d said the lead plaintiff, Iranian inmate       Majid Kamasaee,        in a statement released through lawyers.Rights groups and the United Nations have long condemned Australia\u2019s policy of intercepting migrants and asylum seekers at sea and sending them to camps in Nauru or Papua New Guinea while their refugee claims are assessed. Some have been held for almost four years.Late in the Obama administration, the U.S. agreed to resettle 1,250 of the refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka\u2014a deal derided as \u201cdumb\u201d by President Donald Trump after a contentious January phone call with Australian Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull.Though Mr. Trump threatened to pull out of the deal, the U.S. is preparing to accept the first refugees by September, said a report this week report by the U.S. Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors restricting immigration. About 850 people had been put forward by the U.N. as candidates, the report said, with decisions on the first 70 due within weeks, after an accelerated process that began with Department of Homeland Security interviews in May.The Manus center is scheduled to shut down in October, following a ruling last year by Papua New Guinea\u2019s highest court that detention at Australia\u2019s behest is unconstitutional. Detainees must be sent elsewhere or agree to settle in impoverished Papua New Guinea.Australia\u2019s top court last year ruled that detaining asylum seekers in third countries is legal, and the policy has wide support among voters there\u2014only 25% believe it is too tough, an Essential Media survey last month found, while 61% believe it is either correct or too soft.

With many new high-rise buildings casting shade for much of the day, more households want the courts to intervene to prevent potential blockages.\u201cThere needs to be rules, some process in place over how to deal with this,\u201d said Jenny Port, a gallery owner who has waged a seven-month battle to block construction of a 16-story apartment tower beside her inner city art space and home in Melbourne. \u201cRight now there\u2019s just nothing, no rights at all to the sun.\u201dIt is a problem reflected globally as adoption of solar technology outpaces regulators\u2019 ability to keep up.Governments for a long time have offered subsidies to stimulate demand for solar panels\u2014a move that helped developers to reduce costs\u2014among broader policies to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Now, prices of photovoltaic panels have fallen far enough for many households to attempt going off grid.Globally, the solar-power industry is expected to achieve a 10th straight year of expansion. IHS Markit expects capacity to grow to 79 gigawatts this year from 77 GW, despite lower demand in China and the U.S., the two biggest markets. The industry is worth an estimated 17 billion Australian dollars in Australia, where renewable-energy investors\u2019 dream of creating the \"Saudi Arabia of solar.\u201dAustralia has more panels on homes than anywhere else, even though it ranks sixth behind countries like Germany and Italy for overall installed capacity due to large takeup by offices and industry there. According to the Australian Energy Council, there are panels on 15% of households. Denman Prospect, a housing project near Canberra, Australia\u2019s capital, aims to become the first suburb to mandate panels on every new home.The fast adoption has attracted entrepreneurs. Tesla Inc. two years ago chose Australia for the global launch of its power-storing batteries.To operate effectively, solar panels require access to the sun during peak hours.But Ms. Port and her partner spent nearly US$3,000 installing eight PV panels atop their art space and home, only for their sunshine to be threatened by the proposed apartment tower.\u201cI realized we were going to get no sun. A lot of other local people have objected to these developments, but they still get built,\u201d she said.California introduced laws almost 40 years ago that protect homeowners\u2019 access to the sun, partly in response to the 1970s energy crisis. Now, 36 U.S. states and the U.S. Virgin Islands protect solar access to some degree, although only 15 have so-called easement laws that stop overshadowing.One of the most sophisticated solar-rights protection programs is in Boulder, Colo., where an ordinance sets limits on shading with a hypothetical \u201csolar fence\u201d extending up to 25 feet around a boundary in summer, shielding neighbors.But other countries have been slow to act. Germany, which has added around 7 GW of solar-energy capacity annually in recent years, doesn\u2019t guarantee unfettered access to sunlight.\u201cYou simply have to make sure your plot of land is so large new buildings can\u2019t block light for your solar cells,\u201d said Olaf Reidt, partner at Berlin-based law firm Redeker Sellner Dahs.Adrian Bradbrook, an expert in energy law at the University of Adelaide, said solar-rights disputes mostly occur outside equatorial latitudes, where the sun passes overhead in peak hours. Consequently, it hasn\u2019t triggered problems in crowded Asian cities like Bangkok and Jakarta.\u201cIt\u2019s a continual battle between development and other interests, particularly in temperate latitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. is really the leader. You can\u2019t just leave it to courts. At the very least [Australia] could have laws requiring municipalities to take [solar rights] into account.\u201dIn Victoria state, Planning Minister Richard Wynne said overshadowing was a problem in areas where homes and offices competed for land. Lawmakers were open to improving solar rights guidance to municipalities to help achieve a target for 40% of electricity needs coming from renewables by 2025, he said.Australia\u2019s Housing Industry Association fears additional red tape, however.\u201cHow can regulations deal with it without overly complicating it and leading to even more disputes?\u201d said Graham Wolfe, deputy managing director of the association, which represents developers.In smaller cities like Adelaide in South Australia, Mr. Wolfe said solar regulation could inhibit new projects that offer new jobs to offset factory closures.A group of Adelaide residents recently banded together in a court challenge to block successfully a four-story apartment complex that would have overshadowed 27 homes and a local community garden.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'A Fight for Sunlight Down Under.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 01:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/excuse-me-youre-blocking-my-sun-1497351606", "news_title": "Excuse Me, You\u2019re Blocking My Sun ", "keywords": "construction,development,energy,housing development,renewables,solar,IHS Markit,INFO,Tesla,TSLA,Adrian Bradbrook,Graham Wolfe,Olaf Reidt,Richard Wynne,machinery,building construction,residential building construction,real estate,industrial goods,renewable energy equipment"}, {"content": "The White House secretly sent a diplomatic mission to North Korea this week to recover a U.S. citizen who the Trump administration had learned was in a life-threatening coma, senior U.S. officials said, an episode that could inflame tensions with Pyongyang.The freed American, University of Virginia student       Otto Warmbier,        was sentenced early last year to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly defacing a political poster while on a private tour of North Korea. He arrived late Tuesday in Cincinnati, where his plane was met by ambulances, according to the Associated Press.The 22-year-old\u2019s dire health condition, U.S. officials said, risked escalating a standoff between Washington and Pyongyang, fueled by North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear-weapons program and repeated ballistic missile tests.Mr. Warmbier slipped into a coma more than a year ago, U.S. officials and members of his family said. North Korea told U.S. officials during a secret meeting last week that Mr. Warmbier first lost consciousness after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill, prompting a frantic week within the State Department to assemble a mission to retrieve him.U.S. officials said the administration and Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family are skeptical about Pyongyang\u2019s description of events, particularly because North Korea withheld any information on Mr. Warmbier for so long, despite repeated requests by the Obama and Trump administrations.\u201cIn no uncertain terms, North Korea must explain the causes of his coma,\u201d said       Bill Richardson,        a former member of Congress and onetime New Mexico governor who sent a delegation to North Korea last year to seek the release of Mr. Warmbier and other Americans currently imprisoned in the communist country.The Trump administration has been ratcheting up financial sanctions on North Korea in an effort to pressure leader       Kim Jong Un       to dismantle his nuclear program. China has been urging talks, while increasing its role in the rising U.S.-North Korean tensions.Under ordinary circumstances, the release of a detained American could ease hostilities. But Mr. Warmbier\u2019s health, and the circumstances behind his lapse into a coma, could undercut efforts to establish a diplomatic channel to defuse the nuclear crisis, current and former U.S. officials said.Former U.S. basketball star       Dennis Rodman       is visiting Pyongyang this week on what he has described as a peace mission. Senior Trump administration officials said they are worried Pyongyang could be trying to use the trip as a cover for returning Mr. Warmbier without taking responsibility for his medical condition.The White House denied Tuesday that it coordinated with Mr. Rodman on his trip, or that it is seeking to use him as a channel to Mr. Kim. Mr. Rodman has made at least three previous trips to Pyongyang and has met North Korea\u2019s dictator.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t put anything past the North Koreans,\u201d said a senior U.S. official briefed on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case. \u201cThe trip could complicate matters.\u201dAnthony Ruggiero, a former State and Treasury Department official, said, \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s reported treatment of Otto Warmbier is a dangerous escalation and shows that Kim Jong Un sees Americans as bargaining chips in its standoff with Washington.\u201dSenior U.S. officials said the Obama and Trump administrations repeatedly had sought information on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s health, using Sweden\u2019s Embassy in Pyongyang, but were rebuffed. President Donald Trump in February ordered redoubled efforts to gain the release of the four Americans, using all \u201cappropriate measures,\u201d officials said Tuesday, describing the sequence of events.The State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea,       Joseph Yun,        met North Korean diplomats in Oslo last month, where they agreed Swedish diplomats could gain access to the four imprisoned Americans. But Pyongyang didn\u2019t mention Mr. Warmbier\u2019s deteriorating health, U.S. officials said.It was only on June 6, when Mr. Yun talked to Pyongyang\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations in New York, that the U.S. was told of the American\u2019s condition.Senior Trump administration officials described a flurry of activity in the past week in which Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       ordered Mr. Yun to prepare to fly to Pyongyang to retrieve Mr. Warmbier. North Korea didn\u2019t give the green light for Mr. Yun\u2019s trip until the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter. Once there, the American diplomat confirmed the prisoner\u2019s condition and then ordered his medical evacuation back to Ohio.U.S. officials didn\u2019t mention whether threats were made against Pyongyang to gain Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release, but one person said that there was no quid pro quo and the North agreed to Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release on humanitarian grounds, given his health condition.Mr. Tillerson said in a statement: \u201cThe Department of State continues to have discussions with [North Korea] regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained.\u201d He added that the Trump administration wouldn\u2019t comment further.Kim Dong-chul, a Korean-American businessman, was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in April last year on charges of spying and stealing trade secrets.The other two detainees are affiliated with a university in Pyongyang set up by a Christian Korean-American businessman: Tony Kim, an accounting professor, was detained in April this year, while Kim Hak-song was arrested by North Korean officials in May.Both Mr. Richardson and the president of the University of Virginia, Teresa Sullivan, said Mr. Warmbier was in a coma, citing his family. Before his detention, the student had been on track to graduate from the UV this May.\u201cWhile the entire University of Virginia community is relieved to learn of Otto\u2019s release from North Korea, we are deeply concerned and saddened to learn from his family that he is in a coma,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said in a statement Tuesday.Mr. Rodman, one of a handful of U.S. citizens known to have met Mr. Kim since his elevation to the North Korean leadership, told CNN at Beijing\u2019s airport on Tuesday that he was hoping to do \u201csomething that\u2019s pretty positive\u201d with a sports-related \u201cmission\u201d in Pyongyang.During Mr. Rodman\u2019s last visit to North Korea more than three years ago, he sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Mr. Kim.The company sponsoring Mr. Rodman\u2019s trip to North Korea is PotCoin, a digital-payment network for marijuana transactions. While Mr. Rodman\u2019s visit was in no way official, the company nonetheless trumpeted his ties to President Trump as well as the North Korean leader, declaring in a release that the trip\u2019s purpose is to promote \u201cpeace and understanding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to spending time with the wonderful people of North Korea and of course, visiting with the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un,\u201d the news release quotes Mr. Rodman as saying.Mr. Rodman appeared on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d reality television show before Mr. Trump\u2019s election as U.S. president.Lecturing at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in March, Mr. Rodman said he would go back to North Korea \u201cif it meant helping\u2026our president.\u201d He added that Mr. Kim had expressed a desire to come to the U.S. to watch the New York Knicks play.\u2014Eun-Young Jeong in Seoul and Jon Kamp in Boston contributed to this article.Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com, Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Frantic Mission Freed American.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 00:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-frees-detained-u-s-student-1497364334", "news_title": "American Jailed in North Korea Returns Home After Mission to Free Him", "keywords": "basketball diplomacy,detainee,hard labor,nba star,prisoner release,rodman visit,student in coma,u.s. student freed,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,politics"}, {"content": "The first death of a Citi Bike rider in New York on Monday drew attention to the risks of the bike-share program at a time when cycling in the city is becoming more popular and safer.Dan Hanegby, a 36-year-old investment banker, was killed after his bike collided with a charter bus on 26th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues at about 8:15 a.m. Monday.Mr. Hanegby was knocked off the bike and crushed under the rear tires of the bus, according to the New York Police Department.A report in February by New York City\u2019s Vision Zero campaign to combat road deaths found that growth in cycling\u2014driven partly by the popularity of Citi Bike\u2014had contributed to making cycling safer because motorists are more aware of bikes.Bicycling trips rose to an average of 158 million a year in 2014 and 2015, a rise of 34% from the average between 2011 and 2013, the report found.Last year, the city installed a record 64 miles of bike lanes, of which more than 18 miles were protected.Monday\u2019s death was the first in over 41 million trips on Citi Bike in New York and only the second bike-share fatality in the U.S. The first death occurred last year when a 25-year-old woman in Chicago was involved in a collision with a truck.Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for Motivate, the parent company of Citi Bike, said the bike-share program\u2019s users in New York are, on average, involved in about 14 crashes a year that require \u201cserious medical attention.\u201d\u2014Paul BergerAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Bike Riding Is Becoming More Popular but Less Dangerous in NYC.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 00:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bike-riding-is-becoming-more-popular-but-less-dangerous-in-nyc-1497414551", "news_title": "Bike Riding Is Becoming More Popular but Less Dangerous in NYC ", "keywords": "biking in the city,citi bike,nyc bikers,New York Police Department,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "Investor anxiety over the Federal Reserve\u2019s likely decision to soon begin reducing its $4.5 trillion in assets stems in part from the unusual calm in the markets this year and a belief by many analysts the tranquility won\u2019t last.The Fed is trying to \u201cgo slowly and be very clear, but what is out of their control is how markets function,\u201d said       Julia Coronado,        president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and former chief U.S. economist at             BNP Paribas SA      . \u201cWe won\u2019t really know until we get the policy and markets have time to react.\u201dGovernment-bond yields have been falling this year and inflows into global bond funds last week reached their highest level in two years, helped by softening inflation, an abundance of foreign central-bank demand for Treasurys and diminishing prospects for new fiscal stimulus from the U.S. government, including changes in tax policy.A gauge of volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s MOVE index, settled Monday at 52.32, its lowest level since early August 2014. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed Monday at 2.206%, down 0.4 percentage point from early March.But a June survey by MacroPolicy Perspectives found most respondents believe the Fed\u2019s unwinding is only \u201cpartially\u201d reflected in Treasury and mortgage bond prices. About half said it is \u201cnot at all\u201d priced into credit and equity markets, despite Fed officials saying they want to get started this year.Fed officials are expected to divulge new details at the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting Wednesday about their plans to shrink the central bank\u2019s securities portfolio, also known as its balance sheet.Investors worry that a reduction in the balance sheet will increase the supply of Treasurys and mortgage bonds circulating in the market and could lower their prices. Analysts say that even small moves, including some the Fed says it is contemplating, could send ripples in a market that has grown accustomed to the buffering effects of a large, stable central-bank presence.The Fed must tread carefully because \u201cthere is a chance that rates move sharply higher\u201d if it moves too quickly to reduce the balance sheet, said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.To be sure, some analysts say they believe a well-communicated Fed policy shift will have little impact on bond markets.       Margaret Kerins,        head of fixed-income strategy at BMO Capital Markets, calculates that the yield on 10-year Treasurys will rise 0.42 percentage point through 2020, or 0.05 point for every $100 billion in bonds the Fed allows to roll off, assuming it reduces its assets by about $900 billion.But economic and market considerations aren\u2019t the only factors in the debate. Several bond dealers said in a May survey by the Fed that recent remarks by central bankers caused them to move their expectations for the Fed unwinding from 2018 to 2017.Janet Yellen\u2019s       term as Fed chair is scheduled to expire in February. Should the Trump administration move to replace her, its candidate could be going through confirmation meetings late in 2017, meaning it could be awkward for the Fed to push through policy changes around the same time, said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets.Other unknowns include to what extent the Fed will skip rate increases as it reduces the balance sheet, which could lead some investors to overestimate how cautious the Fed will be on lifting short-term rates over the near term.\u2014Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article.Write to Katy Burne at katy.burne@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Market Calm Has Some Unnerved.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-calm-unnerves-investors-awaiting-fed-shift-on-4-5-trillion-balance-sheet-1497412860", "news_title": "Market Calm Unnerves Investors Awaiting Fed Shift on $4.5 Trillion Balance Sheet ", "keywords": "balance sheet,bond yields,economic policy,federal reserve chairman,fed policy,investor anxiety,mortgage rates,u.s. bonds,Janet Yellen,Margaret Kerins,Julia Coronado,Gennadiy Goldberg,Michael Cloherty,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "With the Fed on track to announce a strategy for shrinking its big bondholdings, attention is shifting from how it will work to how it will affect financial markets: Will it be a snooze or a storm?Fed officials are hoping for the former, seeking to avoid a replay of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d that occurred when the prospect of declining central-bank bond purchases triggered global market convulsions, including big capital outflows and currency drops in emerging markets.Many analysts expect a modest effect on markets, a view shared by Fed officials who believe their ample guidance about their plans should limit any negative reaction. Some caution, however, that they see potential for turbulence if investors are too complacent about preparing for the Fed\u2019s plans.The Fed is likely to announce Wednesday, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, that it is raising its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point to bring it to a range between 1% and 1.25%, and signal that it expects about one more such increase this year.Fed officials have said for months they were discussing how to reduce the balance sheet, and in May outlined a proposed approach that would let increasing amounts of securities mature over time. They could announce the adoption of the plan as soon as Wednesday.The Fed\u2019s portfolio of assets grew to $4.5 trillion currently from around $800 billion before the crisis through a series of bond-buying programs aimed at lowering long-term interest rates. Allowing those assets to roll off could push up long-term rates.The Kansas City Fed estimated in early May that shrinking the holdings by $675 billion by 2019 would have the effect of a one-quarter-percentage-point increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark short-term interest rate. The Fed has raised the rate in three such increments since December 2015.A mid-May Wall Street Journal survey of private economists found half of respondents reckoned the wind-down process would boost the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by just 0.2 percentage point or less over time.A recent Fed board paper estimated that the expansion of Fed bondholdings since the crisis likely lowered the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by a percentage point from where it would otherwise have been. By 2023, the paper said, the yield would still be about a quarter percentage point lower, all else being equal, despite an anticipated shrinkage in the balance sheet.Fed officials welcome the markets\u2019 muted response so far. It \u201csuggests that there need not be a major reaction\u201d when the process actually starts, Fed governor Jerome Powell said earlier this month.The road could turn bumpier, however. Officials haven\u2019t revealed several key details that could influence the market effects, including when the process begins, its pace and the likely size of the balance sheet at the end.Some analysts worry about the disconnect between current easy financial conditions and Fed efforts to tighten them. Stocks have climbed recently, yields have fallen and volatility is low, despite recent Fed rate increases and plans for more.The gap could mean markets aren\u2019t ready for the Fed to start reducing its balance sheet.\u201cMarkets are overlooking both the Fed\u2019s resolve to normalize policy and the impact their receding from bond markets will have,\u201d Shehriyar Antia, chief market strategist with the Macro Insight Group, wrote to clients. \u201cThe longer it takes for market expectations to converge with the Fed\u2019s policy trajectory, the greater the potential for an abrupt price move.\u201dSome uncertainty about the effects of the wind-down stems from the operation\u2019s unprecedented scale. Before the crisis, the Fed bought and sold almost only Treasury securities to adjust short-term rates, and the relative size of those interventions was small.Also, shrinking the balance sheet is only one way the Fed is trying to reduce the economic stimulus it is providing as the recovery gains strength. Fed officials see the slow growth and ebbing inflation of recent months as likely to be transitory, but some outside analysts and investors aren\u2019t convinced.Some analysts note the process of unloading Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities markets could affect their relevant markets differently. While the Treasury market is vast and unlikely to be much affected by the Fed\u2019s action, the central bank\u2019s presence in the mortgage market is bigger.Dallas Fed President       Robert Kaplan,        a former vice chairman at investment bank             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       acknowledged the challenge in comments to reporters recently. \u201cWe would like to do this in a way that minimizes the impact on trading levels and the functioning of the Treasury market and mortgage-backed securities markets,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we can do that.\u201dAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Await Fed Balance-Sheet Moves.'", "news_time": "2017-06-14 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-await-fed-moves-to-trim-balance-sheet-1497412801", "news_title": "Markets Await Fed Moves to Trim Balance Sheet ", "keywords": " fed balance sheet, fed interest rates,u.s. federal reserve,The Fed,Shehriyar Antia,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news"}, {"content": "Worldwide advertising revenue growth is expected to decline slightly this year, dragged down by more traditional mediums like television and print and a slowdown in the U.S. and U.K.Excluding cyclical events like last year\u2019s Olympics and the U.S. elections, media owners\u2019 ad revenues are expected to increase 4.7% this year globally, compared with 4.9% growth in 2016, according to the latest forecast from             Interpublic Group of Co        IPG -0.28%      s.\u2019 ad buying group             Magna.        MGA 1.51%Media companies knew to brace for a slowdown generally this year given the $5 billion that Magna estimates they raked in last year from ads featured around events like the Summer Games, U.S. elections and Copa America soccer tournament. Including such cyclical events in both years, Magna predicts global ad revenue will rise 3.7% to $505 billion in 2017, compared with 5.9% growth last year.Petering growth in the ad market more broadly, while minimal, is symbolic of a broader shift in how advertisers are allocating their spending, as well as some particular trends in the U.S.In the U.S., advertising sales are expected to grow 3.4% in 2017, compared with 5.9% in 2016, not counting the incremental revenue from politics and the Olympics. \u201cThis represents the slowest rate of advertising sales growth since 2014,\u201d when the market grew by only 1.6%, Magna said in its report. (Including cyclical event spending, U.S. advertising sales are expected to grow 1.6%, compared with 7.7% last year)A weak first quarter in the U.S. set the scene for a potentially tough year ahead, with all non-digital media categories either declining or remaining flat compared with a year ago.In the U.S., national television took a \u201cbigger-than-expected hit,\u201d declining 4% in the first quarter. Out-of-home advertising was also unexpectedly weak. Magna also attributes the U.S. slowdown to an \u201cabrupt slowdown in economic activity.\u201dThere\u2019s also a big shift this year in how advertisers are budgeting.A record level of global ad growth in 2016 came from an influx of spending on digital media, as well as an increased amount of spending on linear traditional television, despite rising rates, said       Vincent Letang,        executive vice president of global market intelligence at Magna. Prior to last year, some large advertisers had been spending very little on paid social ads, so they started pumping more dollars into the medium, he explained. At the same time, a lot of those brands decided \u201cthey needed to maintain their TV exposure.\u201dNow, those advertisers are tightening their belts, especially on the TV front.Globally, TV ad revenues will be down for the first time since 2009, dipping 1% this year, as ratings erode and ad pricing cools, predicts Magna. TV grew 3.3% last year. TV will likely remain flat for the next five years, said Mr. Letang. Total offline ad sales, including television, print, radio and out-of-home, will decrease 2%.Linear TV will fare no better in the U.S., where it\u2019s expected to decline by 3% to $42.8 billion. In addition to \u201ca softening of scatter pricing,\u201d there\u2019s \u201cweak demand\u201d from big spenders in categories such as automotive, food and beverage and pharmaceuticals, according to Magna\u2019s forecast. (Stripping out politics and the Olympics, national TV will be down 1.4%, compared with a 1.1% increase in 2016.)There\u2019s good news for digital media, which is on track to surpass linear TV spending in 2017, thanks largely to a growth in mobile ad and search spending. Digital ad revenues will grow by 14% and reach $204 billion to assume 40% of total global ad sales, compared with 36% for television.Within digital, over 50% of ad sales are generated by impressions and clicks on mobile devices. Mobile advertising will account for over $100 billion for the first time this year, making it a larger category than print and radio combined.Next year, media companies can look forward to the return of the Winter Olympics in South Korea, mid-term elections in the U.S. and the World Cup in Russia driving 4.5% growth.", "news_time": "2017-06-14 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-advertising-growth-to-slow-slightly-this-year-1497412803", "news_title": "Global Advertising Growth to Slow Slightly This Year", "keywords": "Interpublic Group ,IPG,Magna International,MG.T,CA:MG,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,earnings projections,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,public relations,automotive,business,consumer services,media"}, {"content": "International Business Machines Corp.
