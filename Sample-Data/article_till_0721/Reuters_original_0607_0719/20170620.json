Kluber threw a three-hitter with 11 strikeouts, and Jason Kipnis and Carlos Santana both homered as the Cleveland Indians stretched their winning streak to six games with a 12-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The right-hander shut down Baltimore, allowing only three base runners all night. The Orioles never got a runner into scoring position as Kluber (6-2) did not walk anyone and mixed his pitches and locations skillfully.  (I was) just commanding pitches, really,  Kluber said.  I threw the fastball (to) both sides of the plate, and I think that opened up for the off-speed stuff when I needed to throw that.  This was his second shutout of the season, fifth of his career and Kluber's 12th complete game. He now has won three straight starts. His performance left the Orioles and manager Buck Showalter shaking their heads. Kluber threw 108 pitches -- 80 of which were strikes.  There's a reason why he won the Cy Young,  Showalter said.  Any time you can cut the ball, two-seam it, move the other way, then slow you down with something soft, (it's tough). He had everything working.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at OriolesCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchThe Indians (37-31) entered the game leading the American League in doubles (133) and banged out seven more -- along with a triple and the two homers -- to give Kluber more than enough offensive support. The Indians have scored 52 runs in their six-game winning streak. They finished with 17 hits, scoring four in the fourth and four in the fifth plus three more in the sixth and one in the ninth. It even could have been worse as the Indians stranded 13.  We did a lot of good things,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  We scored and then we kept at it and put our foot on the gas.  Cleveland knocked out top Baltimore starter Dylan Bundy (7-6) after 4 1/3 innings. He gave up six runs and six hits -- four doubles and a homer among them -- as the Indians made him throw 100 pitches. Bundy simply could not throw strikes the way he's done it for much of this season.  I wasn't commanding the ball at all tonight,  Bundy said.  Also, just poor execution.  Austin Jackson and Santana led the Indians with three RBIs apiece. Jackson contributed a two-run double plus a bloop run-scoring single, and Santana added a two-run homer and a sacrifice fly. Lonnie Chisenhall also drove in two runs and Jose Ramirez, picked as American League Player of the Week on Monday, added two doubles and a triple in a 3-for-6 night. Ramirez set a team record with his first double as he has hit doubles now in seven straight games. Kipnis had a solo homer in the fifth, the same inning as Santana's two-run blast. The Orioles (34-35) now have allowed at least five runs in 16 straight games. After a 29-minute rain delay before the first pitch, the Indians took command early thanks to back-to-back, four-run innings in the fourth and fifth, which gave them an 8-0 lead. Ramirez started everything with his one-out double off Bundy in the fourth, and Edwin Encarnacion followed with another two-bagger for a 1-0 lead. Chisenhall then made it three straight doubles and drove in the second run. Later in the inning, Jackson lined a two-run double to left that gave Cleveland a 4-0 lead. Kipnis then made it 5-0 when he led off the fifth with a long homer to right. Vidal Nuno replaced Bundy two batters later and allowed the two-run homer to Santana plus Jackson's bloop RBI double for the 8-0 lead in the fifth.  We've been doing a good job with driving the ball when we get out pitch,  Jackson said.  It's contagious; one guy does it, it kind of seems like it trickles down in the order.  NOTES: SS J.J. Hardy was officially diagnosed with a non-displaced fracture of his right wrist, and he should return in 4-6 weeks if everything goes well, said manager Buck Showalter. ... The Orioles moved back LHP Zach Britton's rehab assignment to Tuesday night at Aberdeen (short-season team) because of the rain on Monday. ... Cleveland LF Michael Brantley was put on the 10-day disabled list (right ankle sprain). ...

Though small, the issuance is a key first step in India's plan to revive a municipal bond market that saw its last sale in 2007. The funds raised will help pay for its ambitious  Smart Cities  project that aims to modernise 100 cities by 2020, including by improving water supply and transportation. Pune Municipal Corp sold the debt at 7.59 percent, raising 2 billion rupees  ($31.04 million) SBI Capital Markets, the sole arranger, said. That compared with around 7.40 percent for a similar maturity bond from Maharashtra state. The proceeds will be used to provide uninterrupted municipal water supply in the city, up from 4-6 hours currently. Bondholders will be paid interest from money raised from property taxes. Although India is planning to spend up to 48 billion rupees in its Smart Cities project, it needs cities such as Pune to raise up to 75 billion rupees from bond investors. Pune plans to raise a total of 23 billion rupees in the year to March, while New Delhi and Hyderabad are among other cities looking to raise debt, bankers and analysts said. Subodh Rai, senior director and head analytics at CRISIL Ratings, said it was important for India to develop its municipal bond market.  We are talking billions of dollars that need to be poured into urban infrastructure, and municipal corps cannot be dependent on the state or central governments to fund all of these projects,  he said. India has seen only 11 billion rupees worth of municipal bond issuance over the previous two decades, according to think tank Pahle India Foundation, which estimates only 1 percent of urban bodies' requirements are funded by municipal bonds compared to around 10 pct in the United States. Seeking to change that, capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India this year eased rules for cities selling bonds, while the government has said it will subsidise part of the interest payments. But many challenges remain, with bankers and analysts warning most cities in India typically have antiquated or opaque accounting methods, while infrastructure projects suffer from frequent delays or cost overruns that can jeopardise the ability to pay bondholders.  Most municipal corporations will not be able to raise the required amount of money from capital markets based on their balance sheets,  said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist and director of public finance at India Ratings.

The city's real estate bubble, buoyed by low interest rates, limited supply and mainland money, is stoking unrest. Incoming Chief Executive Carrie Lam promises more affordable housing. It's better policy that's in short supply. A typical apartment in the former British colony now costs 18 times the annual median salary, making it the least affordable housing market in the world by far, according to Demographia. Despite efforts to cool the market, home prices hit a record high for the sixth straight month in April, up nearly a fifth year on year. This has aggravated social inequality and added to political discontent, leading to massive protests that rocked the city in 2014. Graphic: Hong Kong high rises: reut.rs/2sMJytO     Lam is right to focus on the city's massive public housing programme, which serves almost half of Hong Kong's 2.5 million households. Low-income families can apply for public rental housing while a Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) allows eligible middle income households to buy government apartments at a discount. The idea is that families can move up this  housing ladder  into private ownership.     But the system is overstretched. Our Hong Kong Foundation estimates under 100,000 new public housing units will be completed over the next five years, far short of the 140,000 target. As of March there were over 147,000 applicants waiting for rental housing. The average wait time has jumped to 4.6 years, up from less than two years a decade ago.     Bad policies have played a role too. HOS flats are sold at a discount of 30 to 40 percent of the market rate, so many families can now no longer afford them. And while these flats can be later re-sold, owners must first repay the value of the subsidy, called a  land premium,  to the government. Bizarrely, land premiums are pegged to market prices, so they too have soared. This makes exiting public housing prohibitively expensive for many, trapping them on the bottom of the ladder.       Lam has made the usual pledges during her campaign, such as boosting supply. She's mentioned an additional home ownership scheme. But details are scarce.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Cincinnati Reds ended a nine-game losing streak Monday night with a 7-3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, and how they did it made it even better. Scooter Gennett hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and doubled and scored the go-ahead run in the eighth, pulling away instead of letting one get away.  We really needed to get the monkey off of our back,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It's one of the most satisfying wins we've had.  The Reds (30-39) had taken a 3-0 lead on Gennett's two-run homer only to see the Rays (37-36) rally to tie it on Daniel Robertson's two-run shot in the seventh. But Rays reliever Jose Alvarado faced three batters in the eighth and all three scored. Gennett had a leadoff double and scored on Joey Votto's RBI single. Adam Duvall walked, and reliever Danny Farquhar gave up a two-run single to rookie Jesse Winker for a 6-3 Reds lead. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RaysCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchVotto singled again in the ninth off Farquhar and eventually scored on a wild pitch.  There were a lot of good things,  Price said.  There's no quit in this bunch and they came out and played a great game when we really needed to get a win.  Michael Lorenzen (4-2) gave up Robertson's tying home run in the seventh but picked up the win in relief. Jake Odorizzi (4-4) took the loss for Tampa Bay.  I shouldn't have walked Billy Hamilton. That's the fastest guy in the league,  Odorizzi said of the batter immediately preceding Gennett's home run.  I got behind and he barreled it up. When hitters are in control of counts, they can do more damage.  The Rays got a solo home run from Steven Souza -- his second in two games -- to start their comeback in the sixth, but the bullpen couldn't keep it close. Cincinnati took a 1-0 lead in the fifth inning when Scott Schebler crushed a solo home run to right field. The homer was his 19th this season. Until that shot, Odorizzi had held the Reds scoreless on two hits in the first four innings. Cincinnati starter Scott Feldman got himself in and out of jams in the early innings, matching Odorizzi in keeping the game scoreless. Tampa Bay had two singles in the second, but Feldman got Rays newcomer Trevor Plouffe and Robertson out to end the inning. Mallex Smith had a single in the third but was caught stealing to end the inning. The Rays had the bases loaded with one out in the fourth, only to see Plouffe ground into an inning-ending double play. Rays shortstop Tim Beckham left the game after being hit on the left hand by a pitch in the fourth inning. Beckham stayed in as a runner but was replaced in the fifth, with Robertson sliding from second to short and Taylor Featherston taking over at second. Beckham is day to day with a bruise, but X-rays were negative and he hopes to return in the next few days.  I definitely thought it was worse when it first happened,  Beckham said after the game.  I couldn't hardly squeeze my glove so I knew I wasn't going to be able to swing the bat.  NOTES: INF Trevor Plouffe made his Rays debut as the designated hitter, batting seventh and grounding out to the pitcher with two on and one out in the second inning. He singled in the seventh and scored. Plouffe, 31, was acquired from the Oakland Athletics on Saturday after being designated for assignment. Plouffe hit .214 with seven home runs for Oakland this season. To make room for him, the Rays designated INF Mike Martinez for assignment. ... The Reds made four roster moves, placing SS Zack Cosart (strained right quad) and RHP Bronson Arroyo (strained right shoulder) on the 10-day disabled list. With two openings, the Reds recalled rookie OF Jesse Winker from Triple-A Louisville and used him as the DH, batting seventh. Winker hit a two-run single to extend the Reds' lead in the eighth inning. ... The Reds also recalled RHP Ariel Hernandez from Double-A Pensacola.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED6KTRI6S6"},

Speaking at an annual forum in Shanghai, Zhou focused on broad reforms and competition, but did not discuss more immediately pressing policy challenges like managing the yuan exchange rate or balancing efforts to  de-leverage  the economy and encourage growth. Zhou said some people keen to limit foreign participation in the financial sector were  focused on their own interests  and not doing Chinese financial institutions any favors.  From the experience of many countries, including our own, protections will lead to laziness and weakness... protectionism will lead to weak competitiveness and will hurt the industry's development, and (make for) unhealthy and unstable markets and institutions,  he said. The financial services industry had benefited from opening up, and must continue to do so, he said at the start of the Lujiazui Forum in China's finance hub. While the government has opened parts of the financial sector to foreign participation, non-Chinese firms still face a range of restrictions on both investment and business. Analysts say the risks to China's financial sector and the broader economy have grown as debt has soared. Maintaining healthy financial institutions was key to defending against a financial sector crisis, Zhou said. As part of efforts to lift the yuan's status as a globally significant currency, China's long-planned international payment system for cross-border yuan settlement would  soon  be based in Shanghai, Zhou said. The China International Payments System, or CIPS, would replace a patchwork of networks and allow hassle-free yuan payments. China has been keen to turn the yuan into a global currency, but its efforts have been stymied by a string of capital control measures aimed at easing depreciation pressure in recent months. The yuan lost about 6.5 percent of its value against the dollar last year and economists had expected further depreciation this year, but capital controls, a weaker dollar and other steps by the authorities have bolstered the value of the Chinese currency.

Amazon plans to keep the natural grocer's high standards, Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey said, adding,  They’re not stupid enough to go change that.  The filing contained a transcript of a town hall meeting for Whole Foods employees. But Mackey, at the Friday town hall, said,  Over time, there could be other formats that evolve that - that might - wouldn't be branded Whole Foods Market, potentially, wouldn't be our standards.  The remarks offered a preview into how e-commerce giant Amazon might turn around the sluggish sales of Whole Foods since announcing on Friday it would buy the company for $13.7 billion, including debt. Industry observers have said that Amazon may add a selection of discounted, non-organic food to distance the chain from its  Whole Paycheck  nickname. Whole Foods already has a separate store, called 365, which offers private-label goods and lower prices than its typical formats. The company has needed to tread a fine line between introducing more conventional and affordable products, while maintaining the allure of a premium brand.  That’s their dilemma,  said Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group. Mackey is  being pulled both ways.

Amazon, which made a splash last year with a checkout-free grocery store, has said it has no plans to automate the jobs of Whole Foods cashiers. Technology is just one way Amazon stands to change Whole Foods and its culture, though.

Rates on 14-day repos climbed to 5.3 percent on Monday, their highest late April, showing that a large gap remains between the supply of funding and demand from banks. Liquidity conditions are typically tight in China in June due to tax payments and as companies look to make their balance books look healthier at the end of the month and quarter. A rigorous quarterly inspection by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is also prompting banks to hoard cash. This year, a regulatory clampdown on riskier forms of financing, particularly between banks and non-financial institutions, has created additional strains on the system.  Liquidity is tight toward of the end of the month, and there's high demand for borrowing that spans into next month, which is why you see the 14-day rates are pretty high,  said a trader at Xiuwu Rural Commercial Bank, a small lender in China's central Henan province, who is borrowing 100 million yuan ($14.64 million) from the market for 1-14 days. But she said the PBOC's recent money injections had helped to ease market stress. The PBOC injected a net 110 billion yuan into money markets on Monday through a combination of seven-day, 14-day and 28-day reverse repos, traders said, bringing net injections through regular open market operations since the end of May to 540 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations. That is in addition to an injection of 498 billion yuan into the financial system through the PBOC's medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans earlier in June, more than offsetting the 431.3 billion yuan of MLF loans maturing this month. The PBOC had been actively draining funds from the system earlier in the year and has been pressing banks to deleverage as part of a concerted campaign by Chinese authorities to contain risks in the financial system from a rapid buildup in debt. The closely watched three-month Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) was at 4.74 percent on Monday, just four basis points below a two-year peak last Wednesday. The three-month SHIBOR rate has risen more than 45 percent since the beginning of 2017, eclipsing the PBOC's benchmark lending rate of 4.35 percent.  Because of the liquidity injections by the PBOC, we have seen the market sentiment improving over the past couple of weeks, but if the imbalance between assets and liabilities cannot be solved, we still see strong pressure on SHIBOR,  said David Qu, market economist at ANZ in Shanghai. Rapid expansion of lending by mid-sized banks over the past several months has eaten up their liquidity cushions, forcing them to turn to an increasingly expensive interbank market for funding, Qu said. The rise in SHIBOR rates this year has been accompanied by a rise in rates paid for Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs). These short-term debt instruments, favored by smaller banks, are not yet included in the PBOC's Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA), the quarterly inspection of banks' books. The rate on three-month AAA-rated NCDs was at 4.8461 percent on Monday, according to data from the China Foreign Exchange Trading Service (CFETS), hovering near two-year highs of more than 5 percent last week. Zheng Lianghai, an analyst and Dongxing Securities, said that higher NCD issuance despite high borrowing costs shows that  some banks are quite desperate for money.  Despite the squeeze on borrowers, market observers don't fear a cash crunch like that in June 2013, as they expect the PBOC to continue to supply necessary liquidity to the market. Some China watchers believe the squeeze three years ago had been triggered at least in part by the PBOC's efforts to encourage more de-risking at a time when conditions were already seasonally tight. The resulting spike in borrowing rates roiled domestic and global financial markets. But there is a risk in banking on continued PBOC support, said Qu.  I think the market may be relying on the authorities' relaxation, or the PBOC's liquidity injections, too much,  he said, noting that deleveraging remains a priority for regulators in the medium term.  Sooner or later they will start deleveraging again ... you cannot win a bet on relaxation.

Chinese with at least 10 million yuan ($1.47 million) of investable assets hit 1.6 million in 2016, up from 180,000 in 2006, according to the 2017 China Private Wealth Report by Bain Consulting and China Merchants Bank. The overall value of the private wealth market increased to 165 trillion yuan in 2016, growing at 21 percent annually in 2014-2016. But the growth rate of China's private wealth market is expected to decline to 14 percent in 2017 to a total size of 188 trillion yuan. Around 120,000 HNWIs had at least 100 million yuan worth of investable assets, up from less than 10,000 people in 2006.  The percentage of HNWIs with overseas investment increased to 56 percent in 2017, up from 19 percent in 2011, but the overall percentage of assets invested overseas has stabilized since 2013.  The top five destinations for overseas investment were Hong Kong, the United States, Australia and Canada although Hong Kong's popularity fell 18 percent and the United States dropped 3 percent from 2015 to 2017.  Respondents said their top three reasons for investing overseas were to diversify investment risks, to capture market opportunities of overseas investments and to migrate. Sixty-three percent of rich Chinese rely on financial service providers to manage their domestic financial assets and among them, around half use private banking services provided by commercial banks.  China's wealthy are concentrated in major cities and coastal areas, the survey found, but now 22 Chinese provinces have at least 20,000 HNWIs. Most respondents said their top priorities. were  wealth preservation  and  wealth inheritance , in contrast to 2009 when nearly half of HNWIs surveyed said  wealth creation  or  quality of life  were their main goals.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

He sold his father's land and fish farm and also borrowed money from banks and relatives to pay S$17,000 ($12,000) in fees to multiple agencies who helped arrange the job and his trip to the island state early last year. But in December, his employer told him that there wasn’t enough work and he was laid off from a job doing a range of tasks, such as directing traffic around building sites, and operating excavators. Islam was given a month by Singapore's Ministry of Manpower to find another job but, unable to do so, he returned home still owing S$6,000. He had only earned S$5,000 during his time away – based on basic pay of just S$18 a day and overtime of S$3 per hour. For Singapore, a system of temporary labor to do many jobs in the construction, shipping, manufacturing and service industries – including hotels and restaurants - works as an effective buffer. When times are good it means Singapore can fill jobs that would otherwise be vacant but when the economy is weak and unemployment rises – as has been happening in the past year - it is easy to cut back on foreign workers. However, for the workers it is a brutal system that can leave them in big debt and regretting they ever made the move to Singapore.  I go back for what? No fish, no land. I go back or die, same-same,  Islam said in an interview just before heading back to Bangladesh. Islam’s former boss, Maqbool Ahmed Khan, who owns building company Elchim Construction Services, confirmed the Bangladeshi's story. Khan said he faced a  market slowdown  late last year, without elaborating. The Singapore Contractors Association Ltd. and The Association of Singapore Marine Industries declined comment. Singapore's Ministry of Manpower said the agency fees foreign workers incur in their home countries are beyond its jurisdiction.  We hope that source countries would do more to address the issue of high agency fees incurred, and we will refer cases to their embassies here for follow up where appropriate,  it said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Islam, 25, is among thousands of migrant workers, mainly from Bangladesh and India, who left Singapore's shipyards and building sites last year because of a 30 percent contraction in the marine sector largely related to a drop in demand from the energy industry, and a downturn in construction. It was the first year since 2009 when the number of low-skilled jobs taken by foreigners fell here. Reuters interviewed around two dozen Bangladeshi workers who were laid off recently in Singapore, and many of them provide similar pictures of growing hardship. Many face agency fees that cost between 26 and 51 months of their total basic wage in Singapore, and they leave the island with heavy debt burdens. To be sure, many workers still in jobs say they are happy with their working conditions and are motivated by success stories of fellow countrymen who built homes and started businesses back home after working for a few years in Singapore. While conditions are tough – many live 12 to a dorm room and work 12 hour days with only one day off a month – it is still often much better than the alternatives in Bangladesh. Hussein (L), a Bangladeshi worker who said he lost his job and has to return home, packs his luggage at Changi Airport in Singapore March 28, 2017.Edgar SuThe number of work permit holders in Singapore, excluding domestic workers, fell by 12,600 to 753,000 in 2016, with most of the losses in the construction and shipping industries, according to the Ministry of Manpower. But two diplomats from countries that are a source for such workers say they are taking the brunt of the contraction. Singapore does not disclose the breakdown of nationalities of its migrant workers, but the Bangladeshi High Commission's labor councillor Ayesha Shelly estimates its workers in Singapore decreased more than 30,000 last year to some 120,000.  Every day my staff are in the airport sending workers back,  said David Leong, managing director of Singapore-based recruiting agency PeopleWorldwide, adding that the number of workers he supplied to shipyards last year dropped 40 percent. Slideshow (4 Images)This is likely to have an impact on Bangladesh's economy because remittances are the nation’s second-biggest source of foreign income after garment exports. Bangladesh’s remittances fell more than 11 percent in 2016 to $13.6 billion, according to the nation’s central bank, with much of the decline because of the impact of lower energy prices on Middle East employment. Myriad of Middlemen     Workers say there are not many established recruiting agencies for Bangladeshis, and many job seekers rely on a myriad of middlemen and brokers who share recruiting, training and transportation and then split fees, making it difficult to properly regulate the industry.  At least 98 recruiting agencies have been suspended over the past decade for alleged wrongdoings such as fraud and trafficking, according to a senior Bangladesh government official.  People easily fall prey to recruiters who promise them higher paying jobs,  said the official in the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment. A broker, who declined to disclose his name, said his company charges around 1 million taka ($12,400) in fees but doesn't think they are charging too much, as the cost covers basic job training, language support and transportation. And even those who have had one bad experience in Singapore seek ways to come back.  My agent told me I would have to pay $5,000 to get back this (Singapore) job. How can I take that risk again? What if I lose the job after one year,  asked Ataur Rahman, who was laid off last year and came back to Bangladesh with 300,000 taka ($3,716) of debt. He is now looking for a cheaper way back, he says.

A Commerce Department investigation found that exporters from China had sold hardwood plywoods used for wall panels, kitchen cabinets, tabletops and flooring in the United States for as much as 114.72 percent below fair value, the department said in a statement. The department preliminarily set an anti-dumping margin of 114.72 percent for Shandong Dongfang Bayley Wood Co Ltd and a margin of 57.36 percent for other respondents eligible for a separate rate. A rate of 114.72 percent was set for other Chinese producers who belong to a China-wide entity, the Commerce Department said in a statement.  Mandatory respondent Linyi Chengen Import and Export Co Ltd was determined not to be dumping and was not assessed an anti-dumping margin, the department said. As a result of the decision, the Commerce Department will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits from the firms based on those preliminary rates. Linyi Chengen will not be subject to a cash deposit rate. The Commerce Department said a final determination in the case was expected around Aug. 31. The investigation was launched after the Coalition for Fair Trade in Hardwood Plywood initiated a complaint on behalf of itself and its members, six private firms in Oregon, New York and North Carolina. The Commerce Department issued a preliminary finding in April that the plywood firms were being subsidized by Beijing and should be subjected to countervailing duties ranging from 9.89 percent to 111.09 percent. It calculated preliminary subsidy rates of 111.09 percent for Shandong Dongfang Bayley Wood Co and 9.89 percent for Linyi Sanfortune Wood Co. A final decision in that case is due in early July.

The dollar rose to 111.775 yen at one point, reaching its strongest level since May 26. That marked a gain of about 2.7 percent from the dollar's near 2-month low of 108.81 yen set last Wednesday. The greenback last stood at 111.685 yen, up 0.2 percent on the day. The dollar was lifted on Monday when New York Fed President William Dudley said that tightening in the labour market should help drive up inflation. That helped offset concerns among some investors that stubbornly low inflation could prevent the Fed from raising interest rates further this year. Dudley's comments reinforced the message from last week's Fed meeting and gave a boost to the dollar, said Teppei Ino, analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore. The dollar is now near some key technical resistance levels, including its May 24 intraday high of 112.13 yen, Ino said.  It's sort of at a crossroads now. If it gets through these levels, that could open the way for further gains, at least from a technical perspective,  he said. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again. The greenback has edged higher since the Fed raised interest rates last Wednesday and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities later this year, while indicating that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar rose to as high as 97.609 at one point on Tuesday, its highest level since May 30. The euro held steady at $1.1145, having retreated from a 7-month peak of $1.1296 set on June 14.

Andy Home","keywords":"Canada,China,United States,US,CHINA,STEEL,AHOME,Commentaries,Steel,International Trade,China (PRC),Economic Events,Copper,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,English,Government Borrowing Requirement,Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Regulation,United Kingdom,Reports","sector":"","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - China's exports of steel product have fallen sharply over the first few months of this year.  The January-May total was 34.2 million tonnes, down 26 percent on last year's equivalent figure and the lowest read since 2014.  The year-on-year drop in tonnage terms was 12.1 million, which is roughly what Canada, the world's 17th-largest producer, churned out over the full 12 months of 2016.  The only recent historical comparison for such a dramatic and sustained drop in steel exports was 2009, when demand in the rest of the world was imploding in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  So what's happening this time around?  Is this a sign that China's much-hyped capacity closure program is finally starting to bear fruit?  The rest of the world's producers would love to think so  but the evidence suggests things are a little more complicated.  Graphic on China's monthly exports of steel product:  tmsnrt.rs/2rMrdIc Capacity Down, Production Up Beijing does targets well and it's already way ahead of its goal for steel capacity closures this year.  A total 42.4 million tonnes were shut in the first five months of this year, representing 85 percent of the 50-million-tonne target, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. That follows 65 million tonnes of closures last year and brings the running count to over 100 million tonnes, now well within the 100-150 million range originally promised by China over a five-year period.  The only problem is that these shutdowns have had no discernible impact on steel production.  China produced 72.78 million tonnes in April, an all-time record. Production eased very slightly to 72.26 million tonnes in May but that was still the second-highest production month after April.  This counterintuitive outcome is down to what exactly has been closed.  The initial round of capacity elimination appears to have included a large amount of non-productive capacity, an easy win for producers and local governments looking to fall into line with the new national policy.  A second focus has been on induction furnace operators. Such producers, using scrap rather than iron ore as their input and frequently accused of manufacturing sub-standard product, are largely unapproved and therefore  illegal  in the eyes of Beijing.  For that reason they are also unreported. Millions of tonnes might be in the process of being closed but you won't see any ripple in the national production figures since they were never counted in the first place.  What is visible, though, is the resulting jump in profitability of the official steel sector.  The margin on construction-grade steel rebar has surged more than 800 percent this year to around 1,100 yuan ($162) per tonne in early June, according to data tracked by brokerage CLSA.  With that sort of money to be made, it should be no surprise that China's steel producers are running faster than ever before.  Stocks Down, Demand Up But quite evidently higher production has not fed into higher exports.  Is there some form of voluntary restraint at work here?  After all, China has recently been the subject of unprecedented political pressure to rein back its steel exports.  Trade cases are piling up thick and fast. The European Union has just initiated another set of duties on Chinese steel, these ones on hot-rolled flat products, and the two entities are still dueling over the broader issues of Chinese overcapacity and, in Europe's eyes, over-exports.  Meanwhile, the mother of all sanction packages is looming in the United States, where the Trump administration has been investigating steel imports on national security grounds. The so-called Section 232 probe is nearly done, according to U.S. officials. China might reasonably be expected to have taken some of the heat out of the diplomatic storm by stemming the flow of exports.  Yet there is absolutely no sign of any build-up in steel inventory within China as might be expected if exports were being massaged by policymakers. Local consultancy Steel Home estimates that stocks of rebar and flat products such as cold rolled coil have been falling in line with  normal  seasonal patterns.  Interestingly, those of rebar have fallen harder and faster than those of coil, attesting to a broader divergence in fortune between those mills servicing the construction sector and those feeding the manufacturing sector. While the latter has been showing signs of weakness, construction is still booming.  True, there are all sorts of warning signs flashing in terms of overheating prices in parts of the country's residential property sector. But investment in real estate, one of the broadest indicators published by the National Bureau of Statistics, is still running at an annual growth rate in excess of 6 percent, as has been the case since the most recent stimulus package kicked off at the start of last year.  Graphic on real estate investment: tmsnrt.rs/2tjvwN8 For How Long? How long it can continue doing so is the subject of much debate among analysts.  The consensus narrative is that the construction sector will start losing momentum imminently before entering a period of much slower growth over the second half of this year.  A caveat to the consensus is that the strength and durability of the 2016 stimulus package have already surprised many commentators. But neither building activity nor those supercharged profit margins are going to run indefinitely.  At some stage there will be a slowdown, which will feed quickly into the steel sector, and super-quickly if it coincides with seasonal weakness over the coming summer holiday season.      Don't expect China's steel producers to adapt supply fast enough. Their track record is poor when it comes to adjusting production to changes in demand tempo.  Rather, the pattern has tended to be for demand weakness to lead to falling prices, margin compression and accelerated exports.  Current low export levels are first and foremost down to strong domestic demand.  If that fades, Beijing's control over its leviathan steel sector and those politically toxic export flows is going to be put to the real test.

The farmers of TR Crop Watch – which features weekly, real-life check-ins with two farmers in Illinois and one in Minnesota – are currently expecting average to above average yields for this year’s corn and soybean harvest.  The Illinois corn is now just three weeks away from the start of pollination and soybeans there should also begin their reproductive stage in the next several days. Weather over the next couple weeks will be important to place the crops in the best possible condition to begin this crucial period. The Minnesota crops should enter these stages about three weeks later.  Average-to-cooler temperatures are expected across the entire Corn Belt for the next week, with the weekend ushering in highs up to 15 degrees below normal. These temperatures are generally favorable for the Illinois growers, particularly where it is dry, but the Minnesota-based farmer would rather see slightly warmer weather to facilitate continued development for both his corn and soybeans. Rainfall is also likely to be below average over the next week, which is of least concern for Farmer B but of most concern to Farmer C, whose crops could come under further stress as a result. The growers - known as Farmers A, B and C - will assign a condition score every week to each field, similar to the system used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ratings are: excellent – 5, good – 4, fair – 3, poor – 2, very poor – 1. They will also give their best estimation of yield potential. The yield ratings are: yields well above average – 5, slightly above – 4, average – 3, slightly below – 2, well below average – 1. Farmer a – East Central Illinois Farmer A corn, June 12 versus June 18: (reut.rs/2thmhx5) Farmer A soybeans, June 12 versus June 18: (reut.rs/2rL3A2Z) As of June 18, Farmer A’s Champaign County, Illinois, corn stands just over 4.5 feet (1.4 m) tall compared with 2 feet (0.6 m) a week earlier. This field received two rain events last week – some 1.5 inches (38 mm) early in the week and 0.2 inch (5 mm) on Saturday. The next week of weather looks mostly favorable for A’s corn, though he notes the crop will certainly need another rain in 10 days. In about 2.5 or three weeks, he expects this field to tassel – which is the beginning of the pollination period. A’s soybeans have reached 11 inches (0.28 m) by June 18, representing growth of 5 inches (0.13 m) on the week. The plants should begin flowering next week as they enter the reproductive stage. Farmer A now rates his crop conditions and yield potential at a 3 all around. Last week, he assigned both corn and soybeans a 4 score on condition, but with some milder weather and the potential for a good shower to end the week, he might be more satisfied with the state of his crops next week. Farmer B – South Central Minnesota Farmer B corn, June 11 versus June 18: (tmsnrt.rs/2thRujS) Farmer B soybeans, June 11 versus June 18: (reut.rs/2ti0Uf3) Farmer B’s corn reached 22 inches (0.56 m) in height by June 18, which is 10 inches (0.25 mm) taller than the week before. This field received about 0.8 inch (20 mm) of rain within the last week. He expects that his Freeborn County corn field will begin pollination around July 20 – which is later than in the previous two years. B’s soybeans are likely to begin flowering in early July and will be setting and filling pods toward the end of the month. His soybeans are now up to 8 inches (0.2 m) tall compared with 5 inches (0.13 m) on June 11. The cooler-than-average temperatures forecast for the coming week are not ideal for B’s beans, as he would prefer high temperatures at or a bit above 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C). The expected high temperatures in the 70s F – and possibly below at the end of the week – are also a little cooler than Farmer B would prefer for his corn, but he is just happy at this point that he has thus far avoided severe weather, which is common in Minnesota in June and usually his biggest concern this month. As of June 18, B left his corn and soybean condition rating of 5 and yield potential score of 4 unchanged from last week. Farmer C – Southeastern Illinois Farmer C corn, June 11 versus June 18: (reut.rs/2rKGhGy) Farmer C soybeans, June 11 versus June 18: (reut.rs/2sI0OQM) Farmer C’s Crawford County, Illinois, corn field has had the most challenging weather of the six Crop Watch fields as rain has been largely elusive for the past month. Corn plants in his sample spot stand just over 4.5 feet (1.4 m) tall versus 3 feet (0.9 m) the previous week, but some plants on lower-quality soil in the same field stood only 3 feet tall as of June 18. His corn received a total of only 0.6 inch (15 mm) over the last week, which started out very hot. A midweek shower and cooler temperatures to finish off the week provided relief, but it will not last long without more rain. C downgraded his corn condition and yield potential to 3 as of June 18 from 4 the week prior because the crop is short of moisture. C’s soybeans are not as visually stressed as his corn, and he notes there is still a lot of time yet for the beans. The plants grew about 2 inches (51 mm) within the week and now stand up to 14 inches (0.36 m) tall. He has noticed some blooms forming on the bean plants already, meaning that flowering is likely around the corner. C is still somewhat optimistic about his soybeans as he left the condition and yield rating of 4 unchanged from last week. Farmer C’s corn is about three weeks away from the tassel stage, and without abundant rain in the forecast, he expects that yield potential will continue to shrink. The expected lack of extreme heat in the days ahead and particularly the well-below-average temperatures toward the weekend will certainly help, but if the sun is out too much and there is no rainfall, corn leaves will continue to exhibit stress by rolling up. He also notes that soybean fields in his area – particularly those with drier soil types – will likely start showing signs of stress by next week if the forecast for below-average rainfall in the coming days is realized.

In Cambodia, a single mother is separated from her two children, arrested and locked up in prison. On the dry savannahs of Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul, farmers shoot dead a 26-year-old indigenous man in broad daylight. In Bangladesh, a university professor receives death threats from an al Qaeda-inspired militant group. Mysterious disappearances, political murders, the killing of women, gangland hits: thousands of cases, seemingly unrelated, are reported every year from all corners of the globe. Evidence suggests the number of dead is soaring - and  political scholars and activists believe they are connected. They say people are dying protecting their land and homes from global industry's relentless push to develop the natural resources beneath their feet with the bloodshed a direct product of a phenomenon dubbed 'necropolitics' or 'politics of death'.  Women Worst Hit According to global watchdogs, resource-rich Honduras and Nicaragua are the world's deadliest countries for land deaths per capita, while Brazil tops the list in sheer numbers. And women - often at the frontline of conflict defending home and children - accounted for more than half of the dead.  Subhabrata 'Bobby' Banerjee, professor of management at the University of London's Cass Business School, has studied global development projects and the people who resist them for more than 15 years.  He says academic colleagues have built the Environmental Justice Atlas, a global database of conflicts over natural resources and development, which shows numbers climbing.  Right now there are more than 2,000 reported hot spots around the world,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   The reality is that there are probably three times that number which are not reported because they are not sexy and don't make TV news.  Can the Dead Be Counted? During an interview in his office among the glass towers of London's financial heart, Banerjee said much of this violence unfolds in the former colonies of sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Asia, where the law has ceased to function. Criminal gangs, mercenaries and extremist groups step in to this vacuum of law and order, he says, creating a kind of  death world  by deciding who will live and who will die - and entire communities can be forcibly removed. Banerjee says in many parts of the world, the dual roles of the state - to encourage economic development and protect citizens - can become  schizophrenic .  If a state is in a joint venture with a mine which involves dispossession or forcible displacement, what are the conflicting interests?  he said.  At one level you have to create jobs, collect taxes, while at another you have to kill your citizens to make that happen.  Watchdog groups, including Front Line Defenders (FLD), Global Witness, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, say last year was easily the deadliest on record for activists trying to defend their homes and environment.  This year is on track to be much worse. More than 1,000 citizens in 25 countries were murdered, harassed, imprisoned or intimidated while fighting for their community's rights in 2016, according to FLD. Of 281 recorded deaths, half were attempting to defend their homes and land. Global Witness researchers told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that its newest report, due for release next month, will reveal another climb in the death toll and is expected to eclipse the dramatic 59 percent rise seen between 2015 and 2016. Andrew Anderson, executive director of FLD, said a global project - HRD Memorial - was launched this year to document violence that often unfolds in remote areas so goes unrecorded. The partnership of 20 organizations - including national rights monitors from countries including Brazil, Uganda and the Philippines – will also examine deaths that had been officially attributed to crime so as to identify which ones were, in fact, the slaying of human rights defenders over land. The coalition hopes this exercise will provide a more realistic picture of the extent of violence related to land.  We know that the scale of the problem is immense, despite severe barriers to documentation. Access to remote areas, lack of adequate police documentation at the local level, and fear of reprisals all make reporting difficult for local communities,  Anderson said.  In the vast majority of cases documented in 2016, killings were preceded by warnings, death threats and intimidation which, when reported to police, were routinely ignored.  Collusion So far this year, monitoring groups in Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines have verified the murder of 88 land rights defenders - more than four a week - in just three countries. Comité Cerezo México reported 30 killings between January and May 31, Karapatan in the Philippines documented 26 deaths between January and March, and Somos Defensores registered 32, also to May.  This trend shows that despite increased attention on human rights defenders (HRDs), there remains almost blanket impunity for the  masterminds of these assassinations  and their hired guns, said Adam Shapiro, FLD's head of campaigns. Shapiro said increasing numbers weren't surprising but 88 murders in less than six months should not only be a cause for extreme alarm but should compel authorities to act.   In health terms we would be referring to this as a pandemic, but, unlike a virus, the killing of HRDs is intentional and criminal,  he said. Speaking from Paris this month after field trips in South East Asia, Michel Forst, the United Nations rapporteur on human rights defenders, said he believes the numbers represent  the tip of the iceberg .  The attacks are becoming stronger: this is not random violence but deliberate attacks to eliminate those who are trying to protect their land and their traditions. In some countries it is a war, collusion between powerful interests, corruption and organized crime and companies,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Many communities, including indigenous communities, are affected around the world but we don't know exact numbers because information comes through NGOs and so many are alone, working unprotected.  With violence escalating, the global corporate world is also becoming acutely and increasingly aware of the reputational – and economic risks – if they are linked with the abuses. In April, an analysis by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), which monitors 7,000 companies in 180 countries, found  clean  energy projects are battling with the industry's unforeseen toll of human rights conflicts.  The sector - which includes growing markets in solar and wind energy generation - is struggling with legal costs and reputational risks incurred by companies' needs to accumulate large areas of land, said BHRRC. Researchers questioned 50 companies in a report that revealed only 10 percent of companies referred to U.N. standards on free, prior and informed consent when negotiating with communities whose land they want. Experts say the cost - in both dollars and lives - is encouraging renewable energy companies to learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors in fossil fuels and mining. A study by Harvard's Kennedy School and Australia's  University of Queensland examined conflict between mining firms  and communities in 2014, finding companies wrote off up to $379 million in assets and $1.33 billion in projected reserves. Forst said his report, due to be released later this year, will focus on business and on identifying ways to ensure the defenders are protected. He said some corporations, including the U.S. jeweler Tiffany and the Italian energy giant ENEL, are already doing some pioneering work in this area.  ENEL has a policy which recognizes the role of defenders,  he said.  If they feel that a group of defenders or indigenous communities don't want to talk to them or refuse to consult, they will simply stop immediately.   Many others are very aware of the problem and, if not trying to solve it, are at least participating in discussion.  Gregory Regaignon, Research Director at BHRRC, said there is a chasm between a few leading companies taking meaningful steps and the much larger group of laggards.  These companies treat social impacts as a voluntary menu, picking and choosing issues where they can undertake corporate philanthropy and, at worst, think these actions somehow diminish their responsibility to do no harm.  False Narratives Nor is the world's media much help, according to Ariadna Estevez, professor at the Centre for Research on North America at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  Its  obsession  with framing violence through a lens of organized crime, gangs and drugs means the public and policymakers are misled, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Analyses of migration patterns from countries such as Honduras reveal a clustering of criminal, misogynistic and political violence which can be directly linked to forced migration and displacement from resource-rich areas. Estevez argued this cannot be coincidence and asks why, if gang violence is the chief driver of migration across Central America, the number of Honduran displaced persons increased nearly 600 percent in 2015, while gang-related murders fell, according to a 2016 report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.  Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that development projects are historically among the greatest drivers of displacement, with an estimated 15 million people pushed off their land a year since the mid-2000s, according to the most figures cited by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.  Criminal violence, while potent, is just part of a dangerous cocktail that serves to 'cleanse' places where local communities are defending their home territory,  Estevez said. And this failure to grasp the true causes means government policy on migration is often doomed to fail, Estevez added. U.S. investment in projects designed to discourage migration by stimulating the 'Northern Triangle' of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, may well have the opposite effect, she added. By financing one-off infrastructure, rather than creating sustainable local projects, investors may in fact further spur land grabs that in turn accelerate migration, she said. Who Is a Target? Amnesty International's Secretary General Salil Shetty says global leaders are dismantling legal protections for land  defenders to organize and stand up for communities' rights.  What we are witnessing today is a full frontal assault by governments, armed groups, corporations and others on the right to defend human rights,  he said in a statement last month. Yet the murder of activists represents only the most direct outcome of state policies designed to clear resource-rich lands of populations to make way for development, said Estevez.   Deadly situations  can arise alongside murder, she said. Denying access to the lands that have fed communities for generations threatens lives as does the forced transfer of local populations to new and often dangerous workplaces, such as mines or mega construction sites.   The murder of women - who often choose to spearhead high profile campaigns to protect their communities - should also not be written off as a  private  crime, unconnected to government or gang violence, Estevez says. In Latin America, for example, data from Front Line Defenders and Global Witness shows the region now accounts for half the world's deaths. And more than half of last year's global roll call of the dead were women. New Frontiers From diamonds, gold and silver in Africa to precious woods in Latin America to the fertile farmland of Southeast Asia or the coal mines of India and Bangladesh, the modern world's demand for natural resources is insatiable. It is often in the most remote frontiers, areas that are poorly understood, where development mega-projects - many financed by western financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund - deliver the greatest danger to local communities.  The U.N. Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to  life, liberty and security  and that nobody can be arbitrarily deprived of their property. Worldwide, experts estimate about one billion people live and work land without secure property rights. Without legal protection, communities are vulnerable and live with the constant risk of wrongful eviction or forced displacement. Banerjee said the vacuum of law and order created in these so-called  states of exception  can also unfold in big cities, for example in the sweatshops of New Delhi or migrant-dominated industries and illegal sweatshops of New York, London and Paris. Increasingly, clashes are also erupting over urban land needed for residential growth in the world's developing cities. In some global cities like Lagos, valuable city center and waterfront land has become a war zone. Banerjee insisted it was too easy to blame globalised capitalism, adding that in socialist-led economies of countries such as Venezuela or Bolivia – which is now headed by the indigenous politician and activist Evo Morales – people are also being forced off land and killed to make way for development.  The model is the same but instead of the capitalist killing people, you have socialist governments which have made dissent illegal,  he said.  Instead of the money going to multinationals, these nations are using it to build roads, hospitals, schools,  he said, but wealth accumulation by dispossession was  pretty much the same . Experts said the lightning rod for clashes is increasingly reserves of as yet untapped 'tech metals', including lithium, cobalt, cadmium and rhodium. Generally rare, the metals are needed to make miniaturized computer equipment, advanced weapons systems and clean and renewable energy storage, such as solar panels and batteries. The market is growing every year.  In the first months of 2016, lithium prices trebled after electric car maker Tesla announced plans for a $5 billion lithium ion battery plant in Nevada known as a  gigafactory . The new plant will produce more lithium ion batteries each year than were produced worldwide in 2013, massively boosting demand for the light metal. The price spike for lithium also sparked a battle between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia – known as the 'lithium triangle' – to prove who could offer the most business-friendly environment. The stampede of corporations vying for a stake in the market spans from North America to Europe, Latin America to Australia. The dark side of the lithium boom: a race to exploit the world's biggest reserves, which lie beneath the Bolivian salt flat of Salar de Uyuni, and could end traditional salt mining. Cobalt is another tech metal which is found 10,000 miles across the equator in the impoverished Democratic Republic of Congo where 60 percent of the world's cobalt lies buried. Cobalt is needed in energy storage and is integral to the green technology revolution but its extraction has sparked fears of violence in a nation with a history of weak governance and bloody conflict over resources. In September, a Washington Post investigation revealed more than 100,000 men work underground, using just their hands and simple tools, to produce the metal needed for products such as Apple's Iphones. It said deaths and injuries were common. All the global watchdog organizations agreed that the fight against mining projects is now the most dangerous form of activism, although the newest figures also suggest a marked upturn in killings related to forestry and logging. More than 20 Park rangers and forest guards were murdered last year alone, according to Global Witness and signal a dangerous new front to watch. Private Violence Market Academics and activists said in many parts of the world, violence has flourished due to a blurring of responsibilities between the state and corporate sector. This is best exemplified by an increasing reliance on private security forces to maintain law and order. Half the world lives in countries that employ more private security workers than public police officers, according to research funded by the Washington-based Pulitzer Centre for Crisis Reporting. Their analysis covered 40 countries, including China and the United States. The global market for private security services, including private guarding, surveillance and armed transport, is now worth an estimated $180 billion, forecast to hit $240 billion by 2020.  Speaking in his London office in front of an Australian Aboriginal flag, Banerjee said private armies are no longer the exception, but the norm. Increasingly the security personnel used by big corporations are better funded and resourced than traditional police forces or national military, he said.  However unlike their publicly funded counterparts, private armies are not accountable to the state or international law, leaving victims of violence vulnerable to injustice. Old Fights The concept of necropolitics - the politics of death - was coined by a Cameroonian philosopher, Achille Mbembe, in 2003. Mbembe argued that while in many western nations, the state alone has the right to kill - and only to safeguard life and maintain law and order - in other regions, particularly developing, post-colonial nations, the state is not the only purveyor of violence.  In Africa, states use the fear of death to maintain control, often through private militias whose power can be bought and sold in the market place, Mbembe wrote. His 'politics of death' also encompassed social death, including racial or gender exclusion, persecution, apartheid, slavery or political violence.  Other scholars - from Mexico to Slovenia - have adopted and adapted it to shine light on their own cultures.  Students are now taking this approach to Peru, Chile, Brazil and India, as well as Eastern Europe, said Banerjee. In many parts of the world where natural resources are fuelling developing economies, indigenous communities are hamstrung because they do not have the legal right to refuse proposed developments, according to environmental lawyers. Both Forst and Banerjee said in most places they have studied - particularly Australia and India – negotiation between developers and indigenous communities focus on conditions under which the mining proceeds, not on whether it should ever happen.  It is always about ‘how many jobs, how many hospitals, how many schools, how much tax, how much royalties',  he said.  The question has never been 'can mining proceed at all?'  Until they have a veto option, he says, communities will not be able to decide whether to allow exploitation of their resources, let alone organize a resistance to unwanted projects. Big money, however, is beginning to talk, according to Anne Simpson, a director of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages $300 billion in assets. She said that for her long-term U.S. investors, human rights in the renewable energy sector is now fundamental to what projects they back - for both moral and financial reasons.   More community engagement must be fostered to ensure that the transition to renewable energy truly benefits communities and does not create undue risk for investors,  she said in a speech in April.  Estevez, Banerjee and Forst all believe the system of self-regulated corporate social responsibility (CSR) needs a rethink. They argue there is more than an echo of old colonial trade arrangements when big companies in powerful cities stepped in to take on state responsibilities offering healthcare, education, sanitation and infrastructure in return for access to resources.  For the well-meaning liberals in the West, it's all about 'inclusion'. The communities I speak with, they don't want to be included. They want to be left alone,  Banerjee said.  The violence of the last 50 years has clearly shown who bears the brunt of development and who does not. So I think the discourse has to change from CSR and inclusion in development, to the right to say 'no' to development.  Regaignon, of BHRRC, said many companies tried to assess and respect the human impact of their investments.  The best companies include intense stakeholder engagement based on respect for communities’ rights through the entire life of the project, from planning to end use,  said Regaignon.  However, one of the most alarming things we found was that even companies with strong commitments on paper, face serious allegations of harms to communities on the ground.  Ultimately, the option for communities to veto development must always be on the table, he said, and companies must  respect their decision if they do not grant their consent.   In the 2014 Harvard report examining the cost of land conflicts to the mining industry, lost staff time managing such clashes was cited as the most overlooked corporate bill.  Such conflicts can easily escalate - and then come the major advocacy campaigns and law suits which certainly do show up on the corporate ledger,  wrote Professor John Ruggie. Conflict and bloodshed over resources in new frontiers, concluded Banerjee, is not new to human history. The difference between the past and the 21st century is the advent of corporate social responsibility CSR programs, he says.  The mining industry is a good example: if you look at these conflicts, every single company involved in these conflicts has won awards in CSR, have published sustainability reports, these companies tick all the boxes for good practice,  he said.  Then the question is why are people being killed on their mining sites? Something is obviously flawed.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the three major futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 51 million barrels in the week to June 13 (tmsnrt.rs/2rMOh9T). Fund managers cut their net long position for the second week running by a cumulative total of 91 million barrels, according to data published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2shCOmq). Portfolio managers also cut their net position in gasoline by 13 million barrels and heating oil by 19 million barrels last week (tmsnrt.rs/2shNukU and tmsnrt.rs/2rMooXW). Hedge funds have discounted the fact oil prices are already under than $50 per barrel and reassurances from OPEC ministers that global oil stocks will draw in the second half of the year. Instead they have focused on the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and signs gasoline and diesel demand may not be growing fast enough to absorb the record fuel being produced by U.S. refineries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts global oil stocks will draw down in the third quarter of 2017 as a result of OPEC’s output cuts. But global stocks are expected to rise again through 2018 as OPEC compliance deteriorates and supply from non-OPEC sources increases. Bearish sentiment among oil traders has triggered a wave of short selling, with hedge funds adding 45 million barrels of extra short positions in crude, as well as 15 million in gasoline and 16 million in heating oil. There are signs hedge funds may have embarked on the eighth cycle of short-selling in WTI since the start of 2015, though it is still too early to tell. The only supportive factor for oil prices in the short term is that so many short positions have been established and there are relatively few long positions left to liquidate. Conditions are in place for an eventual short-covering rally but the rebound may not come until there are clear signs global stocks are falling and U.S. shale drilling is leveling off.

The White House wants to update government information technology systems, cut costs, eliminate waste and improve service. Trump on Monday cited estimates that the government could save up to $1 trillion over 10 years through such measures.  Our goal is to lead a sweeping transformation of the federal government’s technology that will deliver dramatically better services for citizens,  Trump said.  Government needs to catch up with the technology revolution.  The executives are part of the so-called American Technology Council that Trump formed in May to support efforts to modernize the U.S. government.  “The U.S. should have the most modern government in the world. Today it doesn’t,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said he wanted the Trump administration to make use of commercially available technologies, worker retraining, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Before meeting with Trump, the CEOs met in 10 small group sessions with Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, along with the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ohio State University. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, said the administration wanted to  unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before.  He said the administration was scrapping unneeded regulations for government computing systems, such as a rule on preventing Y2K issues. Most of the government's 6,100 data centers can be consolidated and moved to a cloud-based storage system. U.S. President Donald Trump participates in an American Technology Council roundtable, accompanied by Tim Cook, CEO of Apple (L) and Satya Nadella CEO of Microsoft Corporation at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 19, 2017.Carlos BarriaThe White House is seeking to shrink government, reduce the federal workforce and eliminate regulations.  Trump in March signed an order to overhaul the federal government and tapped Kushner to lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions. Many of the tech executives are eager to get White House help in dealing with regulatory and other policy issues such as visas for highly skilled workers. Slideshow (13 Images)Others attending include Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr and the CEOs of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O). Facebook (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg was invited but could not attend because of a conflict, the company said. A 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report estimated the U.S. government spent more than $80 billion in IT annually, excluding classified operations. In 2015, the U.S. government made at least 7,000 separate IT investments and some agencies were using systems that had components at least 50 years old.  This structure is unsustainable,  Kushner said. Visa Program The CEOs and White House also planned to discuss Trump's review announced in April of the U.S. visa program for bringing high-skilled foreign workers into the country. Cook plans to raise immigration, a person briefed on the matter said Sunday. The council also seeks to boost the security of U.S. government IT systems and wants to learn from private-sector  practices. In 2015, hackers exposed the personal information of 22 million people from U.S. government databases. The White House thinks it can learn from credit card companies about significantly reducing fraud. A 2016 government audit found that in Medicaid alone there was $29 billion in fraud in a single year. Following Trump's June 1 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords, Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Robert Iger stepped down from White House advisory panels. White House officials said the dispute had little impact and that they had to turn away tech leaders from Monday's event because of lack of space.

This would be the biggest deal ever for EQT  as it looks to expand its natural gas business. Rice Energy's shares surged almost 27 percent to $24.95 in afternoon trading, but below the $27.05 per share offered by EQT. EQT's shares were down 7.6 percent. The deal would put the combined EQT-Rice ahead of Exxon Mobil Corp as the nation's biggest gas producer. U.S. energy firms are pumping money into gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. The United States should soon become the world's top natural gas exporter.  EQT appears to be empire building,  analysts at Mizuho said in a report, noting they expect EQT to begin monetizing Rice's midstream assets by dropping them down to EQT Midstream Partners, which could raise $1.3 billion. EQT said it would be able to drill longer horizontal wells in Pennsylvania after the deal as most of the acquired acreage is next to where EQT already drills or owns land.  EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in Marcellus/Utica,  said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.  EQT needs a lot, and Rice offers a lot of what it needs.  EQT has been buying acreage in the Marcellus shale field, with some of the cheapest gas in the country. Most recently it picked up 53,400 acres in the field from Stone Energy Corp. EQT said the acquisition would increase its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000. The deal would also give the company access to Rice Energy's midstream assets, including a 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT will take on about $1.5 billion in debt. Rice Energy shareholders will receive $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share they hold, EQT said. The offer translates to a price of $27.05 per Rice Energy share, representing a premium of 37.4 percent to the stock's Friday closing price, according to Reuters calculations. Citigroup was EQT's financial adviser, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz were its legal advisers.

The new rating is in line with the long-term AA- credit rating that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (NAB.AX) have from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the three major futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 51 million barrels in the week to June 13 (tmsnrt.rs/2rMOh9T). Fund managers cut their net long position for the second week running by a cumulative total of 91 million barrels, according to data published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2shCOmq). Portfolio managers also cut their net position in gasoline by 13 million barrels and heating oil by 19 million barrels last week (tmsnrt.rs/2shNukU and tmsnrt.rs/2rMooXW). Hedge funds have discounted the fact oil prices are already under than $50 per barrel and reassurances from OPEC ministers that global oil stocks will draw in the second half of the year. Instead they have focused on the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and signs gasoline and diesel demand may not be growing fast enough to absorb the record fuel being produced by U.S. refineries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts global oil stocks will draw down in the third quarter of 2017 as a result of OPEC’s output cuts. But global stocks are expected to rise again through 2018 as OPEC compliance deteriorates and supply from non-OPEC sources increases. Bearish sentiment among oil traders has triggered a wave of short selling, with hedge funds adding 45 million barrels of extra short positions in crude, as well as 15 million in gasoline and 16 million in heating oil. There are signs hedge funds may have embarked on the eighth cycle of short-selling in WTI since the start of 2015, though it is still too early to tell. The only supportive factor for oil prices in the short term is that so many short positions have been established and there are relatively few long positions left to liquidate. Conditions are in place for an eventual short-covering rally but the rebound may not come until there are clear signs global stocks are falling and U.S. shale drilling is leveling off.

In my opinion, market fundamentals are going in the right direction, but in light of the large surplus in stockpiles over the past years, the cut needs time to take effect,  he told the newspaper, referring to a global deal to curb oil production.  Current expectations indicate the market will rebalance in the fourth quarter of this year, taking into account an increase in shale oil production,  he said. Asked about the recent drop in oil prices, Falih said:  Markets determine prices but are themselves driven by unpredictable variables beyond the control of producing nations.   Short-term volatility is mostly a reaction to short-term factors ... as well as the role of speculators in stock markets that increase market volatility.  Oil prices dipped on Monday, weighed down by a continuing expansion in U.S. drilling that has helped to maintain high global supplies despite an OPEC-led initiative to tighten the market by cutting production.  The price of oil is down around 14 percent since late May, when producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended their pledge to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by an extra nine months.  Falih said there was a relatively big draw of around 50 million barrels from floating storage and a drop in industrialised nations' onshore storage of 65 million barrels compared to July last year.  The market often tends to ignore these criteria and focus on the drop in U.S. inventories that came below expectations,  he said. Compliance in April and May with the OPEC-led output deal was above 100 percent, he said. Falih also said he expects Libya's production to return to normal levels. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the supply cuts because unrest had curbed their output.  It is inappropriate to pressure Libya to slow the recovery in its production,  he was quoted as saying. He said production levels in Libya and Nigeria were within the range determined when OPEC, meeting in September last year in Algeria, decided to cut output for the first time since 2008.  They shouldn't be considered a threat to the initiative.  OPEC's output rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd, led by a rebound in Nigeria and Libya, the 14-country organisation said last week in its monthly report.

Brent futures were up 13 cents at $47.04 at 0034 GMT. On Monday, they fell 46 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $46.91 a barrel. That was their lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers agreed to cut output for six months from January. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 13 cents at $44.33 a barrel. They declined 54 cents, or 1.2 percent in the previous session, to settle at $44.20 per barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 14. The July contract will expire on Tuesday and August will become the front month. Both benchmarks are down around 15 percent since late May, when OPEC, Russia and other producers extended by nine months the cut in output by 1.8 million barrels per day (mb/d).  Recent data points are not encouraging,  Morgan Stanley said in a research note.  Identifiable oil inventories - both crude and product in the OECD, China and selected other non-OECD countries - increased at a rate of (about) 1.0 mb/d in 1Q.  OPEC supplies jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, two countries exempt from the production cut agreement. Libya's oil production has risen more than 50,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan source told Reuters. Analysts said rising U.S. crude production has fed the global glut. Data on Friday showed a record 22nd consecutive week of increases in U.S. oil rigs.

A teenager died of a gunshot wound in the latest clashes and several others were injured, bringing the death toll since April to at least 73. About 10,000 protesters filled the streets and arching flyovers of the city's wealthy east. Faced with security forces' water cannons and volleys of teargas, a deep line of protesters threw rocks, petrol bombs and powerful fireworks from behind crude wooden shields.  Day 80 of the resistance, and the people are not tired. Today, it is clear to anybody who was worried that the street had died down that it is not the case,  Freddy Guevara, a lawmaker from the opposition Popular Will party, said at the protest.  A Reuters photo showed a member of the National Guard pointing what appeared to be a pistol toward a crowd of protesters. In a separate video showing what looked like the same scene, an official appears to be firing a pistol. In an apparent reference to the incident, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol described an  improper and disproportionate use of force,  saying on Twitter that several people had been injured and one killed. He said officers involved were being investigated, but also condemned the violence of the protesters. The dead protester was named as Fabian Urbina, 17, shot in the chest, the local mayor said, adding at least 27 others were injured.  The National Guard is a wing of the military tasked with public order. The head of the guard on Sunday said his men would never use  weapons of war  against protesters.  You have not seen anything, squalid ones,  said Diosdado Cabello, a top leader of the Socialist Party, speaking at a separate pro-government protest earlier in the day, and using a popular epithet for the government's opponents.  What you have seen is just a little scratch.  An injured demonstrator is assisted by volunteer members of a primary care response team during a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, June 19, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsThe opposition accuses President Nicolas Maduro of dragging the oil-exporting country toward dictatorship by delaying elections, jailing opposition activists and pressing to overhaul the constitution. Maduro contends the protests are part of a foreign plot to topple his government, and points to arson attacks on public buildings as evidence of what he calls terrorism. Anti-government activists' anger has been fanned by shortages of food and medicines which have coincided with a spike in infant malnutrition and mortality. Slideshow (14 Images) We don't have food, we don't have healthcare, we don't have a future,  said a protester, who declined to give his name, speaking through a gas mask.  How is it possible that at 19 years old, I have to be here fighting?  A young musician nearby played the national anthem on a clarinet, while tear gas grenades and rocks whistled past her. Green flashes and explosions echoed from apartment blocks, and two protesters flung themselves at armored vehicles, hitting the windows with clubs.  We are here to show that we are not terrorists, we are only here to fight for our rights,  said the musician, who gave her name as Hazel. The protests began in April when the Supreme Court tried to usurp the powers of the opposition-controlled Congress.  Some marches have been smaller in recent weeks as violence has flared. But Monday's effort, matched by protests in several other parts of the country, demonstrated the movement still has momentum.  The opposition seeks to halt Maduro's plan to hold July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, a move the opposition says is aimed at undermining democracy.

The Calgary Bid Exploration Committee told the City Council in a presentation on Monday that C$2.2 billion in revenue from the Games would offset less than half their C$4.6 billion cost.  I am confident when I say that the Board and staff at CBEC have diligently reviewed all aspects of bidding and hosting a prospective 2026 Games, and the numbers we are sharing today accurately represent the current situation,  CBEC Chair Rick Hanson said in a statement. The committee said Calgary's funding requirement was reduced given the 1988 Winter Games host had the ability to re-use existing venues, rather than build new ones. The group said it had included post-Games endowments and facility operations costs in its budget estimates.  One of the things we identified from looking at some prior Olympic Games was the failure to account for post-Games operation and maintenance of facilities in their budgets,” said Hanson.  While this adds cost, our Board felt it was a necessary addition to a prospective budget.  The Committee is scheduled to make its final recommendation to the city on July 24.

The high court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination, as it did on May 22 when it found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. But the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another. The justices will take up Wisconsin's appeal of a lower court ruling last November that state Republican lawmakers violated the Constitution when they created state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling Democrats in legislative races. The case will be one of the biggest heard by the Supreme Court during its term that begins in October. The case involves a long-standing practice known as gerrymandering, a term meaning manipulating electoral boundaries for an unfair political advantage. The lower court ruled that the Republican-led legislature's redrawing of state legislative districts in 2011 amounted to  an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  A panel of three federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the way the Republicans redrew the districts violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by undercutting the ability of Democratic voters to turn their votes into seats in Wisconsin's legislature. In a possible sign of deep ideological divisions among the nine justices over the issue, the court's conservative majority granted Wisconsin's request, despite opposition from the four liberal justices, to put on hold the lower court's order requiring the state to redraw its electoral maps by Nov. 1. That means Wisconsin will not need to put in place a new electoral map while the justices consider the matter. A Supreme Court ruling faulting the Wisconsin redistricting plan could have far-reaching consequences for the redrawing of electoral districts due after the 2020 U.S. census. State and federal legislative district boundaries are reconfigured every decade after the census so that each one holds about same number of people, but are sometimes draw in a way that packs voters who tend to favor a particular party into certain districts so as to diminish their statewide voting power. Wisconsin Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel welcomed the justices' decision to hear the state's appeal and called the state's redistricting process  entirely lawful and constitutional.  FILE PHOTO -  A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S., November 15, 2016.Carlos Barria/File PhotoThe case in the short term could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about 10 states, before having major implications for the post-2020 redistricting, according to the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. 'Politics Going Haywire'  Wisconsin's gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade, locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for Republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state,  said Brennan Center redistricting expert Thomas Wolf.  It's a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court's liberals in major cases, could cast the decisive vote. Kennedy, writing in a 2004 case, indicated he may be open to the idea that racial gerrymanders could violate the Constitution. Though a  workable standard  defining it did not exist, he suggested one might emerge in a future case. FILE PHOTO -- The U.S. Supreme Court building is pictured in Washington, DC, U.S. on November 15, 2016.Carlos Barria/File PhotoDemocrats have accused Republicans of taking improper actions at the state level to suppress the turnout of minority voters and others who tend to support Democrats and maximize the number of party members in state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans call their actions lawful. Republicans control the U.S. Congress. They also have majorities in an all-time high of 69 of 99 state legislative chambers, according to the Republican State Leadership Committee. After winning control of the state legislature in 2010, Wisconsin Republicans redrew the statewide electoral map. They were able to amplify Republican voting power, gaining more seats than their percentage of the statewide vote would suggest. In 2012, Republicans received about 49 percent of the vote but won 60 of the 99 state Assembly seats. In 2014, the party garnered 52 percent of the vote and 63 Assembly seats. A dozen Wisconsin Democratic Party voters in 2015 sued state election officials, saying the redistricting divided Democratic voters in some areas and packed them in others to dilute their electoral clout and benefit Republican candidates.  The lower court found that redistricting efforts are unlawful partisan gerrymandering when they seek to entrench the party in power, and have no other legitimate justification.  The state argues recent election results favoring Republicans were  a reflection of Wisconsin's natural political geography,  with Democrats concentrated in urban areas like Milwaukee and Madison.

In a securities filing, Triunfo (TPIS3.SA) said it sold the 50 percent it has in Terminal Portuário de Navegantes SA for 1.3 billion reais ($396 million) to MSC's Terminal Investment Ltd SARL. Reuters reported earlier in the day that both partners had agreed on price and terms for the deal. Triunfo, which has been a partner in the terminal known as PortoNave since 2001, could get a 90 million real earn-out and extraordinary dividends if some unspecified conditions are met, two people familiar with the deal said. The sale depends on antitrust and regulatory approval. Asset sales have become a key part of Triunfo's plan to reduce debt. Creditors have discussed a restructuring plan that would allow Triunfo to retain cash from potential divestitures while it downsizes, Reuters reported on May 11.  Without an agreement with creditors, Triunfo could risk the completion of future asset sales, people with knowledge of the company's situation have told Reuters. Triunfo is negotiating the restructuring proposal with creditors individually, and the PortoNave sale could accelerate such agreement, they said. Proceeds from the PortoNave stake sale are expected to mainly go to repay part of Triunfo's 3.5 billion reais in debt, one of the people said - an indication that an accord with creditors is close. Triunfo has hired Alvarez & Marsal Holdings LLC to conduct talks with banks. The restructuring talks have aimed at engaging creditors with a long-term turnaround at Triunfo, suggesting that banks that agree to take on a significant loss on their loans to the company may get repaid first, the sources said. São Paulo-based Triunfo declined to comment. Efforts to obtain comment from MSC's press office in Geneva outside business hours were unsuccessful. Aggressive Borrowing At that price, PortoNave was valued at about 11 times annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said one of the people. PortoNave is considered one of the world's most efficient port operators and was the only one of Triunfo's main four business lines that turned a profit last year. Apart from PortoNave, Triunfo may sell stakes in a consortium running Brazil's Viracopos international airport and a hydropower dam. Reuters reported on March 27 that MSC's TIL unit was likely to exercise a right of first refusal to buy Triunfo's stake in PortoNave. Triunfo borrowed aggressively at the start of the decade to fuel expansion in toll roads, electricity and airports. Still, Brazil's worst-ever recession has eroded profitability at the company and about 1 billion reais of Triunfo's debt will mature by the end of next year.

The talented Australian maverick slipped awkwardly on the grass at the back of the court during a rally at 4-4 in the first set against American Donald Young, succumbing again to a recent, problematic hip injury. After putting his head in his hands and lying on court for a few minutes after the slip, Kyrgios needed a medical time-out. When he resumed, obviously in some discomfort, he went on to squander two break points before losing the first set 7-3 in a tie-break and then deciding to retire from the contest. His withdrawal may have just been a precaution with Wimbledon so close, but it was another blow to the 22-year-old, whose hip and shoulder problems forced him to pull out of the Italian Open and blighted his French Open preparations.  It just was a sharp pain when I fell,  the Australian told reporters.  I started feeling it when I was walking, when I was landing on my serve. It's exactly what I was feeling in Paris. It's tough to play through.  It's not great at the moment. But we'll see.  Despite the setback, he expects to play at Wimbledon, which begins on July 3.  I'd play Wimbledon if I was injured pretty bad anyway,  he said.  I'm here anyway. I don't really have time to go home or anything. Yeah, I will be playing, for sure.  Earlier, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had returned emphatically to winning ways at Queen's, putting his shock first round exit at his home French Open firmly behind him. Tsonga outplayed his compatriot Adrian Mannarino 6-2 6-2 in the opening match of the traditional Wimbledon warm-up event in his first match since suffering a four-set defeat by little-known Argentine Renzo Olivo at Roland Garros. The loss to the world number 91 Olivo had been particularly disappointing for Tsonga in light of his three-title season during which he also reckoned that becoming a new father had helped provide him with fresh inspiration on court. Yet even while never needing to find top gear in the sunshine, the two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist demonstrated why he could still be a threat on the grass at 32 as he dismissed the challenge of the man who had beaten him in Monaco in April. Dimitrov Through Mannarino, ranked 62 in the world, had started brightly, swapping breaks with Tsonga, but once the world number 10 found rhythm in his groundstrokes and his opponent needed a time-out in the first set for treatment to his back, it proved a straightforward win. The key game was the marathon eight-deuce sixth in the opening set which finally saw left-hander Mannarino surrender his delivery for a second time after Tsonga had eked out six break points. A run of seven straight games saw the fifth seed take complete control before he became the first winner in the week-long championships, wrapping up victory in 67 minutes.  It was a good match. I played pretty well. I had to play my best tennis to get over him,  Tsonga said.  I sweated a lot.  If he can find his best form, Tsonga, who lost to Andy Murray in the 2011 Queen's final, could be one of the major threats to world number one Murray, who is seeking a sixth championship triumph. So will Bulgaria's sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, on the evidence of his superb 6-3 6-1 hammering of French Open men's doubles champion Ryan Harrison in just 54 one-sided minutes. Dimitrov, who has shown signs of rediscovering his 2014 best when he won Queen's, was in imperious form, reducing Harrison to such frustration that the American landed a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct after smashing his racket against his foot in the second set. Murray opens the defense of his title on Tuesday against fellow Briton Aljaz Bedene.

The White House wants to update government information technology systems, cut costs, eliminate waste and improve service. Trump on Monday cited estimates that the government could save up to $1 trillion over 10 years through such measures.  Our goal is to lead a sweeping transformation of the federal government’s technology that will deliver dramatically better services for citizens,  Trump said.  Government needs to catch up with the technology revolution.  The executives are part of the so-called American Technology Council that Trump formed in May to support efforts to modernize the U.S. government.  “The U.S. should have the most modern government in the world. Today it doesn’t,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said he wanted the Trump administration to make use of commercially available technologies, worker retraining, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Before meeting with Trump, the CEOs met in 10 small group sessions with Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, along with the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ohio State University. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, said the administration wanted to  unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before.  He said the administration was scrapping unneeded regulations for government computing systems, such as a rule on preventing Y2K issues. Most of the government's 6,100 data centers can be consolidated and moved to a cloud-based storage system. U.S. President Donald Trump participates in an American Technology Council roundtable, accompanied by Tim Cook, CEO of Apple (L) and Satya Nadella CEO of Microsoft Corporation at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 19, 2017.Carlos BarriaThe White House is seeking to shrink government, reduce the federal workforce and eliminate regulations.  Trump in March signed an order to overhaul the federal government and tapped Kushner to lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions. Many of the tech executives are eager to get White House help in dealing with regulatory and other policy issues such as visas for highly skilled workers. Slideshow (13 Images)Others attending include Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr and the CEOs of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O). Facebook (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg was invited but could not attend because of a conflict, the company said. A 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report estimated the U.S. government spent more than $80 billion in IT annually, excluding classified operations. In 2015, the U.S. government made at least 7,000 separate IT investments and some agencies were using systems that had components at least 50 years old.  This structure is unsustainable,  Kushner said. Visa Program The CEOs and White House also planned to discuss Trump's review announced in April of the U.S. visa program for bringing high-skilled foreign workers into the country. Cook plans to raise immigration, a person briefed on the matter said Sunday. The council also seeks to boost the security of U.S. government IT systems and wants to learn from private-sector  practices. In 2015, hackers exposed the personal information of 22 million people from U.S. government databases. The White House thinks it can learn from credit card companies about significantly reducing fraud. A 2016 government audit found that in Medicaid alone there was $29 billion in fraud in a single year. Following Trump's June 1 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords, Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Robert Iger stepped down from White House advisory panels. White House officials said the dispute had little impact and that they had to turn away tech leaders from Monday's event because of lack of space.

{"news_time":"2017-06-19 19:53:00","news_title":"U.S. Supreme Court and top patent court rarely see eye to eye","keywords":"United States,Allyson Ho,Arti Rai,Carter Phillips,John Stuart Hugh Roberts,Paul Michel,Rochelle Dreyfuss,Samuel Alito,Sharon Prost,USA,COURT/PATENTS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous backing on Monday of a ruling by the country's top patent court was a rare instance of agreement with a body whose decisions in that specialized area it regularly overturns. Tellingly, Monday's decision related to trademarks, not patents. Since its term began last October, the Supreme Court has thrown out all six patent-related decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was set up to handle such cases. Since 2014, the high court has upheld the patent court in only two of 16 patent cases, a Reuters review showed. The lack of agreement between the high court and the patent court reflects a basic conflict at the top of the U.S. legal system over intellectual property rights, which are critical to many industries. The high court's pattern on patent law is part of a wider trend, under Chief Justice John Roberts, of the court siding with business in legal disputes that come before it. Business interests have won a string of victories in the current term, which is scheduled to end next week. Through its repeated reversals of the patent court, the Supreme Court is making it harder to sue companies using patents. That helps major technology firms such as Google , Apple and Samsung, all frequent targets of patent infringement lawsuits by  patent trolls.  Other industries, including drug and medical diagnostics companies, have warned against weaker patent rights.  The patent system has been weakened, and as far as I'm concerned the Supreme Court is unaware of that,  said Paul Michel, who retired as Federal Circuit chief judge in 2010. Michel said the high court's decisions had created huge uncertainty for companies and investors over patent rights and could affect research and development and innovation. Reached by Reuters, a representative for the Federal Circuit declined to comment. The Supreme Court's patent cases this term have been significant, including one involving Apple and Samsung over smartphones. In that case, the justices said the Federal Circuit misinterpreted the law on design patents. In another major case, the Supreme Court repudiated a 27-year-old Federal Circuit precedent and tightened where patent lawsuits may be filed, a blow to the  trolls,  or entities that generate revenue by suing over patents.  It’s pretty safe to say that it's one of the most impactful decisions of the term,  said Allyson Ho, a business lawyer, at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event on Friday. In an exception that perhaps proves the rule, the high court on Monday upheld the Federal Circuit's decision to strike down a law that prevents disparaging names from being trademarked. The Federal Circuit also handles some trademark cases. Condescending Tone The justices have sometimes adopted a condescending tone toward the Federal Circuit's patent rulings. During arguments in a 2014 case, Roberts suggested the Federal Circuit was failing at streamlining patent law, one of the reasons for its creation in 1982. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in an opinion that same year that the Federal Circuit  fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe  certain patents. When the patent court was founded, the judges  saw their mission as making patents stronger, and the Supreme Court thought it went too far and started to reel them in,  said Rochelle Dreyfuss, a professor of law at New York University who has studied the court.  Now the question is whether the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.  She said the patent court was doing a better job explaining its rulings. It recently seated several new judges, and Sharon Prost, viewed as less pro-patent than her predecessor, became chief judge in 2014. Duke University law professor Arti Rai said the high court seemed to disapprove of treating patent law differently from other areas of law. The situation could spark further debate over the future trajectory of the specialist court, Rai said. For several years, attorneys, judges and professors have sparred over whether the court should retain exclusive control over patent cases. Some observers note that other appeals courts also go through periods of high reversal rates. Carter Phillips, who frequently argues patent cases, said that since the Federal Circuit was the sole appeals court to decide patent issues, the Supreme Court was more likely to review only those rulings it thinks are wrong.

Tellingly, Monday's decision related to trademarks, not patents. Since its term began last October, the Supreme Court has thrown out all six patent-related decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was set up to handle such cases. Since 2014, the high court has upheld the patent court in only two of 16 patent cases, a Reuters review showed. The lack of agreement between the high court and the patent court reflects a basic conflict at the top of the U.S. legal system over intellectual property rights, which are critical to many industries. The high court's pattern on patent law is part of a wider trend, under Chief Justice John Roberts, of the court siding with business in legal disputes that come before it. Business interests have won a string of victories in the current term, which is scheduled to end next week. Through its repeated reversals of the patent court, the Supreme Court is making it harder to sue companies using patents. That helps major technology firms such as Google, Apple and Samsung, all frequent targets of patent infringement lawsuits by  patent trolls.  Other industries, including drug and medical diagnostics companies, have warned against weaker patent rights.  The patent system has been weakened, and as far as I'm concerned the Supreme Court is unaware of that,  said Paul Michel, who retired as Federal Circuit chief judge in 2010. Michel said the high court's decisions had created huge uncertainty for companies and investors over patent rights and could affect research and development and innovation.  Reached by Reuters, a representative for the Federal Circuit declined to comment. The Supreme Court's patent cases this term have been significant, including one involving Apple and Samsung over smartphones. In that case, the justices said the Federal Circuit misinterpreted the law on design patents. A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S., November 15, 2016.Carlos BarriaIn another major case, the Supreme Court repudiated a 27-year-old Federal Circuit precedent and tightened where patent lawsuits may be filed, a blow to the  trolls,  or entities that generate revenue by suing over patents.  It’s pretty safe to say that it's one of the most impactful decisions of the term,  said Allyson Ho, a business lawyer, at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event on Friday. In an exception that perhaps proves the rule, the high court on Monday upheld the Federal Circuit's decision to strike down a law that prevents disparaging names from being trademarked. The Federal Circuit also handles some trademark cases. Condescending Tone The justices have sometimes adopted a condescending tone toward the Federal Circuit's patent rulings.  During arguments in a 2014 case, Roberts suggested the Federal Circuit was failing at streamlining patent law, one of the reasons for its creation in 1982. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in an opinion that same year that the Federal Circuit  fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe  certain patents.  When the patent court was founded, the judges  saw their mission as making patents stronger, and the Supreme Court thought it went too far and started to reel them in,  said Rochelle Dreyfuss, a professor of law at New York University who has studied the court.  Now the question is whether the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.  She said the patent court was doing a better job explaining its rulings. It recently seated several new judges, and Sharon Prost, viewed as less pro-patent than her predecessor, became chief judge in 2014.  Duke University law professor Arti Rai said the high court seemed to disapprove of treating patent law differently from other areas of law.  The situation could spark further debate over the future trajectory of the specialist court, Rai said. For several years, attorneys, judges and professors have sparred over whether the court should retain exclusive control over patent cases.  Some observers note that other appeals courts also go through periods of high reversal rates. Carter Phillips, who frequently argues patent cases, said that since the Federal Circuit was the sole appeals court to decide patent issues, the Supreme Court was more likely to review only those rulings it thinks are wrong.

Among children and teens aged 17 or younger, 1.6 per 100,000 killed themselves with guns in 2014, compared with 1.0 per 100,000 in 2007. An average of 493 children died of gun-related suicides each year covered by the study, which was led by Katherine Fowler and Linda Dahlberg of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the online journal Pediatrics.   Suicides are often impulsive in this age group, with previous findings indicating that many who attempt suicide spend 10 minutes or less deliberating,  the research paper said.  All told, nearly 1,300 children in the United States age 17 or younger died of gunshot wounds each year, with boys accounting for the vast majority of the victims, according to the study. For decades, gunshot wounds have ranked second behind car crashes as the leading cause of death from injuries for U.S. children. But while car travel has become safer, gun fatalities have remained high in that age group, pediatric experts say.  Firearm injuries are an important public health problem, contributing substantially to premature death and disability of children,  the study said.  Understanding their nature and impact is a first step toward prevention.  The rise in fatal gunshot wounds runs counter to a decline in the overall death rate among American children over the last several decades, as well as a decrease in the number of children who were homicide victims. African-American boys are the most likely of any demographic group to be shot and killed by someone else, while white and Native American children are four times more likely to kill themselves by firearms than black and Hispanic children, the study found.  The study is the most comprehensive analysis of firearm deaths and injuries among American children ever conducted, according to two pediatric experts who were not involved in it.  We take care of these kids, as pediatricians it's not abstract,  Dr. Robert Sege, chief medical officer of the Massachusetts-based research group Health Resources in Action, said by phone.   Firearm deaths among children have remained roughly constant, with the higher suicide rate canceling out progress in lowering homicides with guns, Sege said.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has said the safest household are those with no firearms.  But parents often are not open to hearing that message from a doctor, given the widespread acceptance of gun ownership in the United States, writes  Dr. Eliot Nelson, a University of Vermont College of Medicine professor who did not participate in the latest research. Doctors should focus on sharing information about safe storage of firearms, he wrote in a separate paper in Pediatrics.    Given the impulsivity, risk-taking and unpredictability of adolescence, we should promote safe storage as a routine measure rather than only when a concern or crisis arises,  he said.

The court ruled 8-0 in favor of the Portland, Oregon-based Asian-American dance rock band, which had been denied a trademark because the government deemed its name disparaging to people of Asian descent. The Slants challenged that rejection as a violation of free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, and the Supreme Court agreed. The ruling likely paves the way for the Redskins to protect trademarks covering the team's name. The National Football League team, which took the name Redskins in the 1930s, filed a legal challenge to a 2014 decision by a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal canceling its trademarks as disparaging to Native Americans. A lower court put the Redskins' dispute on hold pending the outcome of the band's case. Lisa Blatt, a lawyer representing the Redskins, told Reuters the team is thrilled with Monday's ruling because it resolves  the Redskins' long-standing dispute with the government.  Writing for the court, Justice Samuel Alito did not mince words in ruling that the decades-old trademark provision is unconstitutional.  It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend,  Alito wrote.  Band frontman Simon Tam has said he chose to call the band The Slants to reclaim a term some consider a derogatory reference to Asian people's eyes, and wear it as a  badge of pride.  The band's lawyers argued that the government cannot use trademark law to impose burdens on free speech to protect listeners from offense. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed legal papers supporting the band, hailed the ruling as a major victory for the First Amendment. ACLU lawyer Lee Rowland said government efforts to protect minorities from disparagement instead hurt members of that very community, in this case the Asian-American band.   Fortunately, today's opinion prevents the kind of absurd outcome that results when the government plays speech police,  Rowland said.

Jiang pose in Portland, Oregon, U.S., August 21, 2015 in a picture released by band representatives.  Anthony Pidgeon/Handout via Reuters'Marginalized Communities' The band welcomed the ruling.  After an excruciating legal battle that has spanned nearly eight years, we're beyond humbled and thrilled to have won this case at the Supreme Court,  the band said in a statement posted to its website on Monday.  This journey has always been much bigger than our band: it's been about the rights of all marginalized communities to determine what's best for ourselves.  Patent and Trademark Office spokesman Paul Fucito said the agency was reviewing the decision. The government previously said a ruling favoring The Slants could lead to a proliferation of racial slurs as sanctioned trademarks. After the government rejected The Slants' request, Tam appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which in 2015 ruled that the so-called disparagement provision of the 1946 law governing trademarks ran afoul of the Constitution's guarantee of free speech. The government appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. The federal government said in court papers that it should not be required to approve trademarks  containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white-supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.  In the separate Redskins case, a trademark board in 2014 canceled the team's six trademarks at the request of Native American activists on grounds that the team name disparaged Native Americans.  The team's appeal, also on free speech grounds, was put on hold in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, pending the outcome of The Slants' case.  Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court after arguments were heard in the case and did not participate in Monday's decision. The Supreme Court also ruled on another free speech case on Monday, striking down a North Carolina law banning convicted sex offenders from Facebook and other social media services that play a vital role in modern life.

A teenager died of a gunshot wound in the latest clashes and several others were injured, bringing the death toll since April to at least 73. About 10,000 protesters filled the streets and arching flyovers of the city's wealthy east. Faced with security forces' water cannons and volleys of teargas, a deep line of protesters threw rocks, petrol bombs and powerful fireworks from behind crude wooden shields.  Day 80 of the resistance, and the people are not tired. Today, it is clear to anybody who was worried that the street had died down that it is not the case,  Freddy Guevara, a lawmaker from the opposition Popular Will party, said at the protest.  A Reuters photo showed a member of the National Guard pointing what appeared to be a pistol toward a crowd of protesters. In a separate video showing what looked like the same scene, an official appears to be firing a pistol. In an apparent reference to the incident, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol described an  improper and disproportionate use of force,  saying on Twitter that several people had been injured and one killed. He said officers involved were being investigated, but also condemned the violence of the protesters. The dead protester was named as Fabian Urbina, 17, shot in the chest, the local mayor said, adding at least 27 others were injured.  The National Guard is a wing of the military tasked with public order. The head of the guard on Sunday said his men would never use  weapons of war  against protesters.  You have not seen anything, squalid ones,  said Diosdado Cabello, a top leader of the Socialist Party, speaking at a separate pro-government protest earlier in the day, and using a popular epithet for the government's opponents.  What you have seen is just a little scratch.  An injured demonstrator is assisted by volunteer members of a primary care response team during a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, June 19, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsThe opposition accuses President Nicolas Maduro of dragging the oil-exporting country toward dictatorship by delaying elections, jailing opposition activists and pressing to overhaul the constitution. Maduro contends the protests are part of a foreign plot to topple his government, and points to arson attacks on public buildings as evidence of what he calls terrorism. Anti-government activists' anger has been fanned by shortages of food and medicines which have coincided with a spike in infant malnutrition and mortality. Slideshow (14 Images) We don't have food, we don't have healthcare, we don't have a future,  said a protester, who declined to give his name, speaking through a gas mask.  How is it possible that at 19 years old, I have to be here fighting?  A young musician nearby played the national anthem on a clarinet, while tear gas grenades and rocks whistled past her. Green flashes and explosions echoed from apartment blocks, and two protesters flung themselves at armored vehicles, hitting the windows with clubs.  We are here to show that we are not terrorists, we are only here to fight for our rights,  said the musician, who gave her name as Hazel. The protests began in April when the Supreme Court tried to usurp the powers of the opposition-controlled Congress.  Some marches have been smaller in recent weeks as violence has flared. But Monday's effort, matched by protests in several other parts of the country, demonstrated the movement still has momentum.  The opposition seeks to halt Maduro's plan to hold July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, a move the opposition says is aimed at undermining democracy.   We want to put pressure on the government, it cannot impose a new constitution,  said telecoms engineer Luis Serrano, 22, resting at a medical station near the protest.

Blue Apron's up to $510 million IPO will test whether the growth seen by the meal-kit industry's greatest players will continue to whet investor appetite, even as costs to acquire new customers mount and possible new competitors with established distribution systems appear.  Amazon, which said on Friday it would buy Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion deal, has dallied with both food delivery, through AmazonFresh, and meal kits, which deliver fresh ingredients and recipes to subscribers. Though its AmazonFresh program is more advanced than its meal kits programs, both are still limited to certain metropolitan areas.  It's going to take some time to figure out the impact of the acquisition on food delivery, and there are a lot more available ways to raise money when you're public than when you're private,  said Kathleen Smith, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds at Renaissance Capital. New York-based Blue Apron, named after the uniform that apprentice chefs wear in France, delivers pre-packaged ingredients and recipes to subscribers' doorsteps for them to prepare meals at home. It is the largest U.S. meal kit delivery service.  The IPO price range it issued on Wednesday implies a valuation of up to $3.2 billion. This equates to roughly three times the company's sales, and while Blue Apron has no publicly listed peer, some analysts pointed out that was higher than home good company Wayfair Inc's 1.8 times sales multiple.   Both Wayfair and Blue Apron are quickly growing, unprofitable e-commerce companies considered to be the leader in their respective niches.  Such a comparatively rich valuation indicates that Blue Apron, which was founded five years ago by Matt Salzberg, Ilia Papas and Matt Wadiak, believes its rapid growth will be sufficient to entice investors, despite having never turned a profit.  Blue Apron posted a net loss of $54.9 million last year, even as revenue more than doubled to $795.4 million, as it poured money into logistics and marketing. It was valued at as much as $2 billion in a June 2015 private fundraising round.  The timing of the Blue Apron IPO was not affected by the Whole Foods deal, a source close the company said.

Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSBlue Apron said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it was looking to sell 30 million Class A shares at between $15 to $17 per share, raising as much as $510 million.  Distribution Challenges    The meal-kit industry, which includes HelloFresh in Europe and Chefs Plate in Canada, is attempting to win consumers over  from supermarkets by delivering fresh ingredients directly to subscribers without a middle man. Vegetables are seen in an undated photo illustration provided by New York-based meal kit delivery service Blue Apron. Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSThe industry is also becoming more competitive, as companies have struggled to balance marketing costs with attractive prices. Food-delivery startup Maple announced it was shutting down earlier this year about a year after SpoonRocket made a similar announcement. Amazon first experimented with AmazonFresh in 2007, though has struggled with the same challenge facing all food delivery services: having a wide and cost-efficient distribution network for fresh food. With Amazon gaining access to Whole Foods' roughly 400-store footprint, the e-commerce juggernaut would command a distribution network dwarfing that of any meal-kit service. Its automated warehouses rely on robots to manage everything from inventory tracking and replacement, making it a formidable player as it cuts cost.  Blue Apron has fulfillment centers in Richmond, California, Jersey City, New Jersey, and Arlington, Texas and has also worked to increased its automation. Reuters reported in March that Blue Apron competitor, Sun Basket, which focuses on organic ingredients, has hired banks for an IPO that could come in the second half of the year. Bessemer Venture Partners, Stripes Group and Fidelity are among Blue Apron's investors. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays are among the underwriters to its IPO.

I don’t want to get hung up over small differences  between whether the Fed raises rates two, three or four times over the course of 2017, Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to Money Marketeers of New York University.  The important feature is that the current environment supports very gradual rate hikes and slow preset reductions in our balance sheet.   Repeating much of a similar talk he gave in May, Evans said that while the Fed had essentially achieved its goal of full employment, it has had a  serious policy outcome miss  on its other goal of 2-percent inflation.  Unemployment fell to 4.3 percent in May, below what many Fed officials say is sustainable in the long run. But inflation, which by the Fed's preferred gauge fell to 1.5 percent in April, has run below the Fed's 2-percent target for years.  Despite his warning on too-low inflation, Evans last week cast his vote with the 8-1 majority at the Fed who supported lifting the target range for short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Interest rate hikes are typically aimed at slowing growth and inflation. Fed officials also reaffirmed their expectation of one more rate hike in 2017, bringing the total for the year to three, and said they expect to begin allowing the $4.5 trillion balance sheet to shrink by an initial $10 billion a month. On the margin, a smaller Fed balance sheet delivers less downward pressure on longer-run borrowing costs.  It remains to be seen whether there will be two rate hikes this year, or three, or four—or exactly when we start paring back reinvestments of maturing assets,  Evans said.  Ultimately, our exact actions will appropriately be driven by how events transpire to influence the outlook for achieving our policy goals.

Moody's on Monday downgraded the four largest Australian banks to a long-term credit rating of Aa3 from Aa2, citing risks from high household debt levels after sharp property price rises. The new rating is in line with the long-term AA- credit rating that Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) have from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.  Given this downgrade merely brings the major banks' credit ratings under Moody's to the equivalent notches under S&P; and Fitch, we expect no impact on funding costs,  Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients published on Monday. However, the analysts said there was still a risk that S&P; would downgrade the major banks due to a sovereign ratings downgrade or a reduction in government support, which could lift long-term funding costs by 10 basis points. S&P; revised its outlook on the major banks to negative last July. Both houses of Australian parliament on Monday voted in favour of a 6 basis point levy on certain liabilities of the four biggest banks and Macquarie Group Ltd in a measure meant to help return the federal budget to a surplus by 2021. The banks have criticised the tax as unfair and argued that foreign rivals should be included to level the playing field. A Senate committee on Monday recommended the bank tax should be reviewed in two years and possibly waived in times of financial distress, but Treasurer Scott Morrison on Tuesday rejected those arguments.  There's no need to do any of those things,  he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Moody's also downgraded the New Zealand subsidiaries of the Australian banks in line with their parents. The banks, with the exception of NAB, have acknowledged the ratings downgrade but have not commented any further. NAB has not yet provided any comment.

While the U.S. military's shootdown of a Syrian jet on Sunday was a rarity in modern warfare, the first in 18 years, it was not an isolated incident. The United States has taken a series of actions over the past three months demonstrating its willingness to carry out strikes, mostly in self-defense, against Syrian government forces and their backers, including Iran. In April, Trump ordered cruise missile strikes against a Syrian airfield from which Washington said a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched. Since then, the United States has repeatedly struck Iranian-backed militia and last week even shot down a drone threatening U.S.-led coalition forces. These incidents, however, are tactical, not part of any U.S. strategy in Syria, analysts said. Both the administration of former President Barack Obama and Trump's have focused exclusively on defeating Islamic State, but with the militants' self-proclaimed caliphate shrinking, U.S.-backed and Syrian-backed forces appear to be competing for territory.  There isn't an over-arching U.S. strategy driving this,  said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute.  This is just the result of tactical decisions by a commander on the ground whose only focus is a specific theater in Syria. He is acting to protect his assets ... This is purely a series of tactical decisions that are creating a series of very serious strategic consequences.  Russia and Iran both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war. The larger problem, the officials and analysts said, is that Trump and his national security team have not advanced a long-term political strategy for Syria's future. Like Obama, Trump has focused on Islamic State, leaving for later the question of Assad's fate and the region's mangled alliances.  We have never had a coherent Syrian strategy,  said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  We oppose Assad, but our main enemy is ISIS, which also opposes Assad. Our most capable allies are the (Kurdish) peshmerga, but Turkey, who is a NATO ally and host to an airbase that is central to our efforts, considers the Kurds enemies.  Jennifer Cafarella, of the Institute for the Study of War,  said the U.S. strikes are unlikely to deter Assad and his backers.  The absence of a civilian-led U.S. strategy in Syria and the narrow U.S. military focus on ISIS will continue to provide an open invite for the pro-Assad regime coalition to extend and escalate,  Cafarella said. A White House spokesman did not respond to calls and an email seeking comment. A senior White House official said:  The strategy for Syria is to defeat ISIS and first and foremost achievement of a de-escalation of the conflict so we can work toward a political resolution. We’re not close to that, but that's the strategy.  Trump Aides Split Over Iran Russia reacted angrily to the U.S. shootdown of the Syrian jet, which the Pentagon said was dropping bombs near the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a mixed Kurdish-Arab militia  fighting Islamic State. Moscow said it would treat U.S.-led coalition aircraft flying west of the River Euphrates in Syria as potential targets and track them with missile systems and military aircraft. It stopped short of saying it would shoot them down. The White House said on Monday that coalition forces fighting Islamic State militants in Syria would retain the right to self-defense, and said the United States would work to keep lines of communication open with Russia. In another complication, Iran on Sunday launched ballistic missile strikes at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria, the first time it has carried out such an action.    U.S. intelligence analysts quickly concluded that Iran fired the missiles mostly in retaliation for a pair of Islamic State attacks earlier this month on Iran's parliament building and the tomb of the Islamic Republic's founder. A second U.S. official said the use of ballistic missiles may also have been intended as a signal that Iran remains committed to supporting Assad and a reminder that U.S. forces and bases in the region are within reach of Iranian missiles and ground forces. As it tries to craft a Syria strategy, the Trump administration is divided between those who consider Islamic State the primary enemy and some officials who think the war in Syria is part of an existential struggle between the United States and its Gulf allies on the one hand and Iran on the other, said a third U.S. official, who has participated in government deliberations on Syria. Some Trump appointees saw Iran's missile strike as an illustration of Tehran’s regional ambitions, which they have argued make it an existential enemy, according to the three U.S. officials. These Iran hawks, they said, are pushing for a Syria strategy that calls for concentrating first on defeating Islamic State, then turning on Iran and its allies, including Assad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, Iraq's Shi'ite militias, and Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The vehicle swerved into a group of mainly North and West African people shortly after midnight as they left prayers at the Muslim Welfare House and the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, one of the biggest in Britain.  The driver, a 47-year-old white man, was grabbed at the scene by locals and pinned down until police arrived.  The man was not named by police but local media reported he was a father of four who lived in Wales. He was held on suspicion of attempted murder which was later extended to preparing or instigating terrorism, including murder and attempted murder. After being seized, he said he had wanted to kill  many Muslim people , one witness told journalists. A man, who had earlier suffered a heart attack, died at the scene but it was not clear if his death was connected to the van attack.   This morning, our country woke to news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city: the second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come before,  May told reporters outside her Downing Street office.  This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship,  said May who later visited the mosque. The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was receiving regular updates on the attack.  We've made it very clear to our British allies that we stand ready to provide any support and assistance that they may need,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a briefing.  The attack was the fourth since March in Britain and the third to involve a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians. It came at a tumultuous time for the government with Britain starting complex divorce talks with the European Union and May negotiating with a small Northern Irish party to stay in power after losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election that backfired. Driver Detained Related CoverageImam stops angry Muslims assailing London van suspectThe mosques' worshippers had just left special prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  Usain Ali, 28, said he heard a bang and ran for his life.  When I looked back, I thought it was a car accident, but people were shouting, screaming and I realized this was a man choosing to terrorize people who are praying,  he told Reuters.  He chose exactly the time that people pray, and the mosque is too small and full, so some pray outside.   Another witness Yann Bouhllissa, 38, said he had been tending an old man who had suffered a heart attack when the van was driven at them. The driver was then seized by locals.  One guy caught the guy and brought him down,  Bouhllissa told Reuters.  When he was on the floor, the guy asked 'why do you do that?'. He said 'Because I want to kill many Muslim people'.  Mohammed Mahmoud, the imam from the Muslim Welfare House,  stepped in to ensure the van driver was not hurt until he was bundled into a police van. A message on a wall is seen near to where a van was driven at Muslims in Finsbury Park, North London, Britain, June 19, 2017.Marko Djurica We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him ... and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches. By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm,  Mahmoud told reporters.   We stopped all forms of attack and abuse towards him that were coming from every angle.  Neil Basu, senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said restraint shown by locals was  commendable .  In addition to the man who died, 11 people were injured, with nine taken to hospital, two in a very serious condition, police said.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said the man was  not known to the authorities in the space of extremism or far-right extremism . Police, who believe he was acting alone, were searching addresses in Cardiff, Wales, where the vehicle hire company that the van was rented from is based.  Slideshow (28 Images)Attacks in London, Manchester The latest incident took place just over two weeks after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight.. A suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester, northern England, in May also killed 22 people, while in March, a man drove a rented car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London and stabbed a policeman to death before being shot dead. Five people were killed in that attack. Five other terrorism plots have been foiled since March, police say. May, weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, has faced criticism for her record on security after the previous series of attacks blamed on Islamist militants. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called on her to reverse planned police spending cuts. She has also been criticized for her response to a fire in a London tower block last Wednesday which killed at least 79 people.  Today’s attack falls at a difficult time in the life of this city, following on from the attack on London Bridge two weeks ago – and of course the unimaginable tragedy of Grenfell Tower last week,  May said. She promised action to stamp out all forms of hatred, saying there had been far too much tolerance of extremism in Britain over many years. Police have said hate crimes rose after the London Bridge attack and more officers would be deployed to provide reassurance to mosques.    The Muslim Council of Britain said Monday's attack on mosque worshippers was the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia in Britain in recent months and called for extra security at places of worship. Finsbury Park Mosque said it was a  callous terrorist attack  and noted it had occurred almost exactly a year after a man obsessed with Nazis and extreme right-wing ideology murdered lawmaker Jo Cox, a former humanitarian aid worker. The mosque itself gained notoriety more than a decade ago for sermons by radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison in January 2015 after being convicted of terrorism-related charges. However, a new board of trustees and management took over in February 2005, a year after Abu Hamza was arrested by British police. Attendance has greatly increased since then among worshippers from various communities, according to the mosque's website.

This departure from traditional pork-rich dumplings is a hit with busy, young urbanites, trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food.  They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight. It's a big trend for mainland China consumers, especially those aged 20 to 35,  said Ellis Wang, Shanghai-based marketing manager at U.S. food giant General Mills (GIS.N), which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry. For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026. Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China. China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats. But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017. Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January, even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year. China's meat and seafood sales IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2s83aam Rare Luxury Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s, pork demand expanded by an average 5.7 percent every year, until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often. During Mao Zedong's reign as Chinese leader from 1949-76 meat had, for many, been a rare luxury. Now, growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too, fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear. [reut.rs/2rpFDhp] [reut.rs/2tis0Tg]  Market demand remains very weak. I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier. This is a new trend,  said Pan Chenjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. Sales of vegetable-only dumplings grew 30 percent last year, compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings, Nielsen research also shows.  Demand for vegetable products keeps rising, giving us large room for growth,  said Zhou Wei, product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food. FILE PHOTO: A customer chooses meat at a meat market in Beijing May 31, 2013.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoGuangzhou-based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day. Staff at the technology companies, banks and oil majors that are Harmony's clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago, but around 10 percent more green vegetables, according to Harmony vice president Li Huang.   It's mainly because of media, the concept of health has entered popular consciousness,  he said. For now, it's mostly urban and white-collar workers paying closer attention to their diets. There's been, for example, a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses.    But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits. Childhood obesity in China is rocketing, and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease, Harvard researchers warned last year. Among the problems, they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake. In April, the health ministry kicked off its second 10-year healthy lifestyle campaign, urging citizens to consume less fat, salt and sugar, and aim for a 'healthy diet, healthy weight and healthy bones'. Slideshow (2 Images)By 2030, Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness, a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt, and slower growth in the rate of obesity, it said in its recently published 'Healthy China 2030' pamphlet. Meat consumption by type and country: reut.rs/2s3F00J Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell, going for higher-margin pork meats rather than volume. Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing. Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down, the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals.  People usually eat lean beef or lamb, like beef brisket, while with pork it's both fatty and lean parts, like in 'hong shao rou',  said Beijing-based nutritionist Chen Zhikun, referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish. China's top pork producer WH Group has been going up market, selling Western-style products in China, such as sausages and ham. A lot of this is imported from Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork producer, which was acquired by WH in 2013. Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output. A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs, hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016. But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers, price tags on food items are less and less important. A spate of safety scandals in recent years, many related to meat, have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality. More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients, much higher than the global average of 68 percent.  China is in a new stage where consumption of pork and other foods is no longer a simple matter of 'more is better',  said Fred Gale, senior economist at the United States agriculture department.

Embraer SA rose 4.6 percent as traders bet on fresh orders for the jetmaker at the start of the Paris Airshow, the global aviation industry's biggest event.     Gains in Brazilian markets were limited due to concerns that a political scandal may hamper the implementation of President Michel Temer's reform agenda.     Temer on Saturday pledged to sue billionaire Joesley Batista, the founder of meatpacker JBS SA, after the businessman accused Temer of leading a corruption scheme in which politicians squeezed high-profile executives for bribe.     Shares of JBS dropped 4.1 percent.     The Brazilian real was little changed. Both the real and the Bovespa sank last month when accusations exploded that Temer was involved in a wide-ranging graft probe.     The Mexican peso lost nearly 0.3 percent after     New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said halting a U.S. policy-tightening cycle now would imperil the U.S. economy.        Higher U.S. rates curb the appeal of emerging market assets, which are seen as riskier than U.S. assets. Slack U.S. inflation data has fueled expectations that the Fed could slow its path of raising borrowing costs.      The Mexican currency has recovered from a record low hit in January and has been the best-performing major currency this year, up more than 15 percent.     The peso has gained as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has moved back from threats to slap tariffs on Mexican exports and toward talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A day after British and European Union negotiators met for the first time in Brussels, finance minister Philip Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will deliver speeches they postponed last week because of a deadly fire in a London housing block. Britain went from being one of the fastest-growing economies among the Group of Seven nations in 2016 to its slowest in early 2017 as the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum pushed up inflation and hit consumer spending. While the drag from inflation on the world's fifth-biggest economy is likely to fade next year, Hammond and Carney have both stressed the importance of avoiding a so-called hard Brexit in 2019. At the weekend, Hammond revived his opposition to an abrupt departure from the EU, calling for a phasing-in of Britain's new trade and regulatory relationship with its main trading partner.   If we are going to radically change the way we work together, we need to get there via a slope not via a cliff edge,  he told BBC television on Sunday. His tone was less confrontational than that of Prime Minister Theresa May, who repeatedly said no deal with the EU was better than a bad deal before she was weakened by failing to win a parliamentary majority in an election this month.  FILE PHOTO: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks during the central Bank's quarterly Inflation Report press conference at the Bank of England in the City of London,  Britain May 11, 2017.Adrian Dennis/File Photo - RTX38HXBHammond had looked set to lose his job until May's election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business' leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was  not deaf  to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. The combination of rising prices and slowing wage growth represents a challenge for the Bank of England and its top policymakers, three of whom voted last week to raise interest rates to head off the acceleration of inflation. They were outvoted by five rate-setters, led by Carney, who kept borrowing costs at their record low. But the unexpectedly close vote spurred a brief surge in the value of the pound GBP= and government bond yields GB10YT=RR. Investors want some clarity from Carney on Tuesday about whether he shares the concerns about inflation or is putting more weight on the hit to spending power of consumers which would suggest he sees no rush to raise rates. The Confederation of British Industry on Tuesday raised its growth forecasts for 2017 to reflect the economy's strong end to 2016, but said quarter-on-quarter growth would be stuck at around 0.3 or 0.4 percent until the end of 2018, roughly half the average seen since 2013. The speeches by Hammond and Carney are expected to be published at 0730 GMT.

In a series of floor motions, inquiries and lengthy speeches, Democrats criticized the closed-door meetings that Republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. They called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a Senate vote, which Republicans say could come in the next two weeks, although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly. Lacking the votes to derail or change the Republican process, the maneuvers by the Democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting Republican efforts on a controversial issue. Polls have said that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Obamacare replacement that has passed the House of Representatives and that Senate Republicans are now considering. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that the closed-door Republican meetings on healthcare amounted to  the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen.    Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Schumer charged. The resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance, he said, while granting  a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us.

Several Democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to Senate committees for hearings, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused. McConnell said all Republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that Democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce, once it is brought to the Senate floor.  We're going to have a meeting on the Senate floor, all hundred of us, with an unlimited amendment process,  McConnell said.  So there will be no failure of opportunity.  Senate Republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in July, before the July 4 recess if possible. But Republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right. In the House, conservatives have written to McConnell to express concern about reports that say the Senate may water down the House bill.

Brown's Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode and he was killed. A Tesla Inc spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report. In 2016, the company said Autopilot  does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility,  however. Brown family lawyer Jack Landskroner said in an email the NTSB's findings should put to rest previous media reports that Brown was watching a movie at the time of the crash, which he called  unequivocally false.  He added that the family has not taken any legal action against Tesla and was still reviewing the NTSB report. The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in the report. The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said  Hands Required Not Detected.  In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to  Hands Required Detected  for one to three second periods. Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls. In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown's death. NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles (119 km) per hour less than two minutes before the crash -- above the 65 mph speed limit. The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact. Brown  took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision,  the report said. A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation. He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday. The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle's speed and other data, which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars. For that reason, the NTSB said it  had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software.

Nearly 3,500 people have walked into Canada from the United States from January through May, according to government data, crossing the border through fields, forests and ditches to avoid official ports of entry where they would be turned back under a bilateral agreement. Once on Canadian soil, asylum seekers, many of whom are of Somali and Ghanaian origin, are each entitled to a hearing. While Canadians have assisted many stranded or freezing border-crossers, some have also worried about safety, and the fairness of asylum seekers entering Canada without permission.  The problem has not gone away and we need to fully figure out why this is happening and we need a full effort on both sides to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can do for the integrity of the border,  Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in an interview, after meeting with Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton.  Because if people broadly begin to have doubts about that, then the reaction will get to be harsher and harsher and harsher and it's in everyone's interest here to ensure the integrity of the border,  Goodale said.

Many of those walking into Manitoba come from the neighboring state of Minnesota. The journey can be dangerous, resulting in one woman's death and two cases of asylum seekers losing fingers to frostbite. Although the number of border-crossers into Canada is unusually high this year, numbers have declined two months in a row, even as weather became milder.  This does defy logic at the moment,  Goodale said.  You would have thought it would be easier at 30 (degrees Celsius) above than 30 below.

Service-sector mood rose to a two-year high, evidence of  broadening confidence, although the Reuters Tankan also found that confidence was seen slipping over the next three months.  The readings in the Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - suggested a slight improvement in the central bank's survey due July 3, which would support the BOJ's upbeat economic outlook. The central bank kept monetary policy steady on Friday and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months, signaling its confidence in an export-driven economic recovery that is gaining momentum. In the poll of 526 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between June 2-15 in which 250 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 26 from 24 in May, led by materials firms such as oil refinery/ceramics and textiles/paper. The index matched April's reading, which was the highest since August 2007, shortly before the global financial crisis. The index was up by one point from three months ago, and it was seen rising further to 29 in September.  Machine tool makers, who are our main clients, are performing well for both external and domestic markets. The situation is good because currencies remain stable,  a manager of a nonferrous metal firm wrote in the survey. A recent run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market. The Reuters Tankan service-sector index rose to 33 from 30 in May, led by gains in real estate/construction firms and wholesalers. It was seen slipping to 28 in September. Compared with three months ago, the sentiment index was up seven points. The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists. The BOJ's last tankan on April 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high, and service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters.

The extreme heat, brought on by a high-pressure system camped over the Four Corners region, has already boosted temperatures above normal across much of the Southwest, with the worst forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday. The heat wave was expected to push temperatures even higher by mid-week, taxing power grids and prompting airlines to warn that flights could be disrupted. Fisher said the sweltering weather could break records in some areas but was part of a cyclical pattern and not brought on by climate change or any other unusual phenomenon.  It's not unprecedented at all, things oscillate around,  he said.  We've had a fairly cool spring, had 'May Gray' and 'June Gloom', this our first real warmth of the season.  Temperatures were expected to drop by five to 10 degrees F (about 2.5 C to 5 C) later in the week but in the meantime the National Weather Service issued excessive heat warnings and advisories across the Southwest. Even in typically cooler San Francisco, residents baked in sultry 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 C). The National Park Service in Death Valley, known as the hottest place in America, cautioned tourists about the  EXTREME SUMMER HEAT  in a warning on its website.  Expect high temperatures of 100°F to over 120°F (38°C to over 49°C). Drink plenty of water and carry extra. Avoid hiking (after 10 am). Travel prepared to survive. In the case of a heat related illness, get to a cool place and seek help ASAP!  the park service said.  Temperatures like this happen less than once per year on avg. High risk of heat illness if doing strenuous activity outdoors,  the Phoenix office of the National Weather Service said in a tweet on Monday morning. There were no reports of severe heat-related illnesses as of Monday afternoon. Power grid operators and utility companies urged customers to conserve electricity at peak times to avoid the possibility of blackouts.

A day after British and European Union negotiators met for the first time in Brussels, finance minister Philip Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will deliver speeches they postponed last week because of a deadly fire in a London housing block. Britain went from being one of the fastest-growing economies among the Group of Seven nations in 2016 to its slowest in early 2017 as the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum pushed up inflation and hit consumer spending. While the drag from inflation on the world's fifth-biggest economy is likely to fade next year, Hammond and Carney have both stressed the importance of avoiding a so-called hard Brexit in 2019. At the weekend, Hammond revived his opposition to an abrupt departure from the EU, calling for a phasing-in of Britain's new trade and regulatory relationship with its main trading partner.   If we are going to radically change the way we work together, we need to get there via a slope not via a cliff edge,  he told BBC television on Sunday. His tone was less confrontational than that of Prime Minister Theresa May, who repeatedly said no deal with the EU was better than a bad deal before she was weakened by failing to win a parliamentary majority in an election this month.  FILE PHOTO: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks during the central Bank's quarterly Inflation Report press conference at the Bank of England in the City of London,  Britain May 11, 2017.Adrian Dennis/File Photo - RTX38HXBHammond had looked set to lose his job until May's election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business' leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was  not deaf  to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. The combination of rising prices and slowing wage growth represents a challenge for the Bank of England and its top policymakers, three of whom voted last week to raise interest rates to head off the acceleration of inflation. They were outvoted by five rate-setters, led by Carney, who kept borrowing costs at their record low. But the unexpectedly close vote spurred a brief surge in the value of the pound GBP= and government bond yields GB10YT=RR. Investors want some clarity from Carney on Tuesday about whether he shares the concerns about inflation or is putting more weight on the hit to spending power of consumers which would suggest he sees no rush to raise rates. The Confederation of British Industry on Tuesday raised its growth forecasts for 2017 to reflect the economy's strong end to 2016, but said quarter-on-quarter growth would be stuck at around 0.3 or 0.4 percent until the end of 2018, roughly half the average seen since 2013. The speeches by Hammond and Carney are expected to be published at 0730 GMT.

BlackRock, which manages $5.4 trillion across a range of actively managed and index-tracking funds, led a 30 million euro ($33.6 million) funding round for Scalable alongside its two existing German venture capital backers, a joint statement said. The funding will help Scalable expand its robo-advice business - which uses low-cost exchange-based funds and online distribution - with financial institutions and corporates to help grow assets past the 250 million euros raised in the 16 months since launch from more than 6,000 retail clients. The expansion of BlackRock's digital efforts comes as fund and wealth managers globally look to overhaul their distribution models amid tougher regulation, pressure on fees and the changing investment needs of a younger generation. Patrick Olson, BlackRock's chief operating officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and who will join Scalable's supervisory board, said the decision to invest came as investors increasingly wanted to access their holdings using technology.  This trend is prompting strong demand from European financial institutions – including banks, insurers, wealth managers and advisory firms – for high-quality technology-enabled investment solutions,  Olsen said. Scalable Capital, founded in 2014 and based in Munich and London, uses exchange-traded funds from BlackRock and others to build low-cost portfolios for clients and is actively looking to expand into other European countries. As well as Britain and Germany, it is also active in Austria. New European rules aimed at improving transparency, value for money and protections for investors meant traditional asset and wealth managers would need to use technology to help design, manage and distribute investments, the companies said.  Technology is not just a competitive advantage but a requirement for wealth management businesses to be successful in the future,  Adam French, co-founder and co-CEO at Scalable Capital, said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the third quarter. The companies declined to specify the size of the equity stake taken by BlackRock or its growth targets. Fintech Stable The deal for Scalable comes several months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up its technology and investment expertise. It also follows the purchase in 2015 of U.S.-based robo-adviser FutureAdvisor which, like Scalable, uses exchange-traded funds to build portfolios for clients and began serving retail customers. Since then, FutureAdvisor has put more emphasis on licensing its service to big wealth management companies to offer through their own advisers, typically to lower-tier clients who they might otherwise not retain. BlackRock is keen to win more market share with those wealth management firms, which are already a primary distributor of its funds to the general public. FutureAdvisor disclosed having $969 million in assets under management and 13,751 accounts in a February filing with U.S. regulators, up from $232 million and 3,460 accounts around when the BlackRock deal was announced in 2015. As well as FutureAdvisor, BlackRock's digital wealth management business includes Aladdin Risk for Wealth, iRetire and iCapital, all of which are solely for U.S.-based clients. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company's Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. It is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs and in March announced plans to bolster an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks.

Service-sector mood rose to a two-year high, evidence of  broadening confidence, although the Reuters Tankan also found that confidence was seen slipping over the next three months.  The readings in the Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - suggested a slight improvement in the central bank's survey due July 3, which would support the BOJ's upbeat economic outlook. The central bank kept monetary policy steady on Friday and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months, signaling its confidence in an export-driven economic recovery that is gaining momentum. In the poll of 526 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between June 2-15 in which 250 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 26 from 24 in May, led by materials firms such as oil refinery/ceramics and textiles/paper. The index matched April's reading, which was the highest since August 2007, shortly before the global financial crisis. The index was up by one point from three months ago, and it was seen rising further to 29 in September.  Machine tool makers, who are our main clients, are performing well for both external and domestic markets. The situation is good because currencies remain stable,  a manager of a nonferrous metal firm wrote in the survey. A recent run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market. The Reuters Tankan service-sector index rose to 33 from 30 in May, led by gains in real estate/construction firms and wholesalers. It was seen slipping to 28 in September. Compared with three months ago, the sentiment index was up seven points. The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists. The BOJ's last tankan on April 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high, and service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters.

This departure from traditional pork-rich dumplings is a hit with busy, young urbanites, trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food.  They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight. It's a big trend for mainland China consumers, especially those aged 20 to 35,  said Ellis Wang, Shanghai-based marketing manager at U.S. food giant General Mills (GIS.N), which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry. For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026. Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China. China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats. But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017. Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January, even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year. China's meat and seafood sales IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2s83aam Rare Luxury Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s, pork demand expanded by an average 5.7 percent every year, until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often. During Mao Zedong's reign as Chinese leader from 1949-76 meat had, for many, been a rare luxury. Now, growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too, fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear. [reut.rs/2rpFDhp] [reut.rs/2tis0Tg]  Market demand remains very weak. I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier. This is a new trend,  said Pan Chenjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. Sales of vegetable-only dumplings grew 30 percent last year, compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings, Nielsen research also shows.  Demand for vegetable products keeps rising, giving us large room for growth,  said Zhou Wei, product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food. FILE PHOTO: A customer chooses meat at a meat market in Beijing May 31, 2013.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoGuangzhou-based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day. Staff at the technology companies, banks and oil majors that are Harmony's clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago, but around 10 percent more green vegetables, according to Harmony vice president Li Huang.   It's mainly because of media, the concept of health has entered popular consciousness,  he said. For now, it's mostly urban and white-collar workers paying closer attention to their diets. There's been, for example, a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses.    But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits. Childhood obesity in China is rocketing, and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease, Harvard researchers warned last year. Among the problems, they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake. In April, the health ministry kicked off its second 10-year healthy lifestyle campaign, urging citizens to consume less fat, salt and sugar, and aim for a 'healthy diet, healthy weight and healthy bones'. Slideshow (2 Images)By 2030, Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness, a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt, and slower growth in the rate of obesity, it said in its recently published 'Healthy China 2030' pamphlet. Meat consumption by type and country: reut.rs/2s3F00J Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell, going for higher-margin pork meats rather than volume. Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing. Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down, the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals.  People usually eat lean beef or lamb, like beef brisket, while with pork it's both fatty and lean parts, like in 'hong shao rou',  said Beijing-based nutritionist Chen Zhikun, referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish. China's top pork producer WH Group has been going up market, selling Western-style products in China, such as sausages and ham. A lot of this is imported from Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork producer, which was acquired by WH in 2013. Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output. A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs, hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016. But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers, price tags on food items are less and less important. A spate of safety scandals in recent years, many related to meat, have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality. More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients, much higher than the global average of 68 percent.  China is in a new stage where consumption of pork and other foods is no longer a simple matter of 'more is better',  said Fred Gale, senior economist at the United States agriculture department.

In an 8-1 ruling, the justices overturned a lower court's decision that had allowed hundreds of out-of-state patients who took Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's blood-thinning medication Plavix to sue the company in California. State courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there, the justices ruled. The ruling had an immediate impact, with a state court in St. Louis citing it in declaring a mistrial in a lawsuit filed by out-of-state plaintiffs against New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson over its talc-related products, plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said on Monday. Previous talc cases in the same court have produced jury awards of over $300 million against J&J.; Meadows said he was disappointed, but thought there were still ways to establish jurisdiction in St. Louis. The Supreme Court on May 30 reached a similar conclusion in a separate case involving out-of-state injury claims against Texas-based BNSF Railway Co. Companies typically can be sued in a state where they are headquartered or incorporated, as well as where they have important ties. Businesses want to limit the ability of plaintiffs to shop for courts in states with laws conducive to such injury lawsuits. Plaintiffs contend that corporations are seeking to squeeze their access to compensation for injuries by denying them their day in state courts. The underlying lawsuits filed in 2012 against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp involved 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians, alleging Plavix increased their risk of stroke, heart attack and internal bleeding. Bristol-Myers argued it should not face claims in California by plaintiffs who do not live in the state. The company is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York. The California Supreme Court ruled in August 2016 that it could preside over the case because Bristol-Myers conducted a national marketing campaign and sold nearly $1 billion of the drug in the state. Writing for the U.S. Supreme Court majority on Monday, Justice Samuel Alito said the California court was wrong to rule that it could hear the case  without identifying any adequate link between the state and the nonresidents' claim.  In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor predicted that the Supreme Court's ruling will make it harder to consolidate lawsuits against corporations in state courts and lead to unfairness for individual injury plaintiffs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-bristol-myers-idUSL1N1JG0YJ"},

Brown's Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode and he was killed. A Tesla Inc spokeswoman Tesla spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report. In 2016, the company said Autopilot  does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility,  however. Brown family lawyer Jack Landskroner said in an email the NTSB's findings should put to rest previous media reports that Brown was watching a movie at the time of the crash, which he called  unequivocally false.  He added that the family has not taken any legal action against Tesla and was still reviewing the NTSB report. The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in the report. The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said  Hands Required Not Detected.  In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to  Hands Required Detected  for one to three second periods. Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls. In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown's death. NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles (119 km) per hour less than two minutes before the crash -- above the 65 mph speed limit. The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact. Brown  took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision,  the report said. A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation. He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday. The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle's speed and other data, which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars. For that reason, the NTSB said it  had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software.

Rice Energy's shares surged more than 24 percent to $24.47 in early trading, but below the $27.05 per share offered by EQT. EQT's shares were down 9.4 percent. The deal comes at a time when U.S. energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio as the country prepares to become the world's top natural gas exporter. EQT said it would be able to drill longer horizontal wells in Pennsylvania after the deal as most of the acquired acreage is next to where EQT already drills or owns land.  EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in Marcellus/Utica,  said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.  EQT needs a lot - and Rice offers a lot of what it needs.  EQT has been buying acreage in the Marcellus shale field - where gas is among the cheapest in the country. Most recently it picked up 53,400 acres in the field from Stone Energy Corp. EQT said the acquisition would increase its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and its core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000. The deal would also give the company access to Rice Energy's midstream assets, including a 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT will take on about $1.5 billion in debt. Rice Energy shareholders will receive $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share they hold, EQT said. The offer translates to a price of $27.05 per Rice Energy share, representing a premium of 37.4 percent to the stock's Friday closing price, according to Reuters calculations.

The deal, which was mediated by the Roman Catholic Sant' Egidio peace group and signed at their headquarters in Rome, calls for an immediate end to hostilities and recognition of the results of last year's presidential elections. The country has been plagued by inter-religious and inter-communal conflict since 2013, when the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, prompting reprisals from the anti-Balaka militia, many of whose fighters are nominally Christian. The Sant' Egidio group, which is backed by the Vatican and Italy, negotiated the end of the civil war in Mozambique in 1992 during secret negotiations in Rome and has been trying to broker peace in Central African Republic for months. Political crises have regularly rocked the country and tit-for-tat violence is on the rise again despite last year's presidential election that was aimed at ending the bloodshed. In two weeks in May, fighting between militia groups killed about 300 people and displaced 100,000, the worst bout of displacements since 2013. Around 2.2 million people, about half the population, need humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.. A local radio station said on Monday that as recently as this weekend attacks had been carried out in Yalinga in the country's diamond-rich east. Reuters could not immediately verify the information. Some expressed scepticism that the deal would hold.  They signed this document in the context of serious violence that is continuing in the east of the country,  said Lewis Mudge, African Researcher at Human Rights Watch.  To me, it reads like a first step . Philippe Barga, a 40-year-old mason in Bangui, complained that rebel leaders had not kept their word in the past.  It is those who sign them who don't respect them. I don't believe in this deal,  he told Reuters. The five-page accord, which was signed for the government by Foreign Minister Charles Armel Doubane, calls for the free movement of non-governmental organizations. The armed militia that did not attend the Rome meetings was one of the smaller ones, the  Retour Reclamation et Rehabilitation  or 3R, Sant' Egidio negotiators said. They added that its absence was due to logistical problems and that the other signatories were confident that they would be able to convince the group to join the pact.

Daly,Luc Cohen,Luis Caputo,Mauricio Macri,Sujata Rao,ARGENTINA,BONDS/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina sold $2.75 billion of a hotly demanded 100-year bond in U.S. dollars on Monday, just over a year after emerging from its latest default, according to the government. The South American country received $9.75 billion in orders for the bond, as investors eyed a yield of 7.9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds need to lock in long-term returns. Thanks to a stronger-than-expected peso currency, the government has increased its overall 2017 foreign currency bond issuance target to $12.75 billion from its previous plan of issuing $10 billion in international bonds, Finance Minister Luis Caputo told reporters in Buenos Aires. Argentina is going to the international capital markets to help finance a fiscal deficit of 4.2 percent of gross domestic product this year. Caputo said Argentina has $2.6 billion in bonds left to be issued this year. The new paper could be denominated in euros, yen or Swiss francs. The new bond had a coupon of 7.125 percent, the finance ministry said in a statement that hailed success of the sale as evidence that Argentina had regained  credibility and confidence.  Still, the move came as a surprise given Argentina only last year ended a decade-long dispute with creditors over its 2002 default and residents tend to frown upon accumulating debt in dollars.  Implicitly, this shows market confidence that the government will be able to change the idiosyncrasy of the country and will end the borrow and default cycles. Will it?  said Edgardo Sternberg, Emerging Market debt portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles. Bond Prices Fall Argentine sovereign bond yield spreads over U.S. Treasuries widened six basis points, the widest in a month at 412 basis points. Argentina's 2038 dollar bond fell 1.5 cents while the 2046 bond issue fell 2.6 cents. The 2032 par bond was down by 1.5 percent. Though the bond appeared to be well oversubscribed, some investors questioned the wisdom of investing for a such a long term in a country as volatile as Argentina.  It's awfully premature for Argentina to issue 100-year bonds,  said Jorge Piedrahita, chief executive officer of Puma Investments.  When you look back in history, I'm not sure we can find a 20-year period where Argentina has not defaulted.  Citigroup Inc and HSBC acted as lead book runners on the deal, while Nomura Securities and Banco Santander were co-managers. Such long-term bonds are unusual, particularly in emerging markets. Mexico issued a 100-year bond in 2010. Since taking office in late 2015, President Mauricio Macri has implemented several market-friendly reforms to deliver on his promise of normalizing Argentina's economy after years of heavy state intervention and non-payment of international debt obligations under the previous government. He ended a decade-long dispute with creditors that allowed it to re-enter global credit markets, but Argentina lacks an investment grade rating. S&P; and Fitch rate the sovereign a B with a stable outlook, while Moody's has the debt at B3. The country sold 400 million Swiss francs ($410.64 million)in debt in March, and Caputo said on June 7 that Argentina would issue peso and euro bonds later this month. Many Argentines, with memories of the severe economic crisis following a 2002 default, took to social media to express their surprise, some with a touch of humor. One asked if Argentina would exist in 100 years, and another said at least cockroaches would pay off the debt. Axel Kicillof, former finance minister who led negotiations with holdouts under populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez, accused Macri of saddling 10 generations of Argentines with debt.

The United Arab Emirates, which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed the measures to isolate Qatar, said  the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days. Qatar has denied accusations by its neighbors that it funds terrorism, foments regional instability or has cosied up to their enemy Iran. The dispute has opened a rift among some of the main U.S. allies in the Middle East, with President Donald Trump backing tough measures against Qatar even as his State Department and Defense Department have sought to remain neutral. On Monday Qatar held war games with Turkish troops, showing off one of its few remaining strong alliances after two weeks of unprecedented isolation. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Doha was ready to  engage and address  the concerns of other Gulf Arab states in what he described as a proper dialogue with pre-determined principles, but reiterated that sanctions  must be lifted first.  Until now we didn't see any progress about lifting the blockade, which is the condition for anything to move forward,  Sheikh Mohammed said. The countries that imposed the sanctions have denied that they amount to a blockade. Sheikh Mohammed said he planned to travel to Washington next week to discuss the economic effect of the  blockade  and its effects on the global fight against terrorism.  We have a very strong partnership with the U.S. We are partners together in the global coalition of countering terrorism. We have been talking to them since the crisis started,  he said.

They are still in a phase of denial and anger,  he said, adding that a list of grievances for Qatar to address would be completed in the coming days. Qatar has relished support from Turkey during the dispute. Its state-funded pan-Arab Al Jazeera news channel showed footage of a column of armored personnel carriers flying the Turkish flag inside the Tariq bin Ziyad military base in Doha. It reported that additional Turkish troops had arrived in Qatar on Sunday for the exercises, although military sources in the region told Reuters the operation actually involved Turkish troops who were already present rather than new arrivals. The dispute is a major test for the United States, close allies with both sides and which houses the headquarters of its air power in the Middle East at an air base in Qatar. Turkish APC drives at their military base in Doha, Qatar June 18, 2017.  Qatar News Agency/Handout via REUTERSWashington has sent mixed signals despite Trump's firm personal backing for the sanctions. Trump called Qatar a  funder of terrorism at a very high level,  but five days later the Pentagon approved selling Qatar $12 billion of warplanes. The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Monday that military operations against Islamic State from Qatar were continuing while acknowledging some friction.  But what I said last week remains true, in that we have continued to be able to operate, even through that friction,  Marine General Joseph Dunford told reporters in Washington.  Baseless Propaganda  Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, has used its wealth over the past decade to exert influence abroad, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the Middle East. It has said it is now being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian hereditary and military rulers. Slideshow (2 Images) It is unfortunate that our neighbors have chosen to invest their time and resources in a baseless propaganda campaign,  Sheikh Saif Bin Ahmed al-Thani, director of Qatar's Government Communications Office, said in a statement on Monday, calling the terrorism accusations a  publicity stunt.  The Qatar Financial Centre, which administers special rules for foreign-owned companies operating in Qatar, said on Monday it has no plans to take any action against Saudi Arabian, Emirati or Bahraini firms in response to their governments' sanctions against Doha.  It remains business as usual, and we intend to keep it that way,  its chief executive Yousef al-Jaida said. Jaida said Qatar's government was also prepared to support local banks if foreign institutions withdraw deposits from them because of the economic boycott. Turkey is one of the few powerful countries in the region willing to openly show its support for Qatar. Two days after the sanctions were imposed, its parliament fast-tracked legislation to allow more troops to be deployed to Qatar, where about 90 Turkish soldiers are stationed under a 2014 agreement. Turkey has said it would deploy 3,000 ground troops at the base, primarily to serve as a venue for joint exercises. Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the wealth produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual laborers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it said its vast financial reserves would meet any challenges. Qatar has said the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighboring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday. Thousands of Qataris have been unable to board flights to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and cut off from relatives in those countries.  The Qatari government communications director, Sheikh Saif, said Saudi, Emirati, and Bahraini families had been  forcibly recalled  on Monday by their governments despite being invited by Qatar to stay.

The federal government acted last year to tighten mortgage lending rules to rein in Canada's housing boom, while British Columbia and Ontario have implemented taxes on foreign buyers in Vancouver and Toronto, respectively. Morneau told reporters he had shared with provincial finance ministers the Finance Department's view on  the continuing importance of monitoring the housing market, the need to make sure that we remain vigilant, and consider whether there is additional actions required to best assure the stability of that market.  Morneau said the government was continuing to watch the situation at non-bank lender Home Capital Group Inc, which looks to be  working its way through its challenges  and called its recent settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)  positive.  Home Capital last week agreed on a settlement with the OSC and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid. Morneau said top policymakers at the Bank of Canada told the gathered finance ministers that the economy was doing better than had been expected a few months ago. The federal and provincial governments also discussed the need to keep the tax rate on recreational marijuana low and have a coordinated approach across the country, though ministers did not discuss revenue estimates, Morneau said.  Revenue shouldn't be our driving goal,  said Morneau. Canada is on track to legalize recreational marijuana by next summer, though the federal government has left the details of how the drug will be sold up to the provinces. The Liberal government has said legalizing marijuana will keep it out of the hands of children and reduce drug-related crime. It also wants to keep the sale price low enough that users will not turn to the black market.

The South American country received $9.75 billion in orders for the bond, as investors eyed a yield of 7.9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds need to lock in long-term returns. Thanks to a stronger-than-expected peso currency, the government has increased its overall 2017 foreign currency bond issuance target to $12.75 billion from its previous plan of issuing $10 billion in international bonds, Finance Minister Luis Caputo told reporters in Buenos Aires. Argentina is going to the international capital markets to help finance a fiscal deficit of 4.2 percent of gross domestic product this year. Caputo said Argentina has $2.6 billion in bonds left to be issued this year. The new paper could be denominated in euros, yen or Swiss francs. The new bond had a coupon of 7.125 percent, the finance ministry said in a statement that hailed success of the sale as evidence that Argentina had regained  credibility and confidence.  Still, the move came as a surprise given Argentina only last year ended a decade-long dispute with creditors over its 2002 default and residents tend to frown upon accumulating debt in dollars.  Implicitly, this shows market confidence that the government will be able to change the idiosyncrasy of the country and will end the borrow and default cycles. Will it?  said Edgardo Sternberg, Emerging Market debt portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles. Bond Prices Fall Argentine sovereign bond yield spreads over U.S. Treasuries widened six basis points, the widest in a month at 412 basis points. Argentina's 2038 dollar bond fell 1.5 cents while the 2046 bond issue fell 2.6 cents. The 2032 par bond was down by 1.5 percent. Though the bond appeared to be well oversubscribed, some investors questioned the wisdom of investing for a such a long term in a country as volatile as Argentina.  It's awfully premature for Argentina to issue 100-year bonds,  said Jorge Piedrahita, chief executive officer of Puma Investments.  When you look back in history, I'm not sure we can find a 20-year period where Argentina has not defaulted.  Citigroup Inc and HSBC acted as lead book runners on the deal, while Nomura Securities and Banco Santander were co-managers. Such long-term bonds are unusual, particularly in emerging markets. Mexico issued a 100-year bond in 2010. Since taking office in late 2015, President Mauricio Macri has implemented several market-friendly reforms to deliver on his promise of normalizing Argentina's economy after years of heavy state intervention and non-payment of international debt obligations under the previous government. He ended a decade-long dispute with creditors that allowed it to re-enter global credit markets, but Argentina lacks an investment grade rating. S&P; and Fitch rate the sovereign a B with a stable outlook, while Moody's has the debt at B3. The country sold 400 million Swiss francs ($410.64 million)in debt in March, and Caputo said on June 7 that Argentina would issue peso and euro bonds later this month. Many Argentines, with memories of the severe economic crisis following a 2002 default, took to social media to express their surprise, some with a touch of humor. One asked if Argentina would exist in 100 years, and another said at least cockroaches would pay off the debt. Axel Kicillof, former finance minister who led negotiations with holdouts under populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez, accused Macri of saddling 10 generations of Argentines with debt.

The company, also known as HBC, said it would review the letter from Litt, whose activist real estate hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management disclosed it had bought 4.3 percent of Hudson's Bay. HBC stock had lost about a third of its value this year amid declining sales at its retail stores, which include Saks, Lord & Taylor and the 347-year-old Hudson's Bay brand. The company this month said it would cut 2,000 jobs as part of a restructuring of its retail business. The stock fell to a record low on Friday, partly due to investor frustration that the company has yet to announce plans to monetize its more than $10 billion in real estate assets. They include its Saks on Fifth Avenue in New York City, which is valued at $3.7 billion. Shares peaked just shy of C$30 two years ago but investors have since complained the value of its real estate holdings are not reflected in the price of its stock, which has a market capitalization of C$1.6 billion ($1.21 billion). Litt called on the board to focus on that issue, saying he estimates the real estate holdings are worth C$35 per share, nearly four times HBC's closing price on Friday.  The path to maximizing the value of Hudson's Bay lies in its real estate, not its retail brands,  said Litt, a former Citigroup real estate analyst.  If there is a smarter and better use of any or all of the locations, stores should be closed and redeveloped and put towards their optimal use.  In addition to its North American operations, HBC owns European department store Galeria Kaufhof. It also holds majority stakes in joint ventures worth over C$8.1 billion ($6.1 billion) for its property holdings in North America and Europe. HBC shares closed up C$1.34 at C$10.22 in Toronto after reaching a high of C$10.45. An Aggressive Activist Litt is known as an aggressive activist investor who pressures his targets through public letters, often pushing companies to sell themselves if they are unable to institute the changes he suggests. In the last year, Litt has pushed for the sale of Brookdale Senior Living Inc, Forest City Realty Trust Inc and FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. Litt took on Taubman Centers Inc this spring and waged an unsuccessful proxy fight to replace two directors on the board, including CEO Bobby Taubman. In 2015, Land and Buildings launched a proxy fight against Macerich Co that resulted in the mall owner adding two directors and making corporate-governance changes. Joshua Varghese, a portfolio manager with CI Investments, one of HBC's biggest shareholders, said he would like the company to close some stores, stop opening new ones and focus on finding ways to get the value of its real estate holdings reflected in the stock price. CI Investments is the company's sixth-largest shareholder with a 4.1 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data.  I hope it will force the management team to address these issues in more detail with its shareholders,  Varghese said. Founded in 1670, HBC began as a fur trader and once owned more than 40 percent of what is now Canada and much of what became North Dakota and Minnesota. U.S. real estate developer Richard Baker bought the firm in 2008 and took it public in 2012, retaining its name and Toronto headquarters. Barry Schwartz, portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services, said the company should gradually pull the plug on its struggling stores and sell the real estate.  Their retail is finished,  said Schwartz, whose firm does not hold any HBC stock.

Twelve weeks of yoga lessened pain and improved function in people with low back pain as much as physical therapy sessions over the same period.  Both yoga and physical therapy are excellent non-drug approaches for low back pain,  said lead author Dr. Robert Saper, of Boston Medical Center. About 10 percent of U.S. adults experience low back pain, but not many are happy with the available treatments, Saper and colleagues write in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  The American College of Physicians advised in February that most people with low back pain should try non-drug treatments like superficial heat or massage before reaching for medications (reut.rs/2strnGw). Physical therapy is the most common non-drug treatment for low back pain prescribed by doctors, according to Saper and colleagues. Yoga is also backed by some guidelines and studies as a treatment option, but until now no research has compared the two. For the new study, the researchers recruited 320 adults with chronic low back pain. The participants were racially diverse and tended to have low incomes. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took part in a 12-week yoga program designed for people with low back pain. Another took part in a physical therapy program over the same amount of time. People in the third group received a book with comprehensive information about low back pain and follow-up information every few weeks. At the start of the study, participants reported - on average - moderate to severe functional impairment and pain. More than two-thirds were using pain medications. To track participants function and pain during the study, the researchers surveyed them at six, 12, 26, 40 and 52 weeks using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).  Scores on the RMDQ measure for function declined - meaning function was improving - by 3.8 points over the 12 weeks in the yoga group, compared to 3.5 points in the physical therapy group. Participants who received education had an average RMDQ score decline of 2.5. Statistically, participants ended up with similar functional improvements whether they underwent yoga, physical therapy or education. More people in the yoga and physical therapy groups ended up with noticeable improvements in function, however. People would feel a noticeable improvement with a four to five point drop on the RMDQ, write Dr. Douglas Chang, of the University of California, San Diego and Dr. Stefan Kertesz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in an accompanying editorial. They write that 48 percent of yoga participants and 37 percent of physical therapy participants reached that goal, compared to 23 percent of people who were in the education group. For achieving noticeable differences in pain, physical therapy was again no better or worse than yoga. After 12 weeks, people in the yoga group were 21 percentage points less likely to used pain medications than those in the education group. That difference was 22 percentage points for physical therapy versus education. The improvements among the people in yoga and physical therapy groups lasted throughout the year, the researchers found.  If they remain the same after one year, it's a good bet that their improvement will continue on,  Saper told Reuters Health. One treatment method won't help all or even most patients, wrote Chang and Kertesz in their editorial.  Nevertheless, as Saper and colleagues have shown, yoga offers some persons tangible benefit without much risk,  they write.  In the end, however, it represents one tool among many.

Fear of childbirth is linked with lower tolerance for labor pain and higher odds of postpartum depression, researchers note in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth. For the current study, they randomly assigned 30 mothers to receive either traditional or mindfulness-based birth classes during their last trimester of pregnancy.  There wasn’t a meaningful difference between the groups in perceived labor pain or use of epidurals, the study found. But women who went through the mindfulness-based birthing classes appeared to have greater body awareness during labor and lower odds of depression after their babies arrived.  “In the mindfulness-based childbirth classes, the emphasis is on purposefully cultivating the life skill of mindfulness - the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose and non-judgmentally to whatever is arising moment by moment - whether it’s the stress of a job, a fearful thought about the future, the physical pain of labor, or a crying baby,” said senior study author Nancy Bardacke, a certified nurse-midwife at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.  “It is also a skill that helps expectant parents manage the reality that the future - whether it is childbirth or life - is both unknown and unpredictable,” Bardacke said by email. All of the women in the study were first-time mothers. Half of them were assigned to a standard childbirth preparation class that reviewed factual information about birth like the stages of labor and what to expect after the baby arrives.  The other women attended an intensive weekend workshop that included standard childbirth preparation topics but also focused on practices like mindful movement, walking meditation, and pain coping strategies. These women also received handouts and guided audio materials so they could practice mindfulness on their own.  While mothers in the mindfulness group sought epidurals at similar rates to those in the control group and afterward reported similar levels of pain during labor, the study did see a trend toward lower use of opioid-based pain medication during labor.  While these results were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance, about 62 percent of women in the standard education group used narcotics during labor compared to 31 percent in the mindfulness group.  “Many women in the mindfulness group used the skills to avoid pain medication in early labor and then opted for epidural when things became more intense, but as a more intentional, mindful choice, versus out of fear of the bodily sensations of labor,” said lead study author Larissa Duncan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  “If a woman intends to avoid epidural, it is possible these skills might permit her to do so,” Duncan said by email.  Women in the mindfulness group also reported fewer symptoms of depression in assessments after birth and six week later than women who went through the standard childbirth education course.  Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include a high rate of epidural use in both groups that made it hard to discern meaningful differences in how women perceived pain, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the duration of labor, a factor that could influence epidural use because this is more common with longer birthing processes.

The assailants stormed the hotel on Sunday afternoon, opening fire on guests and battling with French and Malian special forces deployed to try to free those trapped inside. Mali's Security Ministry said in a statement late on Monday that four of the dead were guests and one was a local soldier who died in the firefight. The nationalities of the dead were a French-Malian, a French-Gabonese, a Chinese, a Portuguese and a Malian soldier, the ministry said. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, confirmed that two of the dead were working for its mission there.  Although the attackers succeeded in mounting a lethal assault, security forces backed by French and United Nations troops managed to rescue around 60 residents in two batches on Sunday night, including 13 French citizens and several children. Some survived thanks to a hotel cashier who led them to a cave embedded in the red-earth hillside near the hotel, according to an interview he gave to Radio France International (RFI).  This was without doubt a terrorist attack,  Security Minister Salif Traore told RFI on Monday. Related CoverageAl Qaeda's Mali affiliate claims it carried out tourist resort attack: U.S. SITE monitoringHis ministry's statement added that authorities had killed four attackers and arrested five others. Earlier in the day, Traore said some of the militants' accomplices were still at large. Several security forces were still being treated for serious injuries.

The alliance that claimed the attack, Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, was created earlier this year from a merger of local groups and is led by a notorious Tuareg commander. It was later endorsed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Islamist groups have claimed increasingly frequent attacks on Western targets in Mali and the wider West Africa region, including a raid on a Bamako hotel in late 2015 which killed 20 people.  But analysts said security forces appeared to have responded more quickly this time than in previous such attacks.

He said this was partly because an elite counterterrorism unit was now properly up and running.  They're specialized in this kind of operation,  he said.  French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to the leader of Mali after the attack and pledged his country's full support for the country, Macron's office said on Monday.  France condemns with utmost firmness this murderous attack,  the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The African Union condemned the attack and reiterated its commitment to support Mali in combating terrorism.

Tensions escalated on Sunday as the U.S. military brought down a Syrian military jet near Raqqa for bombing near U.S.-allied forces on the ground, the first time Washington had carried out such an action in the multi-pronged civil war. It was also the first time the U.S. Air Force had shot down a manned aircraft since May 1999.  In a move that will fan tensions between Washington and Moscow, Russia made clear it was changing its military posture in response to the U.S. downing of the jet. Russia, a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said it would treat U.S.-led coalition aircraft flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria as potential targets and track them with missile systems and military aircraft. It stopped short of saying it would shoot them down. Related CoverageWhite House says retains the right to self defense in SyriaU.S. working to restore Syria 'deconfliction' link with RussiaU.S. repositioning aircraft over Syria as tensions riseThe Russian Defence Ministry said it was also immediately scrapping a Syrian air safety agreement with Washington designed to avoid collisions and dangerous incidents. Moscow accused Washington of failing to honor the pact by not informing it of the decision to shoot down the Syrian plane despite Russian aircraft being airborne at the same time. Washington hit back, saying it would  do what we can to protect our interests.   The escalation of hostilities among the many factions that are operating in this region doesn’t help anybody. And the Syrian regime and others in the regime need to understand that we will retain the right of self-defense, of coalition forces aligned against ISIS,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. The U.S. military said it was repositioning its aircraft over Syria to ensure the safety of American air crews targeting Islamic State. The White House also said it would work to keep lines of communication open with Russia amid the new tensions. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the United States was working to restore a  deconfliction  communications line with Russia meant to avoid an accidental clash over Syria. Marine General Joseph Dunford said there were still communications between a U.S. air operations center in Qatar and Russian forces on the ground in Syria, adding:  We'll work diplomatically and military in the coming hours to re-establish deconfliction.  The U.S. Central Command had issued a statement saying the downed Syrian military jet had been dropping bombs near U.S.-backed SDF forces, which are seeking to oust Islamic State from the city of Raqqa. It said the shooting down of the plane was  collective self-defense  and the coalition had contacted Russian counterparts by telephone via an established  de-confliction line to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing. Russia is supporting Assad militarily with air power, advisers and special forces as he tries to roll back Islamic State and other militant groups. Unlike the United States, it says its presence is sanctioned by the Syrian government. Adding to the tension, Iran launched missiles at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria on Sunday, a strike seen as a projection of military power into part of Syria identified as a top priority by Damascus and its allies.

Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill has kept secret the names of the 12 jurors who spent 52 hours in an unsuccessful effort to decide whether Cosby, now 79, drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand at his home in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004. O'Neill may have concern that naming them publicly could lead to another spate of stories on what led to the jury room logjam, further affecting potential jurors' thoughts on the case.  It's one thing if they preview the evidence,  said Wesley Oliver, a law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.  If the jury's analysis of the evidence has been previewed, that's much more of a tainting issue.  The judge will consider whether to release the jurors' names at a hearing on Tuesday. Concerns about the case's visibility had already prompted O'Neill to import jurors for the first trial from Pittsburgh, around 300 miles (480 km) from the courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Prosecutors, who intend to retry Cosby, filed a motion on Monday urging O'Neill to refrain from identifying the jurors, arguing that widespread coverage of their deliberations could influence jurors for the retrial. But David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor, said he doubted such coverage would make much of a difference given the countless stories already published.  You have at least to ask the question, would it really have more influence than what's already out there?  he said. Even so, Oliver cautioned that the emergence of a particular narrative - that Constand's testimony was not believable, or that only one or two holdouts refused to convict Cosby - could affect potential jurors' view of the case. Also on Monday came the first public comments from a Cosby juror - one of six alternates who heard the evidence but did not deliberate - who said he was  sick  to hear a mistrial declared. Mike McCloskey told a Pittsburgh radio station that he had served as an alternate and would have voted to convict Cosby. Juror names are normally a matter of public record and judges must justify the decision to seal them, legal experts said. In some cases, such as terrorism or mob trials, anonymity is aimed at ensuring jurors' safety. It has become increasingly common for judges to keep juror names secret during high-profile trials, though not after the case has ended, said Paula Hannaford-Agor, who studies juries for the nonprofit National Center for State Courts.  Once the risk to the integrity of the trial has dissipated, there is no legitimate reason for maintaining the anonymity of the jurors,  she said. Some jurors in highly visible cases have endured post-trial harassment. After Casey Anthony was acquitted of suffocating her 2-year-old daughter in 2011, one juror quit her job and moved due to death threats she received, Hannaford-Agor said.

The 76ers acquired the top overall pick from Boston in exchange for their No. 3 selection and a future first-round pick, according to statements released by both teams. The Celtics and 76ers had agreed on the parameters of a deal on Saturday night after Philadelphia held a workout with point guard Markelle Fultz, who will become the fourth No. 1 overall pick in franchise history by the 76ers on Thursday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.  We are very pleased with the outcome of this trade, which puts us in the enviable position of selecting first overall in consecutive draft years,  Philadelphia president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo said.  History suggests that No. 1 has the greatest odds of producing franchise-level talent and we are confident that this year's draft class has that very potential. Thursday night will see us take another significant step toward building a successful and sustainable basketball program.  Boston, with leading scorer Isaiah Thomas already manning the point guard position, was equally thrilled to drop down two spots and receive what they expect to be a high first-round pick in either 2018 or 2019.  We're thrilled to be able to select what we expect be an impact player with the third pick in this year's very talented draft class, while also adding a highly valuable future asset as we continue to build towards Banner 18,  Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said. Boston will receive the 2018 first-round pick of the Los Angeles Lakers -- if that selection falls between the No. 2 to No. 5 range. Otherwise, the Celtics will have a choice of first-rounders in 2019 -- either from Sacramento or Philadelphia, whichever pick is higher. Philadelphia will pair Fultz, a high-scoring point guard out of the University of Washington, with Ben Simmons, last year's No. 1 overall pick who missed the entire season with a foot injury. In his only season with Washington, the 6-foot-5, 186-pound Fultz averaged 23.2 points and 5.9 assists. He shot 47.6 percent, averaged along with 5.9 assists, 5.7 rebounds and 1.6 steals over 25 games during his freshman season with the Huskies, who posted a 9-22 record. Boston, meanwhile, could potentially own the draft rights to seven first-round selections over the next three seasons. The Celtics have been linked with either Josh Jackson of Kansas or Jayson Tatum of Duke at No. 3, although multiple media outlets reported the team may be willing to deal the pick. Lonzo Ball of UCLA is expected to go No. 2 to the Lakers, although the sides have yet to reach agreement on a deal. Ball hosted a second workout for the Lakers on Friday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-phi-idUSKBN19A2WR"},

The previous ones yielded 39 contracts with forecast investment over their lifespan of $48.8 billion, according to the government. Mexico hopes opening the energy sector will help reverse years of declining crude output. Total crude production in Mexico has fallen to 2.01 million barrels per day from a peak of 3.38 million in 2004.

A Commerce Department investigation found that exporters from China had sold hardwood plywoods used for wall panels, kitchen cabinets, tabletops and flooring in the United States for as much as 114.72 percent below fair value, the department said in a statement. The department preliminarily set an anti-dumping margin of 114.72 percent for Shandong Dongfang Bayley Wood Co Ltd and a margin of 57.36 percent for other respondents eligible for a separate rate. A rate of 114.72 percent was set for other Chinese producers who belong to a China-wide entity, the Commerce Department said in a statement.  Mandatory respondent Linyi Chengen Import and Export Co Ltd was determined not to be dumping and was not assessed an anti-dumping margin, the department said. As a result of the decision, the Commerce Department will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits from the firms based on those preliminary rates. Linyi Chengen will not be subject to a cash deposit rate. The Commerce Department said a final determination in the case was expected around Aug. 31. The investigation was launched after the Coalition for Fair Trade in Hardwood Plywood initiated a complaint on behalf of itself and its members, six private firms in Oregon, New York and North Carolina. The Commerce Department issued a preliminary finding in April that the plywood firms were being subsidized by Beijing and should be subjected to countervailing duties ranging from 9.89 percent to 111.09 percent. It calculated preliminary subsidy rates of 111.09 percent for Shandong Dongfang Bayley Wood Co and 9.89 percent for Linyi Sanfortune Wood Co. A final decision in that case is due in early July.

Tensions escalated on Sunday as the U.S. military brought down a Syrian military jet near Raqqa for bombing near U.S.-allied forces on the ground, the first time Washington had carried out such an action in the multi-pronged civil war. It was also the first time the U.S. Air Force had shot down a manned aircraft since May 1999.  In a move that will fan tensions between Washington and Moscow, Russia made clear it was changing its military posture in response to the U.S. downing of the jet. Russia, a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said it would treat U.S.-led coalition aircraft flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria as potential targets and track them with missile systems and military aircraft. It stopped short of saying it would shoot them down. Related CoverageWhite House says retains the right to self defense in SyriaU.S. working to restore Syria 'deconfliction' link with RussiaU.S. repositioning aircraft over Syria as tensions riseThe Russian Defence Ministry said it was also immediately scrapping a Syrian air safety agreement with Washington designed to avoid collisions and dangerous incidents. Moscow accused Washington of failing to honor the pact by not informing it of the decision to shoot down the Syrian plane despite Russian aircraft being airborne at the same time. Washington hit back, saying it would  do what we can to protect our interests.   The escalation of hostilities among the many factions that are operating in this region doesn’t help anybody. And the Syrian regime and others in the regime need to understand that we will retain the right of self-defense, of coalition forces aligned against ISIS,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. The U.S. military said it was repositioning its aircraft over Syria to ensure the safety of American air crews targeting Islamic State. The White House also said it would work to keep lines of communication open with Russia amid the new tensions. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the United States was working to restore a  deconfliction  communications line with Russia meant to avoid an accidental clash over Syria. Marine General Joseph Dunford said there were still communications between a U.S. air operations center in Qatar and Russian forces on the ground in Syria, adding:  We'll work diplomatically and military in the coming hours to re-establish deconfliction.  The U.S. Central Command had issued a statement saying the downed Syrian military jet had been dropping bombs near U.S.-backed SDF forces, which are seeking to oust Islamic State from the city of Raqqa. It said the shooting down of the plane was  collective self-defense  and the coalition had contacted Russian counterparts by telephone via an established  de-confliction line to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing. Russia is supporting Assad militarily with air power, advisers and special forces as he tries to roll back Islamic State and other militant groups. Unlike the United States, it says its presence is sanctioned by the Syrian government. Adding to the tension, Iran launched missiles at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria on Sunday, a strike seen as a projection of military power into part of Syria identified as a top priority by Damascus and its allies.

That's what the meal-kit service is proposing for its initial public offering, at the top of the share-price range proposed in a filing on Monday. The company loses money, though, and competition, potentially including the new Amazon.com-Whole Foods Market combo, will be tough. Delivering healthy, ready-to-prepare meals is a good idea. Hence Blue Apron's robust growth. First-quarter revenue was up over 40 percent from a year earlier to $245 million. The problem is that over a dozen competitors have sprung up, making it costly to attract and hold on to customers. Marketing costs as a percentage of Blue Apron's revenue have been increasing, and the number and size of orders per customer are falling. Moreover, the company lost $52 million in the first quarter, almost as much as in the whole of 2016. Slashing marketing outlays might allow a miniscule profit, but then the top line could stall or start shrinking. Investors certainly wouldn’t value such a firm at over $3 billion. Just look at Groupon's experience. That firm offered a similar mix of fast growth, big losses, and an easily copied business model – selling daily deal coupons. It debuted at a $13 billion valuation. As rivals sprouted, the cost of acquiring and retaining customers went through the roof. Six years later, Groupon hasn’t mastered showing a profit while keeping its revenue stable. It is valued at less than $2 billion, or about half its sales. Now consider Amazon’s $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods, which caught the grocery sector unawares on Friday. Combine the leading internet retailer with a knack for logistics with a company known for selling fresh, up-market food, and one obvious opportunity is selling meal kits to rival Blue Apron's. Amazon doesn’t win every time. It tried to compete with Groupon through its own daily deals and another firm called LivingSocial. Amazon eventually gave up and wrote down most of what it had paid for its stake, and Groupon bought LivingSocial at a fire-sale price. The problem wasn’t so much Amazon as the overall market wasn’t as big or profitable as pioneers had hoped. Either way, investors might reasonably worry that Blue Apron's spicy IPO valuation could be as tasty as it gets.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Shares in BT, Britain's biggest telecoms operator, have underperformed those of its European peers of late, falling by about 21 percent since the start of the year after an accounting scandal in Italy forced the group to cut forecasts for the next two years. Orange said in a statement that it plans to initially lower its BT stake to 2.66 percent by selling about 133 million shares via a private placement.  BT would buy up to 200 million pounds in the placement, part of which would go to its employee share trust, Orange said. At the same time the French group said it had launched an offering of four-year bonds exchangeable for BT shares on another third of its 4 percent stake in the British group.  That offering  amounts to 520 million pounds, reflecting a premium in the range of 35 to 40 percent above the share price set via the initial private placement. If the bonds are fully exercised, Orange's stake in BT would then decrease to 1.33 percent.    The outcome of the placement and the issue price for the bonds should be announced by Tuesday at the latest.   BNP Paribas and JPMorgan are acting as joint bookrunners on the transaction.

The Bank of Canada's top two officials said last week that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows.                      At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading unchanged at C$1.3219 to the greenback, or 75.65 U.S. cents.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3191 to C$1.3260. It touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months on Wednesday at C$1.3165.         The greenback got a boost from comments by New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley suggesting the central bank remained on track to raise U.S. interest rates further despite recent disappointing inflation data.                  Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell to a seven-month low as market players saw more signs that rising crude production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria undercut OPEC-led efforts to support the market with output curbs.     U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled 54 cents lower at $44.20 a barrel.           Canadian government bond prices were lower across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            fell 8.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.943 percent and the 10-year             declined 16 Canadian cents to yield 1.540 percent.     The gap between the 2-year and 10-year yields narrowed by 2.9 basis points to a spread of +59.7 basis points, its smallest gap since Oct. 25, as shorter dated Canadian bonds underperformed.     Canadian wholesale trade data for April is due out on Tuesday, while inflation data for May is due on Friday.

Opposition lawmakers from across the political spectrum have called for Alfredo Thorne to step down since he appeared, in a leaked audio recording, to ask the comptroller to approve an airport contract in exchange for a bigger budget. Thorne, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co executive, has denied that he was pressuring the comptroller and said on Sunday that he would not resign despite censure threats from lawmakers.  But on Monday he asked the president of Congress to schedule a vote of confidence, after he answered lawmakers' questions about the controversy last week.  If Congress renews its confidence in me we will continue to work together to move the country forward as we have been doing. Otherwise I'll immediately step aside,  Thorne said in a video released by his office. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investor, has defended Thorne but said Friday that he had a plan ready in case he leaves. The rightwing opposition party Popular Force could reject Thorne's request to hold a vote of confidence and instead force him from office with a more embarrassing censure. But that would risk escalating tensions with Kuczynski, who could demand a vote that would bring him closer to being able to call a new congressional election.  It's obvious there's no confidence in him. I'm personally going to vote for censuring him if the opportunity presents,  said Ursula Letona, a congresswoman close to Popular Force's leader, Keiko Fujimori. Popular Force has a majority in Peru's single-chamber Congress while Kuczynski's party holds just 17 of 130 seats.  Peru was one of Latin America's most robust economies. But growth has been slowing following a graft scandal and heavy floods this year. Kuczynski is widely expected to name another business-friendly finance minister if Thorne steps down. However, he may choose someone to drop Thorne's much-criticized plan to cut the value-added tax rate. Thorne was a top campaign advisor in last year's presidential election when Kuczynski defied expectations to narrowly beat Fujimori, daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori.  Kuczynski canceled the airport contract last month amid criticism it benefited private companies at the expense of the state.

Brown's Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode and he was killed. A Tesla Inc spokeswoman Tesla spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report. Lawyers for Brown's family did not return messages seeking comment. The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in the report. The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said  Hands Required Not Detected.  In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to  Hands Required Detected  for one to three second periods. Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls. In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown's death. NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles (119 km) per hour less than two minutes before the crash -- above the 65 mph speed limit. The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact. Brown  took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision,  the report said. A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation. He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday. The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle's speed and other data, which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars. For that reason, the NTSB said it  had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow directed both sides to file motions on Tuesday if they failed to reach a negotiated solution that would put Illinois in substantial compliance with federal consent decrees on Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor and disabled.  We're still talking to the state,  said Tom Yates, executive director of Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients. Yates added while he could not divulge details of the talks, no motion will be filed on Tuesday on behalf the recipients, some of whom could lose their access to medical services because Illinois owes Medicaid providers $2 billion. Eileen Boyce, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Attorney General's office, confirmed that talks were ongoing and said the office did not plan to file a motion on behalf of the state on Tuesday. Lefkow's June 7 order found Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations that in turn pay doctors and others did not comply with the consent decrees, which resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992. In the wake of the order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in U.S. municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. As a result, the state has amassed an unpaid bill pile topping $15 billion, while payments mandated by state law for expenses such as debt service on bonds and pensions were made in full. The next court status hearing for the Medicaid cases is scheduled for June 28, just days before the July 1 start of Illinois' new fiscal year. Governor Bruce Rauner has ordered lawmakers into a special session beginning on Wednesday to pass a fiscal 2018 budget.  Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state's debt and others to demand even fatter yields.

It allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. Ross is expected to announce within days the outcome of the steel inquiry.

Days after a lone gunman opened fire on U.S. lawmakers at a baseball team practice in Virginia, a conservative group was running a TV ad in Atlanta that, with no evidence, appears to link the Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, to the shooting spree. Ossoff called the ad  shameful  in a statement. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported that Ossoff's Republican opponent, Karen Handel, also condemned the ad. It was an ugly, last-minute twist in the Ossoff-Handel contest for the U.S. House of Representatives seat vacated by Tom Price, who resigned after becoming Trump's secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Total spending in the Georgia race for all candidates has topped $56 million, including tens of millions by outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog in Washington, D.C., easily topping the previous record of $29.5 million set in a 2012 Florida race. Out of the total, $51.9 million has been spent on Handel and Ossoff, the Center for Responsive Politics said. Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff is interviewed by news organizations as he campaigns for Georgia's 6th Congressional District special election in Chamblee.Chris Aluka BerryEnvelopes containing a white powder turned up last week in the home mailboxes of Handel and a few neighbors, prompting a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Washington Post reported that the powder was only baking soda and both candidates now are traveling with bodyguards. The district spans affluent and increasingly diverse suburbs north of Atlanta. It has elected Republicans for decades, but Trump carried it by only 1 percentage point in 2016. Slideshow (7 Images)Ossoff, 30, initially drew national attention with the slogan  Make Trump Furious,  inspiring volunteers from as far away as Oregon to knock on doors and make phone calls for him. Handel, a 55-year-old former Georgia secretary of state, has painted Ossoff as an inexperienced tool of national liberal interests who does not live in the district he hopes to represent. Like Ossoff, Handel rarely mentions Trump. Whatever the outcome, the race will not significantly alter the balance of power in Washington, where Republicans control the House by a wide margin. But victory could provide a blueprint for Democrats on how to win outside of their urban, coastal strongholds.  Democrats fell short in special House elections earlier this year in Kansas and Montana, in districts that Trump won by double-digits. Also on Tuesday is a race in South Carolina, which Republicans are expected to win handily, for a replacement for Republican Mick Mulvaney, now Trump's budget director.

The recording, captured by microphones linked wirelessly to the dashboard video system in the officers' patrol car, was publicly released in the interest of maintaining  transparency  in the investigation of Sunday's shooting, the Seattle Police Department said. Much about the circumstances of the shooting remain unclear.  What the recording does not show, according to official police accounts, is that the woman brandished a knife at the two officers before they responded with lethal force. Both officers have been placed on paid administrative leave, police said.  The woman was identified by family members as 30-year-old Charleena Lyles, who relatives said was a mother suffering from mental health issues. She was shot dead in her apartment moments after the officers arrived on Sunday morning. Several children were also present but were not injured, police said. The advocacy group MomsRising said Lyles had four children and was expecting a fifth.  The police killing of Charleena Lyles, a pregnant black woman who called the police to report a burglary in the midst of a mental health crisis, is an unacceptable tragedy,  the group said. The four-minute audio from Sunday's incident opens with the two officers conversing en route to Lyles' apartment about a separate event, two weeks before, in which Lyle was arrested for threatening responding police with a pair of scissors. The Seattle Police Department in a statement posted on its website along with the audio recording said that two officers were sent on Sunday to respond to the report of a burglary, instead of the typical one,  because of a recent officer safety caution associated with the caller.    She let them in, then she started talking all crazy about how the officers weren't going to leave,  one officer says on the tape.  This gal, she is the one making all these weird statements about how her and her daughter are going to turn into wolves.  The officers are then heard greeting Lyles at her door.  Hello, good morning. You called today?  one of them asks. She lets them in and says,  There was a break-in.  The discourse proceeds calmly at first, as police ask Lyles  questions and she responds. Suddenly, scuffling noises are heard, and the officers repeatedly order Lyles to  get back,  as a child cries in the background. Lyles is then heard uttering a profanity, before one officer says over his radio,  We need help,  and again orders her to  get back,  followed by the sound of four to five gunshots in rapid succession. The tape ends there. Police said both officers were equipped with  less lethal force options,  and family members have questioned why those methods were not used instead. The department said all its officers undergo  crisis intervention training.  The agency has been implementing court-ordered reforms since 2012 to address what a U.S. Justice Department inquiry found to be a pattern of excessive force by Seattle police during encounters with the mentally ill or individuals under the influence of drugs  Reporting by Patrick Enright and Eric M.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow directed both sides to file motions on Tuesday if they failed to reach a negotiated solution that would put Illinois in substantial compliance with federal consent decrees on Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor and disabled.  We're still talking to the state,  said Tom Yates, executive director of Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients. Yates added while he could not divulge details of the talks, no motion will be filed on Tuesday on behalf the recipients, some of whom could lose their access to medical services because Illinois owes Medicaid providers $2 billion. Eileen Boyce, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Attorney General's office, confirmed that talks were ongoing and said the office did not plan to file a motion on behalf of the state on Tuesday. Lefkow's June 7 order found Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations that in turn pay doctors and others did not comply with the consent decrees, which resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992. In the wake of the order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in U.S. municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. As a result, the state has amassed an unpaid bill pile topping $15 billion, while payments mandated by state law for expenses such as debt service on bonds and pensions were made in full. The next court status hearing for the Medicaid cases is scheduled for June 28, just days before the July 1 start of Illinois' new fiscal year. Governor Bruce Rauner has ordered lawmakers into a special session beginning on Wednesday to pass a fiscal 2018 budget. Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state's debt and others to demand even fatter yields.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-idUSL1N1JG1R2"},

Opposition lawmakers from across the political spectrum have called for Alfredo Thorne to step down since he appeared, in a leaked audio recording, to ask the comptroller to approve an airport contract in exchange for a bigger budget. Thorne, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co executive, has denied that he was pressuring the comptroller and said on Sunday that he would not resign despite censure threats from lawmakers.  But on Monday he asked the president of Congress to schedule a vote of confidence, after he answered lawmakers' questions about the controversy last week.  If Congress renews its confidence in me we will continue to work together to move the country forward as we have been doing. Otherwise I'll immediately step aside,  Thorne said in a video released by his office. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investor, has defended Thorne but said Friday that he had a plan ready in case he leaves. The rightwing opposition party Popular Force could reject Thorne's request to hold a vote of confidence and instead force him from office with a more embarrassing censure. But that would risk escalating tensions with Kuczynski, who could demand a vote that would bring him closer to being able to call a new congressional election.  It's obvious there's no confidence in him. I'm personally going to vote for censuring him if the opportunity presents,  said Ursula Letona, a congresswoman close to Popular Force's leader, Keiko Fujimori. Popular Force has a majority in Peru's single-chamber Congress while Kuczynski's party holds just 17 of 130 seats.  Peru was one of Latin America's most robust economies. But growth has been slowing following a graft scandal and heavy floods this year. Kuczynski is widely expected to name another business-friendly finance minister if Thorne steps down. However, he may choose someone to drop Thorne's much-criticized plan to cut the value-added tax rate. Thorne was a top campaign advisor in last year's presidential election when Kuczynski defied expectations to narrowly beat Fujimori, daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori.  Kuczynski canceled the airport contract last month amid criticism it benefited private companies at the expense of the state.

The justices ruled 5-4 in favor of inmate James McWilliams, who was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a convenience store clerk in Tuscaloosa. They sent the case back to lower courts to determine if McWilliams' death sentence will stand in light of the decision. McWilliams became the third black death row inmate the Supreme Court has backed in recent months in cases that civil rights advocates say expose problems in America's criminal justice system that disproportionately affect minorities. The justices did not rule on the main question before them: whether indigent criminal defendants who may have a mental illness have the right to independent expert witnesses to testify in their defense, or whether court-appointed experts who offer findings to the prosecution and the defense are adequate. Instead, the court found that Alabama had not met the basic standards set by a 1985 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Ake v. Oklahoma stating that indigent defendants are entitled to expert assistance. That ruling did not specifically say the expert had to be assigned to assist the defense as opposed to being an expert helping both sides. The court's four liberals were joined by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy in siding with McWilliams in the ruling written by Justice Stephen Breyer, with the other four conservatives dissenting.  James McWilliams could not have a fair trial without a mental health expert to assess his brain damage and other mental impairments and to help his counsel present that information to the sentencing court. He was denied such assistance,  said McWilliams' lawyer, Stephen Bright. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, called the ruling  an affront to the rule of law  because the court had decided a legal question the parties had not argued. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito made a similar point in his dissenting opinion, which was joined by three of the court's other conservatives. Bright argued that McWilliams was mentally ill, saying the 1985 ruling clearly established a criminal defendant's right in appropriate cases to an independent expert to  assist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense.  In the 1984 crime, McWilliams entered a convenience store, locked the doors, took money from clerk Patricia Reynolds, forced her into a back room, raped her, shot her 16 times with a pistol and left her to bleed to death. McWilliams, later caught driving a stolen car in possession of the murder weapon, was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1986. The justices twice this year have ruled in favor of Texas death row inmates. The court found on March 28 that Texas used an obsolete standard to assess whether convicted murderer Bobby Moore was intellectually disabled and exempt from capital punishment. The court on Feb. 22 gave convicted murderer inmate Duane Buck the chance to avoid execution because his trial was tainted by testimony from a psychologist who stated Buck was more likely to commit future crimes because he is black. Chief Justice John Roberts denounced the  noxious strain of racial prejudice  seen in the case.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-deathpenalty-idUSL1N1JG1QJ"},

Pawlowski,Gerry Glombicki,Hannah James,Jeff A. Mohrenweiser,Fitch Affirms Travelers' Ratings; Outlook Stable,Credit / Debt Ratings,Americas,Insurance (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,United States","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows: --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'/'Very Strong'; --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full list of rating actions below. KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by very strong capitalization, a history of favorable reserve development, a top-tier competitive position in the U.S. property/casualty insurance market, and very strong financial performance and earnings. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Prism, Fitch's proprietary capital model, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA' IFS rating. Other measures of capital strength such as consolidated NAIC RBC and net leverage ratios were 300% of the company action level and 3.8x, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2016, and are consistent with median guidelines for the current rating category. Fitch expects that share repurchase activity will reflect underlying profitability and will not reduce capital strength. TRV repurchased 1.9 million common shares under its share repurchase authorization at a total cost of $225 million during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). In April 2017, TRV's Board of Directors approved a $5 billion addition to the repurchase authorization, leaving $5.7 billion of capacity. Financial leverage remains within management's stated range and below Fitch's 25% rating sensitivity. In May 2017, TRV issued $700 million of 4% senior notes due in 2047. Fitch anticipates TRV using the proceeds from the planned issuance to repay $450 million in outstanding senior notes maturing in December 2017 and to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Simply Business acquisition. Fitch calculates that TRV's financial leverage ratio will be near 24% following the debt issuance, compared with approximately 22% at March 31, 2017. This calculation does not count debt redemptions. Reserves have a higher influence on TRV's ratings given a product mix that includes long-tailed lines of business such as workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Fitch's analysis of TRV's reserves continues to indicate a modestly redundant position which is supported by a history of favorable reserve development. The company's asbestos reserve survival ratio remains below Fitch's expectations of 11-13 years despite adjustments for settlement agreements that are less likely to develop adversely. Fitch views the company's business profile as very strong and notes that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' category. TRV offers a wide range of insurance products to both the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top tier position among independent insurance agencies. Return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 12.8% for 2016 and annualized first quarter 2017 ROE was 10.5%. 1Q17 profitability was suppressed by a lower level of favorable reserve development, partially tied to the Ogden discount rate adjustment, and increased catastrophe losses. Net investment income is expected to remain pressured in the near term by the prevailing low interest rate environment. Operating EBIT's coverage of fixed charges was 9.5x during 1Q17, which is down compared to full-year 2016's 12.1x and below Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category. The consolidated combined ratio deteriorated during 2016 and 1Q17 to 92% and 96%, respectively. Business & International (B&I;) and Personal Lines have been responsible for the period-to-period decline in profitability. B&I; is by far TRV's largest segment, accounting for nearly 60% of total net written premiums in 2016. Workers' compensation and commercial multi-peril represent nearly half of net written premiums in the segment. B&I; reported an underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and reserve development, near 94% for both full-year 2016 and 1Q17. Increasing loss-cost trends outpaced earned pricing and greater non-catastrophe weather losses explain the modest deterioration in recent results. TRV has a top-tier position in contract and commercial surety, private and non-profit management liability, and community banks. The Bond and Specialty segment has been consistently profitable with a five-year average combined ratio below 70%. Favorable prior year reserve development makes a significant contribution to profitability of this segment. TRV's Personal Lines segment, offering auto and homeowners insurance, remains modestly sized as the ninth largest domestic writer by net written premiums. The reported underwriting results were essentially break-even during 1Q17. Higher loss estimates in personal auto bodily injury liability coverages are the greatest contributor to the deteriorating underlying underwriting results in this line of business. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very Strong' category; --A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x over an extended period; --A sustained period where the combined ratio exceeds 100% or the operating ratio exceeds 90%; --A persistent and material deterioration in reserve adequacy. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely Strong'. --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS The following ratings have been affirmed by Fitch: The Travelers Companies, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at 'A'; --5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at 'A'; --5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at 'A'; --3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at 'A'; --6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at 'A'; --5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at 'A'; --4.60% senior notes due Aug. 1, 2043 at 'A'; --4.30% senior notes due Aug. 25, 2045 at 'A'; --3.75% senior notes due May 15, 2046 at 'A'; --4.00% senior notes due May 30, 2047 at 'A'; --$800 million commercial paper program at 'F1'.

The justices ruled 5-4 in favor of inmate James McWilliams, who was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a convenience store clerk in Tuscaloosa. They sent the case back to lower courts to determine if McWilliams' death sentence will stand in light of the decision. McWilliams became the third black death row inmate the Supreme Court has backed in recent months in cases that civil rights advocates say expose problems in America's criminal justice system that disproportionately affect minorities. The justices did not rule on the main question before them: whether indigent criminal defendants who may have a mental illness have the right to independent expert witnesses to testify in their defense, or whether court-appointed experts who offer findings to the prosecution and the defense are adequate. Instead, the court found that Alabama had not met the basic standards set by a 1985 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Ake v. Oklahoma stating that indigent defendants are entitled to expert assistance. That ruling did not specifically say the expert had to be assigned to assist the defense as opposed to being an expert helping both sides. The court's four liberals were joined by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy in siding with McWilliams in the ruling written by Justice Stephen Breyer, with the other four conservatives dissenting.  James McWilliams could not have a fair trial without a mental health expert to assess his brain damage and other mental impairments and to help his counsel present that information to the sentencing court. He was denied such assistance,  said McWilliams' lawyer, Stephen Bright. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, called the ruling  an affront to the rule of law  because the court had decided a legal question the parties had not argued. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito made a similar point in his dissenting opinion, which was joined by three of the court's other conservatives. Bright argued that McWilliams was mentally ill, saying the 1985 ruling clearly established a criminal defendant's right in appropriate cases to an independent expert to  assist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense.  In the 1984 crime, McWilliams entered a convenience store, locked the doors, took money from clerk Patricia Reynolds, forced her into a back room, raped her, shot her 16 times with a pistol and left her to bleed to death. McWilliams, later caught driving a stolen car in possession of the murder weapon, was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1986. The justices twice this year have ruled in favor of Texas death row inmates. The court found on March 28 that Texas used an obsolete standard to assess whether convicted murderer Bobby Moore was intellectually disabled and exempt from capital punishment. The court on Feb. 22 gave convicted murderer inmate Duane Buck the chance to avoid execution because his trial was tainted by testimony from a psychologist who stated Buck was more likely to commit future crimes because he is black. Chief Justice John Roberts denounced the  noxious strain of racial prejudice  seen in the case.

In a letter to companies for which Flynn worked, U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel requested documents related to Flynn's work in Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. They said Flynn had not accurately reported his foreign travels and contacts in a 2016 application to renew his security clearance. Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Engel is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Flynn's work for foreign interests has taken center stage in a broad federal investigation into the ties between President Donald Trump's associates and Russia and other countries during and after the 2016 election. While Flynn disclosed an October 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia, Cummings and Engel said Flynn omitted key details and said they could not identify any conference he may have attended or find the hotel he reported staying at during the trip. The two lawmakers said they were most troubled by the lack of any Flynn record identifying  even a single foreign government official he had contact with in the seven years prior to submitting his security clearance application.  Cummings and Engel also cited a recent Newsweek report which said Flynn took a trip to the Middle East in the summer of 2015 in pursuit of a joint U.S.-Russian venture to develop nuclear facilities, in a deal to be financed by Saudi Arabia.  If this press report is accurate, General Flynn's failure to report this trip and any contacts with foreign government officials about this Saudi-Russian nuclear proposal appears to be a potential violation  of a law against making false statements to federal officials, the letter said.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow directed both sides to file motions on Tuesday if they failed to reach a negotiated solution that would put Illinois in substantial compliance with federal consent decrees on Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor and disabled.  We're still talking to the state,  said Tom Yates, executive director of Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients. Yates added while he could not divulge details of the talks, no motion will be filed on Tuesday on behalf the recipients, some of whom could lose their access to medical services because Illinois owes Medicaid providers $2 billion. Eileen Boyce, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Attorney General's office, confirmed that talks were ongoing and said the office did not plan to file a motion on behalf of the state on Tuesday. Lefkow's June 7 order found Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations that in turn pay doctors and others did not comply with the consent decrees, which resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992. In the wake of the order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in U.S. municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. As a result, the state has amassed an unpaid bill pile topping $15 billion, while payments mandated by state law for expenses such as debt service on bonds and pensions were made in full. The next court status hearing for the Medicaid cases is scheduled for June 28, just days before the July 1 start of Illinois' new fiscal year. Governor Bruce Rauner has ordered lawmakers into a special session beginning on Wednesday to pass a fiscal 2018 budget.  Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state's debt and others to demand even fatter yields.

The head of the U.N.'s UNHCR refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, said world powers had to step up pressure on South Sudan's warring parties to go back to talks on ending a civil war that has forced about a third of the population to flee. In South Sudan to launch the UNHCR's annual refugee report, Grandi said his agency had already worked there for decades, helping hundreds of thousands fleeing the territory's long wars with Khartoum. UNHCR was still there, helping many of the same people now fleeing an internal conflict, he told local government officials in the northern town of Bentiu.  Now, the authorities have a greater responsibility because they are in charge of this country and it is under their leadership that we must seek security,  Grandi said.  We are here to help but, in the end, as you know, the responsibility is with you and your colleagues in Juba and here.  South Sudan's civil war erupted out of political infighting in late 2013, just two years after South Sudan declared independence from Sudan and took over running its own affairs. Since then, nearly 2 million people have fled fighting that the United Nations has said amounts in some areas to ethnic cleansing. There has been a string of failed cease-fires and peace accords. Kingdoms of Dependency South Sudanese refugee women living in Nguenyyiel Refugee camp prepare vegetables for cooking near Gambella, Ethiopia June 19, 2017.David LewisAcross the world, the number of displaced people had risen by 300,000 by the end of 2016 from a year earlier - though the pace of the increase had eased from past years, the UNHCR report said. Of the total 65.6 million displaced, just over 40 million had remained in their countries while 22.5 million were registered as refugees abroad. There were another 2.8 million asylum seekers, the report said. Globally, Syrians still represent the largest forcibly displaced population with 12 million refugees or internally displaced – some 65 percent of the population – by the end of 2016. Turkey hosted the most refugees with 2.9 million people. Slideshow (6 Images)UNHCR also sounded an alarm over another rapidly escalating crisis in Democratic Republic of Congo, where over 1 million people have been displaced internally and over 30,000 terms have crossed into Angola since August. In South Sudan, Grandi said the combination of violence, ethnic strife, lack of development, climatic factors and international neglect was unmatched anywhere in the world.  There are dead ends all around ... I think we can still do something but we desperately need international pressure on the parties to go back to the table and be serious about peace,  he said. Aid workers were struggling to raise funds, partly because of frustrations over the lack of progress in peace talks and partly because the scale of the problem was hidden, he said.  They (South Sudan's refugees) don't arrive on the shores of Europe, or Australia or at the border between Mexico and the U.S. Those are the places where refugees become visible and their voices are heard,  he said. While Grandi said ensuring people were safe was important, he warned against setting up  kingdoms of dependency  like the sprawling camps for Somali refugees in Dadaab in northern Kenya that have become permanent settlements.

The International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) infuriated creditors when at the end of May it unveiled a plan to restructure some $3.3 billion in debt and said senior creditors, including Eurobond holders, would need to write down some debt and wait longer to be paid. Creditors were instead offered the chance to swap their holdings for $1 billion in sovereign bonds, with senior creditors given the chance to choose from three restructuring options. The bank said in a statement that  having taken into account feedback received from certain creditors and with the concurrence of the Ministry of Finance of Azerbaijan  it had modified  particular aspects of the restructuring plan . It said the new bond maturing 2032 would be redeemed in three equal annual installments, instead of two installments as stated previously. Participants would also be allowed to request several different allocation options, instead of opting for just one, it added. Finally, claimants who agree to vote in favour of the overall restructuring plan and choose their restructuring option within an 11-day period will be awarded their preferred allocation, the bank added. This is a departure from the original  first-come, first served  stipulation. The bank also said that accrued interest on outstanding debt would be calculated up to Sept. 1, 2017, as opposed to the previously stated July 13, 2017. IBA is being advised by Lazard and law firm White & Case. Creditors include commodities trader Cargill, Italian lender Intesa Sanpaolo, Germany's Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank and French bank Societe Generale while some big asset managers are among holders of its Eurobond. Two ad-hoc groups of creditors have formed and IBA said it has been in talks with one group which controls around $400 million worth of debt. Another group which includes Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and two smaller funds, VR and Promeritum, recently filed an objection in a U.S. court against the restructuring plan . Neither group could be reached for comment on the updated restructuring proposals.

(Reuters) - Astronomers on Monday added 219 candidates to the growing list of planets beyond the solar system, 10 of which may be about the same size and temperature as Earth, boosting the chances for life. Scientists found the planet candidates in a final batch of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope observations of 200,000 sample stars in the constellation Cygnus.  The candidates include 10 newly discovered rocky worlds that are properly distanced from their parent stars for water, if it exists, to pool on their surfaces. Scientists believe liquid water is a key ingredient for life.  “An important question for us is, ‘Are we alone?'  Kepler program scientist Mario Perez said in a conference call with reporters. “Maybe Kepler today is telling us indirectly ... that we are not alone.” The National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched the Kepler telescope in 2009 to learn if Earth-like planets are common or rare. With the final analysis of Kepler data in hand, scientists said they will now work on answering that question, a key step in assessing the chance that life exists beyond Earth.  During a four-year mission, Kepler found 2,335 confirmed planets and another 1,699 candidates, bringing its tally to 4,034. That number includes about 50 worlds that may be about the same size and temperature as Earth.  Including other telescope surveys, scientists have confirmed the existence of nearly 3,500 planets beyond the solar system.  Kepler’s data also provided a new way to assess whether a planet has a solid surface, like Earth, or is made mostly of gas, like Neptune. The distinction will help scientists home in on potential Earth-like planets and better the odds for finding life.  The Kepler team found that planets which are about 1.75 times the size of Earth and smaller tend to be rocky, while those two- to 3.5 times the size of Earth become gas-shrouded worlds like Neptune. “It’s like finding what we thought was a single species of animal is really two different things,” said Benjamin Fulton, a graduate student in astronomy who analyzed the Kepler data. So far, these planets, which scientists refer to as “super-Earths” and “mini-Neptunes,” have not been found in Earth’s solar system, though scientists are on the hunt for a potential ninth planet far beyond Pluto. “It is interesting that we don’t have what appears to be the most common type of planet in the galaxy,” Fulton said.

Universal has said it does not believe the investigation will impact its business. The statement issued on the company's website on Monday said that the company had found that a wholly owned subsidiary of Universal in South Korea, Universal Entertainment Korea Co., Ltd, had disbursed $170,000 related to a $80 million loan taken out by Okada Holdings Ltd for a land transaction in 2014. Okada Holdings, which is controlled by Okada and his relatives, is majority owner of Universal Entertainment. The amount disbursed was equal to interest owed on the loan that should have been paid by Okada Holdings rather than the Universal subsidiary in South Korea, Universal said. The company also said on Monday that it found Okada had in March 2015 withdrawn HK$16 million ($2.05 million) from a bank account of Tiger Resort Asia Limited (TRA), a Hong Kong subsidiary of Universal in which Okada was the sole director at the time. Universal said in the statement that both transactions were carried out without the necessary internal procedures and may constitute a  serious violation of governance.  In a statement on its website on June 8,  Universal said it had found potential problems related to a HK$135 million ($17.31 million)loan from TRA in 2015 to an unnamed third party. Nearly all of that amount was subsequently transferred to Okada Holdings Ltd with the objective of personally benefiting Okada, the company said. Separate from the recent allegations, Okada and his companies have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

Whole Foods shares rose 1.3 percent on Monday to close at $43.22 - adding to Friday's 29 percent rise and reflecting hopes the company might fetch a higher price. Amazon shares ended up 0.8 percent at $995.17. “We thought Amazon was thrifty in its offer,  said Charles Kantor, managing director at Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers LLC, which owns around 2.7 percent of Whole Foods shares and had pressured the company to take steps to improve its stock price.  Kantor noted that Amazon’s market cap gain roughly equaled the amount the company is paying for Whole Foods.  “I think there’s the argument that Amazon acquired Whole Foods for free,  he said.  The reaction of shareholders suggests that Amazon has left themselves lots of room to pay more for this strategic asset.  Some investors suspected other companies were weighing a rival bid.     “Every grocery store out there now is having a conversation about how much they can afford to spend to keep Amazon out of the space,” said Brian Culpepper, a portfolio manager at James Advantage funds. Culpepper, who owns Kroger Co (KR.N) shares, said Kroger is the company that would be most likely improve Whole Foods’ efficiency, but that it would have difficulty matching Amazon’s cash offer.  Kroger shares climbed 1.6 percent to close at $22.64 on Monday. “Kroger would have to pay in stock, and their stock has been hurting,” giving them less leverage to get into a protracted bidding war with Amazon, Culpepper said.  Barclays analyst Karen Short raised her Whole Foods price target to $48 from $38 and upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight, citing the possibility of counterbids.  Many will do anything to either make this acquisition more costly for Amazon, or prevent the asset from landing in Amazon's lap,  Short wrote in a note to clients.   A $48-a-share price tag would be more than reasonable for a fellow retailer that could eliminate overhead at Whole Foods, Short said, while adding that very few companies could outbid Amazon. Amazon's offer of $13.7 billion, representing a multiple of 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, could possibly be raised to 11 or 12 times, according to Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli Funds, which holds Whole Foods shares.   Fourteen billion is a big number but it’s not a number where there’s no other buyer,  said Dreyer.  Others could certainly look at this and sharpen their pencils.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) could have sufficiently deep pockets to make a counter bid and other grocery rivals such as Kroger or Albertsons Cos Inc (ABS.N) would have the motivation, he said. Any of the big grocery chains that bid on Whole Foods would likely win antitrust approval to buy the premium grocery chain, according to three antitrust experts. Any buyer of Whole Foods would likely argue that it was not in the same market, said Alden Abbott, an antitrust expert with the Heritage Foundation.  Even if they did compete ... you'd have to look at the presence of (other grocery chains),  said Abbott, who argued that many Whole Foods stores are in close proximity to other grocery stores, which means antitrust enforcers might be satisfied there was adequate competition.

Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Croatia granted entry to the European Union in 2013, nine years after Slovenia's accession to the bloc. No other former Yugoslav state has joined the EU so far. Croatia withdrew from the arbitration procedures in 2015 after a leaked tape showed a Slovenian judge on the panel improperly exchanging confidential information with the Ljubljana government.

Italy's Eni, Colombia's Ecopetrol and Capricorn Energy, a unit of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy , were among the companies at the forefront of the bidding for 15 blocks in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Ten of the 15 blocks were taken up in the auction. The auction was the most recent step in Mexico's bid to attract more private investment to the industry after Congress changed the constitution in late 2013 to end the 75-year production and exploration monopoly of state oil company Pemex. Top government officials told Reuters before the auction they were hopeful Mexico would assign at least one-third to 40 percent of the blocks in the shallow water round. The auction was the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep water and two previous shallow water tenders. They yielded 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over their lifespan of $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data. Mexico hopes by opening up the energy sector it will help reverse years of declining crude oil output.

Such is the case with news that Argentina plans to sell a 100-year bond, a story tailor-made to illustrate exactly how extreme financial market risk-taking has become. It also shows that global investors either a) have the attention span of a gnat or b) are not paid for making good long-term decisions. I’ll vote for the latter, but am willing to listen to arguments for the former. This isn’t, at base, a story about Argentina, but about how financial intermediaries are paid. Argentina, which just two years ago emerged from a long and tortuous period of default, a state to which it has laid claim for more than half of all days since 1980, is seeking to borrow $2.75 billion for 100 years at about 7.9 percent. This is the same Argentina which fought tooth and nail against creditors unwilling to come to terms over its 2001 default, imposing currency controls. To be sure Argentina has a good “story” as they say in roadshows, emerging from recession and seeing its credit ratings on the rise, though we are still talking about a credit rated “B”. MSCI is also, according to the Financial Times, about to lift Argentina’s equities into Emerging Markets indices from Frontier ones. That must make it a good bet to borrow money some of which won’t, under the best of circumstances, be repaid until after many grandchildren of the readers of this story are no longer clipping coupons. Since gaining independence in 1816, Argentina has defaulted at least eight times, with some debate over whether some local currency efforts should raise the tally. Sounds like a solid bet to go the distance. And remember too that this particular borrower isn’t just acting in its own drama, but pushing this plot point at a time when global interest rates are not too far off all-time lows. That’s important, and I am a bit abashed to feel the need to explain this, because the longer dated a debt instrument is the more sensitive its value is to movements in interest rates. I, like most investors, don’t think the Federal Reserve will be able to restore historically normal interest rates any time soon, but interest rates don’t have to rise too very much to do serious damage to the capital value of a 2017 vintage 100-year bond. Bumpy Ride Any investor who is signing on for a 100-year bond, even the geniuses who intend to trade in and out at opportune moments, need to prepare themselves for potentially a very bumpy ride. To understand why Argentina is able to finance itself for 100 years, we are going to have to look at the issue more broadly than just through the lens of Argentina’s particular set of merits and demerits. And sure, there are entities out there with very long-term liabilities and long-dated debt can be useful for them, making them “natural buyers”. The real story behind Argentina borrowing for 100 years is the very calm, very low-growth and low-inflation global macroeconomic background, combined with a general mood of optimism and a peculiar strain of financial markets calm. It is not a surprise that this bond comes at a time of very, very low volatility, and very, very low interest rates. Also I suppose we should add in the perverse incentives of fund managers, who as the agents for their principals are paid to take a narrow view of outperformance and stretch to achieve it. Sober, sensible bond fund managers, the ones who don’t invest as if central bank liquidity will be endless, have had a tough few years. Their peers more willing to take risks have been right, and may well continue to be right, at least as the game they are playing judges rightness. Capital markets do not discipline borrowers when they are dominated, as they are, by agents acting for principals. For the International Monetary Fund or any other person or body to speak as if they do or will is absurd. All that counts is how the credit looks in the time frame against which the performance of the fund manager is judged. So, the markets are on a momentum high and risk taking, at its far reaches, is extreme. Remember, this is the same market that brought you 800-some crypto-currencies with a value of more than $100 billion. By comparison, 100-year Argentina bonds are stolid, sensible investments appropriate to widows and very young orphans. I wish them, and the agents acting on their behalf, and Argentina, the very best of luck. (Editing by James Dalgleish) )","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-saft-idUSL1N1JD10T"},

The broadcaster, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said as a result it now owned the whole of the Premium unit. It did not disclose any financial details. But a source close to the matter said in exchange for its stake Telefonica would get part of damages Mediaset hopes to get from Vivendi (VIV.PA) in an ongoing legal spat involving the unit. Telefonica declined to comment. Mediaset and Vivendi have been at loggerheads since July when the French media giant ditched an agreement to take control of Premium. Mediaset is seeking 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion)in damages in the case. Telefonica originally bought the stake in the Italian pay-TV business at the start of 2015 for 100 million euros in a deal valuing Premium at 900 million euros. According to the source, Mediaset had reached an agreement with the Spanish group to buy the stake for about 70 million euros and then sell it on to Vivendi. But the sale did not go through when the deal to sell Premium to Vivendi fell through.  Telefonica was a passive shareholder in a difficult market and that's why it's decided to sell the Mediaset stake,  said a second source with knowledge of the matter.

(Reuters) - Democrat Jon Ossoff no longer talks about making President Donald Trump furious. But he may be on the verge of doing just that. Ossoff, a political newcomer who launched his congressional campaign in the Republican-leaning northern suburbs of Atlanta by urging supporters to  make Trump furious,  now speaks in the measured tones of a moderate consensus builder and rarely mentions the president by name. Local economic development and cutting wasteful government spending are Ossoff's talking points in a race against Republican Karen Handel that has shattered records as the most expensive congressional contest in U.S. history. Polls show it is headed for a tight finish in Tuesday's special election. An Ossoff victory would rattle Republicans already nervous about next year's congressional midterm elections, and offer Democrats a template on how to campaign in suburban swing districts as they try to erase the 24-seat Republican majority in the House of Representatives.  It would send a very strong message across the country that we can win these kinds of seats,  said Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who campaigned with Ossoff in Georgia this week. Democrats have much riding on the outcome. On the surface, conditions seem ripe for a nationwide Democratic renaissance, with a historically unpopular Republican president entangled in an investigation for possible obstruction of justice and the Republican agenda largely stalled in Congress. But Democrats lost two special House elections earlier this year in conservative Kansas and Montana districts that Trump won by double digits last November. A failure in a more competitive district in Georgia, which Trump carried by just 1 percentage point, would be a morale killer for a party that has struggled to develop a coherent message beyond  We're not the party of Trump.  Democrats have steadily lost ground in recent years in state and local races. Republicans not only control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but also hold 33 governor's offices, the most in nearly a century. Infighting between grass-roots progressives and the party's more mainstream wing has plagued Democrats, who have appeared increasingly vulnerable to Republican attacks portraying them as coastal elites out of touch with working-class Americans. Ossoff's  Make Trump Furious  slogan quickly endeared him to national anti-Trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls in April's non-partisan primary in a district represented by Republicans for decades. It wasn't enough. The 30-year-old former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker fell just short of a majority, and outright victory, forcing a closely watched run-off against Handel for the House seat vacated by Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services who was first elected to the House in 2004.  Fundraising Machine But the grassroots enthusiasm has made Ossoff a fundraising machine. He raised a stunning $24 million by the end of May, five times the amount raised by Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state. Republican outside groups have helped her make up some of the difference, spending nearly $9 million on her behalf, according to fundraising reports. Total spending has approached $40 million, obliterating the previous record of $30 million for a Florida congressional race in 2012. FILE PHOTO - Georgia's Sixth District Congressional candidate Jon Ossoff speaks to his supports at his Election Night party in Sandy Springs, Georgia, U.S. on April 18, 2017.Marvin Gentry/File PhotoWhile he benefits from the grassroots anti-Trump fervor, Ossoff has deliberately avoided making the race a referendum on Trump. On the campaign trail and in ads, he promises to work with Republicans and focuses on his plans to bolster local economic development, protect access to healthcare, particularly for women, and cut wasteful spending to pay for new priorities. Ossoff said voters in the district are not demanding that he lead an anti-Trump resistance.  I think voters are more concerned with accountability and results than they are with political drama,  he said in an interview after a meeting with millennial supporters. While voters' concerns about the administration have grown, he said,  Fundamentally what folks are looking for is representation that will work across the aisle to deliver a higher quality of life.  Handel, who also rarely mentions Trump and has argued that the race should be about who has the values and experience to best serve the district, says Ossoff is misrepresenting himself. Slideshow (2 Images) He's trying to portray himself as something that he is not. He is Nancy Pelosi's hand-picked candidate,  Handel told reporters this week after greeting diners at a local hamburger restaurant, repeating a line about House Democratic leader Pelosi that has featured prominently in attack ads against Ossoff by outside groups.  He is an ultra-liberal. His values do not align with this district,  she said. Some of her supporters agree. Terry Anderson, 67, a retired IT worker from Cobb County, said he did not believe Ossoff was sincere.  He sounds more like a moderate Republican all the time,  he said. But Brenda Carswell, 61, a retired American Express employee from the city of Tucker who said she typically has switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats -  I've voted for some Bushes and I've voted for some Clintons  - said she is backing Ossoff.  He's been mostly discussing issues that people care about. The problems in our area are more important than most of what they talk about in Washington,  she said. Trump, who visited Georgia to raise money for Handel in late April, is watching closely. On Twitter, he criticized Ossoff, and after Ossoff was forced into a runoff he crowed that Democrats  failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia.  Trump called the race  Hollywood vs. Georgia.  Several recent polls have given Ossoff a slight edge heading into Tuesday, while showing that there are few voters who are still undecided. Democrats say the increasingly diverse area exemplifies the sort of educated and affluent suburban district that Democrats will need to win to recapture the House. Georgia-based Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson said Ossoff's non-ideological messaging should be a model for a party that needs moderates, independents and disaffected Republicans next year.  He's done a good job of positioning himself as a sensible Democrat,  he said.  He doesn't need to tell voters what is wrong with Trump - people see the drama and the problems every day.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed up 73.5 points, or 0.48 percent, at 15,266.04. It follows a 1.8 percent drop for the index last week. On Thursday, it touched its lowest intraday since Dec. 5 at 15,077.95.  I think we were long overdue for a rally and I think we are getting it here,  said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities. U.S. activist investor Jonathan Litt called for Hudson's Bay to consider going private and to monetize its vast real estate holdings, sending shares in the department store retailer up 15.1 percent to C$10.22. The overall consumer discretionary group climbed 1.5 percent, while the heavyweight financial services sector rose 0.8 percent, led by gains for the country's major banks. Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's biggest lender by assets and market value, advanced 0.8 percent to C$94.30. Investors have been encouraged by the Bank of Canada's greater confidence in the outlook for the country's economy, Kinsey said. The central bank's top two officials have said that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows. The bounce for the Toronto market came as a rebound in technology stocks helped push Wall Street to record highs. Canada's technology sector rose 2.4 percent, led by a 4.3 percent advance in the shares of Shopify Inc to C$119.90. Still, the nearly flat performance for the TSX this year compares poorly with a 9.6 percent gain for the S&P; 500. Recent weakening in commodity prices has weighed on Canada's market. U.S. crude oil futures settled 54 cents lower at $44.20 a barrel, while gold declined 0.8 percent following hawkish comments from a top Federal Reserve official. The energy group fell 0.5 percent and the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, gained just 0.1 percent. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc rose 5.9 percent to C$17.79 after hedge fund manager John Paulson joined the company's board. Shares of Bombardier advanced 4.9 percent to C$2.59. The company said it had received seven more orders for its Q400 aircraft from Philippine Airlines.

The Latin America packaged food industry is less exposed to weak economic cycles, which is reflected in less volatility in operating margins and good cash flow generation. Fitch expects higher economic activity in the region and issuers' average sales growth to reach the mid- to high single digits for 2017-2018,  said Rogelio Gonzalez, Director. The industry benefits from geographical diversification, and an associated reduction in business risks and volatility. Raw material pricing should remain stable, though local currency volatility versus the U.S. dollar could pressure profitability. Merger and acquisition activity is expected to be active on improved leverage. Small- to mid-size acquisitions in the short- to medium-term will dominate, and this should help to diversify their operations. Acquisitions will likely be directed toward overseas operations, given the established domestic market share and scale.

It's a resumption of this idea that the economy is in decent shape.

The Fed commentary last week had surprised investors who expected more caution after some weak U.S. economic data.  My sense is investors must be looking at this as a pro-growth belief that perhaps Dudley sees underlying strength in the economy that the data doesn’t show right now. The Fed’s base case is that this is just kind of a soft patch and we will continue to cycle higher,  said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

We're seeing more tankers used for storage and more crude from West Africa and Europe being offered into the U.S. Gulf Coast at the same time the Gulf Coast has been an exporter of light sweet crude,  said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  These are all signs of an oversupplied market.  Brent LCOc1 futures for August fell 46 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $46.91 a barrel, their lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first six months of 2017. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 futures for July dropped 54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $44.20 per barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 14. The July contract will expire on Tuesday, and August will become the front month. Both benchmarks are down more than 15 percent since late May, when producers led by OPEC extended by nine months their pledge to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). There were still almost 70,000 WTI contracts for July outstanding at the end of trade on Friday, which would require delivery of about 70 million barrels of oil to Cushing, Oklahoma after Tuesday's expiration.  Some of the pressure on Monday is because it is hard to get rid of that many (WTI) contracts in just two days,  said Phil Davis, managing partner at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey, noting  very few traders actually want to take physical delivery.  Traders noted the Brent front-month contract was at the highest premium since late May over the same WTI contract WTCLc1-LCOc1. OPEC supplies jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, two countries exempt from the production cut agreement. Libya's oil production has risen more than 50,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan source told Reuters. Analysts said rising U.S. crude production has fed the global glut. Data on Friday showed a record 22nd consecutive week of increases in U.S. oil rigs. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said if the U.S. rig count holds, fourth-quarter domestic oil production would rise substantially.  There are also signs of stalling demand growth in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region. Japan's customs-cleared crude imports fell 13.5 percent in May from a year earlier. India took in 4.2 percent less crude in May than the year before.

These are all signs of an oversupplied market.  Brent LCOc1 futures for August fell 46 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $46.91 a barrel, their lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first six months of 2017. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 futures for July dropped 54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $44.20 per barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 14. The July contract will expire on Tuesday, and August will become the front month. Both benchmarks are down more than 15 percent since late May, when producers led by OPEC extended by nine months their pledge to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). There were still almost 70,000 WTI contracts for July outstanding at the end of trade on Friday, which would require delivery of about 70 million barrels of oil to Cushing, Oklahoma after Tuesday's expiration.  Some of the pressure on Monday is because it is hard to get rid of that many (WTI) contracts in just two days,  said Phil Davis, managing partner at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey, noting  very few traders actually want to take physical delivery.  Traders noted the Brent front-month contract was at the highest premium since late May over the same WTI contract WTCLc1-LCOc1. OPEC supplies jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, two countries exempt from the production cut agreement. Libya's oil production has risen more than 50,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan source told Reuters. Analysts said rising U.S. crude production has fed the global glut. Data on Friday showed a record 22nd consecutive week of increases in U.S. oil rigs. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said if the U.S. rig count holds, fourth-quarter domestic oil production would rise substantially.  There are also signs of stalling demand growth in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region. Japan's customs-cleared crude imports fell 13.5 percent in May from a year earlier. India took in 4.2 percent less crude in May than the year before.

The police launched all possible measures to address the threat,  the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said in a statement on Monday. Helsinki police on Sunday sent several units to patrol near the Temppeliaukio church, which is a popular tourist location, saying it was trying to apprehend a suspect in the area.

The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) raised its threat level on Wednesday, saying it had become aware of more serious terrorism-related projects and plans in Finland.

Hogs on a continuous chart        rose to the highest levels since last June 23. Most-active Chicago Mercantile Exchange August lean hog futures        rose sharply for the second straight session, rebounding from Thursday's one-month low.      You're seeing some funds come in,  said Rosenthal Collins hog broker James Burns, adding that he was long the market.       The overall supply at this time period is not as great as people anticipated. (Animal) weights are down some and demand is up. It's that easily explainable,  Burns said.     Lower hog weights result in relatively tighter supplies and suggest that pig farmers were selling rather than holding back animals to fatten them further.     CME August hogs settled up 2.350 cents at 81.475 cents per pound. Front-month July hog futures        notched a contract high of 84.375 cents before finishing at 83.900, up 1.575 cents.     Hog prices have climbed in U.S. Midwest cash markets. Wholesale pork prices were the highest in more than a year on strong retailer demand for meat ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, when many consumers eat hot dogs and burgers cooked on outdoor grills.                       Cattle futures, meanwhile, extended losses on chart-based selling and investment fund liquidation. Cattle prices typically decline at this time of year, and lower-priced cattle trades last week in the U.S. Plains triggered selling in futures.     CME August live cattle futures        finished down 2.075 cents at 116.100 cents per pound, lowest since April 27.     CME August feeder cattle        eased 2.875 cents to 145.000 cents per pound, lowest since May 11.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said feeder cattle prices were down $1 to $4 per cwt at a closely watched cash auction in Oklahoma City.

Catastrophe, that is the only word for it,  said Fernando Antonio Serra Alves Bernardo, 59, who owns the Lido cafe in the town at the center of the disaster.  This was like a war zone.  Locals and experts alike talk of an unholy combination of extremely hot weather, an unusually dry year and ferocious winds that created a sort of hurricane of fire. Many of those who died burnt in their cars as they fled.  I believe in witches, I believe in anything now,  said one man who had briefly fled from his village over the weekend. The most intense fires broke out on Saturday, but huge blazes still raged on Monday. The blazes may not die out until cooler weather arrives, possibly by the end of the week. More than 1,000 firemen are still working to put out the flames.  It seems there was a lightning strike this time,  said Norwyn Cole, a Briton who owns a house in the area he evacuated for a few hours on Sunday night.  The magnitude of this is on a completely different scale to what I have seen before.  Hundreds of people have been evacuated to camps set up by the army in Pedrogao Grande. On the main approach into town are miles of burnt, smoldering forest. Every second car on the roads is an ambulance, a fire engine or a police car. Some locals blame the fires on the gradual replacement of pine and oak forests by highly combustible eucalyptus, which has been grown in this region by the paper and pulp industry. Others say the fires flared up so quickly because landowners hadn't obeyed the law and cleared their plots of undergrowth. The deaths, the most in memory caused by forest fires in Portugal, have also shown shortcomings in communication systems to evacuate people from villages.  It's still hard to identify what failed, but it's a bit of everything,  said Xavier Viegas, an expert on forest fires in Portugal.  Obviously, certain things that should have been done had not been done - especially in terms of communicating with the population, telling them about the danger levels, areas to be avoided.  Other countries prone to forest fires have systems in place to warn people of danger. Australia, for example, revised its warning system after fires killed 173 people in 2009, and now uses text messages and emergency broadcasts to warn people.  There's an urgent need to organize that kind of alerting,  Viegas said.  Here, at best, someone from the parish council would go knocking on doors telling people to leave.  Armindo Antonio, 67, was evacuated with his family on Sunday evening by civil protection workers who came to his village. He has no idea when he can go back and said he had received no information from authorities.  All of this is so difficult to understand,  said Antonio, whose five family members had been housed in a packed old-age home with other evacuees.  It could have been our village.  One thing everyone agrees on: Portugal's volunteer firemen corps are the heroes in the tragedy.  The human warmth and kindness we received these past days is the only thing that kept us going and gave us pride,  read a message from the firemen hanging in a local shop.

The U.N. Human Rights Council is likely to vote this week on whether to authorize such an investigation into violence that has killed hundreds in central Congo since last August, including two U.N. experts who were murdered earlier this year.   Carrying out an investigation that excludes the Congolese authorities would be unacceptable. It would be as if we were not an independent country,  Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba told reporters in Geneva.  U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein called on the Council to mandate an investigation after Congo missed a deadline to agree to investigate alleged massacres jointly.  That would be a pity, for the simple reason that if a resolution is voted for and doesn't take us into account, implementing it will be difficult,  Thambwe Mwamba said.  Do you want experts to go into a foreign country without reporting to the national authorities?  How will they get visas? How will they get access to the countryside? The best way would be to go towards a solution that is acceptable for everyone ... If you think you can do the investigation without us, go ahead.  He said it was baseless to suggest that Congo had not met a June 8 deadline set by Zeid, since it had presented its roadmap for investigating on May 24 in Kinshasa. Zeid has said the government’s response “falls short”.  Some legal proceedings had already begun, Thambwe Mwamba said, including the trial of people suspected of killing U.N. sanctions monitors Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, an American and a Swede who disappeared in March and whose bodies were found two weeks later in a shallow grave.  About a dozen suspects were identified from a video of the murders, and the four principal suspects have been arrested, Thambwe Mwamba said. The others are still being sought.  Last month a military prosecutor said two militia men had been arrested, and denied that Congolese forces were involved.  We have deployed the whole arsenal to establish responsibility – who committed the act, who ordered it, are there politicians at the provincial or national level who could have played any sort of role?,  Thambwe Mwamba said. The minister also said Congolese opposition leader Moise Katumbi, who has been abroad since he was accused of plotting against the state a year ago, was free to come back to Congo whenever he wants, although he would have to face justice. Thambwe Mwamba added that Katumbi could be barred from standing for election because Congo's constitution does not permit dual nationalities.  Thambwe Mwamba also commented on a lawsuit against him in Belgium, which accuses him of involvement in the downing of an airliner in 1998, with the loss of 40 lives.

Self-employed people or those working in trade or industry making 7,200 pounds a year or less would not be taxed on income. Public and private sector employees making up to 14,200 pounds would be exempt, up from 13,500 previously. Those in the income tax bracket making between 7,200 - 30,000 pounds a year and who would normally pay a 10 percent income tax will get an 80 percent tax break, meaning they pay 20 percent of taxes they would normally pay. The 30-45,000 pound bracket, which is taxed at 15 percent, will get a 40 percent tax break. The 45-200,000 pound a year bracket, taxed at 20 percent, will get a 5 percent tax break. Egyptians making more than 200,000 pounds a year who get taxed at 22.5 percent will pay their full income tax. The measures must be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a formality, before they take effect. Around 15 million families will benefit from the measures, which the government hopes will alleviate some of the effects of recent austerity. Egypt's economy has been struggling since a 2011 uprising drove foreign investors and tourists away, but the government hopes a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program signed last year will put it on the road to recovery. The central bank floated the pound currency last November, as part of economic reforms agreed with the IMF which also included fuel subsidy cuts. The pound's value has halved since then and inflation is at record highs. The government approved a social security package worth 43 billion pounds for the 2017-18 fiscal year beginning in July, including a 15 percent rise for pensioners and a 14-20 percent rise in salaries, Finance Minister Amr El Garhy said last month.

The tunnel is about 12 meters (39 ft) long and we suspect it took more than a week to build,  the head of Kerobokan prison Tony Nainggolan said, adding that police believed the men were still in Bali and not far from the prison. The four are Australian Shaun Edward Davidson, Bulgarian Dimitar Nikolov Iliev, Indian Sayed Muhammad Said and Malaysian Tee Kok King, Bali police spokesman Hengky Widjaja said. The tunnel had a diameter of 50 x 75 cm (20 x 30 inches) and was found filled with water on Monday morning, Widjaja said. Kerobokan houses a fairly large number of foreign inmates, given Bali's status as an international holiday destination and transport hub.  People look into a hole through which four foreign inmates escaped from Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, June 19, 2017. Antara Foto/Nyoman Budhiana via REUTERSThe four men were serving sentences for different crimes, from immigration rules violation to drug crimes, Widjaja said. The remaining jail time for 33-year-old Australian Davidson, who was sentenced to a year in prison for breaking immigration laws, was 2 months and 15 days, while 31-year-old Indian Said had 12 years and 3 months to serve for drug offences.

NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN INDONESIA.The head of the prison said that 10 guards were on duty on Sunday night when the escape is believed to have taken place. Indonesian prisons are frequently overcrowded and a war on drugs being led by the government of President Joko Widodo has triggered a spike in the number of convicted drug offenders, stretching an already overwhelmed jail system. The capacity of Kerobakan is 323 inmates, but it currently houses more than four times that number at 1,378, according to government data. Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia and authorities launched an investigation last month after around 350 inmates broke out of an overcrowded jail on Sumatra island in Riau Province.

Lawyers for Shkreli, who drew public outrage after raising the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent when he was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015, said in a court filing last week that he needed the $3 million to pay back taxes and his lawyers and accountants. Federal prosecutors have not agreed to the request. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto did not rule on Shkreli's request at a hearing on Monday, but said she would be  reluctant  to release the money without knowing more about what assets Shkreli had and what he had done to liquidate them. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges involving his management of his previous company Retrophin Inc and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management from 2009 to 2014. Prosecutors claim that he engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which he defrauded investors in MSMB and took millions in assets from Retrophin to repay them. A trial is set to begin next Monday and last at least four weeks.

We've laid solid foundations for future discussions and an ambitious but achievable timetable,  said David Davis, Britain's Brexit minister, adding he was  encouraged  by the first talks. But the European Union's Michel Barnier made clear little was agreed but an initial calendar and a structure for negotiations. The talks began almost a year to the day after Britain shocked Europe by voting to cut loose from the 28-nation EU, its biggest market. They also come three months after Prime Minister Theresa May locked Britain into a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2019. Perhaps more important, they begin just 10 days after a humbling election setback revived divisions within May's government on what kind of relationship it wants with the EU.  Davis brushed off a suggestion that a weakened Conservative government had dropped objections to a Brussels timetable, which would deal first with EU priorities, including its demand Britain settle a  Brexit bill , and leave the talks on free trade that May wants until at least late this year. Related CoverageMood on first day of Brexit talks was 'incredibly positive': UK sourceBritain, EU to discuss Brexit issues in July, September and OctoberEU negotiator says sides agree Brexit must be orderlyDavis insisted that talks about trade would occur  in parallel , but Barnier said they would start only in a second phase. First,  significant progress  would need to be made on the EU's priority issues, notably the rights of expatriate citizens and a settling financial accounts. An EU official said Britain still refused to accept it would owe Brussels anything. EU officials believe, however, that May and her ministers are coming round to accepting Brussels' rules. For one thing, renewed debate in her cabinet on how far to go with her clean break from the single market and customs union has made it hard to present a coherent set of demands in Brussels. Uncertainty over the future trading relationship also means that special status in the talks has been given to discussions on how to limit the impact on peace in Northern Ireland from the creation of a new EU-UK border with the Irish Republic. The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier (R) welcomes Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis at the European Commission ahead of their first day of talks in Brussels, June 19, 2017.Francois LenoirIreland - a Special Case Three negotiating groups will address agreed priorities on citizens' rights, finances and other technical matters which must be resolved to avoid a messy limbo after Brexit. The Irish issue, long described as a priority for both, will be treated somewhat differently; avoiding a  hard border  will necessarily have to take account of how the rest of EU-UK trade will work. Though less visibly upbeat than veteran Brexit campaigner Davis, Barnier insisted the two sides would work together for a  fair deal  that would not  punish  Britain. But he also refused to discuss concessions to Britons who, in the eyes of most EU leaders, are committing an act of self-harm. Slideshow (17 Images) It is the United Kingdom that's leaving the European Union, not the other way around,  Barnier said sharply, speaking of  unraveling  44 years of relations.  Everyone must accept their responsibilities, the consequences of their decisions ... So my mind is not on making concessions or asking for concessions.  May herself will be in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for a regular summit with fellow EU leaders. Davis said she will tell them about plans to guarantee rights for some 3 million EU citizens in Britain under a proposal to be made next week. As with Monday's seven hours of meetings between Barnier, Davis and their teams, her emphasis is expected to be on easing tensions that have seen some spiky exchanges in recent months. Davis and Barnier, who chatted in English over lunch but used interpreters for some of their more serious talks, made use of their shared love of hill-walking to lighten the mood.  They exchanged gifts -- a walking stick from Barnier's native Alps for Davis, a French mountaineer's memoir in a valuable first edition from the Briton to the Frenchman. And at a final news conference they traded quotes from their respective nations' history: Barnier cited EU founding father Jean Monnet to say:  I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic. I am determined.  Davis channeled Winston Churchill:  The pessimist see difficulty in every opportunity, the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty. And so bridging between Churchill and Monnet, I am certainly a determined optimist.

Lead guitarist Gary Rossington, Ronnie's brother and current lead singer Johnny Van Zant, and others contend that  Street Survivors: The True Story of the Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash,  based on recollections of former drummer Artimus Pyle, violated a 1988 consent order governing the use of the band's name. The lawsuit against Pyle and co-defendant Cleopatra Records Inc was made public on Friday in the U.S. district court in Manhattan. A trial is scheduled for July 11, court records show. Pyle could not immediately be reached for comment. It is unclear whether he has a lawyer. Brian Perera, Cleopatra's president, said in an interview he would be willing to settle, but added,  I understood my First Amendment rights. Filmmakers can make biopics.  Known for such songs as  Sweet Home Alabama  and  Free Bird,  Lynyrd Skynyrd went on hiatus after its touring plane crashed in Mississippi on Oct. 20, 1977, killing Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steven Gaines and four others. Twenty people, including Pyle, survived. In 1987, surviving band members reunited for a  tribute tour,  prompting litigation that led to the consent order. The plaintiffs, who include representatives of the estates of Ronnie Van Zant, Gaines and late guitarist Allen Collins, said they had issued a cease-and-desist letter last summer to halt the defendants' plan for a movie titled  Free Bird.  They said that while Pyle, who left the band in 1991,  is free to exploit his own personal life story,  the retitled movie would destroy their right to use the name and history of Lynyrd Skynyrd, causing  incalculable  loss and irreparable harm. Such a movie  may contain a potentially inaccurate or skewed portrayal of Lynyrd Skynyrd's story as filtered solely through the eyes of Pyle masquerading as the 'True Story' of a defining moment in the band's history,  the plaintiffs said.  Street Survivors  is now being edited, and could be ready for theaters in 2018, Perera said. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, who oversaw the 1988 consent order. The case is Ronnie Van Zant Inc et al v.

Self-employed people or those working in trade or industry making 7,200 pounds a year or less would not be taxed on income. Public and private sector employees making up to 14,200 pounds would be exempt, up from 13,500 previously. Those in the income tax bracket making between 7,200 - 30,000 pounds a year and who would normally pay a 10 percent income tax will get an 80 percent tax break, meaning they pay 20 percent of taxes they would normally pay. The 30-45,000 pound bracket, which is taxed at 15 percent, will get a 40 percent tax break. The 45-200,000 pound a year bracket, taxed at 20 percent, will get a 5 percent tax break. Egyptians making more than 200,000 pounds a year who get taxed at 22.5 percent will pay their full income tax. The measures must be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a formality, before they take effect. Around 15 million families will benefit from the measures, which the government hopes will alleviate some of the effects of recent austerity. Egypt's economy has been struggling since a 2011 uprising drove foreign investors and tourists away, but the government hopes a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program signed last year will put it on the road to recovery. The central bank floated the pound currency last November, as part of economic reforms agreed with the IMF which also included fuel subsidy cuts. The pound's value has halved since then and inflation is at record highs. The government approved a social security package worth 43 billion pounds for the 2017-18 fiscal year beginning in July, including a 15 percent rise for pensioners and a 14-20 percent rise in salaries, Finance Minister Amr El Garhy said last month.

Budget Constraints Macron wants to move quickly on relaxing labor regulations before overhauling France's unwieldy pension system next year.  During the presidential campaign he also promised to cut corporate tax to 25 percent from 33 percent and make a 50 billion public investment in energy, vocational training and transport infrastructure. But he will need to be mindful of a budget deficit that the Bank of France forecasts will once again breach the EU cap of 3 percent of national income this year.  It is in France's interests, its political credibility, its economic credibility, to conform with its obligations,  Pierre Moscovici, the EU's French commissioner for economic and financial affairs told TV channel Public Senat.        Sunday's high abstention rate means Macron will also have to tread carefully with reforms in a country with muscular trade unions and a history of street protests that have forced many a government to dilute new legislation.  But with his wins in last month's presidential election and Sunday's parliament vote, he has routed the old political class. France's youngest leader since Napoleon and having never before held elected office, Macron has seized on the growing resentment towards a political elite perceived as out of touch, and on public frustration at its failure to create jobs and spur stronger growth. In winning the presidency in May, he filled a political vacuum created by disarray within the Socialist Party and the Republicans, with Sunday night capping a sequence of events that looked improbable a year ago. The Republicans and their conservative allies will form the largest opposition bloc in parliament with 131 seats, while the far-right National Front won eight.

Tensions escalated on Sunday as the U.S. military brought down the jet near Raqqa for bombing near U.S.-allied forces on the ground, and Iran launched missiles at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria - the first time each state has carried out such actions in the multi-sided Syrian war. While aimed at Islamic State, the Iranian strike was also a projection of military power into part of Syria identified as a top priority by Damascus and its allies, and followed a recent tussle with Washington over a section of the Syria-Iraq border. A pro-Damascus commander said it was  a message  to all sides in the war that could be repeated, commenting that both Tehran and Washington had set  red lines  in the last day. Russia, like Iran an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, issued a warning of its own to the United States in response to the downing of the Syrian jet, saying on Monday it would view as targets any planes flying west of the Euphrates River, though it stopped short of saying it would shoot any down. The tensions reflect mounting competition for areas of Syria where Islamic State (IS) insurgents are in retreat, leaving swathes of territory up for grabs and posing the question of what comes next for U.S. policy that is shaped first and foremost by the priority of vanquishing the jihadists. The United States said the Syrian army plane shot down on Sunday had dropped bombs near fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters battling to capture the city of Raqqa from IS. Russia's Defence Ministry responded on Monday by suspending cooperation with the United States aimed at avoiding air incidents over Syria, where the Russian air force is bombing in support of Assad's campaigns against rebels and IS. The Syrian army said the jet was shot down while flying a mission against Islamic State. The SDF however accused the Syrian government on Monday of attacking its positions using planes, artillery and tanks.  If the regime continues attacking our positions in Raqqa province, we will be forced to retaliate,  SDF spokesman Talal Silo said. The Syrian government this month marched into Raqqa province from the west but had avoided conflict with the U.S.-backed SDF until the latest incident.  The SDF is getting big-headed,  said the pro-Damascus military commander, a non-Syrian who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.  There could be problems between it and Soheil Hassan,  said the commander, referring to the Syrian officer leading the government offensive in Raqqa province. Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said the sides were establishing red lines in a fluid situation, and the Syrian government was  always testing and pushing the boundaries .  I don't think the Americans are testing the red lines. They are saying 'we have a red line here and if you are going to test it we will respond, but it doesn't mean we are now shifting strategy' because they also want to reassure the Russians.  Iran Sends  Clear Message  The United States has said its recent actions against Syrian government forces and allied militia have been self-defensive in nature, aimed at stopping attacks on U.S.-led coalition forces or their local allies. These have included several air strikes against pro-government forces that have sought to advance towards a U.S. base in southeastern Syria near the border with Iraq, where the U.S. military has been training Syrian rebels to fight IS. The area is of strategic significance to Tehran as it seeks to secure a land corridor to its allies in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and establish a  Shi'ite crescent  of influence that has long concerned U.S.-allied states in the Middle East. The missiles fired by Iran's Revolutionary Guards on Sunday targeted IS in Deir al-Zor province, fast becoming the jihadists' last remaining foothold in Syria and a declared military priority of Tehran's allies in the Syrian government. The attacks have showcased the depth of Iran's military presence in Syria: Iranian drones launched from areas around Damascus allowed Revolutionary Guard commanders to assess the damage done by the missiles in real-time. Two top Revolutionary Guard commanders said that the strikes were intended to send a message to the perpetrators of militant attacks in Tehran last week - claimed by Islamic State - that killed 18 people, as well as their supporters.  I hope that the clear message of this attack will be understood by the terrorists as well as their regional and international supporters,  said Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace unit, according to the website of Iranian state television. Six missiles with a range of between 650 to 700 kilometres (400-435 miles) were fired from western Iran, soaring over Iraqi territory and striking the targets in Deir al-Zor. State TV posted black and white aerial video on their website on Monday which they labelled as the moment of impact of the attack. A projectile can be seen hitting a building followed by thick black smoke billowing out. State TV repeatedly aired video footage of the beginning of the attack Monday, showing several missiles streaking across a dark night sky. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif defended the attack in a Twitter post on Monday.  Iran's missile capability protects its citizens in lawful self-defense & advances common global fight to eradicate (IS) & extremist terror,  he wrote. Other Iranian officials were more blunt in their assessment of the attack.  This attack, before being a message for the terrorists, is a message for the supporters of terrorism in the region which are symbolized by the Saudi regime and the Americans,  the state television website quoted Iranian parliamentarian Javad Karimi Qoddousi as saying.

Fire broke out in the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, a social housing block in Kensington, west London, in the early hours of Wednesday, trapping residents inside as it tore through the building with terrifying speed.  I believe there are 79 people that are either dead, or missing, and sadly I have to presume are dead,  Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy told reporters. He said that five of the dead had been formally identified and it would be a slow and painstaking task to identify the others. Because of the intensity of the blaze some may never be identified. A minute's silence was held across Britain at 1000 GMT to honor the victims of the fire - a painfully familiar ritual after the country has been hit by three deadly attacks by Islamist extremists in London and Manchester since March. At an improvised memorial wall covered in messages of grief and solidarity close to Grenfell Tower, firefighters and members of the local community stood together, some crying, as they observed the minute's silence. One firefighter, in his black protective suit with FIRE emblazoned in yellow on the back, embraced a distraught woman who had photos of a missing person printed on her top. A red t-shirt with the London Fire Brigade's logo had been placed by the memorial wall, with the name of a nearby fire station and the words  We tried, we're sorry  scrawled on it. Briefing reporters at police headquarters, Cundy became visibly upset as he described conditions in the charred tower, where a search and recovery operation is expected to last weeks.  I was in there myself and went all the way to the top floor and it is incredibly hard,  he said, before pausing as tears welled up in his eyes.  It is incredibly hard to describe the devastation in some parts of the building,  he continued, his voice breaking.  Not Good Enough  The fire has come at a particularly difficult time for Prime Minister Theresa May, who was weakened by the loss of her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election and faces arduous talks on Britain's exit from the European Union. Emergency services have been widely praised for their response to the fire, but the local community has accused the government of a slow and inadequate reaction. May has come under personal attack for failing to meet residents during her first visit to the site. People attend a minute's silence for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire near the site of the blaze in North Kensington, London, Britain, June 19, 2017.Marko DjuricaAt a daily briefing with reporters, May's spokeswoman said that on a second visit to the area, during which the prime minister was booed and heckled, May had listened carefully to the experiences of those on the ground.  That's why she totally accepted that it (the government response) hadn't been good enough. She understood that immediate action needed to be taken to speed things up, and that's what she's done,  the spokeswoman said. She said the terms of reference of a public inquiry into the blaze were being drafted and the government had now contacted all local authorities in England, asking them to identify any safety concerns in light of the tragedy. May's spokeswoman said later on Monday that staff from five government departments are now working on the ground, including officials from the Foreign Office. A pledge that survivors would be re-housed locally would be met within three weeks, she said, adding that reports of people being offered homes hundreds of miles away were false.  However, May did not support a proposal put forward by Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, to seize unoccupied properties to re-house survivors of the fire, the spokeswoman said. Slideshow (11 Images) Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it – there’s a lot of things you can do,  Corbyn said on Sunday during an interview on ITV.  Why This Happened  Grenfell Tower is located in a pocket of social deprivation within the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one of Britain's wealthiest areas. The fire has led to national soul-searching about inequalities and neglect of the poor. Cundy said a criminal investigation into the tower blaze would be exhaustive and that 250 investigators were looking at all criminal offences that may have been committed.  Whilst it will look at the how, perhaps more importantly, it will also look at why this happened,  Cundy said.  The investigation will include areas such as the construction, renovation and maintenance of the building and fire safety procedures, he said. Cundy said that five people reported as missing in the fire had now been found and were safe and well. He said the death toll of 79 could still change if anyone reported as missing was found alive, or if anyone was found in the ruined tower who had not been reported as missing.  Whilst I've said I think there may be changes, I don't think those changes will be as significant as the changes we've seen over the last few days,  he said. The death toll was first given as 12 before being revised up to 17, then 30, then 58.

The Defense Ministry said on Friday that Rio de Janeiro-based Condor Tecnologias Não-Letais had not shipped tear gas canisters to Venezuela's armed forces as negotiated in April, without giving a reason. Condor confirmed on Friday that it had two active contracts in Venezuela, but declined to comment on specific shipments. The company and ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. The involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Relations underscores the role of diplomacy in the decision, as Brazil's armed forces usually take responsibility for licensing the export of  controlled products  such as the stun grenades, rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas made by Condor. The entrance of Condor Tecnologias Nao-Letais (non-lethal technology) factory is pictured in Nova Iguacu near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, June 19, 2017.Ricardo Moraes The (Brazilian) government decided to accept the opposition's request because there's a massacre in Venezuela,  said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak freely. The other source, a senior government official, said export of other crowd control equipment would also be denied. Anti-government protests in Venezuela have drawn huge crowds over the past two months decrying food shortages, denouncing Maduro and demanding general elections. At least 72 people have died, with victims including government and opposition supporters, bystanders and security forces.  Maduro accuses his foes of a violent, right-wing  fascist  conspiracy seeking a coup similar to the brief 2002 toppling of his predecessor Hugo Chavez. Venezuela opposition leader Henrique Capriles hailed the blocked Brazilian tear gas as evidence that few countries are willing to provide Maduro with riot gear to control the demonstrations.  (Brazil) did absolutely the correct thing in denying permission for the shipment,  Capriles told Reuters.  We're working on the others ... The only (holdout) seems to be China.  Condor has drawn attention to Brazil's export policies in recent years after its products were used to suppress protests in countries from Turkey to Bahrein. The company said on Friday it did not make political judgments about its clients and warned that blocking its exports  could have dramatic consequences, since there may be no alternative for security forces other than using firearms.

Blue Apron's up to $510 million IPO will test whether the growth seen by the meal-kit industry's greatest players will continue to whet investor appetite, even as costs to acquire new customers mount and possible new competitors with established distribution systems appear.  Amazon, which said on Friday it would buy Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion deal, has dallied with both food delivery, through AmazonFresh, and meal kits, which deliver fresh ingredients and recipes to subscribers. Though its AmazonFresh program is more advanced than its meal kits programs, both are still limited to certain metropolitan areas.  It's going to take some time to figure out the impact of the acquisition on food delivery, and there are a lot more available ways to raise money when you're public than when you're private,  said Kathleen Smith, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds at Renaissance Capital. New York-based Blue Apron, named after the uniform that apprentice chefs wear in France, delivers pre-packaged ingredients and recipes to subscribers' doorsteps for them to prepare meals at home. It is the largest U.S. meal kit delivery service.  The IPO price range it issued on Wednesday implies a valuation of up to $3.2 billion. This equates to roughly three times the company's sales, and while Blue Apron has no publicly listed peer, some analysts pointed out that was higher than home good company Wayfair Inc's 1.8 times sales multiple.   Both Wayfair and Blue Apron are quickly growing, unprofitable e-commerce companies considered to be the leader in their respective niches.  Such a comparatively rich valuation indicates that Blue Apron, which was founded five years ago by Matt Salzberg, Ilia Papas and Matt Wadiak, believes its rapid growth will be sufficient to entice investors, despite having never turned a profit.  Blue Apron posted a net loss of $54.9 million last year, even as revenue more than doubled to $795.4 million, as it poured money into logistics and marketing. It was valued at as much as $2 billion in a June 2015 private fundraising round.  The timing of the Blue Apron IPO was not affected by the Whole Foods deal, a source close the company said. Noodles are held in an undated photo illustration provided by New York-based meal kit delivery service Blue Apron. Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSBlue Apron said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it was looking to sell 30 million Class A shares at between $15 to $17 per share, raising as much as $510 million.  Distribution Challenges    The meal-kit industry, which includes HelloFresh in Europe and Chefs Plate in Canada, is attempting to win consumers over  from supermarkets by delivering fresh ingredients directly to subscribers without a middle man. Vegetables are seen in an undated photo illustration provided by New York-based meal kit delivery service Blue Apron. Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSThe industry is also becoming more competitive, as companies have struggled to balance marketing costs with attractive prices. Food-delivery startup Maple announced it was shutting down earlier this year about a year after SpoonRocket made a similar announcement. Amazon first experimented with AmazonFresh in 2007, though has struggled with the same challenge facing all food delivery services: having a wide and cost-efficient distribution network for fresh food. With Amazon gaining access to Whole Foods' roughly 400-store footprint, the e-commerce juggernaut would command a distribution network dwarfing that of any meal-kit service. Its automated warehouses rely on robots to manage everything from inventory tracking and replacement, making it a formidable player as it cuts cost.  Blue Apron has fulfillment centers in Richmond, California, Jersey City, New Jersey, and Arlington, Texas and has also worked to increased its automation. Reuters reported in March that Blue Apron competitor, Sun Basket, which focuses on organic ingredients, has hired banks for an IPO that could come in the second half of the year. Bessemer Venture Partners, Stripes Group and Fidelity are among Blue Apron's investors. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays are among the underwriters to its IPO.

Andrew Weissmann, who headed the U.S. Justice Department's criminal fraud section before joining Mueller's team last month, is best known for two assignments - the investigation of now-defunct energy company Enron and organized crime cases in Brooklyn, New York - that depended heavily on gaining witness cooperation. Securing the cooperation of people close to Trump, many of whom have been retaining their own lawyers, could be important for Mueller, who was named by the Justice Department as special counsel on May 17 and is investigating, among other issues, whether Trump himself has sought to obstruct justice. Trump has denied allegations of both collusion and obstruction.   Flipping  witnesses is a common, although not always successful, tactic in criminal prosecutions. Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel examining former President Bill Clinton, noted that Trump's fired former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has already offered through his lawyer to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity, suggesting potential willingness to cooperate as a witness.  It would seem to me the time is now to make some decisions about what you have and what leverage can be applied to get the things you don't have,  Ray said, referring to Mueller's team. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and others close to the president already have hired their own lawyers to help navigate Mueller's expanding probe and ongoing congressional investigations. Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, said Weissmann is willing to take risks to secure witness testimony that other prosecutors might not. Ruemmler worked with Weissmann on the Justice Department's Enron task force that investigated the massive corporate fraud that led to the company's 2001 collapse.  Ruemmler recalled that Weissmann had a hunch that former Enron treasurer Ben Glisan would be willing to talk despite already having pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate. So Weissmann had U.S. marshals bring Glisan before the grand jury from prison, Ruemmler said.  'Not Afraid to Lose' FILE PHOTO: Federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann speaks to the press outside the federal courthouse in Houston, Texas, May 1, 2003.Jeff Mitchell/File photoOther prosecutors might have feared Glisan's testimony could contradict their theory of the case, Ruemmler said, but Weissmann's gamble paid off when the former executive became a key witness.  He's not afraid to lose, and that is sometimes an unusual quality,  Ruemmler said of Weissmann. Weissmann also led lengthy negotiations with lawyers for Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer and a star prosecution witness in the case, gaining leverage from the fact that prosecutors had indicted Fastow's wife, also a former Enron employee, on tax fraud charges. Both pleaded guilty, and Fastow testified against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was convicted in 2006. FILE PHOTO: Lawyer John Dowd exits Manhattan Federal Court in New York May 11, 2011.Brendan McDermid/File photoFastow declined to comment. Glisan could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Mueller and the Trump legal team declined to comment. Critics have said say Weissmann's hardball approach can lead to prosecutorial overreach. A number of Enron convictions were overturned on appeal, and Skilling's 24-year sentence was later reduced by 10 years. Defense lawyer Tom Kirkendall, who represented clients related to the Enron case, said the task force intimidated witnesses and misinterpreted the law. But Sam Buell, a former prosecutor who was a member of the Enron task force, called such criticism routine in high-stakes cases. Mueller has several other highly experienced lawyers on his team, including U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. Trump has also been building a legal team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, with veteran Washington defense lawyer John Dowd recently coming aboard. Before his work relating to Enron, Weissmann served as a federal prosecutor in the organized crime bureau in Brooklyn. In 1997, he and trial partner George Stamboulidis brought down one of the country's most powerful mob bosses, Vincent  the Chin  Gigante, with the help of turncoat witnesses.  We cut our teeth in the organized crime section,  said Stamboulidis, now in private practice.  And the only way you can make those cases is to get people to cooperate, even when the oath of Omerta (a Mafia code of silence and non-cooperation with authorities) was strong and in full play.

The vehicle swerved into a group of mainly North and West African people shortly after midnight as they left prayers at the Muslim Welfare House and the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, one of the biggest in Britain.  The driver, a 47-year-old white man, was grabbed at the scene by locals and pinned down until police arrived.  The man was not named by police but local media reported he was a father of four who lived in Wales. He was held on suspicion of attempted murder which was later extended to preparing or instigating terrorism, including murder and attempted murder. After being seized, he said he had wanted to kill  many Muslim people , one witness told journalists. A man, who had earlier suffered a heart attack, died at the scene but it was not clear if his death was connected to the van attack.   This morning, our country woke to news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city: the second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come before,  May told reporters outside her Downing Street office.  This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship,  said May who later visited the mosque. The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was receiving regular updates on the attack.  We've made it very clear to our British allies that we stand ready to provide any support and assistance that they may need,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a briefing.  The attack was the fourth since March in Britain and the third to involve a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians. It came at a tumultuous time for the government with Britain starting complex divorce talks with the European Union and May negotiating with a small Northern Irish party to stay in power after losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election that backfired. Driver Detained Related CoverageImam stops angry Muslims assailing London van suspectThe mosques' worshippers had just left special prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  Usain Ali, 28, said he heard a bang and ran for his life.  When I looked back, I thought it was a car accident, but people were shouting, screaming and I realized this was a man choosing to terrorize people who are praying,  he told Reuters.  He chose exactly the time that people pray, and the mosque is too small and full, so some pray outside.   Another witness Yann Bouhllissa, 38, said he had been tending an old man who had suffered a heart attack when the van was driven at them. The driver was then seized by locals.  One guy caught the guy and brought him down,  Bouhllissa told Reuters.  When he was on the floor, the guy asked 'why do you do that?'. He said 'Because I want to kill many Muslim people'.  Mohammed Mahmoud, the imam from the Muslim Welfare House,  stepped in to ensure the van driver was not hurt until he was bundled into a police van. A message on a wall is seen near to where a van was driven at Muslims in Finsbury Park, North London, Britain, June 19, 2017.Marko Djurica We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him ... and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches. By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm,  Mahmoud told reporters.   We stopped all forms of attack and abuse towards him that were coming from every angle.  Neil Basu, senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said restraint shown by locals was  commendable .  In addition to the man who died, 11 people were injured, with nine taken to hospital, two in a very serious condition, police said.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said the man was  not known to the authorities in the space of extremism or far-right extremism . Police, who believe he was acting alone, were searching addresses in Cardiff, Wales, where the vehicle hire company that the van was rented from is based.  Slideshow (28 Images)Attacks in London, Manchester The latest incident took place just over two weeks after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight.. A suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester, northern England, in May also killed 22 people, while in March, a man drove a rented car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London and stabbed a policeman to death before being shot dead. Five people were killed in that attack. Five other terrorism plots have been foiled since March, police say. May, weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, has faced criticism for her record on security after the previous series of attacks blamed on Islamist militants. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called on her to reverse planned police spending cuts. She has also been criticized for her response to a fire in a London tower block last Wednesday which killed at least 79 people.  Today’s attack falls at a difficult time in the life of this city, following on from the attack on London Bridge two weeks ago – and of course the unimaginable tragedy of Grenfell Tower last week,  May said. She promised action to stamp out all forms of hatred, saying there had been far too much tolerance of extremism in Britain over many years. Police have said hate crimes rose after the London Bridge attack and more officers would be deployed to provide reassurance to mosques.    The Muslim Council of Britain said Monday's attack on mosque worshippers was the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia in Britain in recent months and called for extra security at places of worship. Finsbury Park Mosque said it was a  callous terrorist attack  and noted it had occurred almost exactly a year after a man obsessed with Nazis and extreme right-wing ideology murdered lawmaker Jo Cox, a former humanitarian aid worker. The mosque itself gained notoriety more than a decade ago for sermons by radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison in January 2015 after being convicted of terrorism-related charges. However, a new board of trustees and management took over in February 2005, a year after Abu Hamza was arrested by British police. Attendance has greatly increased since then among worshippers from various communities, according to the mosque's website.

The autopsy report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner could not ascertain what effect the cocaine and other drugs may have had on her system. Coroner's officials ruled on Friday that the death of the  Star Wars  actress was due to sleep apnea and other causes. Fisher died at age 60 on Dec. 27, four days after she went into cardiac arrest on a flight from London to Los Angeles.  She had a long history of cocaine addiction in the 1980s and she also suffered from bipolar disorder. Although Fisher had spoken openly about her battle with addiction, it was not known that she had ongoing issues with drugs. Fisher had likely taken the cocaine some 72 hours before she was admitted to the hospital in Los Angeles, according to Monday's autopsy and toxicology report. FILE PHOTO: Carrie Fisher poses for cameras as she arrives at the European Premiere of  Star Wars, The Force Awakens  in Leicester Square, London, December 16, 2015.Paul Hackett/File Photo The significance of the cocaine (regarding the cause of death) cannot be established at this time,  the report said.  We cannot establish the significance of the multiple substances  that were detected in Ms. Fisher's blood and tissue with regard to the cause of death.  The officials said they could not pinpoint the time of exposure to the small amount of heroin found in Fisher's system, along with the MDMA and other opiates. But they said the drugs can suppress breathing and respiration and that Fisher had a history of sleep apnea. After undergoing treatment in the mid-1980s for cocaine addiction, Fisher wrote the bestselling novel  Postcards from the Edge,  about a drug-abusing actress forced to move in with her mother. The book was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. She reprised her star-making role as Princess Leia in the  2015 film  Star Wars: The Force Awakens,  when her character  become an astute military general. Her daughter, Billie Lourd, said in a statement to People magazine on Friday that her mother  battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases.  Lourd said she thought Fisher would  want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles. Seek help, fight for government funding for mental health programs.

The high court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination, as it did on May 22 when it found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. But the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another. The justices will take up Wisconsin's appeal of a lower court ruling last November that state Republican lawmakers violated the Constitution when they created state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling Democrats in legislative races. The case will be one of the biggest heard by the Supreme Court during its term that begins in October. The case involves a long-standing practice known as gerrymandering, a term meaning manipulating electoral boundaries for an unfair political advantage. The lower court ruled that the Republican-led legislature's redrawing of state legislative districts in 2011 amounted to  an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  A panel of three federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the way the Republicans redrew the districts violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by undercutting the ability of Democratic voters to turn their votes into seats in Wisconsin's legislature. In a possible sign of deep ideological divisions among the nine justices over the issue, the court's conservative majority granted Wisconsin's request, despite opposition from the four liberal justices, to put on hold the lower court's order requiring the state to redraw its electoral maps by Nov. 1. That means Wisconsin will not need to put in place a new electoral map while the justices consider the matter. A Supreme Court ruling faulting the Wisconsin redistricting plan could have far-reaching consequences for the redrawing of electoral districts due after the 2020 U.S. census. State and federal legislative district boundaries are reconfigured every decade after the census so that each one holds about same number of people, but are sometimes draw in a way that packs voters who tend to favor a particular party into certain districts so as to diminish their statewide voting power. Wisconsin Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel welcomed the justices' decision to hear the state's appeal and called the state's redistricting process  entirely lawful and constitutional.  The case in the short term could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about 10 states, before having major implications for the post-2020 redistricting, according to the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. 'Politics Going Haywire'  Wisconsin's gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade, locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for Republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state,  said Brennan Center redistricting expert Thomas Wolf.  It's a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court's liberals in major cases, could cast the decisive vote. Kennedy, writing in a 2004 case, indicated he may be open to the idea that racial gerrymanders could violate the Constitution. Though a  workable standard  defining it did not exist, he suggested one might emerge in a future case. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking improper actions at the state level to suppress the turnout of minority voters and others who tend to support Democrats and maximize the number of party members in state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans call their actions lawful. Republicans control the U.S. Congress. They also have majorities in an all-time high of 69 of 99 state legislative chambers, according to the Republican State Leadership Committee. After winning control of the state legislature in 2010, Wisconsin Republicans redrew the statewide electoral map. They were able to amplify Republican voting power, gaining more seats than their percentage of the statewide vote would suggest. In 2012, Republicans received about 49 percent of the vote but won 60 of the 99 state Assembly seats. In 2014, the party garnered 52 percent of the vote and 63 Assembly seats. A dozen Wisconsin Democratic Party voters in 2015 sued state election officials, saying the redistricting divided Democratic voters in some areas and packed them in others to dilute their electoral clout and benefit Republican candidates. The lower court found that redistricting efforts are unlawful partisan gerrymandering when they seek to entrench the party in power, and have no other legitimate justification. The state argues recent election results favoring Republicans were  a reflection of Wisconsin's natural political geography,  with Democrats concentrated in urban areas like Milwaukee and Madison.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-election-idUSL1N1JG0HN"},

Trump,George W. Bush,James Ziglar,John Ashcroft,Rachel Meeropol,Robert Mueller,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Stephen Breyer,USA,COURT/DETAINEES (UPDATE 3,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to former President George W. Bush's attorney general, FBI chief and other officials, ruling they cannot be sued over the treatment of detainees, mainly Muslims, rounded up in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The justices, in a 4-2 decision, reversed a lower court's decision that said the long-running suit brought by the detainees could proceed against former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former FBI Director Robert Mueller and others. Mueller is now the special counsel investigating possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign team in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Three of the justices did not participate in the ruling.  The court's decision allows for high-level officials to violate the Constitution without fear of personal accountability - a dangerous message in this time of rampant state-sponsored discrimination against Muslim and immigrant communities,  said Rachel Meeropol, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights advocacy group who represents the detainees. The civil rights lawsuit sought to hold the various former officials responsible for racial and religious profiling and abuse in detention that the plaintiffs said they endured after being swept up following the 2001 attacks carried out by al Qaeda Islamic militants on the United States. Writing for the court, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy said the allegations were serious and that the Supreme Court did not condone such treatment of detainees. But, Kennedy said, the only issue for the court was whether Congress had authorized such lawsuits against public officials. It had not, the justices concluded. The court sent one part of the case back to lower courts to determine if claims against Dennis Hasty, the warden in charge of the Brooklyn detention facility where the detainees were held, could go forward. The suit was filed by a group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens who, their lawyers said, were held as terrorism suspects based on their race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported. The lawsuit claimed that the senior Bush administration officials were liable because they made the policy decisions that led to the round-up and confinement of the plaintiffs. The former officials were represented by the Justice Department. A spokesman declined to comment. Solitary Confinement The plaintiffs were charged with only civil immigration violations. But they said they were subjected at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center to 23-hours-a-day solitary confinement, strip searches, sleep deprivation, beatings and other abuses and denied the ability to practice their religion. They said their rights under the U.S. Constitution to due process and equal protection under the law were violated. Liberal justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented from the ruling. Breyer took the relatively unusual step of reading his dissent from the bench, saying such lawsuits should be allowed to go forward in order  to provide appropriate compensation for those deprived of important constitutional rights and in times of special national-security need.  During the U.S. Justice Department's massive investigation after the Sept. 11 attacks, certain immigrants in the country illegally were detained until being cleared of involvement. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ashcroft, Mueller and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar could be sued, based on a 1971 Supreme Court precedent. In 2013, a judge had dismissed the claims against them but allowed some against detention facility wardens. Government lawyers have said there is no proof Ashcroft or Mueller personally condoned any potential unconstitutional actions. The plaintiffs included Benamar Benatta, an Algerian Muslim who was seeking refugee status in Canada, and Ahmed Khalifa, an Egyptian Muslim who said he was on vacation. In a similar previous case, the Supreme Court in 2009 backed Ashcroft, saying a lawsuit by detainees failed to contain specific details on his involvement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-detainees-idUSL1N1JG0M9"},

By 1840 GMT, the rand was trading 1.64 percent weaker to the dollar at 13.0150, having hit 13.0525 in response to the comments from Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Government bonds also weakened, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 rising as much as 11 basis points to 8.595 percent. Mkhwebane made the proposal in a statement to a Pretoria news conference where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa Group. In her recommendations, Mkhwebane said the constitution should be changed to make promoting balanced and sustainable economic growth the primary objective of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The central bank said that it was studying the Public Protector's report and would announce its response to the findings and remedial actions. But SARB Governor Lesetja Kganyago told a business gathering late on Monday, without making specific reference to Mkhwebane's recommendations, that keeping inflation low and protecting the value of the currency was supportive of economic growth.  The ratings agencies have been clear that the effectiveness of the central bank is one of the strongest pillars supporting this economy – a claim that speaks to both our price and financial stability mandates,  Kganyago said.  We will continue to honour our constitutional mandate and the trust placed in us by the South African society.  Specifically, Mkhwebane said the phrase  to protect the value of the currency  should be removed from the constitution. That phrase has been central to South African monetary policy since the end of white-minority rule in 1994. Mkhwebane was delivering her findings against Barclays Africa, and it was unclear why deviated into monetary policy. Nomura emerging markets economist Peter Attard Montalto said the tangent was touching  Pandora's Box .  This is quite unusual that a Public Protector has been so specific on changing the constitution or indeed be so radical on transformation,  he said. Nevertheless, he said, any changes to the central bank's mandate were unlikely to happen in the short to medium run given the legal resistance the SARB was likely to mount.  I see the SARB leadership strongly and resolutely defending their independence and existing mandate including via court action if necessary,  he said. Economists Nic Borain and Jeff Schultz at BNP Paribas South Africa said in a note that the Public Protector had placed the future of the central bank's autonomy into question.  We also think that it is possible that the public protector has overstepped her powers in instructing Parliament to change the constitution and, therefore, her report is likely to face judicial review,  Borain and Schultz said. Shares Fall In her findings against Barclays, which trades under the name of Absa, Mkhwebane said the bank had unduly benefited from apartheid-era bailouts and must repay 1.125 billion rand ($87 million). She also said the government and the Reserve Bank had failed in their role. Mkhwebane said her investigation had found that the apartheid government breached the constitution by supplying Bankorp, which was acquired by Absa in 1992, with a series of bailouts from 1985 to 1995. Absa denied any wrongdoing. It said it was studying Mkhwebane's report and would consider its legal options. At the same event, Mkhwebane said she will oppose a bid by President Jacob Zuma to have set aside a report on claims of influence-peddling by him and his government. $1 = 12.9900 rand Additional reporting by Johannesburg bureau; Writing by James Macharia; Editing by Toby Chopra","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/safrica-zuma-currency-idUSL8N1JG3PJ"},

The proportion of Americans aged 13 to 25 diagnosed with opioid use disorders surged almost six-fold from 2001 to 2014, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics. During that period, the average annual rate of opioid use disorder among teens and young adults climbed from 0.26 cases to 1.51 cases for every 100,000 people.  Overall, just 27 percent of these young patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder were prescribed buprenorphine and naltrexone, two medicines to treat addiction, within six months of their diagnosis. “Medications have been shown to treat withdrawal and cravings, and reduce relapse, and are an extremely effective component of treatment for opioid use disorder,” said lead study author Dr. Scott Hadland, a pediatrician and addiction specialist at Boston Medical Center. “Offering medications early in the life course of addiction – particularly to patients with severe addiction – is critical to prevent downstream harm from addiction,” Hadland said by email.  To assess how often addicted youth receive medication for opioid use disorders, Hadland and colleagues examined health insurance claims data for 9.7 million young people, for the years 2001 to 2014.  Overall, almost 21,000 teens and young adults in the study, or about 0.2 percent, were diagnosed with opioid use disorder. About 5,600 of these young people received medications to treat their addiction.  The majority of those who got medicine received buprenorphine, an opioid that helps reduce cravings by targeting the same places in the brain that are impacted by addictive opioids like heroin, morphine, and codeine. A minority, about 11 percent, received naltrexone, a medicine for alcohol and drug addiction.  The early years of the study coincided with the 2002 introduction of buprenorphine, and prescriptions of anti-addiction drugs for opioid use disorder in teens and young adults jumped more than 10-fold from 3 percent in 2002 to almost 32 percent in 2009. But after that, prescriptions declined even as addiction rates rose.  Younger teens, females, and black and Hispanic youth were less likely to get medication for opioid use disorder than older youth, males and white people, the study also found.  One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the severity of addiction, which may have influenced whether patients received medications, the authors note. Because the study only included people with private health insurance, it’s also possible that results would look different for young people with other benefits like Medicaid or who were uninsured.  Even so, the results underscore the importance of 2016 recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics advising pediatricians to consider medication for adolescents with opioid addiction, said Brendan Saloner of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore in an accompanying editorial.  “Every patient should have access to a treatment program that provides access to these medications, whether or not they end up using them,” Saloner told Reuters Health by email.  The cost of the medication can be a barrier, Saloner noted, because even with private insurance the drugs can cost $20 to $50 a month or more. But it should always be offered, he stressed.  “There is clear evidence that just as with smoking and other addictive substances, treatment with medication may be necessary due to the neurologic changes that occur in the reward center of the brain,” said Dr. Constance Houck, a researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.  “This may be particularly true for adolescents who are especially thrill seeking and impulsive and may be even more susceptible to addiction,” Houck said by email.

Witness,  in which Perry infused political themes into pop music, sold 162,000 albums, 51,000 songs and was streamed more than 19 million times in its opening week, totaling 180,000 album units, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan. The Billboard 200 album chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album). Perry's promotional tour included numerous performances, interviews and a four-day livestream on YouTube before the album's release.  In one interview, Perry said she was ready to bury the hatchet on her long-running feud with Swift.

Unlike most major European utilities, Britain's second-biggest energy supplier SSE is focused mainly on its domestic market, though it is a highly diversified group involved in nearly every aspect of the UK power and gas business.  In recent years it has invested heavily in offshore wind power and other renewables, but until now it has been uninterested in emulating continental peers that have built on their specializations at home to win market share abroad. These include France's EDF operating Britain's nuclear plants, Norway's hydropower specialist Statkraft building dams in Asia and Latin America and Denmark's Dong Energy becoming a top player in offshore wind in Britain and Germany. SSE operates several large offshore wind farms on British and Irish coasts, often in partnerships with EU utilities such as Dong and Germany's Innogy, but it has no operations on foreign shores.  That is a global business where we have to think about whether we need to have more global ambitions. We have a very strong franchise around the UK and Ireland ... should we be looking further afield? That is a good question for us to ask ourselves,  SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told Reuters at the Eurelectric conference.  He said that SSE last year came reasonably close to an American onshore renewables investment. Though that did not come to fruition, Phillips-Davies said he is continuing to look at opportunities while seeking value for shareholders and remaining consistent with the company's skill base.  I would not say we are the world leader (in offshore wind) but we have possibilities there. Dong would clearly be the number one company out there at the moment ... but I think there are lots of things that we can do,  he said, adding that SSE is also strong in networks and thermal generation. In terms of exporting those skills to other countries, Phillips-Davies said that SSE would look at partnerships or an acquisition rather than dropping its own staff on the ground.  Centrica and SSE are the only two UK-owned utilities among Britain's big six energy suppliers, with European utilities EDF, E.ON, RWE and Iberdrola all having built up significant shares in the market.

Babich,Nathaniel Yeager,Richard Simon,Sunrise Lee,INSYS,COURT/ (PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"BOSTON (Reuters) - A former employee of Insys Therapeutics Inc pleaded guilty on Monday to having conspired to defraud insurers into paying for an expensive fentanyl-based drug that is at the heart of an investigation into the company. Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Arizona-based Insys, entered her plea in federal court in Boston to one count of wire fraud conspiracy as part of deal to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Gurrieri's cooperation could result in her testifying at a later trial of six ex-Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys. Insys has been working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in a probe focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. As U.S. authorities have sought to combat opioid abuse, Subsys has become the subject of federal and state investigations amid allegations that the drug was marketed and sold to non-cancer patients. Prosecutors alleged in December that Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; former national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan. All six have pleaded not guilty. The case against Gurrieri related to what prosecutors said was a push by Insys to get insurers to cover the price of Subsys, which in 2013 cost about $2,340 for 60 units. In court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Yeager said that Gurrieri from 2012 to 2015 worked with others to deceive insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to obtain payment authorization for Subsys.  Ms. Gurrieri specifically directed employees to lie using a number different methods to mislead insurers,  Yeager said. In court papers, prosecutors said Insys employees were taught to mislead insurers about the diagnosis of patients and whether they had tried and failed other preferred medications. Gurrieri also instructed employees to claim a cancer diagnosis regardless of the patient's history or whether Subsys was prescribed for a use not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to a criminal complaint. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. Babich et al, No. 16-cr-10343, and U.S. v. Gurrieri, No. 17-cr-10083.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/insys-court-idUSL1N1JG1AD"},

{"news_time":"2017-06-19 15:03:00","news_title":"DOJ walks narrow path on agency deference in big SCOTUS employment case","keywords":"Neal Katyal,Neil Gorsuch,US,OTC,DEFERENCE","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - The Trump administration, as Reuters was the first to report on Friday, has ditched the National Labor Relations Board in one of the biggest business cases the U.S. Supreme Court will hear in its next term. Instead of backing the NRLB, which asserts that the National Labor Relations Act bars employers from forcing employees to give up their right to bring classwide actions, the solicitor general’s office filed an amicus brief supporting Ernst & Young, Epic Systems and Murphy Oil, all of which require employees to arbitrate disputes individually.  But the SG’s office does not want the Supreme Court to curtail the deference courts pay to federal agencies under the court’s 1984 decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council.  As you doubtless recall, the newest justice, Neil Gorsuch, posited when he was a federal circuit court judge that such deference may violate constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine. The Trump Justice Department’s amicus brief makes no such argument. In fact, the SG emphasized that the NLRB’s interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act is entitled to deference – but the agency’s interpretation of the interplay between that law and the Federal Arbitration Act is not.  That’s a much more moderate view of the deference owed to the NLRB than arguments offered by E&Y, Epic and Murphy Oil. Like the SG’s office, Ernst & Young counsel Kannon Shanmugam of Williams & Connolly said in the accounting firm’s merits brief that the NLRB is not entitled to deference on the interplay between the NLRA and the Federal Arbitration Act. E&Y also argued, however, that the NLRB’s interpretation of the federal law protecting employees is too deeply flawed to warrant deference.  Murphy Oil and Epic Systems, which are both represented by Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, took an even more aggressive position. In the companies’ joint merits brief, Murphy and Epic said the National Labor Relations Act is not ambiguous about classwide arbitration because the law, on its face, does not prohibit classwide waivers. As a result, according to the companies, the NLRB can’t satisfy the initial step in the Chevron test for deference, which requires statutory ambiguity. Since the law is clear, Murphy and Epic said, the courts owe the NLRB no deference.  The three cases, which the Supreme Court will hear jointly, are likely to affect thousands of employers and millions of employees. They will determine whether, in the future, workers can leverage the power of classwide proceedings to force concessions from employers. If the Supreme Court sides with the companies, mandatory arbitration provisions barring classwide claims will become standard practice for employers.  In that context, the issue of Chevron deference is a bit of a legal nerd’s lagniappe. On the other hand, these cases only exist because of how the NLRB interpreted the law it administers. So the Supreme Court’s analysis of how much leeway to grant the bureau – especially when the conservative wing of the court is increasingly restive about deferring to federal agencies – is an issue to watch. And the SG’s institutional interest in protecting deference to executive branch agencies, even as it argues that the agency in this case doesn’t deserve it, puts the Justice Department on a narrow road.  The NLRB changed its own interpretation of classwide arbitration waivers in 2012, according to Ernst & Young. As recently as 2010, E&Y’s brief said, the NLRB’s general counsel advised in a guidance memo that mandatory arbitration provisions were in line with federal law as long as employers only require employees to waive individual rights and did not prohibit employees from challenging the agreements though concerted action. But then in the NLRB’s 2012 ruling in a case called D.R. Horton, the bureau tightened its position. D.R. Horton concluded that employers may not mandate arbitration agreements barring employees from banding together in actions involving their wages or working conditions.  The bureau’s key holding is that classwide legal proceedings are covered in the NLRA section guaranteeing workers’ “right to engage in concerted action for mutual aid or protection.” E&Y, Epic and Murphy Oil all contend in their Supreme Court briefs that the NLRB was wrong on this point: The statute, they said, simply does not create what E&Y calls “a nonwaivable right to class or other collective procedures in employment-related disputes.” (Epic and Murphy Oil put it more simply: “The NLRA unambiguously does not prohibit class waivers.”)  The DOJ, in its amicus brief, agreed with the private companies that Congress does not seem to have intended the National Labor Relation Act to bar employers from enforcing arbitration agreements that prohibit classwide proceedings. Without that Congressional mandate, the SG’s office said, the NLRB “cannot supply the requisite clarity by gap-filling.”  But the SG’s office, unlike the private employers, said deference to the NLRB is restricted only because the federal agency exceeded its authority when it found the NLRA trumps the FAA. The board has the power under Chevron to determine how to read the National Labor Relations Act, which it is responsible for enforcing, but not the Federal Arbitration Act.  “The board is not entitled to deference when it determines how the NLRA should be harmonized with other federal statutes, the brief said. “The board’s approach fails to respect the FAA’s directive that arbitration agreements should be enforced unless they run afoul of arbitration-neutral rules of contract validity.”  Interestingly, the SG’s office disagreed with E&Y, Epic and Murphy Oil on whether the NLRB’s interpretation of the scope of the NLRA’s protection of joint legal proceedings could be correct. The private companies said not only that the NLRB is not entitled to deference but that it is flat wrong. The Justice Department brief said the NLRB may have been right in its reading the phrase “other concerted activities” - except when it comes to arbitration.  “The board’s view that the phrase … encompasses participation in collective or class litigation may reflect a permissible interpretation of that language, such that an employer might commit an unfair labor practice by discharging employees who initiated or joined such suits in accordance with other provisions of law,” the SG’s brief said. “Its reading … may govern in contexts where the FAA does not apply.”  That position will be of small comfort to employees, of course, if employers across the land win the right to impose arbitration agreements barring them from initiating collective litigation. We’ll see in August what the NLRB and employees have to say about that in their Supreme Court merits briefs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-deference-idUSKBN19A2P8"},

Nasdaq's biotechnology index rose 2.5 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day gain since February helped by stocks including Biogen Inc and Clovis Oncology while the S&P;'s healthcare index hit a record high. The S&P; technology sector was up 1.4 percent after its second straight weekly decline, which was triggered by fears of stretched valuations. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's 9.4 percent rally this year.  (Technology) valuations are not cheap but it doesn't seem to be a deterrent for buyers,  said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  Investors were temporarily chased from the space but many companies in the sector offer growth which is difficult to find in the market as a whole.  Apple rose 3.8 percent to $146.07, providing the biggest boost to technology followed by Microsoft, Alphabet  and Facebook. The financial sector was also one of the benchmark's strongest gainers with a 0.9 percent rise after New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the U.S. central bank to continue gradually tightening monetary policy. Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy following a set of weak U.S. economic data.  That was notable in supporting the financial sector which does well under the prospects of better economic conditions and a steeper yield curve,  said Luschini. The S&P; 500 bank subsector was up 1.3 percent At 2:48 P.M. (1848 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 119.2 points, or 0.56 percent, to 21,503.48, the S&P; 500 had gained 16.44 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,449.59 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 74.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to 6,226.08. Biogen shares were one of the top three S&P; percentage gainers with a 3.96 percent rise to $261.71, after it was upgraded to  neutral  from  sell  at UBS, which raise its price target to $270 from $262. Shares of Clovis Oncology were up 46.9 percent at $88 after late-stage data on its already approved ovarian cancer drug. The S&P; tech sector is trading at about 18.7 times forward earnings, compared with the historical 10-year average of 14.5, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.92-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Witness,  in which Perry infused political themes into pop music, sold 162,000 albums, 51,000 songs and was streamed more than 19 million times in its opening week, totaling 180,000 album units, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan. The Billboard 200 album chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album). Perry's promotional tour included numerous performances, interviews and a four-day livestream on YouTube before the album's release.  In one interview, Perry said she was ready to bury the hatchet on her long-running feud with Swift. Swift has yet to respond, but she released her back catalog to streaming services on the same day as Perry's  Witness  release in what was widely seen as a bid to steal Perry's thunder.  On Monday, Swift's 2014 album  1989  climbed to No. 31 on the Billboard 200 chart on the strength of nearly 19 million streams, just under the streaming figures for Perry's  Witness.    Perry became the second solo female artist to top the Billboard chart this year, following on last week's No. 1 debut from Halsey.  Other new releases in the top 10 this week include hip hop singer SZA's  CTRL  at No. 3, country music group Lady Antebellum's  Heart Break  at No. 4 and punk rock band Rise Against at No. 9 with  Wolves.  On the Digital Songs chart, which measures online single sales, Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi's  Despacito  featuring Justin Bieber continued its reign at the top, adding 140,000 copies sold.

Democrats will take advantage of Senate rules which allow any member to object to moving forward with routine business, a Democratic aide said. This could slow Senate operations by forcing the Republican majority to hold additional procedural votes in order to move ahead. Democrats object to closed-door meetings that Republicans have held in recent weeks to craft legislation to replace Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders would like a vote in July, even before the July 4 recess if possible.  What Democrats are aiming to do is highlight how appalling it is for Republicans to try to jam through a bill that impacts one-sixth of our economy, and would undermine the health and financial security of patients and families nationwide, without so much as a single public hearing or a robust floor debate,  said the Democratic aide, who asked not to be named. It was unclear how long the Democrats would stage their protest.  Asked to comment, a spokesman for Republican Majority leader Mitch McConnell said only that the Senate intended to vote on nominees for Trump administration positions in the coming days. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right. In the House of Representatives, conservatives wrote to McConnell about media reports on the Senate's work. Conservatives worry that the changes may make it harder to pass the legislation in the House. Reports that Senate Republicans are considering phasing out the Obamacare Medicaid expansion over three to seven years, instead of ending it in 2020 as the House bill would, have upset some House conservatives, as have other details that have leaked from the Senate talks. Medicaid is the government healthcare program for the poor.  We write to express our serious concerns,  the letter from House conservatives said, that the Senate efforts  are headed in a direction that may jeopardize final passage in the House of Representatives.  The Republican Study Committee, the largest group of House conservatives, was circulating the letter for signatures, said a House Republican aide, who asked not to be named. The group is chaired by Representative Mark Walker. Even without outside pressure, Senate Republicans have struggled to coalesce around an Obamacare replacement bill, with moderates and conservatives in the party pushing in different directions. The House narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. However, Republican President Donald Trump last week urged the Senate to pass a more generous replacement program.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar two weeks ago, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in their affairs and cosying up to Iran, all of which Doha denies.  Both sides stressed the importance of all Arab states and the international community fighting terrorism, especially stopping the funding of terrorist groups and providing political and media cover,  Sisi's office said in a statement. The meeting, which took place in Cairo, came hours after Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Doha had not received any demands from its Gulf neighbours and that Qatar's internal affairs are non-negotiable, including the future of Doha-based channel al Jazeera. The statement did not refer to Qatar or Al Jazeera explicitly. The channel is at the centre of the controversy. Arab rulers accuse Qatar of using its multi-million-dollar franchise as a mouthpiece to attack them. Conservative Gulf neighbours have long viewed Qatar's foreign policy with suspicion, especially its refusal to shun Shi'ite Iran, and resented Al Jazeera for its readiness to air unwelcome or dissenting views from across the region. Saudi Arabia and the UAE shut down the channel when the rift happened. Egypt views Al Jazeera as critical of its government, and the channel has been banned there since 2013. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Egyptian security forces have arrested several of its reporters and last year a Cairo court recommended the death penalty for two of them, charged in absentia with endangering national security by leaking state secrets to Qatar.

Spot gold        was down 0.7 percent at $1,244.85 an ounce by 2:35 p.m. EDT (1835 GMT), after falling below the 100-day moving average to $1,244.27, its lowest since May 17. U.S. gold futures         settled down 0.8 percent at $1,246.70.     New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said U.S. inflation is a little low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market improves, allowing the Fed to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy.                  The potential for higher rates reinforced the uptrend in the dollar       , which, when it rises, makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially weakening demand.             The dollar is a large part of what's going on with gold,  said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson.  I do see some support from uncertainty about the UK government and the start of Brexit negotiations.      British Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a parliamentary election this month has, alongside Brexit negotiations starting on Monday in Brussels, fueled political uncertainty.                  Weighing on gold is a drop in holdings of physically backed exchange traded funds. The biggest, SPDR Gold Trust                , saw holdings decrease by 1.5 percent last week, the biggest weekly outflow in three months.                The Fed continued to signal one additional hike in 2017, but the market is only pricing in a 35 percent probability of a further 25 bps increase this year,  said Standard Chartered in a note, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's statement last week.      The potential hikes, including their speed and magnitude, have limited gold's upside risk in our view, and expectations being scaled back bode well for prices later in the year.      Elsewhere, palladium        was down 0.3 percent at $858.49 an ounce. Prices hovered below a 16-year high but analysts say palladium's gains of more than 25 percent so far this year may not be justified given slowing auto sales.      There are some concerning signals from the two largest gasoline (palladium) auto markets, the U.S. and China,  ICBC Standard Bank analysts said in a note.      The pace of sales growth in both countries has slowed sharply this year.      U.S. and Chinese passenger car sales fell in May from a year earlier.                               Silver        lost 0.3 percent to $16.54 an ounce and platinum        slid 0.6 percent to $918.55 an ounce.

The suspect was yanked from the cab of his van by a furious crowd as he sought to reverse and escape after injuring 10 people in what police said was a deliberate attack on Muslims that was being treated as terrorism. The man was being held down, beaten and kicked when Muslim cleric Mohammed Mahmoud stepped in to plead with people just to restrain him until police arrived.  We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him, around the assailant and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches.

For that reason this guy is still alive today,  he added.  He tried to run away but we brought him down. He would've died because so many people were punching him,  an eyewitness who gave his name as Abdul told The Independent. There were more angry scenes as police arrived and protected the accused man as he was put into a police vehicle. The van had hit people assisting an elderly man who had collapsed, and who later died. It was not clear if he died because of the attack, The attack comes just over two weeks after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight.

After years of booming orders driven by increased air travel and more fuel-efficient planes, passenger jet manufacturers are bracing for a slowdown in demand while they focus on meeting tight delivery schedules and ambitious production targets. In a sign of their more modest expectations, some companies have cut back on staffing and catering at this year's Paris show and made less space available for the media. But Boeing generated a burst of activity on the opening day by launching the 737 MAX 10 to plug a gap in its portfolio at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus (AIR.PA) A321neo. The U.S. planemaker said it had more than 240 orders and commitments from at least 10 customers for the new 737, which can carry up to 230 people in a single-class configuration.  Many airports are running out of capacity and for those airports this is a perfect aircraft,  said Ajay Singh, the chairman of low-cost Indian airline SpiceJet (SPJT.BO), as his company signed a provisional deal to buy 40 MAX 10s.  However, Airbus immediately hit back with an order for 100 of its popular A320neo planes from leasing company GECAS, as well as a deal for 12 A321neos with Air Lease Corporation. Airbus sales chief John Leahy brushed off the latest Boeing challenge, saying that much of the interest in the MAX 10 was from existing Boeing customers switching orders from other models.  Related CoverageQatar Airways CEO sees no need for Boeing mid-market jetGECAS orders 100 Airbus A320neo aircraftQatar Airways firms up order for 20 737 jets, further options dependent on Italy, India We think the 737 MAX 10 is a competitor to the (MAX) 9 and that's why a lot of people are converting,  he said. Twenty of SpiceJet's provisional order for 40 MAX 10s were conversions from an existing order for other 737 models.  GECAS also converted an existing 737 order for 20 planes to the new model and Europe's largest tour operator TUI Group (TUIGn.DE) did likewise for 18 aircraft. Boeing did announce provisional new orders for 90 MAX 10s including 50 from Indonesia's Lion Air. It also won a boost from leasing giant AerCap (AER.N) for its 787 Dreamliner long-range jet, which sits in a category for which demand has been fragile over the past year. A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flyng display at the first day of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, France June 19, 2017.Pascal RossignolIndustry sources said that Airbus would soon announce an order for 10 of its A350-900 wide-body jets from Ethiopian Airways, while it also looked set to clinch a $5 billion deal with low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru. Providing reassurance for planemakers, Qatar Airways said it was sticking with plans to increase its fleet and routes despite a diplomatic rift with four Arab nations that have closed their airspace to the company.  We have had a lot of cancellations, especially to the four countries that did this illegal blockade, but we have found new markets and this is our growth strategy,  Chief Executive Akbar al Baker told Reuters. F-35 Debut Slideshow (6 Images)While demand for passenger jets may be ebbing, there are signs that interest in military aircraft is picking up after years in the doldrums because of government budget cuts and weak economic growth. Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) is in the final stages of negotiating a $37 billion-plus deal to sell 440 F-35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That would be the biggest deal yet for the stealth warplane, which is making its Paris debut this week. President Macron flew into the show aboard an Airbus A400M military transporter in his first official engagement since winning a parliamentary majority in elections on Sunday. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, with France's aerobatic team. The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by difficulties: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. Airbus said on Sunday that it was working on an A380 upgrade -- dubbed A380plus -- with fuel-saving wingtips, confirming plans reported by Reuters in March. Airbus chief Fabrice Bregier said on Monday that the company was in talks with several potential customers for the upgraded plane. But it would only be put into production if it received  a large order , he said, without elaborating. Four-engined, double-decker superjumbos such as the A380 and Boeing's 747 were once viewed as the future of air travel between international hubs, but interest has waned as airlines have preferred cheaper, more nimble aircraft.

Bush's attorney general, FBI chief and other officials, ruling they cannot be sued over the treatment of detainees, mainly Muslims, rounded up in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The justices, in a 4-2 decision, reversed a lower court's decision that said the long-running suit brought by the detainees could proceed against former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former FBI Director Robert Mueller and others. Mueller is now the special counsel investigating possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign team in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Three of the justices did not participate in the ruling.  The court's decision allows for high-level officials to violate the Constitution without fear of personal accountability - a dangerous message in this time of rampant state-sponsored discrimination against Muslim and immigrant communities,  said Rachel Meeropol, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights advocacy group who represents the detainees. The civil rights lawsuit sought to hold the various former officials responsible for racial and religious profiling and abuse in detention that the plaintiffs said they endured after being swept up following the 2001 attacks carried out by al Qaeda Islamic militants on the United States.  Writing for the court, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy said the allegations were serious and that the Supreme Court did not condone such treatment of detainees. But, Kennedy said, the only issue for the court was whether Congress had authorized such lawsuits against public officials. It had not, the justices concluded. The court sent one part of the case back to lower courts to determine if claims against Dennis Hasty, the warden in charge of the Brooklyn detention facility where the detainees were held, could go forward. The suit was filed by a group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens who, their lawyers said, were held as terrorism suspects based on their race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported. The lawsuit claimed that the senior Bush administration officials were liable because they made the policy decisions that led to the round-up and confinement of the plaintiffs. The former officials were represented by the Justice Department. A spokesman declined to comment. Solitary Confinement The plaintiffs were charged with only civil immigration violations. But they said they were subjected at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center to 23-hours-a-day solitary confinement, strip searches, sleep deprivation, beatings and other abuses and denied the ability to practice their religion. They said their rights under the U.S. Constitution to due process and equal protection under the law were violated. Liberal justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented from the ruling. Breyer took the relatively unusual step of reading his dissent from the bench, saying such lawsuits should be allowed to go forward in order  to provide appropriate compensation for those deprived of important constitutional rights and in times of special national-security need.  During the U.S. Justice Department's massive investigation after the Sept. 11 attacks, certain immigrants in the country illegally were detained until being cleared of involvement. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ashcroft, Mueller and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar could be sued, based on a 1971 Supreme Court precedent. In 2013, a judge had dismissed the claims against them but allowed some against detention facility wardens. Government lawyers have said there is no proof Ashcroft or Mueller personally condoned any potential unconstitutional actions. The plaintiffs included Benamar Benatta, an Algerian Muslim who was seeking refugee status in Canada, and Ahmed Khalifa, an Egyptian Muslim who said he was on vacation. In a similar previous case, the Supreme Court in 2009 backed Ashcroft, saying a lawsuit by detainees failed to contain specific details on his involvement.

The tech sector, up 1.4 percent, pushed equity indexes on Wall Street higher, with the Dow and S&P; 500 hitting intraday records. The group had fallen 3.4 percent over the past two weeks.  You could argue that tech got a little overheated, so people took some profits and perhaps the selloff was a little deep, but it wasn’t that deep, that’s the thing,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  It was easily justified giving how far they had outrun, but I can’t believe it was as short-lived.  Retailers in Europe, closed up 0.8 percent, and in the U.S. gained 0.8 percent, recouping some losses that were triggered on Friday by news of Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. It was Amazon's first major brick-and-mortar acquisition in the sector and already-struggling retailers were hit hard by the prospect of having a well-known disruptor as a competitor. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.41 points, or 0.51 percent, to 21,492.69, the S&P; 500 gained 16.04 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,449.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 76.13 points, or 1.24 percent, to 6,227.89. A 1.2 percent gain in Europe's banks also boosted European shares in the wake of broker upgrades for Credit Suisse . The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.87 percent and MSCI's gauge of stock markets across the globe gained 0.56 percent. Dudley Comments The U.S. dollar and Treasury yields moved higher after comments from New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley that reinforced expectations the central bank will continue on its path of tightening monetary policy. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of key currencies, rose 0.37 percent, with the euro down 0.44 percent to $1.1148. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.1827 percent, from 2.157 percent late on Friday. The Fed raised rates last week and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year. The stronger dollar weighed on gold prices, but losses were curbed by uncertainty as talks commenced on the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union. Britain's negotiators were in Brussels seeking a  new, deep and special partnership with the European Union  on Monday as talks on the unprecedented British withdrawal from the bloc finally got under way. Oil prices gave up early gains and turned negative as rising production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria have foiled an OPEC-led effort to support the market by cutting production. U.S. crude fell 1.41 percent to $44.11 per barrel and Brent was last at $46.81, down 1.18 percent on the day.

Orange said in a statement that it plans to initially lower its BT stake to 2.66 percent by selling about 133 million shares via a private placement.

Hewitt Pate,Steven Donziger,USA,COURT/CHEVRON (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to Chevron Corp by preventing Ecuadorean villagers and their American lawyer from trying to collect on an $8.65 billion pollution judgment issued against the oil company by a court in Ecuador. The justices turned away an appeal by New York-based lawyer Steven Donziger, who has spent more than two decades trying to hold Chevron responsible for pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest, of lower court rulings blocking enforcement in the United States of the 2011 judgment. While not disputing that pollution occurred, San Ramon, California-based Chevron has said it is not liable and that Donziger and his associates orchestrated the writing of a key environmental report and bribed the presiding judge in Ecuador.  Today's decision is an important step toward bringing this illegal scheme to a final conclusion,  said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron's vice president and general counsel. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan barred enforcement of the judgment in 2014, citing the corruption used to obtain it. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld Kaplan's decision, citing  a parade of corrupt actions  by Donziger and his associates, including coercion and fraud, culminating in the bribe offer. The 2nd Circuit found that Chevron's $8.646 billion judgment debt was  clearly traceable  to corrupt conduct by the legal team representing villagers from the area affected by the pollution. The lengthy legal battle with Chevron has been waged in several countries and was documented in  Crude,  a 2009 documentary film. The plaintiffs have said they plan to continue efforts to enforce the judgment in other countries, including Canada, regardless of the outcome in the United States.  The Supreme Court's decision closes a chapter and will allow the global public to properly focus on the true substance of the case, which is an international judgment enforcement process - in which U.S. courts have no role - and the devastating environmental and human tragedy that both Chevron and the global community need to address,  Donziger said in a statement. The saga has drawn extensive media attention over the years, with a succession of reporters given tours by both sides of the affected sites on the edge of the Amazonian jungle near the town of Lago Agrio. The plaintiffs also touted the backing of several celebrities including actors Mia Farrow and Danny Glover. Donziger and representatives of residents of the Lago Agrio region have sought to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001. Chevron has said a 1998 agreement between Texaco and Ecuador absolved it of further liability. Donziger's crusade began to unravel when Chevron noticed a scene in the  Crude  documentary, released in 2009, showing Donziger working with supposedly neutral experts in preparing a report for the Ecuadorean court. Chevron was then able to get access to out-takes and other material related to the documentary via court order. Chevron cited this evidence when it filed its lawsuit in 2011 seeking to block enforcement of the judgment, saying Donziger's actions violated U.S. anti-racketeering law.

The intensity of fighting was lower than on Sunday, when  Iraqi forces announced the start of the assault on the Old City, a Reuters visuals team reported from near the frontlines.  The historic district, and a tiny area to its north, are the only parts of the city still under the militants' control. Mosul used to be the Iraqi capital of the group, also known as ISIS. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) expressed alarm on Monday at the situation of the civilians in the Old City, estimated at more than 100,000 by the United Nations.  “We’re seeing dozens of new patients a day, including children and the elderly,  said Julia Schuerch, an ICRC emergency specialist in Mosul.  For a heart-breakingly high number, it was simply too late; they died soon after reaching us,” she said in a statement from the organization calling for the evacuation of the wounded.

The Iraqi government initially hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the campaign took longer as militants reinforced positions in civilian areas to fight back. Islamic State is using suicide car and motorbike bombs, booby traps and sniper and mortar fire against the troops. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks, as Iraqi forces could not fully secure exit corridors. Islamic State snipers are shooting at families trying to flee on foot or by boat across the Tigris River, as part of a tactic to keep civilians as human shields, according to the United Nations.  The militants are also retreating in Syria, mainly in the face of a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition. Its capital there, Raqqa, is under siege.  About 850,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with relatives or in camps, according to aid groups. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi headed on Monday to Saudi Arabia, the first leg of a Middle East tour that will also include Iran and Kuwait, in a diplomatic effort to foster regional reconciliation and coordination against terrorism, his office said.

EU foreign ministers held a first discussion in Luxembourg and agreed to consider the deployment of an EU Security Sector Reform Advice and Assist Team, which could train Iraq security officials, according to a statement released after the meeting.  I hope this can be put in place rapidly enough, hopefully in the coming months, so we can provide all our advice and assistance to the Iraqi authorities,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a news conference. Iraq has formally requested EU help, diplomats said. Iraqi forces are slowly advancing in Islamic State's last stronghold in the Old City of Mosul. A senior commander of the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces said the assault was the final stage of the ninth-month battle for Mosul. The EU mission would not take part in the actual combat but would train Iraqi forces, which would help to maintain order after Islamic State is driven out. U.S. officials are concerned tribal groups may fight for control as the militants flee. French diplomats say an EU mission could build up Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, establish functioning justice and interior ministries and give strategic security advice to the Iraqi government, as well as train police. Another EU diplomat said the bloc had a duty to help in a non-combat role, partly to avoid even greater flows of refugees to Europe.  While a small step, any such effort could signal an end to France and Germany's aversion to EU involvement in Middle East wars after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Berlin and Paris opposed.  Both countries are involved separately in the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, but the EU's militaries have struggled to work as a bloc despite broad know-how in non-combat training roles.  An EU mission in Iraq in 2006 to help train judges and police was widely regarded as a failure because it was too small and too limited in duration, an EU official said. Mogherini has backed a greater role for the bloc abroad, seeking to develop a common EU defense alliance to match its economic clout. Any EU mission might dovetail with similar planning at NATO, which this month joined the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, and is considering training more Iraqi soldiers.  We cannot afford to allow a vacuum to develop,  said one EU diplomat briefed on the EU discussions.  We and others are ready to step in. Just how we do that is to be decided.  The EU's foreign service, the European External Action Service, is expected to present proposals soon.

Dudley said halting the policy-tightening cycle now would imperil the economy, adding that with unemployment at 4.3 percent and inflation at about 1.5 percent,  this is actually a pretty good place to be.”                  “He said that it would be a mistake for the Fed to stop tightening now,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president in fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.      “Generally Dudley has been one of the doves on the committee, so this would signal that the tightening agenda continues,” Hurley said.     The 10-year notes             fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.19 percent, up from 2.16 percent late on Friday, and up from an overnight low of 2.14 percent.     Prices gained overnight on safety buying after a man plowed his van into worshippers near a London mosque, injuring 10 people and compounding worries after a series of attacks in recent months in Britain, Europe and the United States.                  Yields have risen from seven-month lows since the Fed on Wednesday increased interest rates for the second time in three months and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.                  Bond weakness has been limited, however, by concerns about weak economic indicators.     Data released before the Fed meeting on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, suggesting a softening in domestic demand.                   Yellen set aside any immediate concerns about the downtick in core inflation,  said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.  For the time being her stance is very supportive of the long-end.      The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to a three-month low of 100 basis points, as hawkish Fed policy weighed on intermediate-dated notes but long bonds were supported by tepid inflation.

Teodorin Obiang, eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice-president himself, denies charges of laundering embezzled public funds, for which he risks a sentence of 10 years in jail and huge fines if convicted. The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic. Obiang was already put on trial in January but the case, which has been 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued their client had not had enough time to prepare his defense. Among the acquisitions at the center of the trial is a large property bought for 25 million euros ($28 million) in 2005 on Paris's upmarket Avenue Foch, with gymnasium, hammam steam room, hair-dressing studio and a discotheque with cinema screen. In addition to luxury clothing and jewels, prosecutors say Obiang, built up an exceptional collection of costly cars, which along with clothes, jewels and real estate took the value of all his assets to around 100 million euros. Beyond Obiang's case, the broader French probe known as the  ill-gotten assets  investigation concerns purchases in France by the family of Gabon leader Ali Bongo as well as Congo Republic leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.

The FTC, along with the attorneys general of California and the District of Columbia, will file a complaint in federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction to block the deal, the antitrust regulator said. The companies said in a joint statement that they were considering their legal options.  We are disappointed by this decision and continue to believe that a merger is in the best interests of our players, our companies, our employees and the fantasy sports industry,  DraftKings Chief Executive Jason Robins and his FanDuel counterpart, Nigel Eccles, said in the statement. This is the latest setback for two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November 2016 as a merger of equals that would cut their legal bills. Between them, the two companies have 95 percent of daily fantasy sports, according to data from Eilers and Krejcik Gaming LLC. DraftKings and FanDuel have argued that they compete against larger, more powerful companies in the broader fantasy sports business, like ESPN and Yahoo.  This merger would deprive customers of the substantial benefits of direct competition between DraftKings and FanDuel,  said Tad Lipsky, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. The FTC will ask for the preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal under antitrust law. In practice, if companies are slapped with a preliminary injunction, they normally terminate a merger because deals cannot be held together during the lengthy internal process. The FTC has won a long list of court fights to stop deals of all sizes in recent years. Most notably, the agency stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc and prevented office supplies retailer Staples Inc from buying Office Depot Inc. Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. Participants draft teams for a single game, enabling fans to spend money on contests with a frequency critics compare to sports betting. FanDuel has paid contests in 39 states while DraftKings is in 40 where successful players win money. The companies have a history of aggressive advertising as they have battled for market share. They cut ad spending significantly in 2016 and said the combined company could again expand spending on advertising and customer acquisition. The tie-up would reduce costs as both companies separately fund legal defenses and lobbying for legislation to authorize fantasy sports in states that have declared it illegal. Without a merger, the companies may have to go back to outspending each other to win customers. New York's Eric Schneiderman was one of several state attorneys general who cracked down on the industry in 2015. New York settled for $12 million and changes in how the companies market their games, including disclosures about expected winnings. FanDuel's investors include KKR, Shamrock Capital, Comcast Ventures, NBC Sports and Google Capital. DraftKings' investors include KKR and others.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/fanduel-ma-draftkings-idUSL1N1JG0W0"},

Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Arizona-based Insys, entered her plea in federal court in Boston to one count of wire fraud conspiracy as part of deal to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Gurrieri's cooperation could result in her testifying at a later trial of six ex-Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys. Insys has been working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in a probe focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. As U.S. authorities have sought to combat opioid abuse, Subsys has become the subject of federal and state investigations amid allegations that the drug was marketed and sold to non-cancer patients. Prosecutors alleged in December that Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; former national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan. All six have pleaded not guilty. The case against Gurrieri related to what prosecutors said was a push by Insys to get insurers to cover the price of Subsys, which in 2013 cost about $2,340 for 60 units. In court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Yeager said that Gurrieri from 2012 to 2015 worked with others to deceive insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to obtain payment authorization for Subsys.

The court ruled 8-0 in favor of the Portland, Oregon-based Asian-American dance rock band, which had been denied a trademark because the government deemed its name disparaging to people of Asian descent. The Slants challenged that rejection as a violation of free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, and the Supreme Court agreed. The ruling likely paves the way for the Redskins to protect trademarks covering the team's name. The National Football League team, which took the name Redskins in the 1930s, filed a legal challenge to a 2014 decision by a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal canceling its trademarks as disparaging to Native Americans. A lower court put the Redskins' dispute on hold pending the outcome of the band's case. Lisa Blatt, a lawyer representing the Redskins, told Reuters the team is thrilled with Monday's ruling because it resolves  the Redskins' long-standing dispute with the government.  Writing for the court, Justice Samuel Alito did not mince words in ruling that the decades-old trademark provision is unconstitutional.  It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend,  Alito wrote. Band frontman Simon Tam has said he chose to call the band The Slants to reclaim a term some consider a derogatory reference to Asian people's eyes, and wear it as a  badge of pride.  The band's lawyers argued that the government cannot use trademark law to impose burdens on free speech to protect listeners from offense. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed legal papers supporting the band, hailed the ruling as a major victory for the First Amendment. ACLU lawyer Lee Rowland said government efforts to protect minorities from disparagement instead hurt members of that very community, in this case the Asian-American band.  Fortunately, today's opinion prevents the kind of absurd outcome that results when the government plays speech police,  Rowland said. 'Marginalized Communities' The band welcomed the ruling.  After an excruciating legal battle that has spanned nearly eight years, we're beyond humbled and thrilled to have won this case at the Supreme Court,  the band said in a statement posted to its website on Monday.  This journey has always been much bigger than our band: it's been about the rights of all marginalized communities to determine what's best for ourselves.  Patent and Trademark Office spokesman Paul Fucito said the agency was reviewing the decision. The government previously said a ruling favoring The Slants could lead to a proliferation of racial slurs as sanctioned trademarks. After the government rejected The Slants' request, Tam appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which in 2015 ruled that the so-called disparagement provision of the 1946 law governing trademarks ran afoul of the Constitution's guarantee of free speech. The government appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. The federal government said in court papers that it should not be required to approve trademarks  containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white-supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.  In the separate Redskins case, a trademark board in 2014 canceled the team's six trademarks at the request of Native American activists on grounds that the team name disparaged Native Americans. The team's appeal, also on free speech grounds, was put on hold in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, pending the outcome of The Slants' case. Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court after arguments were heard in the case and did not participate in Monday's decision. The Supreme Court also ruled on another free speech case on Monday, striking down a North Carolina law banning convicted sex offenders from Facebook and other social media services that play a vital role in modern life.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-band-idUSL1N1JG0KC"},

The justices turned away an appeal by New York-based lawyer Steven Donziger, who has spent more than two decades trying to hold Chevron responsible for pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest, of lower court rulings blocking enforcement in the United States of the 2011 judgment. While not disputing that pollution occurred, San Ramon, California-based Chevron has said it is not liable and that Donziger and his associates orchestrated the writing of a key environmental report and bribed the presiding judge in Ecuador.  Today's decision is an important step toward bringing this illegal scheme to a final conclusion,  said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron's vice president and general counsel. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan barred enforcement of the judgment in 2014, citing the corruption used to obtain it. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld Kaplan's decision, citing  a parade of corrupt actions  by Donziger and his associates, including coercion and fraud, culminating in the bribe offer. The 2nd Circuit found that Chevron's $8.646 billion judgment debt was  clearly traceable  to corrupt conduct by the legal team representing villagers from the area affected by the pollution. The lengthy legal battle with Chevron has been waged in several countries and was documented in  Crude,  a 2009 documentary film. The plaintiffs have said they plan to continue efforts to enforce the judgment in other countries, including Canada, regardless of the outcome in the United States.  The Supreme Court's decision closes a chapter and will allow the global public to properly focus on the true substance of the case, which is an international judgment enforcement process - in which U.S. courts have no role - and the devastating environmental and human tragedy that both Chevron and the global community need to address,  Donziger said in a statement. The saga has drawn extensive media attention over the years, with a succession of reporters given tours by both sides of the affected sites on the edge of the Amazonian jungle near the town of Lago Agrio. The plaintiffs also touted the backing of several celebrities including actors Mia Farrow and Danny Glover. Donziger and representatives of residents of the Lago Agrio region have sought to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001. Chevron has said a 1998 agreement between Texaco and Ecuador absolved it of further liability. Donziger's crusade began to unravel when Chevron noticed a scene in the  Crude  documentary, released in 2009, showing Donziger working with supposedly neutral experts in preparing a report for the Ecuadorean court. Chevron was then able to get access to out-takes and other material related to the documentary via court order. Chevron cited this evidence when it filed its lawsuit in 2011 seeking to block enforcement of the judgment, saying Donziger's actions violated U.S. anti-racketeering law.

Two sources familiar with the matter said Nomura (8604.T) plans to add a dozen senior- and mid-level investment bankers over the next 12 to 18 months in the United States, covering mergers and acquisitions, equity capital markets and leveraged financing - building out a team of around 200 there. Nomura has poached investment bankers from global investment banks as well as boutiques such as Jefferies and Houlihan Lokey since the beginning of this year. It has hired Jim Voorheis from UBS (UBSG.S), where he was head of specialty finance in the Americas, as managing director for its financial institutions group, and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) veteran Thomas Chung as managing director for U.S. equity capital markets. The number of hires could eventually be much higher, one of the sources said, depending on deals momentum and the outlook for the profitability of Nomura's international operations. The sources, who have direct knowledge of Nomura plans, did not want to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. They said Nomura has made a U.S. expansion of its wholesale business, which includes global markets and investment banking,  one of its priorities. This comes after a major restructuring – including a big shrinking of its operations in Europe last year - following its disastrous acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Asian and European businesses in 2008. That led to internal clashes, and was followed by six consecutive years of losses for its international operations.  As a result previous plans to expand in the U.S. were put on hold and Nomura reduced its total staff across all divisions in the Americas to 2,279 at the end of 2016 from 2,501 a year earlier. The number had crept back up to 2,314 by the end of March.  Strong Candidate  In March, it named company veteran Kentaro Okuda, head of investment banking and a contender to become Nomura’s future chief executive, as head of its Americas arm.  He knows all of our clients from Japan and he can look after their deals,  said one of the sources.  If Okuda does well in the U.S., he might emerge as a strong candidate to become group CEO.   Two of the sources said Nomura plans to bolster its coverage of the technology, financial and healthcare sectors in the U.S. where it sees growing dealmaking opportunities within the country and outside. It expects to benefit from American companies doing deals in Japan, a market where it has strong presence and contacts in the local corporate sectors, they said, and even China - where it has been increasing its presence.  Nomura currently only has about 0.5 percent of the U.S. investment banking fee pool. Even getting this up a little can make a meaningful difference given its size – the fees were worth an estimated $39.6 billion last year, one of the sources said. In response to Reuters queries, Nomura said that it sees its Americas business as a key element of its international strategy and it would continue to make  strategic additions  in areas, including sales and trading, and financing.  Nomura is ... well-positioned to connect markets east and west. Part of our continued strategy is to capture more cross-border client transactions,  it said, without giving details on expansion plans. In part, the U.S. push is a response to concerns at home. Once a go-to bank for the Japanese firms and top of the Japanese M&A; league table for years, Nomura took the number 6 rank in the home league table last year, down from second position in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the first quarter of this year, the bank slipped to 11th position, lagging behind Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and even smaller domestic rival Daiwa Securities (8601.T). In the overall investment banking fee league table, Nomura's share of the revenue in Japan has dropped to 14 percent last year from 18 percent in 2008, the data shows.

Lead guitarist Gary Rossington, Ronnie's brother and current lead singer Johnny Van Zant, and others contend that  Street Survivors: The True Story of the Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash,  based on recollections of former drummer Artimus Pyle, violated a 1988 consent order governing the use of the band's name. The lawsuit and related paperwork were made public on Friday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. A trial is scheduled for July 11, court records show. Known for such songs as  Sweet Home Alabama  and  Free Bird,  Lynyrd Skynyrd went on hiatus after its touring plane crashed in Mississippi on Oct. 20, 1977, killing Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steven Gaines and four others. Twenty people, including Pyle, survived. Surviving band members reunited in 1987 to organize a  tribute tour,  prompting litigation that led to the consent order. The plaintiffs, who also include representatives of the estates of Ronnie Van Zant, Gaines and late guitarist Allen Collins, sued after learning that Pyle and co-defendant Cleopatra Records Inc were making the movie. They said that while Pyle, who left the band in 1991,  is free to exploit his own personal life story,  the movie would destroy their right to use the name and history of Lynyrd Skynyrd, causing  incalculable  loss and irreparable harm. Such a movie  may contain a potentially inaccurate or skewed portrayal of Lynyrd Skynyrd's story as filtered solely through the eyes of Pyle masquerading as the 'True Story' of a defining moment in the band's history,  the plaintiffs said. Pyle could not immediately be reached for comment. It is unclear whether he has hired a lawyer. Evan Mandel, a lawyer for Cleopatra Records, said in a phone interview:  We are confident that our right to publish this film is guaranteed by the First Amendment.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, who oversaw the 1988 consent order. The case is Ronnie Van Zant Inc et al v.

Marlin Bidco, the buyout vehicle set up by BC Partners and Pollen Street Partners, said it had received valid support for its offer from other Shawbrook shareholders owning a combined 75.6 percent of the company. Shawbrook declined to comment. Valid acceptances representing 50 percent of the company were required for the deal to go through with Shawbrook remaining listed on the London Stock Exchange. Under the deal structure, the company would be de-listed if at least 75 percent of its shareholders accept the offer, with those who did not accept, being part owners of an unlisted entity. Shawbrook earlier this month rejected a raised and final 868 million pound ($1.1 billion) offer from the private equity groups, which already hold 38.8 percent of the lender. The consortium first made a bid for Shawbrook in January, offering 307 pence per share, before raising its offer to 330 pence in March. However, so far, Shawbrook's directors had advised shareholders to reject the offers. Founded in 2011, London-listed Shawbrook is one of several 'challenger' banks to emerge since the financial crisis to fill a gap in small-business lending after larger banks slimmed down to focus on bolstering their capital to meet tougher regulatory requirements. These challenger banks have increasingly been seen as ripe for takeovers in recent months, bankers who advise on mergers and acquisitions have said, as a prolonged period of low interest rates has squeezed earnings and the pound's fall has made them cheaper for foreign buyers.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says nearly 75,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary and the Western Balkans are at risk of  psychological distress  caused by existing in a prolonged state of transit. About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have been stuck in Greece for over a year after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe. More than a quarter are children and over half the new arrivals have been women and children, according to U.N. data. Men were the first family members to flee to Europe in previous years, leaving others to follow.  Despair is haunting me at the moment,  said Soha, a 23-year-old Syrian who lives in a tent on the island of Chios with two her two-year-old daughter and other Syrian women.  In the camp, next to the ruins of an ancient castle, overcrowded tents are pitched on the edge of the pebbled shore, and rats roam among the garbage. Women say they are too scared to leave their tents at night, fearing harassment.  Like other women, Soha declined to give her last name or be identified in photographs, fearing it could affect her application to join her husband in Germany. A one-year-old girl smiles as she sits with her mother, Ibtissam, 22, at the Souda Refugee Camp in Chios island, Greece, June 10, 2017.  I was one month pregnant with my daughter and my son was one year old when my husband migrated to Germany.  Ibtissam, who is from Raqqa said.  I feel devastated, at the moment I can’t apply for family reunification because I have to wait until my husband gets his asylum document.... I feel depressed but I have to keep holding on for my children. Zohra BensemraFamily reunification can take between 10 months and two years, UNICEF says, making life particularly hard those left behind. The uncertainty caused  significant psychological distress and anxiety for children and their families, setting them back for years to come , UNICEF Regional Director Afshan Khan said.   I spend most of the day alone,  said Farhiya, a 23-year-old Somali who lives in a volunteer-run camp on Lesbos island. Slideshow (12 Images) The other refugees don't speak English and I don't speak Arabic. It's hard to live alone,  she said. Farhiya applied to join her husband in Austria seven months ago while still pregnant, but has not heard back, she said.     In Athens, 36-year-old Khalissa, who fled Syria with her three young children, spends her days in a drop-in center run by a UNICEF partner, a brief respite from her problems. She colors in hearts representing her feelings about the past, present and future. The past is blue for sadness, the present brown for fear and the future, in which she hopes to reunite with her husband after two years, yellow for happiness. Ultimately, she longs to go home.  If Syria becomes as before the war, I will return home,  she said.  We must return home.

Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive officer of SSE (SSE.L) - an energy supplier and a former investor in new nuclear plants - said that nuclear power has a role to play in reducing carbon emissions, but that existing technologies may not be the right ones.  The bottom line in nuclear is that it looks like only Hinkley Point will get built and Flamanville needs to go well for that to happen,  Phillips-Davies told Reuters at the Eurelectric utilities conference in Estoril.

Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos told the investment board on Monday that despite the high returns of its private equity investments, the negative public scrutiny of the asset class had made  it increasingly difficult for CalPERS to compete successfully in the private equity marketplace.  The  fish bowl of CalPERS may have reached a tipping point for us in private equity,  said Eliopoulos.  Over the course of the past two years and frequently in these monthly investment committee meetings, CalPERS staff is attacked and denigrated for our decision to invest in these funds.  In July, the pension fund plans to review  the private equity business models available to us,  Eliopoulos told the board, in order to find an  effective governance system to oversee private equity investing.  He warned that if CalPERS cannot find a solution, the board may need to  weigh a much reduced allocation to private equity.  As the country's largest public pension fund, CalPERS has come under increasing public pressure to calculate and disclose the fees it pays for its private equity investments. The fund announced last November that it had shared about 14 percent of its private equity profits over the past year with firms managing the money. The announcement marked a major milestone toward greater fee disclosures within the asset class. In December, CalPERS announced that it would reduce its private equity asset class from 10 percent to 8 percent of the total portfolio in order to reduce some of the risks in the fund. Roughly $25.9 billion of CalPERS' $318.9 billion fund was invested in private equity as of April 30. Private equity is now the only asset class in CalPERS' portfolio with a return forecast above 7 percent over the next decade, making the asset class a vital component to maintaining the fund's assumed return rate of 7 percent by 2020. CalPERS, along with most public pension funds across the country, has struggled to achieve its investment goals in recent years. CalPERS returned 0.61 percent last year, compared to its assumed rate of return at the time of 7.5 percent.

Teodorin Obiang, eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice-president himself, denies charges of laundering embezzled public funds, for which he risks a sentence of 10 years in jail and huge fines if convicted. The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic. Obiang was already put on trial in January but the case, which has been 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued their client had not had enough time to prepare his defense. Among the acquisitions at the center of the trial is a large property bought for 25 million euros ($28 million) in 2005 on Paris's upmarket Avenue Foch, with gymnasium, hammam steam room, hair-dressing studio and a discotheque with cinema screen. In addition to luxury clothing and jewels, prosecutors say Obiang, built up an exceptional collection of costly cars, which along with clothes, jewels and real estate took the value of all his assets to around 100 million euros. Beyond Obiang's case, the broader French probe known as the  ill-gotten assets  investigation concerns purchases in France by the family of Gabon leader Ali Bongo as well as Congo Republic leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.

The comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, were among the first after the U.S. central bank hiked rates last week in the face of a series of soft inflation readings.    This is actually a pretty good place to be  with unemployment at 4.3 percent and inflation at about 1.5 percent, Dudley told the North Country Chamber of Commerce in Plattsburg, New York.   We are pretty close to full employment,  he said.  Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up and with that, inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent.   Price readings have edged lower over the past few months, raising questions about the Fed's general plan to boost rates one more time before the year-end, and another three times next year. Last week's hike was the central bank's third in six months. Asked about a so-called flattening of yields in the bond market, which suggest investors are skeptical that this Fed policy-tightening cycle will last much longer, Dudley said pausing policy now could raise the risk of inflation surging and hurting the economy.  He said he did not read the market move as a negative signal for the U.S. economy, but rather one that reflects low overseas inflation and borrowing costs.   I am very confident  that economic expansion  has quite a long ways to go,  Dudley said, adding he expected wage growth to rise to about 3 percent over the next year or two.

Two Sudanese men who arrived with around 1,000 other migrants at the Sicilian port of Palermo on Monday told IOM staff they left Libya in a rubber boat packed with 130 people, mainly Sudanese, IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo said. After a few hours at sea, the men said a group of Libyans caught them up.  They described (the Libyans) as pirates, but they are basically traffickers,  Di Giacomo said.  They stole the motor - something which has happened a few times recently - and at that point the boat started to take on water and sank,  he said. Passing Libyan fishermen rescued the Sudanese pair along with two Nigerian men who were the only other survivors, and put them on another migrant boat. They were eventually rescued and brought to Sicily.  They were in shock, traumatized by what had happened, and exhausted,  Di Giacomo said, adding there were no official witnesses to what had happened though migrants from the second boat confirmed the account.  Gangs in Libya have built a lucrative trade out of packing migrants into rickety boats heading for Italy, where more than 65,000 have arrived so far this year. As of June 14, 1,828 were believed to have died in the attempt, according to IOM figures.   Debate over dealing with the migrant influx is becoming increasingly bitter in Italy, whose economy is lagging behind its European peers ahead of national elections due next year.  Most of the people attempting the journey originally come Nigeria, followed by Bangladesh and other sub-Saharan countries.

The governing International Automobile Federation (FIA), published a 21-race 2018 calendar on Monday with France and Germany's Hockenheim, absent this year, returning while Malaysia drops off. The race at Le Castellet, inland from Marseille, will be on June 24, avoiding a clash with the Le Mans 24 Hours on June 16-17, followed by Austria on July 1 and Silverstone on July 8. Formula One has not had three races on successive weekends before, due to logistical reasons, although it has been mooted. A proposed street race in New Jersey was sandwiched between Monaco and Canada on the provisional 2014 calendar but the U.S. round did not happen for financial reasons. The season will start in Australia on March 25 with teams then traveling to Shanghai and Bahrain, which will be back-to-back on April 8 and 15, before the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on April 29. Russia was the fourth round this year but that race moves away from the May Day holiday weekend to an end of September slot instead. Spain's Circuit de Barcelona opens the European season on May 13, followed by the showcase Monaco race, before Formula One travels across the Atlantic to Canada on June 10 and then returns to France. Germany returns on July 22 with a race at Hockenheim, followed by Hungary on the next weekend, with the three week August break maintained after fears it might have to go to accommodate the extra races.

Kvitova only recently returned to competition after a knife attack at her home in the Czech Republic in December left her with an injured left hand. Rehab has only been part of the work that the 27-year-old has had to undergo. Psychologically, the violent attempted robbery clearly left a scar.  She returned to action at the French Open this month, losing in the second round, and she is playing on the grass at the Aegon Classic at Edgbaston this week as she builds up to her favorite event.  When I was on the way back I thought, I would really like to play Wimbledon and I feel that I can say, in some way, I am ready for Wimbledon. I played Roland Garros as a preparation,  she told Reuters. Kvitova, who plays fellow Czech Tereza Smitkova in Birmingham on Tuesday, said she had been overwhelmed by the welcome she got from fellow players and others in the game.  It was amazing. I was really looking forward to seeing other players and coaches (but) I didn’t expect that huge welcome from all of them. It was so nice to see them all smiling and wishing me good luck and welcoming me back,  she said. She can expect much more of that when she turns up at the All England Club where she enjoyed a surprise win over Maria Sharapova in the 2011 final and then triumphed again three years later, beating Canadian Eugenie Bouchard.  I love the people there. I love England. At Wimbledon, it feels so quiet, so comfy, for me as a home. I am always renting a house and for me it is more than a tournament, I feel like we are a family there. It is just more relaxed for me, it is amazing,  she said. Kvitova was an eighth-ranked 21-year-old when she first won Wimbledon and she admits she did not really know how to handle the moment.  The first one was like a fairytale, I have to say. I really didn’t know what was happening. I won the grand slam but I was like ‘OK, what now?’. It was really happiness but I never expected to win that, so it was a surprise for me and other people. The second one was more special, deeper, I really enjoyed it more,  said the Czech.  New Hand  It would be a major surprise if, after everything that has happened, Kvitova were to claim a third Wimbledon title. While she is back in action, her hand remains troublesome and she is not sure if it will ever fully be back to how it was.  Naturally, it is not fully recovered, it will still take a few more months, maybe a year, who knows,  no one can really say,  she said.   I am not sure if any day it will be 100 percent, I don’t think so but I just need to do what I can.   She added:  I need to live with it. I think I will have to get used to my ‘new hand’ if I can call it that, we are still worried about some inflammation and that kind of thing but I think it is a small risk, now compared to a few months ago.  There has also been a healing process psychologically as she dealt with the shock of the violent intrusion in her house.  It wasn’t easy. I would lie if I said it was easy. The first days, first months, were very difficult mentally as well, I do have my mental coach so I was working with him a lot on this but I have to say that people around me, family and friends, helped me a lot as well. I think I am getting over it,  she said.  It will probably still be there for the rest of my life but I think I will deal with it somehow.   The past year has also given Kvitova a different perspective on her profession and one she will take with her to Wimbledon. “I think the main thing is that I love playing tennis and love to be back and that is what I am really enjoying now. Probably I have never enjoyed tennis as much I do know – it is a beautiful feeling, I have to say.   I always loved to play tennis but now it is a different level. That is what is important for me right now, it doesn’t matter how many matches, if I win or lose or whatever, I will just enjoy it.   Of course I am back because I want to win some big tournaments, but it is not just that I am going there because of that. I am just really glad I can play tennis again .

The talented Australian maverick slipped awkwardly on the grass at the back of the court during a rally at 4-4 in the first set against American Donald Young, succumbing again to a recent, problematic hip injury. After putting his head in his hands and lying on court for a few minutes after the slip, Kyrgios needed a medical time-out. When he resumed, obviously in some discomfort, he went on to squander two break points before losing the first set 7-3 in a tie-break and then deciding to retire from the contest. His withdrawal may have just been a precaution with Wimbledon so close, but it was another blow to the 22-year-old, whose hip and shoulder problems forced him to pull out of the Italian Open and blighted his French Open preparations.  It just was a sharp pain when I fell,  the Australian told reporters.  I started feeling it when I was walking, when I was landing on my serve. It's exactly what I was feeling in Paris. It's tough to play through.  It's not great at the moment. But we'll see.  Despite the setback, he expects to play at Wimbledon, which begins on July 3.  I'd play Wimbledon if I was injured pretty bad anyway,  he said.  I'm here anyway. I don't really have time to go home or anything. Yeah, I will be playing, for sure.  Earlier, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had returned emphatically to winning ways at Queen's, putting his shock first round exit at his home French Open firmly behind him. Tsonga outplayed his compatriot Adrian Mannarino 6-2 6-2 in the opening match of the traditional Wimbledon warm-up event in his first match since suffering a four-set defeat by little-known Argentine Renzo Olivo at Roland Garros. The loss to the world number 91 Olivo had been particularly disappointing for Tsonga in light of his three-title season during which he also reckoned that becoming a new father had helped provide him with fresh inspiration on court. Yet even while never needing to find top gear in the sunshine, the two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist demonstrated why he could still be a threat on the grass at 32 as he dismissed the challenge of the man who had beaten him in Monaco in April. Dimitrov Through Mannarino, ranked 62 in the world, had started brightly, swapping breaks with Tsonga, but once the world number 10 found rhythm in his groundstrokes and his opponent needed a time-out in the first set for treatment to his back, it proved a straightforward win. The key game was the marathon eight-deuce sixth in the opening set which finally saw left-hander Mannarino surrender his delivery for a second time after Tsonga had eked out six break points. A run of seven straight games saw the fifth seed take complete control before he became the first winner in the week-long championships, wrapping up victory in 67 minutes.  It was a good match. I played pretty well. I had to play my best tennis to get over him,  Tsonga said.  I sweated a lot.  If he can find his best form, Tsonga, who lost to Andy Murray in the 2011 Queen's final, could be one of the major threats to world number one Murray, who is seeking a sixth championship triumph. So will Bulgaria's sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, on the evidence of his superb 6-3 6-1 hammering of French Open men's doubles champion Ryan Harrison in just 54 one-sided minutes. Dimitrov, who has shown signs of rediscovering his 2014 best when he won Queen's, was in imperious form, reducing Harrison to such frustration that the American landed a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct after smashing his racket against his foot in the second set.

Two Sudanese men who arrived with around 1,000 other migrants at the Sicilian port of Palermo on Monday told IOM staff they left Libya in a rubber boat packed with 130 people, mainly Sudanese, IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo said. After a few hours at sea, the men said a group of Libyans caught them up.  They described (the Libyans) as pirates, but they are basically traffickers,  Di Giacomo said.  They stole the motor - something which has happened a few times recently - and at that point the boat started to take on water and sank,  he said. Passing Libyan fishermen rescued the Sudanese pair along with two Nigerian men who were the only other survivors, and put them on another migrant boat. They were eventually rescued and brought to Sicily.  They were in shock, traumatized by what had happened, and exhausted,  Di Giacomo said, adding there were no official witnesses to what had happened though migrants from the second boat confirmed the account.  Gangs in Libya have built a lucrative trade out of packing migrants into rickety boats heading for Italy, where more than 65,000 have arrived so far this year. As of June 14, 1,828 were believed to have died in the attempt, according to IOM figures.   Debate over dealing with the migrant influx is becoming increasingly bitter in Italy, whose economy is lagging behind its European peers ahead of national elections due next year.

In becoming the seventh consecutive first-time winner of a major championship, Koepka showed that behind the superstars who dominate the headlines are dozens of players who on any given week are capable of beating anyone. Koepka flew under the radar coming into the second major of the year but was far from a long shot, entering the week at Erin Hills ranked 22nd in the world and having finished no worse than 21st in his seven previous major starts. Strong and aggressive, the 27-year-old Floridian is one of the longest drivers on the PGA Tour, averaging over 300 yards off the tee this season. Koepka is among the new breed of big-hitting golfers and at Erin Hills in Wisconsin he found a venue ideally suited to his game on a course softened by rain that took the fire out of what already were the widest fairways ever at a U.S. Open. There was still waist-high fescue that was as good as a one-stroke penalty, but it took a wildly inaccurate shot to find it, and Koepka did not hit too many wild shots. He ranked fourth in driving accuracy and seventh in distance, a potent combination that he parlayed into 21 birdies, leading the field for greens in regulation while limiting his blemishes to five bogeys. And on Sunday, the only day all week when a challenging wind tested the players, he missed only one green, in supreme command of all facets of his game as he compiled a five-under 67. It was a round people would be talking about for years if it had been delivered by Woods, Dustin Johnson or Rory McIlroy.  I put myself in some good chances over the majors over the last few years and never really quite came through,  Koepka said, adding that he loved the all-round test of a U.S. Open.  You can't make mistakes every shot. I mean there's a double (bogey) and a triple (bogey) waiting around every corner, if you just kind of take your mind off of it or just relax for a half second. There's something about majors where I just focus in a lot more. Obviously I need to do that more often. But it's got my full attention. Every shot, every putt, even if it's 12 inches ... I'm still reading it, still doing everything, and it's got my attention.  Koepka's victory, and before him Sergio Garcia at the U.S. Masters, show the folly of jumping on the bandwagon of whoever happens to be hot on any given week, or month. World number one Johnson seemed unbeatable three months ago. It was a similar case with Jason Day for the first half of last year, Jordan Spieth for much of 2015 and McIlroy before that. Woods won 14 majors in 46 starts from the 1997 Masters to the 2008 U.S. Open, an almost other-worldly record in a sport where a 10 percent winning record is considered outstanding. But his era at the top is long gone, and we are back to how things used to be, when you could make a winning case for dozens of players heading into any major championship. This time it was Koepka's turn to celebrate. Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Frank Pingue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-analysis-idUSKBN19A2IS"},

It indicates that the government is prioritizing radical transformation even if this leads to weakening of the business climate and could reduce trend growth,  Fitch said.

Amtrak's push to repair Penn Station's infrastructure from July 10 through Sept. 1 will take three key tracks out of service and disrupt commutes across the region. New Jersey Transit Corp and the Long Island Rail Road both rent space and tracks from Amtrak.  I think the Long Island Rail Road should consider reducing the fares on those diverted trains,  Cuomo said on Monday.  That's only fair to the people who are taking those trains.  New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the LIRR, said last week that at least 9,600 customers would be diverted or otherwise affected each morning during the repairs. While officials said they would add hundreds of buses and other service alternatives, they said they were not planning to discount fares as NJ Transit is doing. Cuomo made his comments as he marked the opening of a new West End Concourse underneath what is slated to become the Moynihan Train Hall, a $1.6 billion project to transform the James A. Farley Post Office Building across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station into a waiting area for the LIRR and Amtrak. The concourse officially opened last week. On Friday, Cuomo said the financial agreement had closed between the state's development arm and builders Related Cos, Vornado Realty LP and Skanska AB. The private developers are putting up $630 million, with $230 million of the total transferred to the state last week as an upfront payment and annual payments for the remaining $400 million to come during the next 40 years.  The state will contribute $500 million in appropriations.

Trump announced a partial rollback of the normalization of relations with Cuba on Friday in Miami, the heartland of Cuban exiles, in a theater named after the leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of the island in 1961.  It was a grotesque spectacle straight from the Cold War,  Rodriguez said in Vienna, during a tour of European countries, in a news conference broadcast live in Cuba. Trump's speech before an audience that included people Cuba considers terrorists, included dramatic flourishes like a Cuban- American exile playing the U.S. national anthem on his violin. The U.S. president stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba, restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility and leaves many recent agreements between the two countries intact. However, it will tighten restrictions on Americans traveling to the Caribbean island, hurting the booming Cuban tourism industry and clamp down on U.S. business dealings with Cuba's military.  It is necessary to wait for the U.S. government to announce regulations that implement these measures before opining on their reach and depth,  Rodriguez said. Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez addresses a news conference in Vienna, Austria, June 19, 2017.Leonhard FoegerHe added, however, that they would inevitably hit U.S. companies and citizens by restricting their ability to invest in or travel to Cuba, while also hurting the Cuban people.  It will wreak economic damage not just on Cuba's state companies but also on the cooperatives and private sector workers,  he said.  Moody's Investor Service released a report on Monday saying the U.S. revision of its Cuban policy was  credit negative  for the island, coming at a time when the country was already suffering liquidity problems due to weakening economic support from its crisis-wracked ally Venezuela.

'On the contrary, these measures reinforce our patriotism, our dignity and our decision to defend national independence by all means,” he said. Meanwhile, the partial rollback of the detente would fall flat with the majority of Americans, who supported the normalization of relations with Cuba, and with whom the country would continue working, Rodriguez added. In response to Trump's demand to return fugitives sought by the United States, Rodriguez said Cuba considered them fighters for civil liberties.   These persons will not be returned to the United States,  he said.

Amtrak's push to repair Penn Station's infrastructure from July 10 through Sept. 1 will take three key tracks out of service and disrupt commutes across the region. New Jersey Transit Corp and the Long Island Rail Road both rent space and tracks from Amtrak.  I think the Long Island Rail Road should consider reducing the fares on those diverted trains,  Cuomo said on Monday.  That's only fair to the people who are taking those trains.  New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the LIRR, said last week that at least 9,600 customers would be diverted or otherwise affected each morning during the repairs. While officials said they would add hundreds of buses and other service alternatives, they said they were not planning to discount fares as NJ Transit is doing. Cuomo made his comments as he marked the opening of a new West End Concourse underneath what is slated to become the Moynihan Train Hall, a $1.6 billion project to transform the James A. Farley Post Office Building across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station into a waiting area for the LIRR and Amtrak. The concourse officially opened last week. On Friday, Cuomo said the financial agreement had closed between the state's development arm and builders Related Cos, Vornado Realty LP and Skanska AB. The private developers are putting up $630 million, with $230 million of the total transferred to the state last week as an upfront payment and annual payments for the remaining $400 million to come during the next 40 years.  The state will contribute $500 million in appropriations. Of the remaining $420 million, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will pay $150 million, Amtrak will pay $105 million, the MTA will pay $100 million, and a federal grant will cover $65 million.

During the 13-year study, more than half of the gun-related deaths were homicides, while 38 percent were suicides and 6 percent were fatalities from accidental gun injuries, researchers report in Pediatrics.  Each year, guns seriously wounded about 5,800 additional kids under 18.  “Firearm injuries are a leading cause of death among U.S. children aged 1 to 17 years and contribute substantially each year to premature death, illness and disability of children,” said lead study author Katherine Fowler of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.  “About 19 children a day die or are medically treated in an emergency department for a gunshot wound in the U.S.,” Fowler said by email.  Although accidental firearm deaths among children declined from 2002 to 2014 and gun-related homicides decreased from 2007 to 2014, suicides surged 60 percent from 2007 to 2014, the analysis of national injury records found.  Boys account for 82 percent of all child firearm deaths, and black children have the highest rates of firearm mortality overall due to much higher firearm homicide rates. About four black children out of every 100,000 die from gunshot homicides, ten times higher than the rate for white, Asian or Pacific Islander kids, the study found. “It is important to note that firearm injuries and especially deaths are typically not isolated events,” said Alex Piquero, a criminology researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas who wasn’t involved in the study. “They often tend to co-occur with other crimes, whether gang-related, drug involved or other serious criminal activities, and for many of these crimes boys tend to be overrepresented compared to girls,” Piquero said by email. “Crime – especially violence, poverty and related adverse contextual circumstances – are unfortunate characteristics that are common to inner city areas that are overrepresented by minority residents.” For younger children, homicides often occurred in the context of domestic violence, a conflict between intimate partners or other family members. Among older kids, homicides typically happened during disputes with their peers, the study also found. Suicides often occurred in the context of stressful circumstances or relationship problems with a boyfriend, girlfriend or family member. White children, American Indian and Native Alaskan children were four to five times more likely to die by suicide than other kids.  If kids didn’t have guns, the impulse to kill themselves might pass before they acted on it, said Dr. Eliot Nelson, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital in Burlington.  “Too many people assume that if (youngsters) didn’t have a gun they’d use something else, but the quick lethality of guns makes them especially dangerous for an impulsive teen whose moment of crisis might pass with a little time,” Nelson said by email.  “Other methods are harder to use or more likely to be survivable, such as an overdose,” Nelson added.  Accidental gun deaths, meanwhile, almost always happened in the context of children playing with firearms.  All gun deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say.  “Children are curious, and research tells us that they know more about the location of guns in the home than parents might assume,” said Dr. Ruth Abaya of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.  “Simply instructing kids about safe handling is not sufficiently protective,” Abaya, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Guns ideally should be stored outside the home, she said, but if they are in the home they should be unloaded, locked, and in a gun safe.  Parents also shouldn’t underestimate how witnessing gun violence influences kids, said Joan Reid, a researcher at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Living in communities marred by violence that seems to be inevitable and unavoidable, some come to view gun carrying as a defensive strategy, adopting the belief that gun carrying can keep them safer,” Reid said by email. “However, we know that carrying a gun increases the likelihood of youth being injured or dying by gun violence.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sinXYE Pediatrics, online June 19, 2017.

I urge you to exercise your legal authority to remove the holdover Wells Fargo board members,  Warren, who has championed consumer rights and is seen as a possible 2020 presidential candidate, wrote in a letter to the U.S. central bank. Warren said the Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, had the right to take such action when a lender had assumed too much risk, which she said applied in the case of Wells Fargo, the third largest U.S. bank. Warren is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. Wells Fargo's reputation was damaged last year after revelations that employees had created as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts to hit aggressive sales targets set by management. In April of this year, investors voted to back the Wells Fargo board by a narrow margin. A Fed spokesman said the central bank had received Warren's letter on Monday and planned to respond. Wells Fargo said on Monday it had already taken steps to recover from its crisis and hold executives accountable.  That work continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future,  a company spokeswoman said.

The fact of the matter is the president has not been and is not under investigation,  Jay Sekulow, a new member of Trump's legal team, said on CBS'  Face the Nation  in one of four interviews he gave on Sunday. There have been multiple news reports and a tweet from Trump himself on Friday that began with:  I am being investigated.  Challenged on  Fox News Sunday  about the issue, Sekulow said he could not be certain Trump was not under investigation but that no one had notified the legal team if that was the case.  It is common for subjects of federal investigations not to know they are under scrutiny, especially in the initial phases.  A source familiar with the Mueller probe said on Thursday that investigators would have to gather a large amount of evidence before an interview with the president would be warranted.  Trump, who has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, has frequently lashed out about the allegations, which have overshadowed his administration's efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs. Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe the Russia matter, is investigating whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election. The source familiar with the Mueller probe told Reuters that Mueller was also examining whether Trump or others tried to interfere with the investigation. 'Cannot Read Mind' of Special Prosecutor Sekulow said that Trump, in his tweet, was reacting to a story in the Washington Post, which was the first to report  Mueller was examining whether Trump had tried to obstruct the probe by firing FBI Director James Comey in May. U.S. President Donald Trump walks to the White House in Washington, U.S. following his arrival from Camp David June 18, 2017.Eric ThayerSekulow acknowledged that he could not be certain that the report was false.  I cannot read the mind of the special prosecutor,  he said.  Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Mueller team, declined to comment. Sekulow, a conservative activist and radio talk-show host, earlier this month joined Trump's legal team, which is led by Marc Kasowitz.  Sekulow has publicly criticized Comey, whom Trump fired.  In addition to being the author of several books such as  Undemocratic: How unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats are stealing your liberty and freedom,  Sekulow is the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a politically conservative Christian organization. Barak Cohen, a former Justice Department lawyer and now a defense attorney specializing in white-collar crime and investigations, said there was no requirement that the special counsel notify Trump he was under investigation, so the lack of such notice meant nothing. He said, however, that Sekulow’s comments could mean the White House was taking the position that no investigation exists until Mueller’s team officially confirms it, disregarding media reports based on anonymous sourcing. Cohen said the first official communication that a target is under investigation typically comes when prosecutors begin requesting documents and other evidence. At that time, defense lawyers often will ask about their clients’ status. Prosecutors will often answer then to avoid misleading the target. They may not answer if they are trying to build a case and develop further evidence.  No answer is probably the most troubling answer in criminal defense,” Cohen said.

The S&P; technology sector is coming off its second straight weekly decline, triggered by fears of stretched valuations and investors moving money to other sectors. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's 9.4 percent rally this year. Apple rose 2.5 percent, providing the biggest boost to the three major sectors. Facebook and Alphabet were also higher. The tech sector's 1.37 percent rise led the gainers on the S&P; 500, putting it on track for its biggest one-day percentage rise since March.  Some of it is folks taking a second-look at names that may have been unduly punished in the rotation out of tech that started about 10 days ago,  said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York.  There has been no change in the fundamentals for the tech sector. Earnings growth, earnings revisions and forward looking indicators remain healthy.  At 12:47 p.m. ET (1647 GMT), the Dow was up 115.2 points, or 0.54 percent, at 21,499.48, the S&P; 500 was up 17.37 points, or 0.71 percent, at 2,450.52. The Nasdaq Composite was up 75.64 points, or 1.23 percent, at 6,227.39. While the tech sector is at the high end of its valuation, Lefkowitz said they were nowhere near the bubble territory of the 90s. The S&P; tech sector is trading at about 18.7 times forward earnings, compared with the historical 10-year average of 14.5, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy. Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy following a set of weak U.S. economic data. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,808 to 1,049. On the Nasdaq, 1,888 issues rose and 916 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 49 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 99 new highs and 87 new lows.

Black said that he only watched the original film after being cast in the follow-up. He described Williams as a  genius  who was  at the peak of his powers  in the movie. The original  Jumanji  saw Williams play a man who escapes from captivity inside a magical jungle-themed board game. The new film sees that premise reversed, with the lead characters journeying into the game's fantastical world.  In this one we actually travel with the characters into the jungle and it’s gorgeous and treacherous and exciting , Black told Reuters.

The deal, which was mediated by the Roman Catholic Sant' Egidio peace group and signed at their headquarters in Rome, calls for an immediate end to hostilities and recognition of the results of last year's presidential elections. The country has been plagued by inter-religious and inter-communal conflict since 2013, when the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, prompting reprisals from the anti-Balaka militia, many of whose fighters are nominally Christian. The Sant' Egidio group, which is backed by the Vatican and Italy, negotiated the end of the civil war in Mozambique in 1992 during secret negotiations in Rome and has been trying to broker peace in Central African Republic for months. Political crises have regularly rocked the country and tit-for-tat violence is on the rise again despite last year's presidential election that was aimed at ending the bloodshed. In two weeks in May, fighting between militia groups killed about 300 people and displaced 100,000, the worst bout of displacements since 2013. Around 2.2 million people, about half the population, need humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.. A local radio station said on Monday that as recently as this weekend attacks had been carried out in Yalinga in the country's diamond-rich east. Reuters could not immediately verify the information. Some expressed scepticism that the deal would hold.  They signed this document in the context of serious violence that is continuing in the east of the country,  said Lewis Mudge, African Researcher at Human Rights Watch.  To me, it reads like a first step . Philippe Barga, a 40-year-old mason in Bangui, complained that rebel leaders had not kept their word in the past.  It is those who sign them who don't respect them. I don't believe in this deal,  he told Reuters. The five-page accord, which was signed for the government by Foreign Minister Charles Armel Doubane, calls for the free movement of non-governmental organizations. The armed militia that did not attend the Rome meetings was one of the smaller ones, the  Retour Reclamation et Rehabilitation  or 3R, Sant' Egidio negotiators said. They added that its absence was due to logistical problems and that the other signatories were confident that they would be able to convince the group to join the pact.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar had still not received any demands from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which severed relations two weeks ago, triggering the worst Gulf Arab crisis in years. The countries accuse Qatar of supporting Islamist militants and stirring up unrest, charges Doha denies.  Qatar is under blockade, there is no negotiation. They have to lift the blockade to start negotiations,  Sheikh Mohammed told reporters in Doha.  Until now we didn't see any progress about lifting the blockade, which is the precondition for anything to move forward.  He said Kuwait's ruler was the sole mediator in the crisis and that he was waiting for specific demands from Gulf states in order to take resolution efforts forward.  We cannot just have (vague) demands such as 'the Qataris know what we want from them, they have to stop this or that, they have to be monitored by a foreign monitoring mechanism,'  Sheikh Mohammed said. Anything that relates to the affairs of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council is subject to negotiation, he said, referring to the body comprising Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman.  Anything not related to them is not subject to negotiation. No one has the right to interfere in my affairs. Al Jazeera is Qatar's affairs, Qatari foreign policy on regional issues is Qatar's affairs. And we are not going to negotiate on our own affairs,  he said. Qatar's Gulf critics have accused Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected those accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. The crisis has hit civilian travel, some food imports, ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf and sown confusion among businesses. But it has not affected energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar would rely on other states if the boycott continued, including Saudi Arabia's arch regional foe Iran.  We have a back-up plan which depends mainly on Turkey, Kuwait and Oman,  he said.  Iran has facilitated for us the sky passages for our aviation and we are cooperating with all countries that can ensure supplies for Qatar.

The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said.  Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals.  Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals.  Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts.  With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less.  But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way.  Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said.  “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-smokers-vaping-idUSKBN19A2FD"},

LHP Jason Vargas became the first AL pitcher to win 10 games this season with a grinding six-inning effort against the Angels on Sunday. He was touched for two runs in the first inning but settled down and limited the Angels whenever they tried to rally. In the sixth, he loaded the bases on two hits and a walk, but got Danny Espinosa to pop out, retired Ben Revere on a sacrifice fly and Juan Graterol on a foul pop.

Faria struck out nine, walked one and gave up six hits in seven innings.  He quieted a very potent lineup down,  manager Kevin Cash said.  He creates a lot of deception.

Norris is sharing catching time with Jesus Sucre at the moment but with C Wilson Ramos coming off the disabled list soon there will be an alteration of how things play out behind the plate.

I felt good. Felt sharp. A couple pitches I would've liked to have back, but I felt like it was coming out of my hand clean. My mechanics felt good. A couple execution problems, but I felt fine.  SS Jordy Mercer was 1-for-3 with his sixth homer, a solo shot that he lined into the left-field seats for Pittsburgh's only run.  He hung that ball -- a slider or a curveball or whatever it was,  Mercer said of Chicago starter John Lackey.  Those are good to backspin. Those balls can go a long ways at times. I was able to just get underneath it.  I hit it on a line but I didn't think it was going to go out.  C Chris Stewart was reinstated from the 10-day DL but did not play. He went on the DL May 30 because of a left hamstring strain. Stewart is 9-for-37 (.243) in 12 starts, with one error this season. However, Pittsburgh could have a tough decision to make with Stewart. No. 3 C Elias Diaz has sparkled with Stewart and C Francisco Cervelli injured at times this season. Manager Clint Hurdle said the Pirates don't want to keep three catchers for long, but said,  It's awful hard to send down Diaz right now, based on his performance.

Bell has made seven appearances for Detroit over two stints with the club and has been scored upon in just two of his appearances. He was recalled and pitched June 13 against Arizona, hurling 3 2/3 shutout inning and allowing four hits, before Sunday, when he pitched 4 2/3 innings and gave up a pair of solo home runs in his last inning of work.  He's not going to throw shutout innings through September,  manager Brad Ausmus said of the home runs.  But I'm not worried about it.  DH Alex Avila continues to have a productive season for the Tigers. Avila, used as the designated hitter Sunday to keep his bat in the lineup, had two singles plus a walk for his day's work. He'll probably play nearly every day, except possibly against a tough left-hander, with regular DH Victor Martinez on the disabled list with an irregular heartbeat. Avila will catch most of the time but also could play at first as well as DH. RHP Buck Farmer, whose spot in the rotation looked so solid two starts back, came up with a second straight clunker Sunday and was optioned back to Triple-A Toledo after the game. Farmer gave up seven runs to Tampa Bay on three home runs -- a two-run shot to 1B Logan Morrison in the second, a solo blast by C Derek Norris in the third plus a grand slam by RF Steven Souza Jr. in the same inning. Detroit brought back RHP Anibal Sanchez for a 'show me' start Monday so he'll take Farmer's spot for at least one turn.  Big league hitters are tough,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  A lot of them have been here for close to 10 years. They're a lot more adept at taking advantage of mistakes. You might get by a couple times, making mistakes, but they'll take advantage eventually.  1B Miguel Cabrera was pulled after seven innings Sunday to give him a few minutes of rest. He'll be back in the starting lineup Monday in Seattle. Cabrera's seventh home run of the season Saturday broke a tie with Carl Yastrzemski and put him nine home runs shy of Jose Canseco and Adam Dunn, who share the 35th spot all-time. DH Victor Martinez will remain in Detroit while the Tigers are on their week-long road trip but manager Brad Ausmus is expressing some optimism his cleanup hitter will be able to return fairly soon after that.  This isn't a classic baseball DL situation,  Ausmus said,  so I don't want to speak out of turn. The doctors think that about after a week he might be able to do cardio-type activity, light cardio-type activity. I'm guessing it's going to a tolerated (thing) after that. I think we're just going to wait to see how he's doing when we get back from the road trip. And if he gets the doctors' clearance and he feels OK he might start hitting again. I would classify hitting as light cardio activity.  RHP Anibal Sanchez will be recalled Monday from his voluntary assignment to Triple-A Toledo so he can start Monday night at Seattle against the Mariners.  He accepted that assignment to go pitch in Toledo so he could take another shot at starting,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  So we're going to see. He's been throwing the ball well. Good changeup. Velocity's been up to 93.  The insertion of Sanchez (0-0, 9.00 ERA) for his first start of the season will give Detroit's starters an extra day of rest. Where Sanchez fits will be determined by how he fares in his Monday start. The bullpen hasn't worked out for Sanchez, so starting, a trade or getting designated for assignment are the most likely options.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6JT0LP5Z"},

I urge you to exercise your legal authority to remove the holdover Wells Fargo board members,  Warren, who has championed consumer rights and is seen as a possible 2020 presidential candidate, wrote in a letter to the U.S. central bank. Warren said the Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, had the right to take such action when a lender had assumed too much risk, which she said applied in the case of Wells Fargo, the third largest U.S. bank. Warren is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. Wells Fargo's reputation was damaged last year after revelations that employees had created as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts to hit aggressive sales targets set by management. In April of this year, investors voted to back the Wells Fargo board by a narrow margin. A Fed spokesman said the central bank had received Warren's letter on Monday and planned to respond. Wells Fargo said on Monday it had already taken steps to recover from its crisis and hold executives accountable.  That work continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future,  a company spokeswoman said. The Fed has removed members of bank holding companies' boards in the past.

(NBG), Alpha Bank AE (Alpha), Piraeus Bank S.A. (Piraeus) and Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (Eurobank) at 'Restricted Default' (RD). At the same time the agency has upgraded the four Greek banks' Viability Ratings (VRs) to 'ccc' from 'f'. A full list of rating actions is available in the related Rating Action Report. This rating action follows a periodic review of Greek banks' ratings. Their IDRs were downgraded to 'RD' on 29 June 2015 following the imposition of restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits after large outflows from the banks in 1H15. The upgrade of the VRs reflects the banks' improved liquidity and Fitch's expectation that the completion of the second review of Greece's third economic adjustment programme reduces political risks and will strengthen depositor and investor confidence in the Greek banking system. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT The banks' IDRs of 'RD' reflect Fitch's view that the Greek banks are defaulting on a material part of their senior obligations given that capital controls, through restrictions on deposit withdrawals, are still in place in Greece. Full lifting of capital controls is unlikely in the short term in Fitch's view, but we expect gradual steps towards capital controls relaxation and in particular, gradual removal of restrictions on deposit withdrawals. The roadmap published by the Greek Ministry of Finance in May 2017 outlines preconditions for such steps, which include improvements in economic environment and confidence indicators, inflows of deposits into the banking system and strengthening of the banks' liquidity and market access. We expect some form of relaxation of withdrawal restrictions may follow the conclusion of the second review, for example, a further increase in the withdrawal limits (currently EUR840 per account per fortnight) or in limits on transfers abroad. We however do not expect such relaxation to be significant enough at this stage to affect the banks' IDRs. The banks' long-term senior unsecured debt ratings, including those on the debt programmes of their issuing vehicles, have been affirmed at 'C'/'RR6' (Recovery Rating). The ratings reflect exceptionally high levels of credit risk, because of poor recovery prospects in the event of the default on senior debt obligations, due to the banks' weak asset quality, high levels of preferred liabilities (comprising mainly insured deposits) and high asset encumbrance. VRs The upgrade of the banks' VRs mainly reflects the banks' improved, albeit still weak, liquidity. It also reflects our expectation that successful completion of the second bailout review will reduce political risks, improve confidence and facilitate stronger deposit growth in 2H17. The VRs still reflect that the banks' capacity for continued operation is highly vulnerable to deterioration in the business and economic environment. This is driven by our view that confidence in the banking system remains fragile and is still highly sensitive to political developments. The VRs also reflect the Greek banks' exceptionally weak asset quality and high capital encumbrance by unreserved problem loans. The Greek banking system recorded in total around EUR6 billion of deposit inflows in Greece since the imposition of capital controls to end-April 2017, of which half were private sector deposits. Almost all of the inflows occurred since end-May 2016, following the completion of the first bailout review and the relaxation of capital controls in July 2016. The agreement on conclusion of the second bailout review and disbursement of around EUR8.5 billion of bailout funds reached between Greece and its creditors on 15 June 2017 should pave the way for further improvement in confidence. We expect this will result in further deposit growth, particularly since new money coming into the banking system is not subject to deposit withdrawal restrictions. The banks are still reliant on central bank funding, in particular on Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). The reinstatement in June 2016 of the waiver allowing the ECB to accept Greek government bonds as collateral in regular refinancing operations, the inflow of deposits and improved access to the secured interbank market helped the banks reduce their aggregate ELA funding by EUR23 billion or over 35% in the 12 months to end-March 2017. Reliance on ELA remains significant however, ranging from around 7% to around 19% of end-March total assets. Fitch estimates that at end-March 2017, the banks' liquidity buffers, comprising cash and equivalents and collateral that can be pledged to obtain ELA funding, covered around 13%-24% of total deposits across the four banks. We believe this should allow the banks to withstand a moderate liquidity stress, considering recent and expected deposit trends. The political and economic environment in Greece remains fragile, however, and we expect the banks' funding and liquidity profiles will remain highly sensitive to depositor and investor sentiment. Asset quality is poor, with non-performing exposures (NPEs) ranging 38%-54% of gross loans at end-March 2017. Weak asset quality and moderate coverage of problem loans result in high capital encumbrance, with unreserved NPEs equal to 1.3x-2.1x of the banks' end-2016 common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. The banks are pursuing ambitious targets to reduce the stock of NPEs in Greece by roughly 40% by end-2019. However, the bulk of the NPE reduction is back-loaded at some banks, and meeting the targets will require a stable operating environment and well-functioning markets for foreclosed assets and non-performing loans. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Greek banks' Support Ratings of '5' and Support Rating Floors of 'No Floor' highlight our view that support from the state cannot be relied upon, given Greece's limited resources and the implementation of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES - Eurobank and Alpha The 'C/RR6' ratings on Eurobank's (ISINs DE000A0DZVJ6, XS0234821345, XS0440371903 and XS0232848399) and Alpha's (ISIN DE000A0DX3M2) preferred securities issued through their funding vehicles reflect exceptionally high credit risk and poor recovery prospects. The banks' preferred securities are currently non-performing. STATE-GUARANTED DEBT - Eurobank and NBG Fitch affirmed Eurobank's government-guaranteed debt and assigned a long-term rating to NBG's. These are senior unsecured instruments that benefit from a full guarantee from the Greek State. Fitch rates government-guaranteed debt at 'CCC', at the higher of the senior unsecured debt ratings of the issuer (C for both Eurobank and NBG) and the guarantor's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR (CCC for Greece). We believe that these guaranteed programmes and issues will be treated equally with other obligations of the Greek State. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT An upgrade of the banks' IDRs would require a significant relaxation of deposit withdrawal restrictions. Ratings of senior unsecured debt are mainly sensitive to the level of asset encumbrance. A significant shift of funding from secured debt to unsecured facilities could result in an upgrade of senior unsecured debt ratings. VRs An upgrade of the VRs is unlikely in the near term and would require an upgrade of Greece's 'CCC' sovereign rating, an extended record of economic recovery and political stability, significant reductions of banks' NPEs and capital encumbrance by unreserved problem loans, and further improvements in the banks' funding and liquidity profiles through deposit growth and reduction and eventual elimination of ELA reliance. The VRs could be downgraded if depositor and investor confidence weakens, compromising the banks' already weak liquidity profiles, or if capitalisation materially deteriorates. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Any upgrade of Support Ratings and upward revisions of Support Rating Floors would be contingent on a positive change in Greece's ability and propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely in Fitch's view. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES - Eurobank and Alpha Ratings of preferred securities issued, respectively, by Eurobank and Alpha could be upgraded if the securities return to performing status and if there is a multi-notch upgrade of, respectively, Eurobank's and Alpha's VR. STATE-GUARANTED DEBT - Eurobank and NBG Ratings of Eurobank's and NBG's state-guaranteed debt are sensitive to Greece's sovereign rating. CRITERIA VARIATION The analysis includes a variation from Fitch's  Global Bank Rating Criteria , which state that a bank's Long-Term IDR will only be assigned below the VR in limited circumstances when constrained by the Country Ceiling. Although Greece's Country Ceiling of 'B-' does not directly constrain the banks' IDRs, the legal restrictions on deposit withdrawals mean the IDRs remain at 'Restricted Default'. As such, Fitch has varied its criteria to permit a VR higher than 'f' to be assigned whilst still maintaining a Long-Term IDR of 'RD'.

The world's largest aviation meeting usually takes place in a blur of champagne and jet fuel as aerospace giants celebrate multibillion-dollar deals under eye-popping flying displays.  This year, the tone appears more frugal. ⁠⁠⁠ Everybody is making savings this year. The teams have been asked to cut back a little on anything that might appear futile,  an official with a French defense company said. Elsewhere, Airbus is cutting back on hospitality and cultivating a mood of austerity as it slashes spending after combining its headquarters and main planemaking division. It has halved the 800-900 staff attending previous shows, officials said. Boeing also set limits on staff attendance. Some delegates said Airbus was striking a more cautious image amid a sweeping ethics review.  Everything is about compliance,  said one insider. For all but the top VIPs, the France-based company's traditional gourmet lunches are being replaced by finger food, and refreshments are mostly of the non-indulgent variety.  We'll be gone by Tuesday,  quipped one disgruntled executive at the start of the June 19-25 event.  Organisers said many companies had cut chalet space. That is partly because the number of exhibitors has risen, but it also reflects leaner times across the industry. Exhibition halls were also noticeably less stocked with trade show promotional materials, delegates said. It is not the first time air show hospitality has been placed on the back burner. In 2010, champagne was banned from some facilities as U.S. arms firms cut back on anything that might suggest frills and perks to Pentagon planners and others weighing big defense cuts. This year, defense spending is on the rise again and chalets of arms firms are humming with activity. But the civil side of the aerospace industry is hunkering down to produce planes as cheaply as possible after a multi-year order boom. Although Boeing launched a new version of its 737 jet on Monday, overall commercial orders are expected to be down after planemakers filled their order books in previous shows.

Shares of miner Vale SA added the most points to Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index, tracking iron ore futures higher.     Embraer SA was the biggest gainer on the Bovespa as traders bet on fresh orders for the jetmaker at the start of the Paris Airshow, the global aviation industry's biggest event.      Still, concerns remained that a mounting political scandal may further hamper the implementation of President Michel Temer's reform agenda, curbing investor demand for higher-risk Brazilian assets.     Temer on Saturday pledged to sue billionaire businessman Joesley Batista, the founder of meatpacker JBS SA, strongly rebuffing his accusations that he led a corruption scheme in which politicians squeezed high-profile executives for bribe.      Shares of JBS dropped 3.4 percent, leading losses on the Bovespa index.     The Brazilian real weakened as much as 0.8 percent amid the political uncertainty before paring losses to around 0.2 percent.     The Mexican peso also slipped as traders booked gains from a recent rally that last week drove it to a thirteen-month peak against the dollar, while the country's S&P;/BVM IPC stock index followed crude prices lower.

France's blue-chips gained nearly 1 percent after President Emmanuel Macron cemented an overwhelming parliamentary majority, further increasing his party's capacity to push through reforms. Banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole underpinned gains on the index.  Markets are celebrating the fact the Macron government has been strengthened by this outcome,  said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  Planned reforms could enhance the growth potential of the country and reduce the structural deficit, something which would lift French GDP going forward,  he said. Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding said France could become the strongest major economy in Europe in a decade. He said this would outclass  a Germany that is resting on its laurels and a UK that is impairing its long-term growth prospects by losing (some of) its preferential access to its major market, the EU,  Schmieding said. Britain began negotiations on Monday to leave the European Union. Euro zone blue-chips closed 0.9 percent higher, as did the pan-European STOXX 600. The retail sector, particularly grocers, which were sent into a tailspin on Friday after Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods, bounced back, partly on hopes of more deal activity in the sector. The regional retail index, which suffered its worst week in 16 months last week, rose 0.8 percent. Britain's Ocado soared more than 11 percent, the top-performing stock across the region. Exane upgraded Ocado to  outperform  on hopes that partnerships, if not a takeout, were more likely. Analysts at the French broker said Amazon's progress could be hemmed in the short term by the limitations of the store pick model - in which employees pick online orders from the store floor rather than in distribution centres.  We're minded to not overreact therefore, but the deal is still bad news for the sector, we think, unless of course you are a target,  they added.  Ocado might not be a target but the probability of a partnership just increased materially.  Dutch healthcare technology firm Philips jumped to a 15-year high after The Times reported activist hedge fund Third Point was building a stake in the company. Also, in notable broker activity, Credit Suisse found favour among analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citi and Deutsche Bank. Citi named Credit Suisse its preferred Swiss bank, while Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage on the stock with an  outperform.  Credit Suisse shares rose 3.4 percent. Formal Brexit negotiations got under way on Monday with Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, though this did not ruffle market sentiment in the short-term.

The world's largest aviation meeting usually takes place in a blur of champagne and jet fuel as aerospace giants celebrate multibillion-dollar deals under eye-popping flying displays. This year, the tone appears more frugal. ⁠⁠⁠ Everybody is making savings this year. The teams have been asked to cut back a little on anything that might appear futile,  an official with a French defence company said. Elsewhere, Airbus is cutting back on hospitality and cultivating a mood of austerity as it slashes spending after combining its headquarters and main planemaking division. It has halved the 800-900 staff attending previous shows, officials said. Boeing also set limits on staff attendance. Some delegates said Airbus was striking a more cautious image amid a sweeping ethics review.  Everything is about compliance,  said one insider. For all but the top VIPs, the France-based company's traditional gourmet lunches are being replaced by finger food, and refreshments are mostly of the non-indulgent variety.  We'll be gone by Tuesday,  quipped one disgruntled executive at the start of the June 19-25 event. Organisers said many companies had cut chalet space. That is partly because the number of exhibitors has risen, but it also reflects leaner times across the industry. Exhibition halls were also noticeably less stocked with trade show promotional materials, delegates said. It is not the first time air show hospitality has been placed on the back burner. In 2010, champagne was banned from some facilities as U.S. arms firms cut back on anything that might suggest frills and perks to Pentagon planners and others weighing big defence cuts. This year, defence spending is on the rise again and chalets of arms firms are humming with activity. But the civil side of the aerospace industry is hunkering down to produce planes as cheaply as possible after a multi-year order boom. Although Boeing launched a new version of its 737 jet on Monday, overall commercial orders are expected to be down after planemakers filled their order books in previous shows.

It’s no secret that we expect to find this weekend tricky,  he said in a team preview of the race in Baku, round eight of the Formula One season.  After the power unit issues it’s likely we’ll need to take penalties, and the nature of the narrow, fast straights and tight corners means overtaking is generally tough,  added the Spaniard.  However, it’s certainly not impossible, and we’ll keep fighting as we always do.  Alonso, a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006, retired in Canada on June 12 due to a power unit failure while running in 10th place. He said at the time that  we will start last probably in Baku.  McLaren, 12-times constructors' world champions and the second most successful team in Formula One in terms of race wins, are last in the current championship and the only ones yet to score a point. They have taken a string of grid penalties due to exceeding their allocation of power units, with Alonso failing to start in Russia after the car broke down on the formation lap. In Bahrain, Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne had been unable to start.   The team ramped up their criticism of Honda before the Montreal race and have indicated they are looking at other options for the future.    In Canada we were unable to fulfill any potential we showed during the weekend, and we anticipate that in Baku we will face a similar challenge due to the demands this circuit’s characteristics place on the car,  said McLaren's Racing Director Eric Boullier.

Like the Yemen war, which has killed more than 10,000 people, the rift with Qatar is most closely associated with a new generation of leaders in the energy-rich Gulf who are more hawkish than conservative predecessors given more to cautious, consensual policymaking. While the dispute could end up costing Qatar dearly, it also has implications for the Saudis and Emiratis whose activism, critics say, is fuelling uncertainty in an already unstable neighborhood and could even push the region towards all-out conflict with arch-enemy Iran. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar two weeks ago, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in other countries' affairs and cozying up to Iran, all of which Qatar denies. Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have been fruitless. The new muscular policy is embodied in two powerful young leaders: 31-year-old Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the 56-year-old crown prince of Abu Dhabi. They stand in contrast to previous Gulf Arab leaders who over decades weathered crises mostly by time-consuming conciliation. Their rival is also young: Qatar's ruling Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani took over from his father in 2013 at 33, inheriting a high-profile foreign policy that has seen his rich but tiny country exert outsized influence in the region.  The rules of the game seem to have changed. The values governing interfamilial relations in the Gulf have changed,  said Mamoun Fandy, a London-based political analyst.  We are now talking about young people. I don't think it will get resolved soon.  Prince Mohammed, Sheikh Mohammed Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed, widely referred to as  MbS , runs economic, defense and oil strategy and has a direct line to the king, his 81-year-old father. In a kingdom ruled by six brothers in succession, he and his cousin the crown prince are the first from a new generation to reach the highest ranks of power in 64 years. He is spearheading an ambitious drive to reform the kingdom's oil-dependent economy and led the charge into Yemen in 2015 to oppose a takeover by Iran-aligned fighters from the Houthi movement. But after months of bombings, no side has emerged dominant in a war that has displaced more than three million people, left many on the edge of starvation and allowed a powerful al Qaeda branch to expand its operations. Now MbS appears to have orchestrated the Qatar move just days after pulling off a summit in Riyadh where U.S. President Donald Trump called for bold action.  It has his emerging hallmark of action that is sudden, spectacular but not necessarily strategic,  said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at Chatham House.  It is a maximalist position without a clear endgame.      FILE PHOTO: Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (L), Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and UAE's deputy commander-in-chief of the armed forces attends a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, March 24, 2016.Alexander Nemenov/Pool/File Photo MbS  gets on well with Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mohammed, the deputy supreme commander of UAE armed forces, who is known as  MbZ . The Saudi prince's entourage happily concedes they see much to emulate in the UAE's successful diversification of its economy beyond oil. MbZ has long espoused a hard line against Qatar and Iran, which seems to be rubbing off on MbS, who has ratcheted up the rhetoric. Last month MbS ruled out dialogue with Iran and pledged to protect Saudi Arabia from what he called Tehran's efforts to dominate the Muslim world. In blunt remarks, he said any struggle for influence between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and the revolutionary Shi'ite theocracy ought to take place  inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia . Following twin attacks in Tehran earlier this month for which Iran's Revolutionary Guards blamed Saudi Arabia, Iran's foreign minister called those comments  a direct threat and a dangerous provocation . Riyadh and its allies  are no longer risk averse,  Chas Freeman, former U.S. Ambassador to Riyadh, said.  They were prudent, cautious to a fault. Now they are prepared to throw their weight around.  Inside Qatar Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim weathered a smaller dispute with Gulf neighbors in 2014. He pledged to distinguish himself from his more overtly anti-Saudi father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who took power in a palace coup in 1995 and crafted Qatar's independent-minded foreign policy before stepping down in favor of his young son four years ago. But Sheikh Tamim has continued to embrace maverick positions, cultivating relationships with Islamist movements like the Afghan Taliban and Palestinian Hamas in pursuit of leverage. Saudi Arabia and its allies appear willing to use all means short of armed force to rein in Qatar, but the brittle mood has stirred worries about the possibility of violence. Over the decades, Gulf states have sparred among themselves, mostly rhetorically, over border demarcation or foreign policy. In 1992, clashes on the Saudi-Qatari border led to several deaths. This time, say analysts, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are unhappy with what they consider the continued influence of Sheikh Hamad, including at Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab satellite TV network they accuse of interfering in other countries' affairs. If Sheikh Tamim gives too much ground, he could face a challenge from inside his family. But if he remains defiant, royals may start grumbling as well.  That might look less like a coup than a disgruntled board changing a CEO who is no longer making the company profits,  said a Western diplomat in the region. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi say they have made clear what they expect of Doha, but it is far from certain that Sheikh Tamim will simply comply. Unlike Yemen, already desperately poor before the war, Qatar is plugged into the global economy, with the world's highest income per capita. The top liquefied natural gas exporter hosts the region's biggest U.S. military base, and boasts investments that include the Empire State Building, the London Shard and Harrods. Transit disruptions pose a major threat to business, and there is even some talk that the boycott could eventually target Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup.  The unintended consequences of this can go out of control,  said Fandy, the analyst.  It serves no one's purpose that this is pushed to its limits.

This would be the biggest deal yet for the stealthy F-35 jet, set to make its Paris Airshow debut this week.  The sale represents a major shift in sales practices from annual purchases to more economic multi-year deals that lower the cost of each jet.      The pricing of the jets was still not final, although the average price of the 440 jets was expected to be $85 million, the people said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly. The multi-year deal for the fighters will consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.     A Lockheed representative said the U.S. company does not discuss negotiations on contracts and said any deal involving a  block buy  would be announced by the U.S. government. A representative for the customers including the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Last week, representatives from 11 F-35 customer nations met in Baltimore, Maryland to discuss terms and toured a Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) facility in Maryland that provides equipment for the jet. Those nations included Australia,  Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States. The memorandum of understanding being negotiated between Lockheed and the customers aims to procure 135 or more jets in fiscal year 2018 for delivery in 2020 for about $88 million per jet, the people said.  In the subsequent fiscal years, 2019 and 2020, procurement would ramp up to 150 or more jets per year.     The average price in 2019 could be $85 million for the F-35  A  variant and could drop below $80 million in 2020, the people said. That would mark the lowest price ever paid for an F-35, making this deal an important step in reducing the overall cost of each jet.

Recently, a quarter of the operating F-35 fleet was grounded until further notice because of irregularities in the pilots' oxygen supplies. Reducing Costs The memorandum of understanding will guarantee contracts will take place in each successive future year. This allows the manufacturing group led by Lockheed to take advantage of greater economies of scale, reducing the cost of each jet. They have been working to reduce the cost of the jets through streamlining the supply chain and purchasing materials in bulk. Recently revised estimates indicate the U.S. Defence Department expects to spend $379 billion, down from $391 billion, to develop and buy 2,443 of the supersonic warplanes through 2039, one of the people said. Slideshow (2 Images) This is part of an ongoing process. If it gets done, it would be a plus for Lockheed, allowing for better long-term production management,  said Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research. The F-35 comes in three configurations, the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; the B-model, which can handle short take-offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and the British navy; and the carrier-variant F-35C jets. In February, the Pentagon agreed to a deal for the tenth batch of the fighter aircraft and agreed to pay below $95 million per jet for the first time, compared with $102 million in the previous purchase which was the lowest price up until that point.  Around that time the Pentagon said the price of a jet could fall 16 percent to around $80 million in future purchases.       The F-35 business accounts for about 37 percent of Lockheed's total revenue. During the first quarter, Lockheed's revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.1 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35. Lockheed executives have estimated that a multi-year deal will save about $2 billion for the nations that choose to participate in the multi-year purchase.     Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners, including Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain to fuel the production line in Fort Worth, Texas.

Although FCA Japan has already announced its intention to concentrate its resources on the Jeep brand ahead, no decisions have been made regarding (the) Chrysler brand,  the automaker said in a statement on Monday. A woman walks past a logo of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in Turin March 31, 2014.Giorgio PerottinoThe Nikkei business daily reported that the European-U.S. automaker, which also sells the Jeep, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Abarth brands in Japan, was close to deciding to throw in the towel on the Chrysler brand, which posted sales of less than 300 vehicles in 2016, having fallen steadily since around 2000. Sales of the brand in Japan have shrunk to roughly one-tenth of what they were a decade ago. At the moment, FCA sells only one Chrysler model in Japan, the full-sized 300s luxury sedan, which is sold at the company's Jeep dealerships. As its sales struggle, FCA's Fiat brand, which include smaller models, and its Jeep brand have been growing in the country. Last year they sold around 6,700 and 9,400 units, respectively, making them top 10-selling foreign branded vehicles in the Japanese market. Foreign cars comprise a small portion of the total Japanese auto market, which is dominated by domestic brands. Last year, 295,000 foreign branded new cars were sold in the country, roughly one-tenth of total new vehicle sales.

Francesca Bellettini, president and chief executive of the fashion house since September 2013, said the goal was to lift sales from 1.2 billion euros in 2016 to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the mid-term and 3 billion euros in the longer term. YSL also aims to raise its operating margin from 22 percent in 2016 to 25 percent mid-term, and 27 percent long-term.  This company was really a Ferrari. So we gave it the engine of a Ferrari and not the engine of a Cinquecento and now it will go as a Ferrari should go,  Bellettini told reporters at Yves Saint Laurent Investor Day. The company expects higher sales which will be spurred from a variety of measures including opening more stores, developing its eyewear, silk and jewelry categories, as well as more investment in digital businesses and travel retail. Other key moves have included giving more autonomy to the chief operating officers in each YSL division, and looking to focus more on local clients, who now make over 60 percent of the YSL brand's clientbase. Bellettini said YSL aimed to continue to outperform the broader luxury goods market, which Bain & Co expects will grow at an annual growth rate of 3-4 percent to reach 280 billion-290 billion euros in sales by 2020.

Belgian designer Anthony Vaccarello joined in April 2016, and he has sought to build on the success achieved under his predecessor, star designer Hedi Slimane. The YSL logo is seen on a Yves Saint Laurent product displayed at a perfume shop in Paris, November 15, 2013. For fashion houses, getting into skin care is more challenging than launching fragrances and make-up. Yves Saint Laurent's beauty business, owned by L'Oreal since 2008, launched an anti-ageing product last year which has had an encouraging start. The skin care line now makes up 8 percent of the brand's global beauty sales, which include perfume and make-up, according to Stephan Bezy, head of Yves Saint Laurent beauty products at L'Oreal.

Last year, YSL's revenues rose 25.5 percent on a comparable basis - its sixth consecutive year of above 20 percent growth - while recurring operating income jumped 59.3 percent. Western Europe acccounted for 38 percent of sales last year, Asia Pacific and North America 23 percent each, and Japan 9 percent. Bellettini said the plan was to increase the stores network to 200 from 159, opening 20 stores per year. In China alone, the number of stores could rise to 25-30 from 18. Overall, the YSL brand planned to spend 5 percent of its revenue on capital expenditures each year, said Bellettini, who added that YSL would also step up its E-Commerce push in order to capture more tech-savvy  Millennial  customers.

Moscovici said European countries were more conscious about the need to increase military spending and cooperation given growing threats, Britain's decision to leave the EU and a U.S. push to have NATO allies spend more on their own defences.  Everyone understands that now is the time for us to take our fate in our own hands,  the European Union official told reporters at the Paris Airshow.  There are new threats, and they know they cannot count - as they did in the past - only on NATO and a good relationship with the United States.  He underscored the importance of the aerospace sector for the European economy, and said he hoped a new EU fund aimed at funding cooperative work on drones, satellites and other military projects would be  a good incentive.  But he said the military realities needed to be matched by political will among member states, preferably soon, and then eventually commitments of resources.  There is now a window of opportunity for investing more in European defence ... but as with all windows, a window closes if you don't go through it,  he said.  We should seize this moment, especially with the election of a new French president.   We must stay at the technical frontier, and for that we need to invest constantly,  he said.  Consciousness is the first step. This has to start now. This has to be discussed.  Trump recently reassured European allies that he would uphold the NATO charter's demand that all members be prepared to defend each other, weeks after jarring allies by not restating U.S. support for the agreement. Germany and other European countries are boosting military spending, concerned about Russia's increasingly assertive military stance and a growing number of military conflicts around the world, but the increases are likely to be more gradual than dramatic. European industry executives at the air show said they were upbeat about future prospects, but it would take time for the attitude to translate into concrete orders.

The French cooperative group had initially forecast exports in the 2017/2018 campaign of 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes, up from 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes under EU quotas rules on output and exports. Those rules end in October.  We had prepared for 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes, we will likely have less,  Chief Executive Officer Alain Commissaire told Reuters. He said it was too early to give a precise estimate for production or exports from Cristal Union's 170,000 hectares of beet but the sugar content - a key factor for sugar producers - had been hit and could fall further if weather remained dry.  If we have the hot weather forecast for the next two weeks, we'll fall to 13 tonnes per hectare (t/ha) from 14 tonnes currently,  he said, after the firm had originally forecast sugar content of 15.5 t/ha at the start of the season. A further drop could be averted if rains arrived, he said. Lower output from Cristal Union and other EU producers could prompt forecasters to revise down estimates for a global sugar surplus this year that has kept ICE sugar prices near 16-months lows. This follow two years of sugar deficits. Forecasts for a surplus were partly driven by expectations of a jump in EU output as producers planted more beet to take advantage of an end to EU quotas. Cristal Union expanded its planting area by 25 percent from last year with the aim to harvest 17 million tonnes of sugar beet in 2017. Commissaire said some forecasters had predicted 4 million to 4.5 million tonnes of extra EU output, but he said  there may not even be 2 million tonnes more with what we are seeing now.  For now, forecasters expect the EU to produce 18.3 million tonnes of sugar in 2017/18, with exports of 2.7 million tonnes. The EU is the world's leading beet grower, with about 50 percent share. But beet sugar represents just 20 percent of world sugar output with the rest coming from cane, EU data show. The French cooperative group has made the Mediterranean basin a priority, mainly through partnerships with sugar distributors and refiners in the region. It operates in Italy, Algeria, Croatia, Greece, Spain.

Jan Egeland, who heads the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), welcomed election results in several European countries, saying voters must not allow politicians to demonize vulnerable people who had fled their homes. Egeland, a former United Nations humanitarian affairs chief and emergency relief coordinator, made his comments after the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the NRC released figures showing there were a record 65.6 million displaced people around the world, including 25.4 million refugees. The European and U.S. public had shown support for refugees in 2015, he said in an interview. However, the mood had shifted dramatically in 2016, the year when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, promising to build a wall on the Mexican border and to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the country.  Stories circulated that terrorism was associated with refugees, which is wrong. Populist politicians overwhelmed every other politician, who became timid beyond belief. We refugee workers were not able to hold our ground, so we lost the battle for public and political opinion,  Egeland said. Egeland saw the tide turning.  The negative, xenophobic populist wave of 2016, I see that ending now in 2017, and thankfully several of the elections in Europe have shown that.  He did not name any of the countries, but in the past year far-right anti-immigration candidates have lost elections in Austria, the Netherlands and France.  I think there will be also a correction in the United States - that decent normal people will not allow politicians to blame vulnerable women and children who are fleeing for all sorts of ills,  he added. Egeland, a 40-year veteran of humanitarian work, said Uganda had taken more refugees per day in the past year than many European countries accepted in 12 months. He also criticized some governments for trying to erect physical or other barriers, such as Australia's offshore detention centers on Pacific islands, against migrants.  All alarm bells should be going,  he said.  We have a world in great instability, and it's not going away because Europe and the United States and Australia are frantically building higher walls,  he said. Letting inequality fester was dangerous and destabilizing.  Tens of millions of youths will get the message that you will not really get a job, a legal residency, legal status, a family, a future,  he said.  What kind of signal is that, to tens of millions of youths that want to contribute to society? That's why we have to turn this around.

Twenty-eight refugees in Mae La camp have killed themselves and 66 have attempted suicide in the last two years, more than three times the global suicide rate, according to an IOM study published on the eve of World Refugee Day.  The number of suicides is very alarming, and we urgently need to address this,  said Harry Smith, IOM's project officer in Thailand.  There is a high level of distress in the camps which results from myriad reasons including lack of freedom of movement, uncertainty about the future, economic hardship and a lack of educational opportunities.  Mae La is the largest of nine refugee camps along the Thai­Myanmar border which are home to about 100,000 people. Many have spent their entire lives in the camps in what is one of Asia's most protracted refugee crises. There were 14 suicides in Mae La in the last year compared to one in the period June 2014 to May 2015. But the IOM said the jump could be due to a change in data collection. Men under 50 were most at risk, but one child had also taken his life and three had tried to. Nearly four in 10 deaths were from drinking weed-killer which is widely available in the camps where residents grow food. Family problems were a factor in nearly half of suicides. Alcohol and substance abuse played a role in more than a third.  IOM's recommendations included training aid workers in suicide prevention and setting up a family counseling unit. It also suggested deploying a psychiatrist and a counselor with expertise on suicide in the camp, and limiting access to herbicides.  Refugees in the camps are feeling increasingly uncertain of their future amid a fall in resettlement to third countries and a decrease in support from the international community. Most are ethnic Karen from eastern Myanmar who fled conflict and often persecution during decades of military rule. A civilian government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, took power last year. But Smith said many refugees were not confident of security if they returned, and worried about a lack of jobs and their children's education.

Merkel, who said it was already hard to organize fair tax competition in Europe, also announced plans for a Franco-German corporation tax reform. Speaking to non-governmental organizations in Hamburg before she hosts a G20 summit there next month, Merkel said:  I don't want to pillory anyone but the island states of Ireland, Malta and Cyprus say: we have a bad geographical location, we're at such a disadvantage, we can only attract companies by having very low taxes.  She added:  And when, within the context of Brexit, Britain one day decides to step into this tax competition too, then of course that would be a huge challenge for countries.  Germany and France will therefore attempt a joint corporation tax reform via a common tax assessment framework  so that at least two countries can be a role model , she said, adding that this could also be a blueprint for a global tax system. The G20 summit is due to take place in Hamburg in early July. On July 13 the governments of Germany and France will meet in Paris for the Franco-German Council of Ministers, where they want to make proposals for closer cooperation in areas such as tax. In a manifesto document ahead of a June 8 election, Britain's Conservatives - who emerged as the largest party but lost their parliamentary majority - said corporation tax would be cut to 17 percent by 2020.

Then there is the daughter of famed fashion designer Ralph Lauren.  Dylan Lauren, 43, has made herself into a female Willy Wonka by creating the world's largest candy store, Dylan's Candy Bar, in Manhattan. After the flagship's success, she opened more of these emporiums around the country. For the latest in Reuters' Life Lessons series, Lauren shared her secret recipe for success. Q: Your dad came from very little, so did he ever tell you stories about making ends meet? A: He grew up in a room shared with his brothers in a tiny apartment in the Bronx. So they were not affluent at all. But my grandfather was a very creative guy: He was a painter, he played the violin, he was in an actors' troupe. I think that creative life inspired my dad, and it has been passed down to me, too. Q: How did you manage to step out of his shadow and start Dylan's Candy Bar? A: People genuinely like my dad and his brand, so it's been a positive thing to have his name, not a negative. But it came to a point where I wanted people to know myself and my business. I wanted to build the world's largest candy store, three floors that is full retail entertainment. Not just high-end candies but music, movies and a design right out of  Willy Wonka.  The business executives didn't really get it at first. They were like:  Why don't you just work with your dad? Or not work at all?  Q: Did you experience some growing pains in getting it up and running? A: I inherited a pretty good sense from my dad about what is going to sell. But building a team is a different thing. It's not just you anymore, and you have to find people who will support your vision.  That's hard. It's like putting a new family together and hoping everyone gets along. But at the end of the day, it is my name on the door. Nowadays, since we pioneered a new business category, the challenge is that competitors are starting to pop up. So it is a constant challenge to stay ahead of the curve. Q: Now that you achieved some success on your own, how did you handle that wealth? A: I definitely talked to my dad and the people who surround him, who watch out for me and my finances. We have kept the company private, and my husband is on the board. We may look for partners to help roll the company out further. Personally, as an art history major, I enjoy investing in art, pop artists like Romero Britto and Burton Morris, as well as photographers like Michael Dweck and Bruce Weber. Q: Any money mistakes along the way that you regret? A: I definitely learned some hard lessons. Some stores we opened in malls, but malls are so temperamental and weather-driven, relying on traffic. Now I prefer stand-alone stores on streetfronts where we can build our own facade.  I have also had to defend my brand as people try to knock us off, and protect our beautiful designs. Q: Where have your charitable dollars gone so far? A: I grew up with rabbits and have a rescue dog from Puerto Rico, so I created Dylan's Candy BarN to help animals and prevent cruelty. We are trying to create adoption events in all our stores. And I recently went to Ecuador with Heifer International to see firsthand how they are teaching people to be environmentally conscious and good to animals. Q: You have twins now, so what are you trying to teach them about life? A: Being kind and giving is really important, even at age 2 when you are on playdates. Those lessons start early.  Also, not being afraid. I like to introduce them to all sorts of people because I want them to have the confidence that if I go to work, everything is going to be OK. I want them to be independent. Q: So what's your favorite candy? A: Right now it's red Swedish raspberries. But I have also been eating a lot of Cadbury Creme Eggs recently. It changes all the time.

Droughts have killed more than 11 million people worldwide since 1900 and now affect double the land area than in 1970, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Developing countries are the most exposed, with their agricultural sectors shouldering 80 percent of all damage caused by drought, FAO says. Better access to reliable weather data and early warning systems could help farmers in rural areas get ready to endure long spells of no rain, said FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva.  Most of the times poor rural communities in developing countries don't even know that a drought is about to strike,  he told a conference at the FAO headquarters in Rome. Measures such as planting resistant crops and building water reservoirs can greatly reduce the impact of droughts, but international responses too often focus on emergency relief, said Graziano da Silva.  People die because they are not prepared to face the impacts of the drought - because their livelihoods are not resilient enough,  he said. In Rome, FAO and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signed an accord to increase cooperation in the face of climate change, improving agro-meteorological services to help small farmers prepare for droughts. WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said weather forecast accuracy had greatly increased in recent years thanks developments in satellite, computing and scientific research.  Weather forecasts are not anymore a joke, they are something you can very much rely on,  he told the conference. Know-how related to long-term forecasts and prediction of major climate events like El Nino had to be shared between rich and poor countries, he added. The last El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, subsided in 2016 and was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.

CVC has owned it since late 2013, when it purchased it from Campbell Soup (CPB.N) for 400 million euros ($447.1 million). CVC's decision to sell Continental Foods comes amid a wave of deal-making in the packaged food sector where large companies are looking for ways to boost profits in a weak market.

Nestle (NESN.S) said last week that it would explore options, including a possible sale, for its roughly $900 million-a-year U.S. confectionery business. London-based CVC, which recently raised a record 16 billion euros for its latest fund, is working with Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) and Paris-based investment boutique Messier Maris on a possible sale, the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private, said.

Jalil Qanbar-Zahi, leader of Ansar al-Furqan, had been pursued by Iranian security forces for 25 years and was killed by the Guards near the city of Qasr Qand, IRNA reported.  Iranian security forces have carried out a string of raids and arrests after a complex terror attack last week targeted the Iranian parliament in Tehran and the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, south of the capital, leaving 18 dead. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack.  On Sunday night, the Guards fired half a dozen missiles from western Iran at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria in what Guards commanders said was a message the perpetrators of the Tehran attack and their supporters, state media said.  Iran's restive Sistan and Baluchestan province, in the southeast of the country on the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the Baluch minority and is a hotbed of Sunni militant activity against the Shi’ite-dominated government of the Islamic Republic. The province, one of Iran's most impoverished, is also part of a well-known drug trafficking route. Qanbar-Zahi was wanted for an attack on a Shi'ite religious ceremony in the city of Chabahar, planning suicide attacks and killing police officers among other crimes, according to IRNA. During the operations which led to Qanbar-Zahi's death, the Revolutionary Guards found a car bomb containing 600 kilograms of explosives, 15 suicide bombs, 700 kilograms of explosive material and tens of thousands of bullets, IRNA reported. Ansar al Furqan is a splinter group of Jundallah, a militant group that also carried out several attacks in the province, according to the Mashregh news site.

France's 10-year government bond yield was within sight of seven-month lows and South European government bond yields dropped on Monday after this Sunday's second round vote. Macron's centrist Republic on the Move LREM party and its centre-right Modem ally won 350 out of 577 seats in the lower house, fewer than previously forecast. Record low voter turnout suggested France's new leader, the youngest since Napoleon, would need to proceed cautiously with reforms in a country where trade unions and street protests have in the past forced new legislation to be diluted.  He will also face an enormous amount of resistance on the ground from the vested interests of the trade unions which still wield an enormous amount of influence, and could make life very difficult for the inexperienced new President and his party,  said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. But the scale of his victory gives Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, a solid platform to carry out his campaign promises to revive the euro zone's second biggest economy. That lifted investor sentiment on Monday, with French stocks rallying 1.15 percent and outperforming European peers. French banking stocks, a barometer of appetite for French assets, jumped over 1.5 percent Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding said France could become the strongest economy in Europe in a decade. In the Past Sunday's vote also closes a chapter on what has been a driver of European market risk, given the popularity of anti-euro far-right leader Marine Le Pen heading into France's presidential elections in April and May. The gap between French and German bond yields - an important gauge of risk appetite - had widened sharply heading into that vote but has since tightened. The 10-year bond yield gap was at 35 bps on Monday, just 2 bps away from levels hit last week that marked the tightest since November. The spread is down more than 40 bps from highs hit in February at the height of French election jitters . In absolute terms, the yield on France's 10-year government bond was unchanged on the day, staying within sight of a seven-month low of 0.58 percent hit last week. Italian and Portuguese government bond yields dropped 3-4 basis points on the day, and the gap over the German equivalent was close to multi-month lows in both cases. These bonds tend to rally when risk appetite is strong and when euro zone break up concerns ebb.  What is also important is the composition of the (parliament),  said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho.  Having the Socialists lose so many seats means this is still a very much business- and reform-friendly assembly and that's why we've been able to see the CAC-40 (stock market) rally nicely ...while French spreads are still relatively tight.  Positive developments in French politics contrasted with turbulence in Britain, where a weakened government on Monday kicked off divorce talks with the EU.

Meanwhile, Whole Foods shares closed on Friday nearly 2 percent above the agreed price, implying some investors think a rival bid could emerge. But even for Wal-Mart, that would be a stretch. Whole Foods’ filing suggests it wasn't shopped around. Amazon only became serious in late April when the company’s team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery-industry buyer like Wal-Mart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering. Then there's the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery-chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon's plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos' online giant away from Whole Foods. Wal-Mart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs listed U.S. grocers, including Target, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, as well as private Albertsons. Its balance-sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition and, with total debt currently at about 1.5 times EBITDA, it could borrow more. Adding an upscale brand might help Wal-Mart attract new customers and boost its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday's deal to buy men's clothing e-tailer Bonobos. Financially, too, topping Bezos' offer would be tough. Assume Wal-Mart is able to cut Whole Foods' operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon’s premium. Wal-Mart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee. This math applies to any interloper. Likewise, even hefty cost cuts won't make Whole Foods' EBITDA expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted-average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company. Whatever clicks-to-bricks magic Bezos has in mind, his advisers have done the trick of making his deal hard to beat.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The 14.9 percent annual increase in exports in May was the biggest rise since January 2015 and nearly twice the pace seen in April, though it was below analysts' expectations of 16.1 percent. Japan's imports rose more than expected in May, partly due to increasing demand for intermediate goods companies need to manufacture their products.  Exports are likely to continue rising at a steady clip as overseas economies show increasing signs of strength, which should help Japan's economy extend its recent run of expansion.  The main scenario is Japan's exports will continue to recover,  said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  However, the pace of growth could slow somewhat as inventories of certain goods, like electronics, start to build up overseas.  Exports of cars and car parts rose partly because an earthquake in Kumamoto last year in May temporarily shut down production of these goods, Tonouchi noted.   Trade Surplus With u.s. Surges Japan's exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since July 2015, due to an increase of shipments of autos and auto parts. The trade surplus with the United States was 411.1 billion yen ($3.71 billion) in May, up 19.0 percent from the same period a year ago. In April, Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 4.2 percent.   A large trade surplus could draw criticism from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly indicated that it prefers protectionist policies to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and increase exports.      Exports to China increased 23.9 percent year-on-year in May, following a 14.8 percent annual increase in April. FILE PHOTO: Newly manufactured cars of the automobile maker Honda await export at port in Yokohama, Japan, January 16, 2017.Toru Hanai/File PhotoLarger shipments of flat panels and semiconductor manufacturing equipment drove the gains in China-bound exports. Exports to Asia, which includes China, rose 16.8 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase in three months, due to increased shipments of electronics to Hong Kong and steel to Indonesia, the data showed. In terms of volume, Japan's exports rose 7.5 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest gain in three months, another indication that overseas demand is firm. Import Growth at More Than 3-Year High Japan's imports rose 17.8 percent in the year to May, the strongest gain since early 2014, versus the median estimate for a 14.8 percent annual increase, as a rise in the price of oil from a year ago pushed up the value of imports. Excluding oil imports, the data showed increasing demand for chemicals, electronic parts and raw materials used in Japanese factories. In terms of volume, imports rose 5.4 percent in May from a year ago, the third consecutive month of gains in a sign of growing demand. The trade balance came to a deficit of 203.4 billion yen, versus the median estimate for a 76.0 billion yen surplus.  You can say domestic demand is doing well, but this is being driven more by the manufacturing sector,  said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.  There are some gains in durable goods, which are related to consumer spending, but rising factory output is the bigger factor behind imports.  Policymakers and economists have become more optimistic about Japan's prospects this year as an increase in factory output and a tightening labor market show the economy is poised to extend its recent growth. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Friday and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months. Consumption has been a soft spot in Japan's otherwise strengthening economy, with its weakness blamed for keeping inflation subdued by discouraging companies from raising prices, leaving growth heavily reliant on exports.

Implementing the programme would be positive for growth and hence for France's public finances, but it may still face opposition outside parliament. The two-round election has given Macron's La Republique En Marche! (EM) party a large majority with 308 out of 577 seats (53.4%), and another 42 seats for the centrist EM ally Democratic Movement party, giving the president 350 seats (60.7%). It underscores the breakdown of traditional party politics, with the previously dominant Socialist and Republican parties winning a combined total of 142 seats, down from 474 in the previous parliament. EM's large majority ensures parliamentary backing for the president's centrist programme, which features labour market reforms, a EUR5 billion investment plan, and some tax cuts, including a reduction in corporate tax to 25% from 33%. However, as in the presidential election, a high abstention rate (of 57% in the second-round relative to an average of 37% since 1993) suggests that the outcome may overstate the level of public endorsement of Macron's proposals. An early test of the new administration's ability to deliver will be its labour market reforms. Proposed measures include allowing negotiations to be conducted in-house and directly with employers rather than with unions at national or branch level, capping on severance packages in cases of unfair dismissal, reducing employee and employer contributions, and cutting labour costs through incentives for permanent contract hiring. We think these would contribute to a reduction of France's 9.6% unemployment rate (versus a ratings peer median of around 4%). However, some attempts by previous governments to pass similar reforms have been met with strong resistance from labour unions and the general public, and have triggered protests and strikes that have resulted in some measures being abandoned or watered down. The president has been in consultation with labour unions since May and is expected to issue detailed proposals reflecting these consultations in the coming weeks. Civil opposition groups and unions, including the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, have said they will hold protests against Macron's proposals, if their counter-proposals and interests are ignored. Macron's plans for stronger eurozone integration could also face popular resistance, after 48% of first-round presidential election voters supported anti-EU candidates in May. Stronger growth would be positive for France's sovereign credit profile because it would improve the public finances, which remain a major weakness in France's 'AA'/Stable rating. Budget deficits spurred by high government spending have resulted in general government debt reaching 96% of GDP in 2016, limiting France's ability to deal with shocks. France's economy has underperformed the eurozone in the last two years, but growth momentum has improved as the temporary, terror-and-weather related weakness of mid-2016 fades (GDP increased by 0.4% qoq in 1Q17, following 0.5% in 4Q16). France should also benefit from the broader recovery in the eurozone. President Macron's stated commitment to reducing the budget deficit to below 3% of GDP suggests that he will strive to meet the European Commission deadline for closing the  excessive deficit  this year.  Macron's fiscal plans, which will be revealed in more detail in the 2018 budget, include a reduction in household and business taxes worth at least EUR20 billion per year (around 1% of GDP), lower corporate tax, annual expenditure savings of up to EUR60 billion (2.5% of GDP), and a reduction in civil service posts. Our next scheduled review of France's sovereign rating is on 28 July.

Like its main rival FedEx Corp, UPS has struggled with the expense of  the last mile  associated with delivering to residential addresses. The cost per package to businesses is typically lower because they receive more deliveries. Atlanta-based UPS, the world's largest shipping company, said residential packages, large packages and those exceeding system weight limits would face surcharges of up to 97 cents for two-day air services to residential addresses from Dec. 17-23. A 27 cent surcharge per package will apply to UPS' ground service from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 and between Dec. 17 and Dec. 23.  We're focused on helping our customers achieve success during some of their most important selling seasons,  Alan Gershenhorn, UPS' chief commercial officer, said in a statement.  UPS's average daily volume exceeded 30 million packages on some days during its 2016 peak holiday season, far above its normal daily average of more than 19 million packages.  To meet that demand, UPS said it  acquires on a temporary basis and often at shorter-term premium rates, additional air and truck cargo capacity, temporary facilities, and additional sorting and delivery personnel.  UPS has worked closely with retailers to manage the peak season surge since struggling to do so in 2013 and 2014.  Both UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars in upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, leaving investors chafing over the expense.  It is unclear whether Memphis-based FedEx, which is due to report quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday, plans to adopt a similar peak season surcharge policy. Cutting delivery costs is a key priority in the e-commerce sector and was, according to industry experts, one of the reasons for Amazon Inc's announcement last week that it was buying Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion. UPS shares were down 6 cents at $110.53 in late morning trading on Monday. FedEx was down 74 cents at $209.76 a share.

India's air force needs hundreds of aircraft to replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said foreign suppliers would have to make the planes in India with a local partner to help build a domestic industrial base and cut outright imports. The agreement is an  intent to partner together to meet India’s Make-in-India requirement through the establishment of an F-16 production line in India,  Lockheed Martin's leader of F-16 business development, Phil Howard, said on Monday on the sidelines of the Paris Airshow. But Modi's Make-in-India drive runs the risk of conflicting with U.S. President Donald Trump's America First campaign under which he has been pressing for companies to invest in the United States and create jobs instead of setting up factories abroad. However, Lockheed has met and briefed the current U.S. administration on its plan, and Howard said he had a sense of full support from the Trump administration. In announcing their agreement at the Paris Airshow, Lockheed and Tata said moving the production base to India would still retain jobs in the United States.  F-16 production in India supports thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the U.S., creates new manufacturing jobs in India, and positions Indian industry at the center of the most extensive fighter aircraft supply ecosystem in the world,  a joint statement by the firms said. Sweden's Saab is the other contender to supply the Indian Air Force, offering to make its Gripen fighter in India. It has not yet announced a local partner for the plane which it has pitched as a modern alternative to the F-16s. The announcement comes days before Modi travels to Washington for a first meeting with Trump, scheduled for June. 26. India and the United States have built a close defence relationship in recent years with Washington emerging as among the top three arms suppliers to India, along with Russia and Israel. India will also have the chance to export the F-16 that is flown by air forces around the world, the joint statement said. Some 3,200 of these planes are being flown by 26 countries and the model that is being offered to India will be Block 70, the most modern of all the F-16s.  This unprecedented F-16 production partnership between the world’s largest defense contractor and India’s premier industrial house provides India the opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft, the newest and most advanced version of the world’s most successful, combat-proven multi-role fighter,  the statement said. Tata is already building airframe components for the C-130 military transport aircraft. India has not opened formal bidding for the jet order, which is expected to be anything from 100 planes to 250.

The tech sector, up 1.4 percent, pushed equity indexes on Wall Street higher, with the Dow and S&P; 500 hitting intraday records. The group had fallen 3.4 percent over the past two weeks.  Some of it is folks taking a second look at names that may have been unduly punished in the rotation out of tech that started about ten days ago,  said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York.  Which makes sense; there has been no change in the fundamentals for the tech sector.  Retailers in Europe, up 0.8 percent, and the U.S. , up 0.7 percent, recouped some losses suffered in the wake of news on Friday of Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. It was Amazon's first major brick-and-mortar acquisition in the sector and already-struggling retailers were hit hard by the prospect of having a well-known disruptor as a competitor. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 97.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 21,481.41, the S&P; 500 gained 15.46 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,448.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 70.77 points, or 1.15 percent, to 6,222.53. A gain in Europe's banks, up 1.5 percent, also boosted European shares in the wake of broker upgrades for Credit Suisse. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.96 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.62 percent. Dudley Comments The U.S. dollar and Treasury yields moved higher after comments from New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley that reinforced expectations the central bank will continue on its path of tightening monetary policy. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of key currencies, rose 0.22 percent, with the euro down 0.28 percent to $1.1166. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.174 percent, from 2.157 percent late on Friday. The Fed raised rates last week and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year. The stronger dollar weighed on gold prices, but losses were curbed by uncertainty as talks commenced on the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union. Britain's negotiators came to Brussels seeking a  new, deep and special partnership with the European Union  on Monday as talks on the unprecedented British withdrawal from the bloc finally got under way. Oil prices managed to steady after four straight weeks of declines sparked by rising production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria, which had taken the edge off an OPEC-led initiative to cut output to support the market. U.S. crude rose 0.29 percent to $44.87 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.58, up 0.44 percent on the day.

The bonds' Recovery Rating is 'RR5'. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 8 June 2017. The notes qualify as Basel III-complaint Tier 2 instruments and contain contractual loss absorption features, which will be triggered at the point of non-viability of the bank. According to the terms, the notes are subject to permanent partial or full write-down upon the occurrence of a non-viability event (NVE). There are no equity conversion provisions in the terms. An NVE is defined as occurring when the bank has incurred losses and has become, or is likely to become, non-viable as determined by the local regulator, the Banking and Regulatory Supervision Authority (BRSA). The bank will be deemed non-viable when it reaches the point at which either the BRSA determines that its operating licence is to be revoked and the bank liquidated, or the rights of Sekerbank's shareholders (except to dividends), and the management and supervision of the bank, should be transferred to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund on the condition that losses are deducted from the capital of existing shareholders. The notes have a 10-year maturity and a call option after five years. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated one notch below Sekerbank's Viability Rating (VR) of 'b+' in accordance with Fitch's  Global Bank Rating Criteria . The notching includes zero notches for incremental non-performance risk relative to the VR and one notch for loss severity. Fitch has applied zero notches for incremental non-performance risk, as the agency believes that write-down of the notes will only occur once the point of non-viability is reached and there is no coupon flexibility prior to non-viability. The one notch for loss severity reflects Fitch's view of below-average recovery prospects for the notes in case of an NVE. Fitch has applied one notch, rather than two notches, for loss severity, as partial, and not solely full, write-down of the notes is possible. In Fitch's view, there is some uncertainty as to the extent of losses the notes would face in case of an NVE, given that this would be dependent on the size of the operating losses incurred by the bank and any measures taken by the authorities to help restore the bank's viability. RATING SENSITIVITIES As the notes are notched down from Sekerbank's VR, their rating is sensitive to a change in this rating. The notes' rating is also sensitive to a change in notching due to a revision in Fitch's assessment of the probability of the notes' non-performance risk relative to the risk captured in Sekerbank's VR, or in its assessment of loss severity in case of non-performance. Sekerbank's ratings are listed below: Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'B+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'B' Viability Rating 'b+' Support Rating '5' Support Rating Floor 'No Floor' National Long-Term Rating 'A/(tur)'; Outlook Stable Basel III-compliant Tier 2 notes: 'B'/'RR5' assigned Contact: Primary Analyst Lindsey Liddell Director +44 20 3530 1008 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Ahmet Kilinc Associate Director +44 20 3530 1272 Committee Chairperson James Watson Managing Director +48 22 338 62 92 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Then there is the daughter of famed fashion designer Ralph Lauren.  Dylan Lauren, 43, has made herself into a female Willy Wonka by creating the world's largest candy store, Dylan's Candy Bar, in Manhattan. After the flagship's success, she opened more of these emporiums around the country. For the latest in Reuters' Life Lessons series, Lauren shared her secret recipe for success. Q: Your dad came from very little, so did he ever tell you stories about making ends meet? A: He grew up in a room shared with his brothers in a tiny apartment in the Bronx. So they were not affluent at all. But my grandfather was a very creative guy: He was a painter, he played the violin, he was in an actors' troupe. I think that creative life inspired my dad, and it has been passed down to me, too. Q: How did you manage to step out of his shadow and start Dylan's Candy Bar? A: People genuinely like my dad and his brand, so it's been a positive thing to have his name, not a negative. But it came to a point where I wanted people to know myself and my business. I wanted to build the world's largest candy store, three floors that is full retail entertainment. Not just high-end candies but music, movies and a design right out of  Willy Wonka.  The business executives didn't really get it at first. They were like:  Why don't you just work with your dad? Or not work at all?  Q: Did you experience some growing pains in getting it up and running? A: I inherited a pretty good sense from my dad about what is going to sell. But building a team is a different thing. It's not just you anymore, and you have to find people who will support your vision.  That's hard. It's like putting a new family together and hoping everyone gets along. But at the end of the day, it is my name on the door. Nowadays, since we pioneered a new business category, the challenge is that competitors are starting to pop up. So it is a constant challenge to stay ahead of the curve. Q: Now that you achieved some success on your own, how did you handle that wealth? A: I definitely talked to my dad and the people who surround him, who watch out for me and my finances. We have kept the company private, and my husband is on the board. We may look for partners to help roll the company out further. Personally, as an art history major, I enjoy investing in art, pop artists like Romero Britto and Burton Morris, as well as photographers like Michael Dweck and Bruce Weber. Q: Any money mistakes along the way that you regret? A: I definitely learned some hard lessons. Some stores we opened in malls, but malls are so temperamental and weather-driven, relying on traffic. Now I prefer stand-alone stores on streetfronts where we can build our own facade.  I have also had to defend my brand as people try to knock us off, and protect our beautiful designs. Q: Where have your charitable dollars gone so far? A: I grew up with rabbits and have a rescue dog from Puerto Rico, so I created Dylan's Candy BarN to help animals and prevent cruelty. We are trying to create adoption events in all our stores. And I recently went to Ecuador with Heifer International to see firsthand how they are teaching people to be environmentally conscious and good to animals. Q: You have twins now, so what are you trying to teach them about life? A: Being kind and giving is really important, even at age 2 when you are on playdates. Those lessons start early.  Also, not being afraid. I like to introduce them to all sorts of people because I want them to have the confidence that if I go to work, everything is going to be OK. I want them to be independent. Q: So what's your favorite candy? A: Right now it's red Swedish raspberries. But I have also been eating a lot of Cadbury Creme Eggs recently. It changes all the time.

Sale due to poor election results .  It was a prank but after a drubbing in Sunday's second round vote, the future of the building may be up for discussion as the party tries to reinvent itself for survival. The number of Socialist seats in the 577 seat chamber plummeted from 280 in 2012 to just 29, the lowest in the post-war Fifth Republic. Parliament's lower house will be dominated by President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Republic on the Move party that blew apart the traditional two-party system. The Socialists may be sidelined for years and will be a weak force in parliament where they have been a major obstacle to more liberal economics that investors hope Macron will bring.  If the Socialists move to the left -- to capture voters whose growing support of hard-left ideas has helped Jeremy Corbyn in Britain -- they will compete with Jean-Luc Melenchon's France Unbowed. The stunning demise reflects the wider struggle of left wing parties in Europe to overcome internal divisions and win votes.  Just five years after hailing the election of Francois Hollande as a new dawn for French Socialists, they will not even be the official opposition -- the conservative The Republicans party will take that role.   The collapse of the Socialist Party is beyond doubt,  Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said late on Sunday after announcing he would step down as party chief.  The president of the Republic has all the powers.  Cambadelis said it was time to build  a new political force on the left.  The crisis facing the Socialists has its roots in Hollande's mid-term shift from being the self-proclaimed  enemy  of bankers and defender of workers to advocate of business-friendly reform. Hollande's move split the party, exposing a deep-seated rift between moderates and hard-left lawmakers, and when the reforms failed to spur the economy, the Socialists haemorrhaged support.  Hollande became the first postwar French president not to seek re-election. The party's nominee, Benoit Hamon, adopted a message veering toward the far-left. But hard-left voters were already flocking to  Melenchon, while  progressive  party grandees inclined toward the center jumped ship to Macron. Hamon polled fifth, setting the party on course for Sunday's disastrous parliamentary vote.  The Socialist Party has been through crises before, but this one is unprecedented in size,  said historian and party member Denis Lefebvre. Boxed in An immediate concern for the Socialist Party will be its finances because of a sharp drop in public funding. French political parties receive government financing worth 1.42 euros each year for every vote won in the parliamentary elections and over 37,000 euros for every elected lawmaker.  The 2012 election results translated into 24.9 million euros last year, almost half its total budget, French media has calculated and that will now fall sharply.  The Socialist party has low debt but the loss of funding will mean scaling back operations just as it needs to reconcile rival factions after Hollande lost control.   The Socialist Party has faced near-death experiences before -- in 1969, when it won just 5 percent of the presidential vote and in 1993 when it was all but wiped out as a major party in parliamentary elections, collecting 53 seats.  On both occasions the Socialists recovered but bouncing back this time may be more difficult.  The scale of Macron's win pointed to widespread disillusion with the two main traditional parties. It also blew apart the left-right divide and left the Socialists boxed in between a powerful centrist party and a buoyant France Unbowed.  From a strategic standpoint, they are wedged between Macron and Melenchon,  said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Temeo Intelligence.  And they're a tarnished brand, part of the mainstream, part of the old politics.  Fight for Survival For decades, France's fractured left was glued together by a common enemy on the right but Macron's victory may split the party along its progressive-traditional socialist faultline. Jim Shields, professor of French at Aston University, said the party had to reinvent itself if it is to survive.   This means (the Socialist Party) facing up to its own ideological contradictions and forging a clear policy direction that no longer pays lipservice to the far-left in opposition while inclining to the center in government,  Shields said. Sebastian Denaja, a 38-year-old Hollande loyalist who lost his parliamentary seat in the first round said a new Socialist Party needed to be  social-democrat, European, green.   He said there was still space for a reinvented center-left party because Macon's plans to cut public jobs and ease labor regulations showed that he was  pure right-wing . Others on the traditional left, led by Hamon, believe a rapprochement with Melenchon, who rails against Europe and the rich and powerful, is possible. But in a typically combative speech on Sunday night that contrasted sharply with the Socialists' tone of defeat, Melenchon, a former Trotskyist, showed no sign of wanting to work with the party he quit in 2008. Hamon and Greens leader Yannick Jadot are due to launch a new movement on July 1. Meanwhile former minister Christiane Taubira, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and her Lille counterpart have launched a process of reflection called  From Tomorrow .  It may be too late.  There's no reason now to support the Socialist Party,  said Sciences Po lecturer Thomas Guenole.  They can try and create a new party but will it be a satellite (orbiting around) Melenchon or around Macron.

Like its main rival FedEx Corp, UPS has struggled with the expense of  the last mile  associated with delivering to residential addresses. The cost per package to businesses is typically lower because they receive more deliveries. Atlanta-based UPS, the world's largest shipping company, said residential packages, large packages and those exceeding system weight limits would face surcharges of up to 97 cents for two-day air services to residential addresses from Dec. 17-23. A 27 cent surcharge per package will apply to UPS' ground service from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 and between Dec. 17 and Dec. 23.  We're focused on helping our customers achieve success during some of their most important selling seasons,  Alan Gershenhorn, UPS' chief commercial officer, said in a statement.  UPS's average daily volume exceeded 30 million packages on some days during its 2016 peak holiday season, far above its normal daily average of more than 19 million packages.  To meet that demand, UPS said it  acquires on a temporary basis and often at shorter-term premium rates, additional air and truck cargo capacity, temporary facilities, and additional sorting and delivery personnel.  UPS has worked closely with retailers to manage the peak season surge since struggling to do so in 2013 and 2014.  Both UPS and FedEx have spent billions of dollars in upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, leaving investors chafing over the expense.  It is unclear whether Memphis-based FedEx, which is due to report quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday, plans to adopt a similar peak season surcharge policy. Cutting delivery costs is a key priority in the e-commerce sector and was, according to industry experts, one of the reasons for Amazon Inc's announcement last week that it was buying Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion. UPS shares were down 6 cents at $110.53 in late morning trading on Monday. FedEx was down 74 cents at $209.76 a share.

The justices declined to review the ruling that dismissed claims by Ohio's Democratic Party and homeless rights groups that the state's  perfect form  law, which invalidates ballots for even minor errors, deprived thousands of people of their right to vote, violating the federal Voting Rights Act. Such suits must be filed by the federal government, not private citizens, that court held.  The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless in Cleveland, the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless and the state Democratic Party challenged a pair of 2014 laws. Those laws required county election boards to reject absentee and provisional ballots unless voters had properly and completely filled out the forms that come with the ballots, including with their name, address, birth date and signature.  Ballots were rejected even if the voter's identity could be determined despite the errors, the plaintiffs told the justices in legal papers. Some were thrown out for omitting zip codes, using cursive writing instead of print, or writing in the current date instead of a birth date, they said, disenfranchising thousands of voters in recent elections, especially minorities.  The plaintiffs claimed the laws were unconstitutional, violating voters' rights to due process and equal protection under the law. They also alleged the laws violated a provision of the Voting Rights Act that outlaws voter disqualification for errors that are  not material  to determining voter eligibility. Last September the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the laws to be mostly legal, striking down only the requirement that absentee voters accurately provide their full address and birth date. The court also said the Voting Rights Act provision at issue could only be enforced by the U.S. attorney general, and lawsuits by private parties were barred.

The S&P; technology sector is coming off its second straight weekly decline, triggered by fears of stretched valuations and investors moving money to other sectors. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's rally this year. Leading the recovery, Apple rose 2.6 percent, providing the biggest boost to the three major sectors. Microsoft and Alphabet were also up. The tech sector's 1.37 percent rise led the gainers on the S&P; 500, putting it on track for its biggest one-day percentage rise since March.  Some of it is folks taking a second-look at names that may have been unduly punished in the rotation out of tech that started about 10 days ago,  said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York.  There has been no change in the fundamentals for the tech sector. Earnings growth, earnings revisions and forward looking indicators remain healthy.  At 11:08 a.m. ET (1508 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107.62 points, or 0.5 percent, at 21,491.9, the S&P; 500 was up 15.92 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,449.07. The Nasdaq Composite was up 72.12 points, or 1.17 percent, at 6,223.88. Consumer staples stocks, which were battered on Friday after Amazon.com's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods, added to their losses. The deal by Amazon, a proven retail disruptor, marked a major step by the internet retailer into the brick-and-mortar retail sector. Amazon rose as much as 2.9 percent to an all-time high of $1017. Wal-Mart, Target and Costco reversed premarket gains to trade lower. New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy. Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy following a set of weak U.S. economic data. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,803 to 964. On the Nasdaq, 1,793 issues rose and 906 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 49 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 99 new highs and 87 new lows.

The deal cements Occidental's status as the dominant U.S. producer of oil via carbon injection, a process favored by environmentalists and oil producers alike, and one that could grow in popularity if Congress expands a tax credit this summer. The EOR process harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil, from power plants or from natural sources, and forces it back into aging oil fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. Occidental is not only buying out Hess's stakes in carbon injection projects, but is also getting complete control of naturally occurring sources of underground carbon dioxide, a boost to the company's bottom line. The cost of carbon is one of the largest expenses in EOR projects typically. For Hess, the deal gives it cash to further expand in North Dakota's Bakken shale and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, areas in which it already invests heavily. The deal is expected to close by August. Shares of Hess fell about 1 percent to $43.25 in morning trading.  Separately, Occidental said it would sell remote acreage in the Permian for $600 million to undisclosed buyers and acquire other acreage closer to existing wells. The deals will effectively cut Occidental's holdings in the Permian, America's largest oilfield, by 13,000 acres. Occidental declined to disclose the buyer but said the deal was not connected to the Hess transaction. The company said the deals should help it, one day, to break even with oil prices CLc1 at $50 per barrel after paying its dividend.  Oil on Monday traded near $45 per barrel.  By monetizing assets in the tail of the portfolio that were not strategic to us, but are synergistic to other companies, we are creating value for our shareholders,  Vicki Hollub, Occidental's chief executive, said in a statement.

The deal cements Occidental's status as the dominant U.S. producer of oil via carbon injection, a process favored by environmentalists and oil producers alike, and one that could grow in popularity if Congress expands a tax credit this summer. The EOR process harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil, from power plants or from natural sources, and forces it back into aging oil fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. Occidental is not only buying out Hess's stakes in carbon injection projects, but is also getting complete control of naturally occurring sources of underground carbon dioxide, a boost to the company's bottom line. The cost of carbon is one of the largest expenses in EOR projects typically. For Hess, the deal gives it cash to further expand in North Dakota's Bakken shale and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, areas in which it already invests heavily. The deal is expected to close by August. Shares of Hess fell about 1 percent to $43.25 in morning trading.  Separately, Occidental said it would sell remote acreage in the Permian for $600 million to undisclosed buyers and acquire other acreage closer to existing wells. The deals will effectively cut Occidental's holdings in the Permian, America's largest oilfield, by 13,000 acres. Occidental declined to disclose the buyer but said the deal was not connected to the Hess transaction. The company said the deals should help it, one day, to break even with oil prices CLc1 at $50 per barrel after paying its dividend.  Oil on Monday traded near $45 per barrel.  By monetizing assets in the tail of the portfolio that were not strategic to us, but are synergistic to other companies, we are creating value for our shareholders,  Vicki Hollub, Occidental's chief executive, said in a statement. Shares of Oxy fell a penny to $61.82 per share in morning trading.

SPD leader Martin Schulz hopes to unseat Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Sept. 24 election, but the center-left party has lost momentum in the polls since making gains following his nomination in January.  We'll reduce the tax burden for small and medium-sized incomes and we'll support families,  Schulz told reporters.  Our proposal is good not just for Germany but also for Europe,  he said, adding it would help stimulate domestic demand and suck in more imports from other European countries. Schulz said the SPD would increase Germany's top income tax rate to 45 percent from 42 percent, while lifting the threshold from which the rate applied to 76,000 euros ($85,000) from around 54,000 euros. The SPD, currently the junior partner in Merkel's ruling coalition, would also raise the special income levy for those earning 250,000 euros or more to 48 percent from 45 percent. The plans highlight the SPD's aim of putting social justice at the heart of the election campaign. But the topic has yet to strike much of a chord with voters, with opinion polls showing the conservatives led by Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in office, holding a double-digit lead. Ifo head Clemens Fuest said the SPD's tax plan combined a small relief for the majority of middle-income taxpayers with rising taxes for high incomes.  The redistribution effects would be generally moderate,  Fuest said, adding that the proposal could increase the risk that the well-off might try to hide from tax collectors abroad. The leftist Die Linke party criticized the SPD's tax concept as too defensive.  The central problem is the lack of a millionaire or wealth tax,  Linke head Bernd Riexinger said.  The SPD doesn't have the courage to dig deeper into the pockets of the rich and wealthy.        Taxing Capital Gains Schulz said the SPD plans meant families with small and medium-sized incomes would pay 15 billion euros less in taxes every year. The party also wants to replace the flat-rate withholding tax on capital gains with a banded system so that income from labor and capital would be taxed equally again. Introduced in 2009 by former SPD finance minister Peer Steinbrueck to help fight tax evasion to countries like Switzerland and Luxemburg, withholding tax is charged at 25 percent on private income from capital gains.  Schulz said the SPD would exempt workers on small and medium-sized incomes from the  solidarity tax  that Germany introduced after reunification in 1990 to support its poorer eastern states. The 5.5 percent tax, which brings in over 15 billion euros a year, was originally envisioned as a short-term measure but has been repeatedly extended despite opposition from some politicians who say it has outlived its usefulness. The SPD's tax proposal is expected to be discussed and adopted at a party congress next Sunday. The SPD would also boost infrastructure investment by 30 billion euros over the next four years to improve schools and streets, he said.

But Konta, who is playing in the Aegon Classic at Edgbaston this week, says that she will not be embracing any of the likely hype and intends to try to prepare as normal - inside her  bubble . Virginia Wade was the last British woman to win a Wimbledon singles title in 1977.  The things that we focus on with my team are very much to stay in my own process and bubble, my approach to my game and my approach to my career doesn’t change according to what is happening outside of me,  Konta said on Monday, when asked about how she intends to cope with the expectations that accompany her bid this year.  We are just staying very much in the process and also just keeping things in perspective – I am out here just trying to be the best player that I can be,  she said. Konta will be featuring in her sixth Wimbledon having never managed to get out of the second round so far. But the 26-year-old, who was reached the final of the Nottingham WTA event before losing on Sunday to Croatian Donna Vekic, is certainly expected to mount a more serious challenge this year. Britain Tennis - Aegon Classic - Edgbaston Priory Club, Birmingham - June 19, 2017 Great Britain's Johanna Konta during a media interview Action Images via Reuters / Peter Cziborra LivepicKonta began the year winning her second WTA title with a win in Sydney and reached the quarter-finals in the Australian Open and then won the biggest title of her career in Miami to establish herself inside the top 10 players in the world. The clay season was less fruitful, with a first round exit at Roland Garros, but Konta is hoping that grass will bring glory.  I think everyone looks to get as much time as possible on the grass going into Wimbledon – it's a short season and for me I am just looking to play as many as I can and adapt well going into Wimbledon. But I also want to enjoy each one of them on their own as well,  she said. Britain Tennis - Aegon Classic - Edgbaston Priory Club, Birmingham - June 19, 2017 Great Britain's Johanna Konta during a media interview Action Images via Reuters / Peter Cziborra LivepicHer plan is to play Eastbourne after Edgbaston and - if results go well - that could mean three solid weeks of tournament tennis in the build-up to Wimbledon. But the Australia-born Konta is not worried about the risk of over-playing.  I am not anticipating that, no. I train very hard to be able to withstand a lot of matches. I think if we are at that stage then that is also a very good problem,  she said. Wimbledon looms though and while she insists she will stick to her  process , she admits that she enjoys the big stages.  I love playing in front of people, whether the crowd is for me or against me, the most important thing is we are entertainers, people pay to come and watch us perform and give them a good match.

The development comes as Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels.  In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer's Olympic Games.  Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale,  said Vijay Swarup, Exxon's vice president for research and development.  We like algae because it's fast-growing, doesn't compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water.  Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale. The oil company's ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive. Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment.  Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat. The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent.   This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil,  said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics. Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells.      This just gives us hope and optimism that we're on the right track,  said Swarup.

For many girls in the conflict-ravaged east of the country, the pain of being spurned by their families and friends as survivors of rape was worse than the violence itself, according to a report by Britain-based Child Soldiers International (CSI).  It is better to die there than come home and be rejected,  said one of the 150 former girl soldiers interviewed by CSI. Eastern Congo is plagued by dozens of armed groups that menace civilians and exploit mineral reserves. About a third of child soldiers are estimated to be girls, who are often married off to militants, abused and raped, activists say. While most girl soldiers in the vast central African nation are abducted by armed groups, others join voluntarily to obtain food and money, to seek protection against violence, or because their families cannot afford to pay their school fees, CSI says. Yet despite witnessing violence and suffering sexual abuse, some girls in militias do not want to return home for fear of shame and stigma, while many of those who do so end up rejoining the armed groups, said Sandra Olsson, program manager at CSI.  It is shocking to see that stigma is one of the main reasons reintegration fails so badly for these girls,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  Even after being home for years, many still suffer from exclusion and discrimination.   We need to ensure these girls are accepted by their communities, rather than being frozen out,  Olsson said.  If they don't receive support after returning home, they won't make it ... they will not survive,  she added. The government should ensure all former girl soldiers have  education, vocational training, and medical care, and work with community leaders including priests and politicians to improve reintegration efforts, according to CSI. One third of the 150 girls interviewed by CSI said they had received no assistance or support since returning home.   With violence on the rise nationally since December when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate, more girls could be forced into joining armed groups across the country, Olsson said.

The week-long internet blackout in the Syrian city meant  she could neither take her online university exams nor reach her professors to explain why.  I was just crying, all the time,  she said.  After two months of hard work and studying, I simply couldn't do my final exams, what could I do?  Panicked, the 23-year-old phoned a relative in Damascus who, also without internet, called another one - a refugee in Germany, who in turn emailed the U.S. university to plead for deferring her exams. The school, University of the People, agreed. Hammad is one of hundreds of Syrian students who are going to great lengths, amid shelling, hunger and brushes with death, to keep up with their university studies and earn their degrees from online schools abroad. Syria had a thriving higher education system before its civil war broke out, with about a fifth of people between 18 and 24 years enrolled in higher education. But the conflict - now in its seventh year - has forced an estimated 200,000 Syrians to give up their studies, according to the New York-based charity Institute of International Education (IIE). Lifeline for Students For many, a handful of easily accessible, virtual schools that offer accredited diplomas and tuition for free have become an educational lifeline. University of the People, headquartered in California, offers 4-year bachelor degrees completely taught online with the help of volunteer academics and retired university staff. It has more than 200 students in Syria, and counts among its student body another 300 Syrians who have fled to safety abroad, according to the school. Similarly, the Berlin-based Kiron Open Higher Education and Amity University, in India, each offer free online courses to hundreds of Syrian refugees. For Hammad, it was during an adrenaline-fueled, end-of-semester exam rush in 2013, that conventional schooling came to an abrupt end. Then a first-year finance student at Aleppo University, the bright-eyed woman was sitting an exam alongside her young peers when two explosions rocked the campus, killing more than 80 people and wounding some 160.  I can't forget until now how many students died in front of my eyes,  she said in a Skype interview.  Their blood, their eyes, many students lost their arms, their legs.  From that moment, her local university, along with Hammad's professional aspirations, was off limits. Now Hammad studies most nights by candlelight on her smartphone - she has no laptop - towards a bachelor's degree in business and administration. Her mobile internet connection is painfully slow, she said, but sufficient to load her weekly readings - a welcome distraction.  When I study, I feel like I'm out of the war,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Violence in Aleppo has receded since government forces have retaken the city from rebels last December.  But humanitarian organizations have expressed shock at the extent of the destruction to infrastructure and homes alike. The magnitude of the tragedy only hit Hammad recently. While researching a paper on globalization, she stumbled upon a U.N. website describing the Syrian crisis as being at the center of the worst refugee exodus since World War Two. It is a comparison widely made in the Western media, but the first time Hammad, a victim of that war, had heard about it, she said. That night, after writing down her homework on paper with a pencil, then transcribing it on her smartphone to send her professors, Hammad sobbed.  It's terrible, terrible,  she recalls telling her parents.  What is happening here is like a dream, a bad dream.  University in Exile From half a world away, in New York City, Shai Reshef, the president and founder of University of the People, is working g to increase the number of Syrians who - like Hammad - go back to university.  We never know when the situation in Syria will come to the point when they can start to rebuild their country,  he said in a phone interview.  But they should be ready for that.  Still, not all see online schools as the right fix. IIE President Allan Goodman warned that without brick-and-mortar universities and their vibrant intellectual communities, Syrians may never return in droves to higher education. His organization has been lobbying several governments, unsuccessfully so far, to host a  university in exile  - an Arabic-language school that would be staffed by some among the 2,000 Syrian academics estimated to have fled their country.  What we're hearing (from Syrians) is the desire for reconnection to an academic environment - something that looks like a university, sounds like a university, has teachers walking around, libraries,  said Goodman in a phone interview.  And the online education is not a substitute for that.  A recent study by the British Council echoes that view. After interviewing some 180 Syrian refugees - many of whom had never studied on the internet - researchers concluded online learning appealed the least to Syrian refugees compared to other schooling options, including in-person degree programs. But University of the People's Reshef argued researchers were asking the victims of war the wrong question.  What options do they have?  he said. Far removed from these debates, Hammad, meanwhile, said she looked to the day when, armed with her business diploma, she may be able to rebuild Syria - as a businesswoman.  You know after each war, countries receive financial aid,  she said.  There will be many investments.

The historic district, and a tiny area to its north, are the only parts of the city still under control of the Islamists. Mosul used to be the Iraqi capital of the group, also known as ISIS.  Iraqi forces early this morning breach into old Mosul, the final ISIS-held district in the city,  Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the international coalition fighting Islamic State, said on Twitter.  We are proud to stand with them.  The Iraqi army estimates the number of Islamic State fighters at no more than 300, down from nearly 6,000 in the city when the battle of Mosul started on Oct. 17. But the Old City is a densely-populated maze of narrow alleyways and the fighting is slow, bloody and house-to-house. About 100,000 civilians are trapped, with little food, water or medical treatment.  This will be a terrifying time for around 100,000 people still trapped in Mosul's Old City ... now at risk of getting caught up in the fierce street fighting to come,  the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said in a statement.  This is the final chapter  of the offensive to take Mosul, said Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi, senior commander in Mosul of the elite Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) units spearheading the assault.  A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the campaign. Several air strikes during the day hit a medical complex just north of the Old City, alongside the western bank of the Tigris river, a Reuters TV reporter said. Armoured vehicles were heading toward the front line north of the Old City, and shelling and gunfire could be heard. The medical complex, housing the two biggest hospitals of Mosul, is still held in part by the militants who are using its buildings as sniper outposts.  Islamic State's security services chief in the Old City, Kanaan Jiyad Abdullah, also known as Abu Amna, was killed in the morning clashes, said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises several Middle East governments on Islamic State affairs. A high-ranking Islamic State figure in charge of intelligence in Mosul, Shakir Mahmud Hamad, was captured by the advancing troops in the Old City, Hashimi told Reuters. The Iraqi government initially hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the campaign took longer as militants reinforced positions in civilian areas to fight back. Smoke billows from the Islamic State militants positions after an artillery attack by the Iraqi soldiers in western Mosul, Iraq June 18, 2017.Erik De CastroIslamic State is using suicide car and motorbike bombs, booby traps and sniper and mortar fire against the troops.  The buildings of the old town are particularly vulnerable to collapse even if they aren't directly targeted, which could lead to even more civilian deaths than the hundreds killed so far in air strikes across the rest of the city,  the IRC said.  We are trying to be very careful, using only light and medium weapons ... to avoid casualties among civilians,  CTS divisional commander Major General Maan Saadi told Iraqi state TV. Street Fighting Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks, as Iraqi forces could not fully secure exit corridors. Slideshow (16 Images) An estimated 50,000 children are in grave danger as the fighting in Mosul enters what is likely to be its deadliest phase yet,  Save the Children warned in a statement.  We expect thousands of families to escape from the Old City. We have made all preparations to evacuate them from the front lines,  army colonel Salam Faraj told Reuters. Islamic State snipers are shooting at families trying to flee on foot or by boat across the Tigris River, as part of a tactic to keep civilians as human shields, the United Nations said on Friday.   The operation now is about street fighting. Air and artillery strikes will be limited because the area is heavily  populated and the buildings fragile,  CTS spokesman Sabah al-Numan told al-Hadath TV in Dubai. Iraqi government forces regained eastern Mosul in January, then a month later began the offensive on the side located west of the Tigris, which includes the Old City. The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in a speech from a mosque in the Old City three years ago and which once covered large areas of Iraq and Syria. The group is also retreating in Syria, mainly in the face of a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition. Its capital there, Raqqa, is being besieged.  Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul and Raqqa to field commanders, becoming effectively a fugitive in the border area between Iraq and Syria. U.S. air strikes have killed several commanders of the group over the past two years, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, a top military commander, chief propagandist Abu Mohammed al-Adani and Abu Ali al-Anbari, the former top civilian administrator. About 200,000 people were estimated to be trapped behind Islamic State lines in Mosul in May, but the number has declined as government forces have thrust further into the city. About 850,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with friends and relatives or in camps, according to aid groups.

The court, in an 8-0 ruling, handed a victory to Lester Packingham, a registered sex offender due to a statutory rape conviction who had challenged the law as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.  This case is one of the first this court has taken to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern Internet. As a result, the court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium,  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court. The North Carolina law, enacted in 2008, made it a felony for people on the state's sex offender registry to use online services that can lead to social interactions with minors. The case forced the justices to weigh free speech rights against a state's interest in protecting its citizens, specifically from sexual abuse of minors. It was one of two victories for free speech at the court on Monday, with the justices in another case striking down a law that bans offensive trademarks. [L1N1JG0K4] The North Carolina law banned the use of leading social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter among others. Opponents had raised concerns that the measure could be interpreted as covering other online activity in which users must create profiles and can interact with other users. That even could include certain news websites. Packingham was on North Carolina's sex offender list because of his 2002 conviction at age 21 on two counts of statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. He was convicted in 2010 of violating the statute when he posted a message on Facebook expressing his surprise at a traffic citation against him being dismissed. The case, which tested the social media smarts of the notoriously tech-averse justices, is the latest of several in recent years that have tested free speech rights in the digital era. For example, the Supreme Court in 2015 threw out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man who made threatening Facebook statements toward his estranged wife and others in a ruling that made it tougher to prosecute people for using menacing language on social media. The North Carolina law did not require proof that the registered sex offender intended to use a particular social media service for an illegal purpose. It also exempted chatrooms and photo-sharing sites. Packingham was convicted of violating the law after local police saw the Facebook post he wrote upon avoiding a traffic citation.  Praise be to GOD. WOW! Thanks JESUS,  he wrote. During February's argument in the case, Justice Elena Kagan mentioned Donald Trump's Twitter feed as an example of how social media has become indispensable in the political sphere.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature Immunology, suggests doctors and drug developers will need to get smarter in zeroing in on those people who stand to benefit from the expensive new drugs, which are revolutionizing cancer care. Drugs such as Merck & Co's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Roche's Tecentriq and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi can boost the immune system's ability to fight tumors, but they only work for some patients. The current widely used benchmark when giving cancer immunotherapy is a protein called PDL-1. However, many experts view PDL-1 as a  blunt instrument , since it does not match precisely to drug response, leading to the consideration of other measures, such as the level of mutation in tumors. The latest research adds a further twist by highlighting the role of so-called tissue-resident memory T-cells. Researchers from the University of Southampton and La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology found that lung cancer patients with lots of this cell type in their tumors were 34 percent less likely to die than others.  Having made the first baby steps with PDL-1 testing, we need to be smarter by using new tests,  said Christian Ottensmeier, a Cancer Research UK scientist who worked on the study.  PDL-1 testing is a little bit like saying 'you've got a Ferrari because it is red'. Many Ferraris are red and many tumors that are PDL-1 positive will respond to immunotherapy, but on its own that is not sufficient.  Ottensmeier and colleagues now plan further clinical trials to see how well their biological predictor can pick out patients who will benefit from taking Opdivo. Industry analysts expect the new generation of cancer immunotherapy drugs to generate tens of billions of dollars in annual sales by early next decade, with lung cancer the biggest single market.

The development comes as Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels.  In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer's Olympic Games.  Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale,  said Vijay Swarup, Exxon's vice president for research and development.  We like algae because it's fast-growing, doesn't compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water.  Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale. The oil company's ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive. Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment.  Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat. The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent.   This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil,  said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics. Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells.      This just gives us hope and optimism that we're on the right track,  said Swarup.

Though small, the issuance is a key first step in India's plan to revive a municipal bond market that saw its last sale in 2007. The funds raised will help pay for its ambitious  Smart Cities  project that aims to modernise 100 cities by 2020, including by improving water supply and transportation. Pune Municipal Corp sold the debt at 7.59 percent, raising 2 billion rupees  ($31.04 million) SBI Capital Markets, the sole arranger, said. That compared with around 7.40 percent for a similar maturity bond from Maharashtra state. The proceeds will be used to provide uninterrupted municipal water supply in the city, up from 4-6 hours currently. Bondholders will be paid interest from money raised from property taxes. Although India is planning to spend up to 48 billion rupees in its Smart Cities project, it needs cities such as Pune to raise up to 75 billion rupees from bond investors. Pune plans to raise a total of 23 billion rupees in the year to March, while New Delhi and Hyderabad are among other cities looking to raise debt, bankers and analysts said. Subodh Rai, senior director and head analytics at CRISIL Ratings, said it was important for India to develop its municipal bond market.  We are talking billions of dollars that need to be poured into urban infrastructure, and municipal corps cannot be dependent on the state or central governments to fund all of these projects,  he said. India has seen only 11 billion rupees worth of municipal bond issuance over the previous two decades, according to think tank Pahle India Foundation, which estimates only 1 percent of urban bodies' requirements are funded by municipal bonds compared to around 10 pct in the United States. Seeking to change that, capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India this year eased rules for cities selling bonds, while the government has said it will subsidise part of the interest payments. But many challenges remain, with bankers and analysts warning most cities in India typically have antiquated or opaque accounting methods, while infrastructure projects suffer from frequent delays or cost overruns that can jeopardise the ability to pay bondholders.  Most municipal corporations will not be able to raise the required amount of money from capital markets based on their balance sheets,  said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist and director of public finance at India Ratings.

If emissions continue to rise at their current pace, however, three in four people in the world will face deadly heat by the turn of the century, a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change said. “People are talking about the future when it comes to climate change, but what we found from this paper is that this is already happening … and this is obviously going to get a lot worse,” said Camilo Mora, lead author of the study and a geography professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. By 2100, for instance, New York is likely to experience around 50 days a year with combined temperature and humidity exceeding the threshold in which people have previously died, researchers said.  In already hot southern U.S. cities such as Orlando and Houston, deadly heatwaves could last nearly the entire summer period, the study found. But the most serious risks will be in tropical areas, where temperatures are already closer to the danger threshold and where heat can last more of the year, rather than just during the summer, researchers said. “Warming at the poles has been one of the iconic climatic changes. Our study shows, however, that it is warming in the tropics what will pose the greatest risk,” said Iain Caldwell, a co-author of the report and a researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  With temperatures already high, “it takes very little warming for conditions to turn deadly in the tropics,” he said in a statement. More Heatstroke, Less Work In steamy Bhubaneswar, for instance, in eastern India’s Odisha state, gardener Basudev Singh is bathed in sweat after two hours of early morning weeding, despite the temperature gauge showing 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Farenheit) – usually considered a bearable temperature in this part of India. The problem is that the relative humidity is 82 percent, meaning the “real feel” of conditions is above 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Farenheit), experts say – and it’s not yet even noon. Monsoon showers, which would normally cool the city, are past due. The 27-year-old laborer said that over the last two and a half summer months he has lost close to half his average earnings because it has become impossible to work outside in searing heat. Jitendra Murmu, another daily-wage worker, said efforts to move work to cooler parts of the day were becoming less effective. “Over summer we even rescheduled our work timing because no work for three months means no food for our children,” he said. “By early April we would rush to work at 5:30 a.m. when day broke, return home at 10:30 a.m. and resume at 3 in the afternoon, until sunset.” “But work itself is less available. Employers and construction contractors are themselves taking it slow due the heat,” he said. Mami Patra, the owner of a small medicine shop in central Bhubaneswar, said she has seen demand for heatstroke treatments surging. “Every single day, all this summer, we get at least seven people who come to us complaining of exhaustion and asking for glucose powder packets,” she said. City doctors said the number of patients turning up with dizziness, confusion and vomiting – symptoms of heat exhaustion, a precursor to deadly heatstroke – is increasing, with patients 50 to 70 years old seemingly most affected. Mora, the author of the University of Hawaii study, noted that the impacts of rising heat will extend far beyond simply a higher death toll, to things like “people having to take longer breaks to withstand the heat and compensate for it by working longer hours”. The already substantial heat death rate “also points out the limitation of many of these governments to afford the cost of adaptation,” he said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Bad - or Terrible? The University of Hawaii study looked at nearly 2,000 deadly heatwave events since 1980, and focused in on more than 780 cases with particularly good data, gathered from 164 cities – from London to Sydney to Sao Paulo – spread across 36 countries. Those included events such as a European heatwave in 2003 linked to 70,000 deaths, a 2010 Moscow heatwave that killed about 10,000 people and a 1995 Chicago heatwave that claimed 700. The study identified consistent threshold levels of combined heat and humidity that triggered deaths, and used those to project future deadly heatwaves as world temperatures continue to rise as a result of climate change. The area of the world where such a thresholds are crossed for 20 or more days a year has been increasing, and is projected to grow, even with dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers said. “The scary thing is how common those deadly conditions are already,” said Farrah Powell, a graduate student and one of the co-authors of the study, in a statement. When heat and humidity exceed a person’s core body temperature – about 37 degrees Celsius, or 98.6 degrees Farenheit – they person cannot dissipate heat into the environment, researchers said.  High humidity makes efforts so sweat out heat less effective, which can lead to a lethal build-up of body heat that can damage major organs, muscles and the brain. “Climate change has put humanity on a dangerous path that will become increasingly dangerous and difficult to reverse if greenhouse gas emissions are not taken much more seriously,” Mora said. “We are running out of good choices for the future,” he warned. “For heatwaves, our options are now between bad or terrible.” Reporting by Manipadma Jena @ManipadmaJena,; editing by Laurie Goering :; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

Italian communications regulator AGCOM said in April that Vivendi's stake-building was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power in the country's telecoms and media sector. Vivendi is the biggest single shareholder in Telecom Italia, with 24 percent, and recently acquired 28.8 percent of Mediaset, Italy's biggest private broadcaster. At the time of the ruling the authority did not say how much Vivendi must divest in either company but asked the French group to present a  specific plan of action  within 60 days, a deadline that expires this week. Sources told Reuters this month that Vivendi planned to cap its Mediaset voting rights at just below 10 percent pending the outcome of its appeal. The sources said Vivendi would argue that it does not control Mediaset and that AGCOM's ruling is an obstacle to a broader, sector-wide convergence between media and telecoms businesses. While the market has been speculating which stakes Vivendi will reduce, sources said that the group's plan was to keep both as part of efforts to establish a southern European media empire.

Clovis's late-stage trial was designed to move its drug, Rubraca, up to a second-line treatment and later, a maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy immediately follows initial treatment to keep patients cancer-free if they go into remission. Rubraca, like Tesaro Inc's Zejula and AstraZeneca Plc's Lynparza, belongs to a closely watched class of new medicines called PARP inhibitors, which blocks enzymes that repair damaged DNA, helping kill cancer cells in the process. Rubraca was granted accelerated approval in December by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients whose cancer tested positive for defective BRCA genes, and whose disease had advanced despite two or more rounds of chemotherapy. BRCA gene mutations are known to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Clovis's latest study included 564 patients and tested Rubraca against a placebo in patients with various gene mutations who had undergone initial platinum-based chemotherapy. When given Rubraca, women with recurrent ovarian cancer lived a median 10.8 months without their disease worsening, compared with 5.4 months for women on a placebo, Clovis said. Overall, data showed Rubraca slowed recurrence in patients who were in remission, and shrunk tumors in those who entered the study with residual disease, in some cases even eliminating tumors. Shares of Tesaro, whose Zejula is already approved as a maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, were off 3.6 percent at $139.12 in morning trading.  Rubraca and Zejula appear to be more similar than different, leading to a narrowing of the valuation gap between Clovis and Tesaro,  Morgan Stanley analysts said. Clovis plans to submit an application to the U.S. FDA within the next four months to expand Rubraca's label. If approved, the drug could be used as a maintenance therapy, or to treat the cancer if the patient prefers to wait for real evidence that the tumor has recurred, Clovis CEO Patrick Mahaffy said. More than 22,400 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society. About 25 percent of those diagnosed will carry BRCA mutations, Mahaffy said, adding that with an expanded label, Rubraca's addressable population could effectively quadruple. Shares of Boulder, Colorado-based Clovis were up 48 percent at $88.76 in morning trading.

Despite that possibility, Amazon shares also gained as Wall Street analysts lauded the proposed $42-per-share deal and bet that the company would prevail in any bidding battle. After closing at $42.68 on Friday, Whole Foods shares were up 1.5 percent at $43.32 on Monday morning after rising as high as $43.64 earlier in the session, suggesting hopes it would end up fetching a higher price. Amazon hit a high of $1,017 and was last up 1.4 percent at $1,001.13. Barclays analyst Karen Short raised her Whole Foods price target to $48 from $38 and upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight, citing the possibility of counterbids.  Many will do anything to either make this acquisition more costly for Amazon, or prevent the asset from landing in Amazon's lap,  Short wrote in a note to clients. A $48-a-share price tag would be more than reasonable for a fellow retailer that could eliminate overhead at Whole Foods, Short said, while adding that very few companies could outbid Amazon. Benchmark Research analyst Daniel Kurnos also expects a bidding war, but he said:  Amazon will ultimately be able to outbid any other party by a meaningful amount, given the valuation gap between them and WFM.  Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said the deal was a  healthy option to accelerate growth  at Amazon as it could use Whole Foods supermarkets as distribution centers for its online grocery service and to sell its own branded devices, such as Kindle e-readers. Pachter said Amazon was likely to increase spending to build its online grocery business over the next several years, so the acquisition would add only slightly to earnings while boosting revenue significantly.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature Immunology, suggests doctors and drug developers will need to get smarter in zeroing in on those people who stand to benefit from the expensive new drugs, which are revolutionizing cancer care. Drugs such as Merck & Co's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Roche's Tecentriq and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi can boost the immune system's ability to fight tumors, but they only work for some patients. The current widely used benchmark when giving cancer immunotherapy is a protein called PDL-1. However, many experts view PDL-1 as a  blunt instrument , since it does not match precisely to drug response, leading to the consideration of other measures, such as the level of mutation in tumors. The latest research adds a further twist by highlighting the role of so-called tissue-resident memory T-cells. Researchers from the University of Southampton and La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology found that lung cancer patients with lots of this cell type in their tumors were 34 percent less likely to die than others.  Having made the first baby steps with PDL-1 testing, we need to be smarter by using new tests,  said Christian Ottensmeier, a Cancer Research UK scientist who worked on the study.  PDL-1 testing is a little bit like saying 'you've got a Ferrari because it is red'. Many Ferraris are red and many tumors that are PDL-1 positive will respond to immunotherapy, but on its own that is not sufficient.  Ottensmeier and colleagues now plan further clinical trials to see how well their biological predictor can pick out patients who will benefit from taking Opdivo. Industry analysts expect the new generation of cancer immunotherapy drugs to generate tens of billions of dollars in annual sales by early next decade, with lung cancer the biggest single market.

The yen weakened against the greenback and euro following Friday's Bank of Japan meeting where officials downplayed the likelihood it would begin to roll back emergency stimulus for the economy.     On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley's comments came with doubts whether stubbornly low inflation, which has been stuck below the central bank's 2-percent goal, would allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of the year.      The Fed doesn't seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,  said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.     The Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point last Wednesday and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided more details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.       Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up and with that, inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,  Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York.     Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed's Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 45 percent from 41 percent late on Friday, CME Group's FedWatch tool showed.     An index, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.15 percent at 97.310.     The euro was down 0.2 percent versus the greenback to $1.1174, while the dollar gained 0.4 percent against the yen at 111.32 yen.     The single currency was up 0.2 percent at 124.39 yen,      Positioning data showed speculators' net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest in seven years last week.

At a closed-door meeting last month, Arizona State University ecologist Leah Gerber presented a plan to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials that would use a mathematical formula to direct government money away from endangered and threatened species she calls  over-funded failures  and toward plants and animals that can more easily be saved. Gavin Shire, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an email to Reuters that the agency is examining the controversial proposal.  We have worked closely with this group of scientists as they developed this new conservation tool, and while we have not made any determinations yet, are impressed with its potential,  Shire said.  We will be exploring further if and how we may best use it to improve the effectiveness of our recovery efforts.  Gerber's May 5 meeting with administration officials and their stated interest in her proposal have not been previously reported. The agency would not comment further.  The proposal comes at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to cut billions from the budgets of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, which oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Endangered Species Act bars the government from deciding which animals and plants become extinct. But funding one species over another could let some decline or die out.   I just don’t think it’s possible to save all species even though I would like to,  said Gerber, a self-described Democrat and environmentalist.  That's an uncomfortable thing to say and I don’t like it but that’s the reality.  Gerber said as many as 200 additional species could be saved by directing funds away from species such as the iconic northern spotted owl - whose numbers have declined despite millions of dollars spent on conservation efforts - and toward those with a better chance of survival. So-called conservation triage is already being used in New Zealand and the Australian state of New South Wales, but Gerber has developed a specific algorithm for the United States that considers the expense and needs of local species as well as rules laid out by the Endangered Species Act. Gerber came up with the idea for a U.S. model while Democratic former President Barack Obama was in office, pitching the concept to  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials before her algorithm was developed. Given the proposed budget cuts, some proponents say it may have a better chance of adoption under the Trump administration. To opponents, conservation triage is an impractical and immoral policy that effectively allows bureaucrats to play God.   If we let species go extinct, there is no bringing them back,  said Rebecca Riley, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Increased funding would allow more species to be saved without sacrificing those that are costly to help, she said. Winners and Losers    In making her case to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Gerber flashed graphs and charts across brightly-colored monitors ringing the meeting room, but said she showed the names of species in code to avoid hot-button issues. According to research she conducted in 2013, species that might be recommended for an increase in funding include an endangered western reindeer called the woodland caribou, the Indiana bat, the Hawaiian crow and others. She expects the new algorithm to show similar results. The threatened Northern Spotted Owl is shown in this undated handout photo provided June 13, 2017.  Courtesy Shane Jeffries/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Handout via REUTERS    Those that could be left with less government help include the Florida scrub-jay, California's marbled murrelet, Texas' golden-cheeked warbler, the West Coast's white sturgeon fish and Florida's gopher tortoise. Numerous plants could also lose funding. Then there is the northern spotted owl, which in the 1990s became a symbol of the battle between conservationists and business when the government placed restrictions on the timber industry to protect its old-growth forest habitat.     Today, in struggling former lumber towns of the Pacific Northwest, some residents still blame the spotted owl in part for economic decline. Since 1990, amid habitat protections as well as unrelated economic pressures, the number of sawmills in California has dropped from 117 to 27, according to U.S. government figures.  The county has never recovered from the Spotted Owl,  said Keith Groves, a Trinity County Supervisor who spent his childhood in the Northern California area when it was logging country. Lumber-related work had sustained his father and grandfather, but Groves became a winemaker after the timber industry's collapse. Locals do not blame the loss entirely on protections for the owl, but the abrupt halt to most logging on federal land connected with the animal's protection shook the region's economy, he said.   Tom Wheeler, a spotted owl expert with the Environmental Protection Information Center, said even with current levels of support the bird could become extinct by 2050. Slideshow (5 Images) We need to do everything within our power to stop that from happening,  Wheeler said.  We have a legal obligation under the Endangered Species Act, but I think more forcefully we have a moral obligation to do it.   Despite protected habitat and about $4.5 million, adjusted for inflation, that Gerber calculates has been spent annually between 1989 and 2011 to help the owl recover, federal statistics show its numbers have declined by about 4 percent per year. About 4,800 northern spotted owls are left in North America, according to the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife.      Beloved Creatures  Supporters of the triage idea prefer the term  strategic prioritization,  saying there is a difference between actively deciding to let a species decline and choosing to spend more on those with better chances of recovery.     One proponent is Hugh Possingham, an Australian scientist and an architect of the policy in that country. Now the chief scientist for U.S. environmental group The Nature Conservancy, Possingham wants to see similar policies adopted in the United States.     “I’m always amazed that this is a contentious issue. I’ve had people discuss it with me and end up with a fit,  he said.  But the mathematics and the economics of doing the best you can with the resources you have - I don’t know why that’s contentious at all.”      The Australian state of New South Wales, which in 2013 adopted a strategic prioritization algorithm, decided to keep funding recovery efforts for some species that the model ranked as low priorities, said James Brazill-Boast, senior project officer with the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage.     For example, he said, the koala would be ranked low, but Australians would never support letting the beloved creatures, listed as vulnerable by law, become extinct.     Gerber said U.S. officials could similarly decide to continue supporting species that her algorithm might reject - or non-profits could step in to help.      I don't think the agency wants to let things go extinct,  Gerber said.  I don't want to let things go extinct. ... But we can actually achieve better outcomes by being strategic. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-endangered-species-triage-idUSKBN19A1DK"},

Rice Energy's shares surged more than 24 percent to $24.47 in early trading, but below the $27.05 per share offered by EQT. EQT's shares were down 9.4 percent. The deal comes at a time when U.S. energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio as the country prepares to become the world's top natural gas exporter. EQT said it would be able to drill longer horizontal wells in Pennsylvania after the deal as most of the acquired acreage is next to where EQT already drills or owns land.  EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in Marcellus/Utica,  said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.  EQT needs a lot - and Rice offers a lot of what it needs.  EQT has been buying acreage in the Marcellus shale field - where gas is among the cheapest in the country. Most recently it picked up 53,400 acres in the field from Stone Energy Corp. EQT said the acquisition would increase its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and its core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000. The deal would also give the company access to Rice Energy's midstream assets, including a 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT will take on about $1.5 billion in debt. Rice Energy shareholders will receive $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share they hold, EQT said. The offer translates to a price of $27.05 per Rice Energy share, representing a premium of 37.4 percent to the stock's Friday closing price, according to Reuters calculations. Citigroup was EQT's financial adviser, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz were its legal advisers.

After years of booming orders driven by increased air travel and more fuel-efficient planes, passenger jet manufacturers are bracing for a slowdown in demand while they focus on meeting tight delivery schedules and ambitious production targets. In a sign of their more modest expectations, some companies have cut back on staffing and catering at this year's Paris Airshow and made less space available for the media. But Boeing generated a burst of activity on the opening day by launching the 737 MAX 10 to plug a gap in its portfolio at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus A321neo. The U.S. planemaker said it had more than 240 orders and commitments from at least 10 customers for the new 737, which can carry up to 230 people in a single-class configuration.  Many airports are running out of capacity and for those airports this is a perfect aircraft,  said Ajay Singh, the chairman of low-cost Indian airline SpiceJet, as his company signed a provisional deal to buy 40 MAX 10s. However, Airbus immediately hit back with an order for 100 of its popular A320neo planes from leasing firm GECAS, as well as a deal for 12 A321neos with Air Lease Corporation. Airbus sales chief John Leahy brushed off the latest Boeing challenge saying much of the interest in the MAX 10 was from existing Boeing customers switching orders from other models.  We think the 737 MAX 10 is a competitor to the (MAX) 9 and that's why a lot of people are converting,  he said. Twenty of SpiceJet's provisional order for 40 MAX 10s were conversions from an existing order for other 737 models. Industry sources also said Airbus would soon announce an order for 10 of its A350-900 wide-body jets, while sources said on Sunday it was close to clinching a deal worth about $5 billion with low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru. Providing more reassurance for planemakers, Qatar Airways said it was sticking with plans to increase its fleet and routes, despite a diplomatic rift with four Arab nations which have closed their airspace to the company.  We have had a lot of cancellations, especially to the four countries that did this illegal blockade, but we have found new markets and this is our growth strategy,  Chief Executive Akbar al Baker told Reuters. Macron Jets in While demand for passenger jets may be ebbing, there are signs interest in military aircraft is picking up after years in the doldrums due to government budget cuts and weak growth. Lockheed Martin is in the final stages of negotiating a $37 billion-plus deal to sell 440 F-35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That would be the biggest deal yet for the stealth warplane, set to make its Paris Airshow debut this week. In another boost for defence projects, President Macron flew into the airshow aboard an Airbus A400M military transporter in his first official engagement since winning a parliamentary majority in elections on Sunday. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and France's aerial display team. The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by problems: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. Airbus said on Sunday it was working on an upgrade of the A380 - called A380plus - with fuel-saving wingtips, confirming plans reported by Reuters in March. Airbus chief Fabrice Bregier said on Monday the company was in talks with several potential customers for the upgraded plane. But it would only be put into production if it received  a large order , he said, without elaborating. Four-engined, double-decker superjumbos such as the A380 and Boeing's 747 were once viewed as the future of air travel between international hubs, but interest has waned as airlines have preferred cheaper, more nimble aircraft.

The Russian-donated sculpture of a fist-clenched Chavez, in a square of Sabaneta near where he was born in a mud hut, has withstood nearly three months of anti-government unrest that has convulsed Venezuela since April and killed more than 70 people.   It will fall one day soon, you'll see,  said activist Angel Dorante, noting the vandalism and destruction of Chavez statues and symbols elsewhere in Venezuela.  Surrounded by fertile plains and home to nearly 40,000 people, Sabaneta is a politically sacred spot for the ruling  Chavismo  movement, now led by President Nicolas Maduro, but it has not been immune to protests roiling the nation in demand of elections to end socialist rule.  Locals have been banging pots and pans at night and took to the streets recently during a power cut. They were dispersed by security forces with tear gas, witnesses said.   In the tatty state capital Barinas, where Chavez studied and lived as a youth, the trouble has been far worse. Many people have turned on the ruling Socialist Party in a poor region that was once their heartland of support. Even though much of the attention has been on the capital Caracas, Barinas has seen the worst of the anti-government unrest. Violence on May 22-23 left seven people dead, hundreds of shops looted and the city's half million people traumatized. With some businesses on strike, anti-Maduro protesters barricaded streets and faced off with National Guard soldiers, witnesses said. Pro-government gangs joined the fray and, according to local authorities, 500 shops were looted while at one point a crowd of 2,000 people took over a major police base.   There was a social explosion,  Jose Luis Machin, Barinas' opposition mayor, describing how some business owners hired gunmen to stand on roofs to deter looters.  One Chinese owner stood on his roof with two grenades to keep them away.  In scenes unthinkable during Chavez's 14-year rule, the rioters in Barinas stormed and burned the headquarters of the ruling Socialist Party, stoned a house where the late leader had lived as a youth, and defaced images of him on the streets. A few weeks later, soldiers watch over gas stations, courts and other key buildings while many businesses remain closed with signs saying  already looted  and workers repaint the ransacked party building. There are still sporadic protests and fear is pervasive. Rights activists say dozens of protesters have been detained, some beaten savagely on the knees with baseball bats and one covered in excrement and urine while in custody.  Not Enough Food  A woman walks next to a mural depicting Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez in Barinas, Venezuela June 14, 2017. Picture taken June 14, 2017.Carlos Eduardo RamirezThe anger in Barinas, as elsewhere around Venezuela, is fueled by widespread hunger and shortages after four years of brutal recession. There is special bitterness in Chavez's home state that locals say should be a prosperous bread basket for the nation due to its fertile farming conditions.  We do not have enough food for our baby. That is why my husband went out to protest, like any other Venezuelan,  said Arianna Espinoza, 20, whose husband, Yorman Bervecia, 19, took to the streets on May 22 near a National Guard military base.  He never came home, shot dead in the chest.  Now it's me who wants to go out there and protest,  Espinoza said as she cradled 1-year-old Lucas in her arms. Slideshow (15 Images)As well as elections, the protesters are demanding solutions to the crisis-hit economy, an end to rampant corruption, freedom for jailed activists, foreign humanitarian aid, and autonomy for the National Assembly legislature won by the opposition in 2015. Barinas' turn away from  Chavismo  dates from that election, when voters elected five opposition lawmakers for six seats. Maduro calls his opponents  terrorists  bent on a violent coup and is resisting calls to bring forward the next presidential election scheduled for late 2018. He is setting up instead a super-body known as a constituent assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution and override other institutions. An election for that assembly is set for July 30 but the opposition says it is rigged to guarantee him a majority so they are boycotting the process.  The terrorist right-wing won't stop in their attempts to bring down President Maduro's government,  said Barinas state Governor Argenis Chavez, brother of the late president. Despite Venezuela's economic decline and anti-government unrest from the Andes to the Amazon, Maduro retains a hardcore of support and his approval rating of just above 20 percent is respectable compared to some peers around Latin America. That reflects the deep reverence among Venezuela's poor for Chavez, who picked Maduro as his successor and urged people to back him, lingering suspicion of opposition leaders long viewed as an out-of-touch elite, and disgust at violence in protests. Denny Frias, 43, a distant relative of Chavez who tends the gardens round his statue in Sabaneta, said he was still  100 percent Chavista  and had the government to thank for both his job and state-provided house.  Chavez gave his life for his country and Maduro is continuing his work so I support him,  Frias said, wearing a red T-shirt with Chavez's image in the shadow of the statue.   The troublemakers have tried to come here. They're paid and given food to be violent. But they can't touch this statue. We are here watching and we won't let them.

The justices ruled 5-4 in favor of inmate James McWilliams, who was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a convenience store clerk in Tuscaloosa. The court sent the case back to lower courts to determine if the ruling will affect McWilliams' conviction and sentence. The court did not rule on the main question before them: whether indigent criminal defendants who may have a mental illness have the right to independent expert witnesses to testify in their defense, or whether court-appointed experts who offer findings to the prosecution and the defense are adequate. Instead, the court found that Alabama had not met the basic standards set by a 1985 case called Ake v. Oklahoma, which said that indigent defendants are entitled to expert assistance. That ruling did not specifically say the expert had to be assigned to assist the defense as opposed to being an expert helping both sides. Lawyers for McWilliams, who claimed he was mentally ill, argued the 1985 ruling clearly established a criminal defendant's right in appropriate cases to an independent expert to  assist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense.  In the 1984 crime, McWilliams entered a convenience store, locked the doors, took money from clerk Patricia Reynolds, forced her into a back room, raped her, shot her 16 times with a pistol and left her to bleed to death. McWilliams, later caught driving a stolen car in possession of the murder weapon, was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1986.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-deathpenalty-idUSL1N1JG0LE"},

Faster growth this year reflects a synchronised improvement across both advanced and emerging market economies. Macro policies and tightening labour markets are supporting demand growth in advanced countries, while the turnaround in China's housing market since 2015 and the recovery in commodity prices from early 2016 has fuelled a rebound in emerging market demand,  said Brian Coulton, Fitch's Chief Economist. The biggest positive forecast revision since Fitch's March GEO is to the eurozone. Here, stronger incoming data, improving external demand and greater confidence that ECB QE is gaining traction on activity have resulted in an upward revision of 0.3pps to the 2017 eurozone growth forecast, taking it to 2%. The recent pick-up in world trade growth has also been striking. However, this improving global picture implies an evolving monetary policy outlook. China has recently seen a tightening in credit conditions, which will start to have an impact on growth later this year and the Fed looks set to pursue a normalisation course at a rate of three or four hikes per year through 2019. Low core inflation allows the ECB to carry on with QE for the time being, but the reduction in deflation risks will see the programme phased out by mid-2018.  With the Fed now signalling that QE will start to be unwound later this year, these monetary policy adjustments could spark some volatility in global financial markets attuned to persistent monetary accommodation,  added Coulton. The changing impact of fiscal policy on growth in the advanced economies also remains an important factor behind the improved near-term outlook. Fiscal policy began to shift to a mild easing stance from 2016 in the US and the eurozone after several years of substantial fiscal tightening over 2011 to 2015. Fitch's analysis of multipliers suggests this shift has had a significant impact on growth dynamics in the advanced economies and seems likely to provide a further boost to growth over the next couple of years. Demand growth in the larger emerging market economies is recovering strongly in 2017. Both Brazil and Russia have recently seen a return to positive real GDP growth rates and the latest data suggest consumption and investment is starting to pick up in Russia. Following very large declines in aggregate demand in the aftermath of sharp falls in commodity prices in 2014, there is now room for demand to recover in large emerging market commodity producers.  The two key downside risks identified last quarter - eurozone fragmentation risk and aggressive US-led protectionism - have not gone away but have certainly diminished somewhat in recent months,  noted Coulton. Emmanuel Macron's decisive victory in the French Presidential election, as well as his party's success in National Assembly elections, have eased concerns about anti-European and anti-euro sentiments gaining additional traction. Furthermore, despite tough rhetoric on trade in the election campaign, the US policy approach to reforming trade relations has not, so far, translated into aggressive unilateral measures. However, the lack of much visible progress to date on agreeing specific tax reform measures raises the risk that US fiscal policy may not be eased as much as anticipated in our baseline forecast.

Clovis's late-stage trial was designed to move its drug, Rubraca, up to a second-line treatment and later, a maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy immediately follows initial treatment to keep patients cancer-free if they go into remission. Rubraca, like Tesaro Inc's Zejula and AstraZeneca Plc's Lynparza, belongs to a closely watched class of new medicines called PARP inhibitors, which blocks enzymes that repair damaged DNA, helping kill cancer cells in the process. Rubraca was granted accelerated approval in December by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients whose cancer tested positive for defective BRCA genes, and whose disease had advanced despite two or more rounds of chemotherapy. BRCA gene mutations are known to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Clovis's latest study included 564 patients and tested Rubraca against a placebo in patients with various gene mutations who had undergone initial platinum-based chemotherapy. When given Rubraca, women with recurrent ovarian cancer lived a median 10.8 months without their disease worsening, compared with 5.4 months for women on a placebo, Clovis said. Overall, data showed Rubraca slowed recurrence in patients who were in remission, and shrunk tumors in those who entered the study with residual disease, in some cases even eliminating tumors. Shares of Tesaro, whose Zejula is already approved as a maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, were off 3.6 percent at $139.12 in morning trading.  Rubraca and Zejula appear to be more similar than different, leading to a narrowing of the valuation gap between Clovis and Tesaro,  Morgan Stanley analysts said. Clovis plans to submit an application to the U.S. FDA within the next four months to expand Rubraca's label. If approved, the drug could be used as a maintenance therapy, or to treat the cancer if the patient prefers to wait for real evidence that the tumor has recurred, Clovis CEO Patrick Mahaffy said. More than 22,400 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society. About 25 percent of those diagnosed will carry BRCA mutations, Mahaffy said, adding that with an expanded label, Rubraca's addressable population could effectively quadruple. Shares of Boulder, Colorado-based Clovis were up 48 percent at $88.76 in morning trading.

A Syrian army statement released on Syrian state television said the plane crashed and the pilot was missing in the first such downing of a Syrian jet by the United States since the start of the conflict in 2011. The army statement said it took place on Sunday afternoon near a village called Rasafah. The  flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies ... in fighting terrorism across its territory,  the Syrian army said.  This comes at a time when the Syrian army and its allies were making clear advances in fighting the Daesh (Islamic State) terrorist group,  it added. Related CoverageU.S. says it downed Syrian warplane that attacked U.S.-backed fightersThe U.S. Central Command later issued a statement saying the Syrian plane was downed  in collective self-defense of Coalition-partnered forces,  identified as fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near Tabqah. It said that  pro-Syrian regime forces  had earlier attacked an SDF-held town south of Tabqa and wounded a number of fighters, driving them from the town.  Coalition aircraft in a show of force stopped the initial advance. When a Syrian army SU-22 jet later dropped bombs near the U.S.-backed forces, it was immediately shot down by a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet, the statement said.

The coalition does  not seek to fight the Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces  but would not  hesitate to defend itself or its  partnered forces from any threat,  the statement said. The U.S.-led coalition has in recent weeks escalated its aerial bombing campaign in northern Syria and Raqqa province. U.S.-backed forces have encircled the city of Raqqa and captured several districts from the militants. The Syrian army, which has been taking territory from retreating Islamic State militants in the eastern Aleppo countryside, has moved into Raqqa province and seized back some oil fields and villages that had been under the militants' control for almost three years. An SDF official told Reuters the Syrian army had been engaged in skirmishes in recent days with U.S.-backed forces near the town of Maskaneh close to the borders of Raqqa province, much of which is now held by U.S.-backed groups fighting Islamic State. The Syrian army backed by Iranian-backed militias has also been in competition in southeastern Syria with U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels who are also trying to recapture territory from Islamic State. On several occasions in recent weeks, warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have also struck pro-government forces to prevent them advancing from a U.S.-controlled garrison in southeastern Syria at a spot where the country's borders join with Iraq and Jordan.

The court, in an 8-0 ruling, handed a victory to Lester Packingham, a registered sex offender due to a statutory rape conviction who had challenged the law as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.  This case is one of the first this court has taken to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern Internet. As a result, the court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium,  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court. The North Carolina law, enacted in 2008, made it a felony for people on the state's sex offender registry to use online services that can lead to social interactions with minors. The case forced the justices to weigh free speech rights against a state's interest in protecting its citizens, specifically from sexual abuse of minors.

A little over a month ago, the anti-immigration, anti-euro Natonal Front (FN) was dreaming of Le Pen winning the presidency and demanding a renegotiation of European Union treaties. But Le Pen was comfortably beaten by now-President Emmanuel Macron. Her defeat prompted a public row between senior party officials, and more barbs were traded after Sunday's parliamentary election which saw the party fall short of the 15 lawmakers required to form a parliamentary group, though it did quadruple its MP count to eight. Le Pen told reporters in her Henin-Beaumont stronghold that the phase of  overhauling  the FN had started.   I want this debate to be polite and friendly ... I will demand that this be the case,  Le Pen said. She expressed irritation at bickering among party officials, much of which focused on her close aide and deputy Florian Philippot, architect of her anti-euro economic policy that gives state intervention a big role.  It was neither the time nor the place to do so, on social media networks, and therefore publicly, right in the middle of parliamentary elections,  she said. The task for Le Pen is whether she can transform her party's growing popularity into more votes and real power. France's two-round voting system in both presidential and parliamentary elections has traditionally impeded the FN, which seeks a more proportional system of voting.  Rift Over Euro Central to the party debate will be whether it sticks with its policy of calling for an end to use of the euro currency and a return to the French franc. Polls show that most French oppose a switch away from the euro currency and Le Pen herself hinted she might soften her anti-euro stance, saying:  We need to ask ourselves what went well and what did not.  The party will also be looking at whether it continues to follow a strategy of calling itself  neither Right nor Left  with both right-wing anti-immigration policies and left-wing protectionist policies. Some party officials want to see the FN seek allies with other hard-right parties to try and break its political isolation. The findings of the party debate, including a meeting of top officials in late July, will go to party members in a much-broader party congress, expected to take place at the end of this year or the beginning of next.   Philippot, seen by some within the party as exerting too much influence over Le Pen, failed to win his seat on Sunday and may now find his position imperiled.  Gilbert Collard, another close Le Pen ally, who was re-elected and has long pressed for the FN to drop its anti-euro stance, told Sud Radio that Philippot spent  too much time in the media.  Philippot, who has said he will quit if the party drops its anti-euro policy, told BFM TV that the party had to avoid  hysteria . None of Philippot's closest allies won a parliamentary seat.  Another challenge for Le Pen will be how to handle her estranged father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen.  The two have been at odds since Marine Le Pen ousted him from the party and then moved to bring the party closer to the mainstream, cleaning up its image as a xenophobic party under the former paratrooper.   He is expected to show up at a FN political bureau meeting on Tuesday, at which his daughter has said he is not welcome.

Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca are in talks with the Italian and European authorities regarding precautionary recapitalisations, and Italy's finance minister said last week he expects a solution for the banks that does not include losses for senior creditors. The Italian authorities are particularly reluctant for senior debt to be bailed in, as many retail investors hold senior debt, and losses for them could hit financial stability. Senior bondholders would be vulnerable to losses if the banks were put into resolution, given their thin junior debt buffers. The Italian government passed a decree on 16 June that suspends reimbursement of subordinated bonds that mature within six months of a bank applying for a precautionary recapitalisation. This is to ensure buffers that should be available during burden-sharing do not decline because of debt maturities. The resolution of Popular, the first under the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, is a reminder that resolution is a possible outcome for Vicenza and Veneto, particularly if their precautionary recapitalisation falters. Their assessment for precautionary recapitalisation could be complicated by their plans to merge. However, Vicenza and Veneto's circumstances differ from those of Popular. The ECB had determined that Popular was  failing or likely to fail  due to its recent stressed liquidity situation, whereas the Italian banks' liquidity is supported by their issuance of state-guaranteed notes. Popular had a strong and willing buyer, Banco Santander, with good capital market access, but there do not appear to be any likely buyers for the Italian banks. The stronger domestic banks in Italy all have to prioritise reduction of their own legacy impaired assets, and acquiring a troubled bank together with its impaired assets could damage the buyer and worsen the problem. Many Italian banks contributed to rescue fund Atlante in 2016. The fund became the owner of Vicenza and Veneto after their capital increases. We warned then how the weaker Italian banks represent a contingent liability for the stronger and larger ones, and further calls on the stronger banks could put their creditworthiness at risk. Most have already taken significant impairments on their Atlante stakes in their 2016 financial statements. The precautionary recapitalisation process in Italy has been long, adding to investor concerns about the banking sector and damaging the deposit franchises of the troubled banks being assessed. Vicenza and Veneto's market shares have declined, including in their home region of the Veneto, where they were historically strong. They are therefore becoming less systemically important, which may reduce the likelihood of precautionary recapitalisation. Monte dei Paschi's precautionary recapitalisation follows its failed attempt to raise capital to cover its large volume of doubtful loans ( sofferenze ). But uncertainties remain. Receipt of public capital is conditional on the ECB confirming the bank is solvent and meeting Pillar 1 capital requirements, and on Italy obtaining formal confirmation from private investors that they will purchase the bank's portfolio of non-performing loans. Our 'CCC'/Rating Watch Evolving IDR for Vicenza reflects our view that there is a real possibility that losses could be imposed on senior bondholders if the bank does not receive fresh capital in a precautionary recapitalisation, as conversion or write-down of junior debt alone would not strengthen capitalisation sufficiently. We do not rate Veneto Banca. <a href= https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1024901 >Fitch Affirms Santander at 'A-'; Downgrades Popular's VR to 'f' Contact: Francesca Vasciminno Senior Director, Financial Institutions +39 02 87 90 87 225 Fitch Italia S.p.a.

We remain passionate about the opportunity and intend to continue pursuing discussions,  Liberty House said in an email to Reuters.  The Seoul-based private equity syndicate led by Newlake Alliance and JB Asset Management was named on June 15 as the preferred bidder over Liberty, and that was thought to be the end of more than a year of Morgan Stanley-led (MS.N) efforts to provide a financial rescue package to Arrium.  Morgan Stanley recommended the Newlake and JB Asset consortium to Arrium's committee of creditors, which overwhelmingly supported the South Korean group, according to the steelmaker's financial administrator, KordaMentha.  The creditors' committee includes Australian lenders Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), Westpac (WBC.AX) and ANZ Bank (ANZ.AX), which together are owed a combined A$1 billion ($761 million).  KordaMentha confirmed a revised bid had been submitted by Liberty House, but said administrators continued to deal with the Korean consortium on an exclusive basis.  South Australia state has pledged A$50 million to the new owner to help upgrade Arrium's steelworks.     A spokesman for the South Australia treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, said the state would work with either group to keep Arrium in business.  Newlake's and JB's bid proposes spending more than A$1 billion on the Whyalla upgrade and on Arrium's mini-mills, steel distribution and iron ore mining divisions. The consortium also plans to build a gas-fired power station to feed the steelworks, which would help combat South Australia's energy shortage.  Newlake has said it will use the Finex steelmaking technology under license from South Korean steelmaker POSCO (005490.KS) to revamp the Arrium's main Whyalla steelworks. The decision to use the technology played a key role in the selection process, according to KordaMentha.   Newlake and JB West were not immediately available for comment.  Liberty House, which operates together with commodities and energy conglomerate SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, hit the headlines last year when it offered to rescue steel plants owned by Tata Steel UK (TISC.NS) that were on the verge of shutdown.  Liberty's so-called green metal model is based on using renewable energy to fire furnaces and smelters that recycle local scrap and sell the finished metal to manufacturers.

The case pitted a Pennsylvania woman, Stephanie Lenz, against record company Universal Music Group (UMG), the Vivendi SA-owned unit that enforces Prince's copyrights. She sued Universal Music Group after it directed the video-sharing website YouTube to remove a 29-second video she had posted in 2007 that showed her 13-month-old son dancing to the 1984 song. The high court left in place a mixed September 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The legal question focused on whether copyright holders can face damages if they wrongly direct someone to take down content posted online that is protected by the  fair use  doctrine, which allows the use of copyrighted material in some circumstances without the permission of the rights holder. The appeals court decision could make it harder for copyright holders to remove content that they feel infringes upon copyright-protected works by invoking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law intended to curb movie and music piracy online. Critics contend that abusive takedown notices can suppress the freedom speech guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Lenz said that when she posted the video that was recorded in her kitchen she thought her family and friends would enjoy seeing the toddler, who had just learned to walk, dance as well. The boy, wearing a red outfit and a happy expression, is seen bouncing to the music while pushing a wheeled walking toy. But Universal Music Group persuaded YouTube to remove Lenz's video, citing a good faith belief that the video was unauthorized. Lenz had the video restored, and sued Universal over the takedown notice, seeking damages. A U.S. district court in California ruled partly in Lenz's favor. The ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit said there can be liability if a copyright holder  knowingly misrepresented  in a takedown notice that it had a good-faith belief that a video  did not constitute fair use.  But that decision also said courts should defer to a copyright holder who has a  subjective good-faith belief  to the contrary.

Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted as saying by the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that he expected the Saudi market to be included in the index by the end of 2018. MSCI will announce late on Tuesday whether it is putting Saudi Arabia on a list for possible index inclusion. Most funds think Riyadh has done enough to be included, but if MSCI follows its usual timetable, actual entry would occur in mid-2019. However, MSCI has the flexibility to move faster if it wishes. The Saudi stock index rose 2.4 percent, its largest single-day gain since November, although trading volume was only moderate.  Local funds which have been somewhat sceptical of MSCI putting Riyadh on review reacted to the comments made by the vice chairman,  said Mohamad al-Hajj, macroeconomic strategist at EFG Hermes. Some of the top-performing shares on Monday were those which may eventually be added to MSCI's standard emerging market index, including Banque Saudi Fransi, which jumped 7.5 percent, and medical insurer BUPA Arabia, up 6.0 percent. Although progress towards inclusion would be a net positive for the Saudi stock market, some analysts are cautious about speculative fever trumping fundamentals, which are not particularly supportive. Saudi Arabia's 12-month forward price-earnings ratio is 13.9 while the MSCI Emerging Market Index is at 12.  While we believe that inclusion in watch list for Saudi will lead to enhanced market liquidity and generate more interest in the Saudi market, we caution investors to be wary of irrational exuberance as inclusion is unlikely to change market fundamentals which currently remain tepid,  said a note by Alrajhi Capital. The government's petrodollar revenues remain under pressure and reforms planned for the next 12 months include another round of fuel and electricity price hikes and introduction of a value- added tax, which will raise costs for the private sector. Meanwhile, Dubai's National Central Cooling Co (Tabreed) surged its 15 percent daily limit to 2.12 dirhams after French power and gas group Engie agreed to buy a 40 percent stake for 2.8 billion dirhams ($763 million) from Abu Dhabi's Mubadala. Mubadala will convert its mandatory convertible bonds into shares, with 1.086 billion shares to be transferred to Engie at about 2.62 dirhams each. The Abu Dhabi fund will keep 42 percent after the deal has been approved by regulators. Analysts at Arqaam Capital said they were keeping their target price for the stock unchanged at 2.32 dirhams, as Tabreed's growth would benefit from Engie's experience but share buy-backs by the company were no longer likely. Drake & Scull climbed 1.2 percent after its acting chief financial officer told reporters that the company had not been affected by Qatar's diplomatic rift with some of its Gulf neighbours, although DSI was not bidding for new business in that country. DSI expects to complete a plan to reduce its capital by 75 percent by the end of the third quarter, deferring the process by one month, its chief executive said. The Dubai index added 0.4 percent. Qatar lost 1.3 percent with commodity-linked companies some of the worst performers as Brent oil stayed near its 2017 lows. Drilling rig provider Gulf International Services declined 4.0 percent and petrochemical maker Industries Qatar fell 2.7 percent. Abu Dhabi's index edged down 0.2 percent, weighed down by a 2.9 percent decline in Dana Gas, the most heavily traded stock on Monday.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. banks are profiting from higher official interest rates by not commensurately increasing the rates paid out on deposits, giving them an income advantage over their European peers. The question now is whether those margins - the widest in years - start to narrow if banks are forced to increase savings rates for customers. And if they do, will banks' profits and share prices come under pressure? The spread between U.S. commercial deposit rates and interbank Libor or official policy rates should, in theory, be thin. For most of the last quarter century it has been no more than 10 basis points either way although banks will try to ensure they retain some cushion. That's currently the situation with UK and euro zone banks. The spread between 1-month UK commercial deposit rates and 1-month sterling Libor is just 3 basis points, and the euro zone equivalent is 5 basis points. Of course, neither the Bank of England nor European Central Bank is raising rates. Far from it. British rates are a record low 0.25 percent, as is the ECB's deposit rate at minus 0.4 percent. Money market pricing suggests neither will rise any time soon. So there's far less scope for banks in Europe to take advantage of the widening spread between deposit and lending rates as is typically the case. But the Federal Reserve is raising rates, and the U.S. commercial deposit/Libor spread has widened lock step with the four hikes since December 2015. That spread is now over 100 basis points, the highest in 18 years. Barring a short-lived surge to 300 bps in mid-1999, it's the widest in 30 years. It should be noted that commercial deposits are not quite the proxy for wider bank funding they once were. California's First Republic Bank, for example, funded around 30 percent of its book via commercial deposits in 2002. That's now just under 10 percent. But overall net interest margin - the broadest measure of the gap between the interest paid on deposits and the interest earned on loans - is still the widest in years for U.S. banks, even if not quite as historic as the commercial deposit spread. According to BankRegData.com, the net interest margin across U.S. banks was 3.13 percent in the first quarter. That was the highest since 2014. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets note that U.S. bank deposits currently stand at a record $13 trillion, in large part thanks to the Fed's QE stimulus. They estimate that QE created between $1.6 trillion and $2.5 trillion of new bank deposits. But as the Fed prepares to reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, that will likely reverse. RBC expects U.S. bank deposits to shrink by $500 billion next year as QE is withdrawn, although the industry's organic growth should more than offset that.  Banks may be forced to increase deposit rates faster than expected in order to 'stem the tide',  they wrote in a note last week. Outperformance There are many reasons why U.S. banks have outperformed their European rivals recently, including: better cost control, stronger balance sheets, and expectations that President Trump would boost growth, cut corporate taxes and loosen regulation. Since the Fed's first rate hike in December 2015 U.S. financials have risen 25 percent, outstripping Wall Street's 19 percent rise. By contrast, UK bank stocks have gained 17 percent over the same period, underperforming the broader FTSE 100's 25 percent rally. Euro zone financials are barely up at all, while the benchmark Stoxx 50 index has risen 25 percent. But with the  Trump bump  evaporating and inflation remaining stubbornly low, the U.S. yield curve is flattening. The gap between two- and 10-year U.S. yields is now around 80 bps, the smallest gap since September last year. Flatter yield curves hurt banks, as the gap between the level they borrow at (short end) and lend at (long end) narrows. Another potential worry for U.S. banks in the months ahead.

Yousef al-Jaida said institutions from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which broke off diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, had about $18 billion of deposits in Qatari banks that would mature in two months. If necessary, the Qatari government will step in to cover those funds if they are withdrawn, and other banks in the QFC are still providing short-term U.S. dollar deposits to Qatar's banking sector, he told reporters.  Whether the blockade countries make a decision on retracting those deposits is yet to be seen. Those mature in a couple of months, so there's no impact as of yet. But this is a measure and a point that we are paying close attention to.  We've been in a worse crisis in 2008, a financial crisis not a political crisis, and the government was able to step in and buy out the default portfolios of loans and real estate at that time. If a need arises, the government can easily step in and enforce similar measures.  The QFC licenses foreign companies to exempt them from the Gulf state's local ownership laws. The centre has its own legal, regulatory, tax and business infrastructure, allowing for 100 percent foreign ownership and full repatriation of profits. Jaida said the QFC did not plan to take any action against companies from Saudi Arabia, the UAE or Bahrain in response to the sanctions by their governments, which accuse Doha of backing terrorism.  We do not intend to take any measures on any businesses in Qatar from the blockade countries. We have Saudi and Bahraini banks in the QFC,  he said.  It remains business as usual, and we intend to keep it that way. There are five companies at the QFC from Saudi and Bahrain.  However, Jaida said countries imposing the sanctions had restricted some of their companies from doing business in Qatar, which was affecting about $2 billion of these companies' contracts in areas such as construction, professional services and export of materials. He did not give details. The UAE central bank has asked banks to apply  enhanced customer due diligence  when dealing with six Qatari banks, making the UAE institutions reluctant to do fresh deals. Guidance from the Saudi and Bahraini central banks has also deterred new business with Qatar, bankers told Reuters. Roadshow Jaida said the QFC had cancelled plans to hold a roadshow for potential customers in Dubai this year because of the diplomatic rift. But he said there could be long-term benefits for the QFC and Qatar, as companies which had previously served Qatar from bases in neighbouring countries now had no option but to establish offices in Doha.  Law firms, consultancies, professional service companies were told not to access Qatar for no other reason than government decisions. We intend to leverage and take full advantage of this opportunity,  Jaida said. Qatari companies with operations in the Dubai International Financial Centre are now looking to pull them back to Qatar, he said, without giving details. The Qatar Exchange has been planning to introduce exchange-traded funds as part of a drive to develop the stock market. Jaida said this plan would not change despite the market's 8.6 percent tumble since the sanctions were introduced.  Coming to a product like an ETF, there might be an impact in terms of raising capital for that particular project. We intend to step in and launch that project regardless of whether there is capital or not,  he said, adding that the funds would be launched at the end of August or the start of September.

The case pitted a Pennsylvania woman, Stephanie Lenz, against record company Universal Music Group (UMG), the Vivendi SA-owned unit that enforces Prince's copyrights. She sued Universal Music Group after it directed the video-sharing website YouTube to remove a 29-second video she had posted in 2007 that showed her 13-month-old son dancing to the 1984 song. The high court left in place a mixed September 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The legal question focused on whether copyright holders can face damages if they wrongly direct someone to take down content posted online that is protected by the  fair use  doctrine, which allows the use of copyrighted material in some circumstances without the permission of the rights holder. The appeals court decision could make it harder for copyright holders to remove content that they feel infringes upon copyright-protected works by invoking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law intended to curb movie and music piracy online. Critics contend that abusive takedown notices can suppress the freedom speech guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Lenz said that when she posted the video that was recorded in her kitchen she thought her family and friends would enjoy seeing the toddler, who had just learned to walk, dance as well. The boy, wearing a red outfit and a happy expression, is seen bouncing to the music while pushing a wheeled walking toy. But Universal Music Group persuaded YouTube to remove Lenz's video, citing a good faith belief that the video was unauthorized. Lenz had the video restored, and sued Universal over the takedown notice, seeking damages. A U.S. district court in California ruled partly in Lenz's favor. The ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit said there can be liability if a copyright holder  knowingly misrepresented  in a takedown notice that it had a good-faith belief that a video  did not constitute fair use.  But that decision also said courts should defer to a copyright holder who has a  subjective good-faith belief  to the contrary.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-song-idUSL1N1JG0HY"},

A little over a month ago, the anti-immigration, anti-euro Natonal Front (FN) was dreaming of Le Pen winning the presidency and demanding a renegotiation of European Union treaties. But Le Pen was comfortably beaten by now-President Emmanuel Macron. Her defeat prompted a public row between senior party officials, and more barbs were traded after Sunday's parliamentary election which saw the party fall short of the 15 lawmakers required to form a parliamentary group, though it did quadruple its MP count to eight. Le Pen told reporters in her Henin-Beaumont stronghold that the phase of  overhauling  the FN had started.   I want this debate to be polite and friendly ... I will demand that this be the case,  Le Pen said. She expressed irritation at bickering among party officials, much of which focused on her close aide and deputy Florian Philippot, architect of her anti-euro economic policy that gives state intervention a big role.  It was neither the time nor the place to do so, on social media networks, and therefore publicly, right in the middle of parliamentary elections,  she said. The task for Le Pen is whether she can transform her party's growing popularity into more votes and real power. France's two-round voting system in both presidential and parliamentary elections has traditionally impeded the FN, which seeks a more proportional system of voting.  Rift Over Euro Central to the party debate will be whether it sticks with its policy of calling for an end to use of the euro currency and a return to the French franc. Polls show that most French oppose a switch away from the euro currency and Le Pen herself hinted she might soften her anti-euro stance, saying:  We need to ask ourselves what went well and what did not.  The party will also be looking at whether it continues to follow a strategy of calling itself  neither Right nor Left  with both right-wing anti-immigration policies and left-wing protectionist policies. Some party officials want to see the FN seek allies with other hard-right parties to try and break its political isolation. The findings of the party debate, including a meeting of top officials in late July, will go to party members in a much-broader party congress, expected to take place at the end of this year or the beginning of next.   Philippot, seen by some within the party as exerting too much influence over Le Pen, failed to win his seat on Sunday and may now find his position imperiled.  Gilbert Collard, another close Le Pen ally, who was re-elected and has long pressed for the FN to drop its anti-euro stance, told Sud Radio that Philippot spent  too much time in the media.  Philippot, who has said he will quit if the party drops its anti-euro policy, told BFM TV that the party had to avoid  hysteria . None of Philippot's closest allies won a parliamentary seat.  Another challenge for Le Pen will be how to handle her estranged father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen.  The two have been at odds since Marine Le Pen ousted him from the party and then moved to bring the party closer to the mainstream, cleaning up its image as a xenophobic party under the former paratrooper.   He is expected to show up at a FN political bureau meeting on Tuesday, at which his daughter has said he is not welcome.

The January-May total was 34.2 million tonnes, down 26 percent on last year's equivalent figure and the lowest read since 2014. The year-on-year drop in tonnage terms was 12.1 million, which is roughly what Canada, the world's 17th-largest producer, churned out over the full 12 months of 2016. The only recent historical comparison for such a dramatic and sustained drop in steel exports was 2009, when demand in the rest of the world was imploding in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. So what's happening this time around? Is this a sign that China's much-hyped capacity closure programme is finally starting to bear fruit? The rest of the world's producers would love to think so but the evidence suggests things are a little more complicated. Graphic on China's monthly exports of steel product: tmsnrt.rs/2rMrdIc Capacity Down, Production Up Beijing does targets well and it's already way ahead of its goal for steel capacity closures this year. A total 42.4 million tonnes were shut in the first five months of this year, representing 85 percent of the 50-million-tonne target, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. That follows 65 million tonnes of closures last year and brings the running count to over 100 million tonnes, now well within the 100-150 million range originally promised by China over a five-year period. The only problem is that these shutdowns have had no discernible impact on steel production. China produced 72.78 million tonnes in April, an all-time record. Production eased very slightly to 72.26 million tonnes in May but that was still the second-highest production month after April. This counterintuitive outcome is down to what exactly has been closed. The initial round of capacity elimination appears to have included a large amount of non-productive capacity, an easy win for producers and local governments looking to fall into line with the new national policy. A second focus has been on induction furnace operators. Such producers, using scrap rather than iron ore as their input and frequently accused of manufacturing sub-standard product, are largely unapproved and therefore  illegal  in the eyes of Beijing. For that reason they are also unreported. Millions of tonnes might be in the process of being closed but you won't see any ripple in the national production figures since they were never counted in the first place. What is visible, though, is the resulting jump in profitability of the official steel sector. The margin on construction-grade steel rebar has surged more than 800 percent this year to around 1,100 yuan ($162) per tonne in early June, according to data tracked by brokerage CLSA. With that sort of money to be made, it should be no surprise that China's steel producers are running faster than ever before. Stocks Down, Demand Up But quite evidently higher production has not fed into higher exports. Is there some form of voluntary restraint at work here? After all, China has recently been the subject of unprecedented political pressure to rein back its steel exports. Trade cases are piling up thick and fast. The European Union has just initiated another set of duties on Chinese steel, these ones on hot-rolled flat products , and the two entities are still duelling over the broader issues of Chinese overcapacity and, in Europe's eyes, over-exports. Meanwhile, the mother of all sanction packages is looming in the United States, where the Trump administration has been investigating steel imports on national security grounds. The so-called Section 232 probe is nearly done, according to U.S. officials. China might reasonably be expected to have taken some of the heat out of the diplomatic storm by stemming the flow of exports. Yet there is absolutely no sign of any build-up in steel inventory within China as might be expected if exports were being massaged by policymakers. Local consultancy Steel Home estimates that stocks of rebar SH-TOT-RBARINV and flat products such as cold rolled coil SH-TOT-CRCLINV have been falling in line with  normal  seasonal patterns. Interestingly, those of rebar have fallen harder and faster than those of coil, attesting to a broader divergence in fortune between those mills servicing the construction sector and those feeding the manufacturing sector. While the latter has been showing signs of weakness, construction is still booming. True, there are all sorts of warning signs flashing in terms of overheating prices in parts of the country's residential property sector. But investment in real estate, one of the broadest indicators published by the National Bureau of Statistics, is still running at an annual growth rate in excess of 6 percent, as has been the case since the most recent stimulus package kicked off at the start of last year. Graphic on real estate investment: tmsnrt.rs/2tjvwN8 For How Long? How long it can continue doing so is the subject of much debate among analysts. The consensus narrative is that the construction sector will start losing momentum imminently before entering a period of much slower growth over the second half of this year. A caveat to the consensus is that the strength and durability of the 2016 stimulus package have already surprised many commentators. But neither building activity nor those supercharged profit margins are going to run indefinitely. At some stage there will be a slowdown, which will feed quickly into the steel sector, and super-quickly if it coincides with seasonal weakness over the coming summer holiday season. Don't expect China's steel producers to adapt supply fast enough. Their track record is poor when it comes to adjusting production to changes in demand tempo. Rather, the pattern has tended to be for demand weakness to lead to falling prices, margin compression and accelerated exports. Current low export levels are first and foremost down to strong domestic demand. If that fades, Beijing's control over its leviathan steel sector and those politically toxic export flows is going to be put to the real test.

The case pitted a Pennsylvania woman, Stephanie Lenz, against record company Universal Music Group (UMG), the Vivendi SA-owned unit that enforces Prince's copyrights. She sued Universal Music Group after it directed the video-sharing website YouTube to remove a 29-second video she had posted in 2007 that showed her 13-month-old son dancing to the 1984 song. The high court left in place a mixed September 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The legal question focused on whether copyright holders can face damages if they wrongly direct someone to take down content posted online that is protected by the  fair use  doctrine, which allows the use of copyrighted material in some circumstances without the permission of the rights holder. The appeals court decision could make it harder for copyright holders to remove content that they feel infringes upon copyright-protected works by invoking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law intended to curb movie and music piracy online. Critics contend that abusive takedown notices can suppress the freedom speech guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Lenz said that when she posted the video that was recorded in her kitchen she thought her family and friends would enjoy seeing the toddler, who had just learned to walk, dance as well. The boy, wearing a red outfit and a happy expression, is seen bouncing to the music while pushing a wheeled walking toy. But Universal Music Group persuaded YouTube to remove Lenz's video, citing a good faith belief that the video was unauthorized. Lenz had the video restored, and sued Universal over the takedown notice, seeking damages. A U.S. district court in California ruled partly in Lenz's favor. The ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit said there can be liability if a copyright holder  knowingly misrepresented  in a takedown notice that it had a good-faith belief that a video  did not constitute fair use.  But that decision also said courts should defer to a copyright holder who has a  subjective good-faith belief  to the contrary.

The loonie rose 1.9 percent last week, its biggest advance since the first week of 2016.

At 9:47 a.m. ET (1347 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3227 to the greenback, or 75.60 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3211 to C$1.3260. It touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months on Wednesday at C$1.3165.     Speculators cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a third straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 88,595 contracts as of June 13 from 94,501 a week earlier.                   In May, net short positions reached a record high 99,109 contracts.     U.S. crude        prices were up 0.40 percent at $44.92 a barrel.     Prices of oil had come under pressure over the past month from rising production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria. Oil is one of Canada's major exports.           Canadian government bond prices were mixed across a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 3.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.916 percent and the 10-year             falling 5 Canadian cents to yield 1.528 percent.

South Africa is planning to build 9,600 megawatts (MW) of nuclear capacity to wean itself off coal, a project that could be one of the world's biggest nuclear contracts in decades. Besides Rosatom, major nuclear firms from South Korea, France, the United States and China are interested in bidding for it.  We are aiming for this to be done before the end of the year, and we very imminently want to start,  Kelvin Kemm, Necsa chairman, told Reuters on the sidelines of a nuclear conference in Moscow, when asked when South Africa would make a decision on which company would build the new nuclear reactors.  Rosatom is definitely in there, but a decision has not been finally made. That will be a decision made by the senior politicians in collaboration with the technological and the company people,  Kemm said. Earlier on Monday, a Rosatom official said the Russian company was in contact with South African authorities over their plans to increase the country's nuclear capacity. Those plans were disrupted after South Africa's High Court earlier this year deemed a nuclear cooperation pact with Russia unlawful. In May, state-controlled Rosatom said it was still committed to taking part in a competitive bidding process to build nuclear plants in South Africa. Rosatom was created in 2007 from the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry with a view to turning nuclear power into a major export industry for Russia. Necsa's Kemm said on Monday that the court ruling had delayed the country's plans by a couple of months. In response to a question as to whether Rosatom was a leading contender for the planned nuclear expansion, Kemm said:  Absolutely, Rosatom is a very important player . Reporting by Alexander Winning.

Sugar production in the world's third-biggest raw sweetener exporter will total 4.8 million tonnes in the 2017/18 season, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture, Resource Economics and Rural Sciences (ABARES) said, down from its previous estimate of 5.16 million tonnes in March. ABARES said Cyclone Debbie - a powerful cyclone that brought destructive winds and heavy rainfall across Australia's north east coast in March - was responsible for the production decline. Lower Australian raw sugar production will aid global benchmark prices, which hit a 16-month low last week on ample global supplies. Although Cyclone Debbie was unfavourable for Australian sugar production, the heavy rains across Australia's east coast will aid the country's dairy sector, ABARES said. Milk production during the 2017/18 season may reach 9.25 billion litres, up nearly 3 percent from the 8.9 billion litres forecast in March. The larger Australian milk production is a welcomed boost for Murray Goulburn, country's largest dairy processor, which has been hamstrung by lower supplies. Cyclone Debbie also aided Australian beef exports, ABARES said, as heavy rains across the country's largest cattle producing regions stimulated pasture growth. Beef exports from the world's No. 4 exporter during 2017/18 may climb to 1.035 million tonnes, ABARES said, up 3.5 percent from its March forecast of 1 million tonnes. ABARES said the increased supply of pasture will produce, on average, heavier cattle that will increase the amount of beef produced.

The S&P; technology sector is coming off its second straight weekly decline, triggered by fears of stretched valuations and investors moving money to other sectors. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's rally this year. Leading the rebound, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet were all up about 1.2 percent. Apple provided the biggest boost to the three major sectors. The tech sector's 1.25 percent rise led the gainers on the S&P; 500. Consumer staples stocks, which were battered on Friday after Amazon.com's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods, added to their losses in early trading. The deal by Amazon, a proven retail disruptor, marked a major step by the internet retailer into the brick-and-mortar retail sector. Wal-Mart, Target and Costco reversed premarket gains to trade lower.

New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy.

We suspect, an upholding of least one more rate hike will likely be supported,  said aid Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Last month, the U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs, well below the expected gain of 185,000, while other data showed a fall in retail sales and inflation below the Fed's target of 2 percent.

The company brought Japan's first passenger aircraft in half a century to the Paris Airshow, confirming that it is on track for first delivery of the 90-seat aircraft in mid-2020 and hoping to show potential customers that progress had been made despite delays and cost increases. Asked how many planes his company was hoping to sell, Yugo Fukuhara, vice president of sales and marketing at Mitsubishi Aircraft, told Reuters:  More than 1,000. That is the target during a 20-year time period.  Fukuhara said earlier on Monday that the programme has taken 427 orders so far.  All customers are committed to the programme and are very supportive,  he said in a reference to the announcement this year that the plane was delayed for two more years to redesign its wiring and meet requirements for certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Launch customer ANA, which has resorted to leasing jets and pushing back the retirement of older aircraft while its awaits the delayed MRJ, said on Sunday that it remains committed to the programme. Despite these setbacks, Fukuhara said that Mitsubishi would become one of two major regional jet manufacturers in a sector dominated by companies such as Brazil's Embraer and Canada's Bombardier.  We see more than 5,000 regional jet deliveries (for the sector) in the next 20 years. This segment of the market is very healthy and our goal is to establish a global customer base, Fukuhara said.

In a move that will fan tensions between Washington and Moscow, Russia made clear it was changing its military posture in response to the U.S. downing of a Syrian military jet on Sunday, something Damascus said was the first such incident since the start of the country's conflict in 2011. The Russian Defense Ministry said it was also scrapping a Syrian air safety agreement with Washington designed to avoid collisions and dangerous incidents with immediate effect. Moscow accused the United States of failing to honor the pact by not informing it of the decision to shoot down the Syrian plane despite Russian aircraft being airborne at the same time.  We view such actions by the U.S. command as a deliberate flouting of its obligations,  the Defense Ministry said in a statement. It said it expected the United States to now undertake an investigation into the shoot-down, to share the results, and to take corrective measures. Russia is one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most stalwart allies and is supporting him militarily with air power, advisers and special forces as he tries to roll back Islamic State and other militant groups. Unlike the United States, it says its presence is sanctioned by the Syrian government.    Calling the shooting-down a  cynical violation  of Syria's sovereignty and a breach of international law, Russia said the U.S. move amounted to  military aggression  against Syria and announced it was taking direct measures in response.   In areas where Russian aircraft are carrying out military tasks in the skies above Syria, any flying objects, including international coalition aircraft and drones found operating west of the River Euphrates, will be tracked by Russian land and air-based anti-aircraft ground systems as targets,  the ministry statement said. The U.S. Central Command issued a statement saying the downed Syrian military jet had been dropping bombs near U.S.-backed SDF forces, which are seeking to oust Islamic State from the city of Raqqa. It said the shooting-down was  collective self-defense  and the coalition had contacted Russian counterparts by telephone via an established  de-confliction line to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing .   Franz Klintsevich, a senior lawmaker on the upper house of parliament's defense and security committee, told RIA news agency that Russia would not automatically shoot down any object and that decisions would be taken on a case-by-case basis. He said aggressive acts by such objects would be  dealt with severely , however.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was cited earlier on Monday by Russian news agencies as telling the United States to respect Syria's territorial integrity and refrain from further unilateral action there.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov struck a tougher line than Lavrov, telling TASS the U.S. action was an  act of aggression in support of terrorists . Separately, Ryabkov told Interfax that the shooting down was a dangerous escalation and warned Washington not to use force against Syrian government troops.

The suspect was yanked from the cab of his van by a furious crowd as he sought to reverse and escape after injuring 10 people in what police said was a deliberate attack on Muslims that was being treated as terrorism. The man was being held down, beaten and kicked when Muslim cleric Mohammed Mahmoud stepped in to plead with people just to restrain him until police arrived.  We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him, around the assailant and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches. By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm,  Mahmoud said.  We managed to extinguish any flames of anger or mob rule that might have taken charge,  he told reporters, adding he was acting with  a group of mature brothers . The suspect had been shouting earlier  I've done my bit , aid Toufik Kacimi, the chief executive of the nearby Muslim Welfare House community centre, who praised the imam's courage.  (The imam's) bravery and courage helped calm the immediate situation after the incident and prevented further injuries and potential loss of life,  he said. If confirmed by authorities as terrorism, this would be the fourth such attack in Britain since March and the third to involve a vehicle driven at pedestrians. The suspect was described by police as a 48-year-old white man, who was taken into custody.  I've just seen sheer pandemonium. People on the floor screaming. People bleeding. I've seen the guy being held on the floor,  Ibn Oman told Reuters at the scene.  (The Imam) did the right thing. He had to stop people.  The London mayor praised the imam's actions.  Please Step Back  Mahmoud called on the incensed worshippers not to commit a sin during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.  The imam came from the mosque and he said, ‘Listen we are fasting, this is Ramadan, we are not supposed to do these kinds of things so please step back,’  said Mohammed, a 29-year-old cafe owner who was one of three men who held the suspect down, The Guardian newspaper reported.  For that reason this guy is still alive today,  he added.  He tried to run away but we brought him down. He would've died because so many people were punching him,  an eyewitness who gave his name as Abdul told The Independent. There were more angry scenes as police arrived and protected the accused man as he was put into a police vehicle. The van had hit people assisting an elderly man who had collapsed, and who later died. It was not clear if he died because of the attack, The attack comes just over two weeks after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. Since then incidents of hate crime have risen, police say.

In an interview with Reuters, Zinke outlined his approach to development and conservation in America's wildest spaces, and discussed how that philosophy was guiding his review of which national monuments created by past presidents should be rescinded or resized to make way for more business.  There is a social cost of not having jobs,  the former Montana Congressman and Navy Seal said in the interview on Friday.  Energy dominance gives us the ability to supply our allies with energy, as well as to leverage our aggressors, or in some cases our enemies, like Iran,  he said.  Former President Barack Obama, who oversaw a huge increase in domestic energy production during his tenure while strengthening environmental protections, had advocated reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Obama had also adopted a policy to factor in a  social cost of carbon  emissions from burning fossil fuels - which scientists believe drive global climate change - in making decisions about regulation and land protection.  While total U.S. oil production has risen to near records in the past decade, the share produced on federal land has dropped to a fifth in 2015 from more than a third in 2010, according to federal data from the Department of the Interior.  The administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to sweep away many Obama-era environmental and climate initiatives to bolster the U.S. oil, gas, and coal industries. Monument Review Zinke is in the midst of reviewing some 27 national monuments created since the 1990s and covering millions of acres of land mostly in Western states, as part of a plan by the Trump administration to expand development of public land. Zinke was in New England touring the region's monuments as part of the review.  At least six of those monuments are believed to hold oil, gas, and coal potential. [L8N1J65EW] Zinke issued his first major recommendation to President  Trump on one of the monuments last week, a reduction in the size of the 1.35 million acre Bears Ears National Monument in Utah created by Obama in his last days in office.

It was created by Obama last September to protect whales and newly discovered coral formations. During meetings with New England-based marine scientists, commercial fishermen and National Parks Service employees last week, Zinke argued that the Interior Department now makes around $15.5 billion per year less in revenue from offshore drilling than it did in 2008 due to Obama-era restrictions. Last month Zinke signed an executive order to lift some of those restrictions. He told Reuters he wants increased revenue from offshore to be used to finance a backlog of repairs throughout America’s national parks. Slideshow (9 Images)He was also in New England to gather input on the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine. He will later tour more monuments in Western states, and offer recommendations on all the monuments to Trump in August. Economy Before Environment On the last day of his New England monument tour in Boston, dressed in jeans and a belt with a cowboy style Montana buckle, Zinke met with officials and scientists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and New England Aquarium, followed by a roundtable discussion with commercial fishermen. Zinke argued the recent use of the Antiquities Act by presidents to create national monuments exceeded the intent of its creator President Theodore Roosevelt because they block development on too much land around the specific monument sites. Marine scientists gave Zinke a virtual tour of the Canyons monument at the New England Aquarium, and argued there was a need to preserve the area as a  reference point  to measure the impacts of climate change and overfishing.  Zinke later told Reuters he believed  there are legitimate scientific endeavors and research that are recognized and important (around the site), but there are also recognized livelihoods, fishing jobs that are also important.  During his tour, Zinke also fielded questions about the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact to fight climate change. Zinke defended the administration's decision, calling the agreement a bad deal for the United States.  Zinke later told Reuters while the U.S. government should find solutions to adapt to changing climate, jobs are a priority.  If you don’t have an economy you can’t afford to put in the environmental protections you need,  he said.

The comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, were among the first after the U.S. central bank hiked rates last week in the face of a series of soft inflation readings.    This is actually a pretty good place to be  with unemployment at 4.3 percent and inflation at about 1.5 percent, Dudley told the North Country Chamber of Commerce in Plattsburg, New York.   We are pretty close to full employment,  he said.  Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up and with that, inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent.   Price readings have edged lower over the past few months, raising questions about the Fed's general plan to boost rates one more time before the year-end, and another three times next year. Last week's hike was the central bank's third in six months. Asked about a so-called flattening of yields in the bond market, which suggest investors are skeptical that this Fed policy-tightening cycle will last much longer, Dudley said pausing policy now could raise the risk of inflation surging and hurting the economy.  He said he did not read the market move as a negative signal for the U.S. economy, but rather one that reflects low overseas inflation and borrowing costs.   I am very confident  that economic expansion  has quite a long ways to go,  Dudley said, adding he expected wage growth to rise to about 3 percent over the next year or two.

Dudley said that halting the tightening cycle now would imperil the economy, adding that with unemployment at 4.3 percent and inflation at about 1.5 percent,  this is actually a pretty good place to be.”                  “He said that it would be a mistake for the Fed to stop tightening now,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president in fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.      “Generally Dudley has been one of the doves on the committee, so this would signal that the tightening agenda continues,” Hurley said.     Benchmark 10-year note yields jumped to as high as 2.18 percent on Dudley’s comments, up from a low of 2.14 percent overnight.     Prices had firmed overnight on safety buying after a van hit worshippers near a London mosque, adding to concerns about rising attacks.                  The 10-year notes were last down 4/32 in price to yield 2.17 percent            .     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to a three-month low of 100 basis points, as hawkish Fed policy weighed on intermediate-dated notes but long bonds were supported by tepid inflation.      With no major economic releases or supply this week to sway market direction most investors were continuing to evaluate Fed policy.     Yields have risen from seven-month lows since the Fed on Wednesday increased interest rates for the second time in three months and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.                  Bond weakness has been capped, however, by concerns about weak economic indicators.     Data released before the Fed meeting on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, suggesting a softening in domestic demand.

Chao, who opened the U.S. Pavillion at the world's oldest and largest air show, underscored the importance of aerospace in bilateral trade ties between the United States and France and said 387 U.S. companies were exhibiting this year. In an interview, Chao sought to reassure critics in the U.S. Congress by saying moves to privatize U.S. air traffic control functions would not affect safety, and that the goal was to improve the flying experience for all passengers.  We want to do this in a deliberative and thoughtful way. Once the U.S. Congress passes this proposal, there is a three-year transition period. If that is not enough, we will of course provide a lengthier time to ensure a smooth transition,  she said. U.S. President Donald Trump this month outlined a plan to  privatize the U.S. air traffic control system to modernize it and lower flying costs, but his proposal drew immediate criticism from Democrats who said it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the aegis of an independent, non-profit entity.  This  cooperative  would plough all financial gains back in to improve the air traffic control system to fund further improvements, Chao said.  The issue is efficiency,  she said, adding the goal was also to ensure user fees for general aviation were not too high.  The really important thing is that the air traffic control system will be liberated from government constraints, which slows it down so much, in so many ways,  she said.  Chao also noted there would be no physical movement of air traffic control assets, with the changes focused on governance and financial structure.  No one will be detecting any changes when this transition occurs,  she said. Chao noted that 60 other countries had already privatized their air traffic control systems. Michael Britt, a senior adviser to Chao, said U.S. officials visited the Canadian air traffic control providers several weeks ago with a delegation of 30 U.S. lawmakers, and the Canadian system could provide a solid model for the U.S. reform effort. Together with infrastructure investments, the air traffic control reform is one of the Trump administration's biggest priorities, Britt said. He said the administration was working with critics in Congress to make the effort as bipartisan as possible. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years.

In a move that will fan tensions between Washington and Moscow, Russia made clear it was changing its military posture in response to the U.S. downing of a Syrian military jet on Sunday, something Damascus said was the first such incident since the start of the country's conflict in 2011. The Russian Defense Ministry said it was also scrapping a Syrian air safety agreement with Washington designed to avoid collisions and dangerous incidents with immediate effect. Moscow accused the United States of failing to honor the pact by not informing it of the decision to shoot down the Syrian plane despite Russian aircraft being airborne at the same time.  We view such actions by the U.S. command as a deliberate flouting of its obligations,  the Defense Ministry said in a statement. It said it expected the United States to now undertake an investigation into the shoot-down, to share the results, and to take corrective measures. Russia is one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most stalwart allies and is supporting him militarily with air power, advisers and special forces as he tries to roll back Islamic State and other militant groups. Unlike the United States, it says its presence is sanctioned by the Syrian government.    Calling the shooting-down a  cynical violation  of Syria's sovereignty and a breach of international law, Russia said the U.S. move amounted to  military aggression  against Syria and announced it was taking direct measures in response.   In areas where Russian aircraft are carrying out military tasks in the skies above Syria, any flying objects, including international coalition aircraft and drones found operating west of the River Euphrates, will be tracked by Russian land and air-based anti-aircraft ground systems as targets,  the ministry statement said. The U.S. Central Command issued a statement saying the downed Syrian military jet had been dropping bombs near U.S.-backed SDF forces, which are seeking to oust Islamic State from the city of Raqqa. It said the shooting-down was  collective self-defense  and the coalition had contacted Russian counterparts by telephone via an established  de-confliction line to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing .   Franz Klintsevich, a senior lawmaker on the upper house of parliament's defense and security committee, told RIA news agency that Russia would not automatically shoot down any object and that decisions would be taken on a case-by-case basis. He said aggressive acts by such objects would be  dealt with severely , however.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was cited earlier on Monday by Russian news agencies as telling the United States to respect Syria's territorial integrity and refrain from further unilateral action there.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov struck a tougher line than Lavrov, telling TASS the U.S. action was an  act of aggression in support of terrorists . Separately, Ryabkov told Interfax that the shooting down was a dangerous escalation and warned Washington not to use force against Syrian government troops.

Twenty years after Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, scores of mainland professionals are filling the elite financial ranks of Hong Kong, while a series of lay-offs at Western banks has led to an exodus of expatriates. The largest increase in mainland staff over the past decade has come in investment banks, with 80 percent seeing an increase of at least 20 percent, according to a 2015 Financial Services Development Council survey.   It has a much better environment than Beijing where I used to work,  said Hong Hao, a managing director at BOCOM International, who has lived in Hong Kong for five years.  The food is good, and the tax rate is also good.   Tax rates in Hong Kong are around 15-17 percent, while they can be as much as 45 percent in mainland China.  Chinese initial public offerings (IPO) dominate the Hong Kong market, the world's largest IPO market in 2016 when mainland offerings represented 80 percent of all new listings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Hong Kong's financial services industry accounts for 18 percent of the territory's economy, compared with just 10.4 percent in 1997 when the city returned to Chinese rule. Expat Customers Fall Evan Zhang, a 26-year-old from Guangdong province, is one of those new kids on the block in Hong Kong. For Zhang, one of the younger hires at CITIC Securities International, the increasing outward flow of Chinese capital in recent years is an opportunity.   With Chinese people more willing now to allocate assets overseas, and overseas investors willing to invest in China, I can play a go-between role to help them,  he said.  As top banks such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Bank of America trim their Asia headcount, businesses across Hong Kong have taken a direct hit. Bo Innovation, a Michelin-star restaurant, said its Western expat customers fell roughly 10 percent in the last 10 years, according to owner and executive chef Alvin Leung. Mainland clients increased by about the same percentage, he added. Western companies are also increasingly turning to more affordable locations such as Quarry Bay, at a time when Chinese companies are boosting their presence in the prime Central district, according to Tom Gaffney, a managing director at real estate services firm CBRE.  The value of a typical expat package for middle managers in Hong Kong, has fallen by two percent in U.S. dollar terms over the past five years, while the value of their benefits has fallen five percent over the same period, according to consultancy firm ECA International.  I have seen an enormous change in the expat landscape and packages offered,  said Christine Davis, a manager at international relocation firm The Santa Fe Group who was an expat in Hong Kong in 1999-2001 and again since 2011.          Everything was paid for by hosting companies in the past, she said, but now expat terms had been reduced  drastically .  Hong Kong dropped two places to 13th in the world in HSBC's 2016 Expat Explorer Survey, which measures various aspects of expat life.    Easier to Recruit  The new expat environment is making its easier to recruit talent. Several Chinese brokerages, asset management firms, and a Big Four Chinese bank told Reuters in recent months they intend to expand and hire more people in Hong Kong.  When I first joined the company 14 years ago, we could barely recruit the right people as we couldn't offer a good salary,  said Chen Shuang, chief executive of China Everbright Ltd, the Hong Kong investment arm of state-owned China Everbright Group.  But now, it's much easier to recruit top talent, even those from large Wall Street banks, which was unimaginable in the past.  Some senior Chinese bankers, such as managing directors and department heads, now earn more than their Western counterparts, which offer compensation of about $1 million a year, including base salary and cash bonus, according to executive recruiter Bernard Yeo of Bo Le Associates. On the flip side, junior Chinese bankers are typically paid 20 to 30 percent less than their foreign counterparts and enjoy a less generous package that excludes housing, school fees, and club memberships enjoyed by many Western expats, Yeo said.  The changing demographics of the financial industry is reflected in the local economy. Restaurants featuring provincial mainland Chinese cuisine, like Old Beijing restaurant and San Xilou, which offers spicy Sichuanese fare, are doing well, restaurant managers say. So are serviced apartment companies, English learning programs, and Audis, a popular car brand among Chinese.    In contrast,  Trattoria Doppio Zero, a popular Italian restaurant in the central business district, has seen over a 10-percent drop in its customers the last three years, said manager Jeffrey Ko.

Michael Britt, a senior adviser to Chao, said U.S. officials visited the Canadian air traffic control providers several weeks ago with a delegation of 30 U.S. lawmakers, and the Canadian system could provide a solid model for the U.S. reform effort. Together with infrastructure investments, the air traffic control reform is one of the Trump administration's biggest priorities, Britt said. He said the administration was working with critics in Congress to make the effort as bipartisan as possible. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years.

The issuance, expected to price later on Monday, came as a surprise, as Finance Minister Luis Caputo has said Argentina would meet the rest of its financing needs in non-dollar currencies after selling $7 billion in dollar bonds in January.

That 178-year-old event - known for its blazers, boaters and boozing - comes 10 days from now. The splash and sparkle along the river this time was from the Henley Women's Regatta. One of the world's premier women's rowing events, the HWR celebrated its 30th anniversary over three days with a record number of entrants, now totaling more than 1,800 rowers from 190 clubs across the world. Crews came from Britain, Ireland, Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and Switzerland - all vying for 25 different trophies in 214 races featuring 418 entries. It was a far cry from the one-day, 109-entry, 97-race  launch in 1988, when women's rowing was still relatively rare and had only been included in the Olympics 12 years earlier.  There was little place then, for example, at the more well-known - and famously traditional - Henley Royal event, which squeezed in only a few invitational races.  Women did not have a chance to row at Henley Royal,  said Miriam Luke, the HWR's chairman.  (Now at HWR )we have elites, top clubs, academic, juniors, intermediates.      Luke herself is something of a women's rowing trailblazer. Freya Reid, cox for Henley Rowing Club, is seen before a race at the Henley Women’s Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, Britain, June 17, 2017. Picture taken June17, 2017.Jeremy GauntShe won silver at the 2000 Olympics in the quadruple scull - Britain's first women's crew to medal - and gold at the 1998 world championships in the double scull, among other awards. Henley Royal Regatta now has some women's events, which the better crews at HWR stay on for, getting, as Luke puts it,  two bites at the cherry .    But for women-only regattas HWR is in a fairly exclusive class. There is a women's Tideway Head of the River in London and the college-only U.S. NCAA women's rowing championships, as well, of course, as the women's events in the Olympics and worlds. Slideshow (2 Images)Luke says women's rowing has grown in leaps and bounds in part because it thrives on a special closeness between athletes that you do not necessarily get in individual or other team sports.  It's a different sort of niche sport,  she said.  You build a lot of community with the women you row with.  Organizers estimate that around 30,000 people attended the three-day regatta, which was free for spectators, many of whom were young women like those in the boats. Nicholas Edwards, a Henley local and father of one of the rowers, looked on with a mixture of pride and joy.  It is such a collective spirit,  he said of the regatta, which is a far more relaxed affair than the longer-running event.  It really celebrates women's achievement,  he said.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar had still not received any demands from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which severed relations two weeks ago, triggering the worst Gulf Arab crisis in years. The countries accuse Qatar of supporting Islamist militants and stirring up unrest, charges Doha denies.  Qatar is under blockade, there is no negotiation. They have to lift the blockade to start negotiations,  Sheikh Mohammed told reporters in Doha.  Until now we didn't see any progress about lifting the blockade, which is the precondition for anything to move forward.  He said Kuwait's ruler was the sole mediator in the crisis and that he was waiting for specific demands from Gulf states in order to take resolution efforts forward.  We cannot just have (vague) demands such as 'the Qataris know what we want from them, they have to stop this or that, they have to be monitored by a foreign monitoring mechanism,'  Sheikh Mohammed said. Anything that relates to the affairs of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council is subject to negotiation, he said, referring to the body comprising Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman.  Anything not related to them is not subject to negotiation. No one has the right to interfere in my affairs. Al Jazeera is Qatar's affairs, Qatari foreign policy on regional issues is Qatar's affairs. And we are not going to negotiate on our own affairs,  he said. Qatar's Gulf critics have accused Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected those accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. The crisis has hit civilian travel, some food imports, ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf and sown confusion among businesses. But it has not affected energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar would rely on other states if the boycott continued, including Saudi Arabia's arch regional foe Iran.  We have a back-up plan which depends mainly on Turkey, Kuwait and Oman,  he said.  Iran has facilitated for us the sky passages for our aviation and we are cooperating with all countries that can ensure supplies for Qatar.

The allegations, relating to the financing of AfD's 2014 Saxony state election campaign, are another blow for a party that has seen its standing in the polls collapse as a global tide of populism recedes following Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. The perjury allegations, first raised by rival political parties and which Petry denies, involve claims that she and her colleagues gave differing accounts of candidates' campaign finances. Petry, the party's co-chairman, is AfD's best-known politician. Prosecutors decided in May 2016 that there were solid enough grounds to start a preliminary investigation into the matter. Their request to have Petry's immunity lifted suggests they may be preparing to push ahead with charges against her.  The request for Frauke Petry's immunity to be lifted has no impact on how we see the party's position,  leading party member Alexander Gauland said.  She has our backing. There is a presumption of innocence.  The Saxony state parliament will now hold hearings to decide whether her immunity is to be lifted, at which Petry will be invited to make her own submissions.  We can confirm that we received a request to lift the immunity from Frauke Petry,  Saxony state parliament spokesman Thomas Schubert said. The parliament's immunity committee will discuss the issue and let Petry explain her view on the matter.  We don't expect a final decision before the parliamentary summer break. This means there won't be a decision before late August,  Schubert said. AfD is likely to enter Germany's federal parliament for the first time in September's elections, in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term in office. Last year, concerns over mass immigration by Syrian war refugees and the potential costs of the eurozone debt crisis propelled the anti-EU party's support to new highs of above 15 percent in polls. Its support has crumbled since, however, with AfD last week polling around 8 percent in surveys, only slightly above the minimum threshold of 5 percent needed to gain representation in the Bundestag parliament.

The feud between the children of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, over the future of the family home erupted publicly last week in a flurry of accusations and denials through press releases and Facebook postings, which also touched  on Lee Hsien Loong's leadership. The prime minister's brother, Lee Hsien Yang, and sister, Lee Wei Ling, said they had lost confidence in their older brother as a leader and feared that state power would be used against them in their dispute with him. Prime Minister Lee denied the allegations made by his siblings, and said he would make a statement on the charges and answer questions when parliament sits on July 3.  I deeply regret that this dispute has affected Singapore's reputation and Singaporeans’ confidence in the government,  the prime minister said in a statement and a video message posted on his Facebook page.

Lee Hsien Yang, who said he and his wife would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened, has no immediate comment.  Lee Wei Ling could not be immediately reached for comment. In his last will, part of which was released by Lee Hsien Yang on Thursday, Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled Singapore for three decades, said he wanted his house, a humbly furnished home near the bustling Orchard shopping district, to be demolished.

Provided to solvent European banks experiencing a temporary loss of funding during crises, Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) has kept many afloat, with Greek lenders still relying on the lifeline from the euro zone's national central banks. But critics argue it is not transparent and was used for political purposes at the height of the Greek crisis, forcing Athens to take unpopular action to stave off the collapse of banks and the ejection of the country from the currency bloc. Transparency International said this year that the ECB used the 'technical task' of ELA to exert pressure on Athens, without publicly communicating the details of its ELA decisions.  No other central bank in the world holds that power – no decision by the US Fed could result in the ejection of a state from the Union,  the anti-corruption watchdog said in March. ELA will be provided for at least 100 basis points above the ECB's marginal lending rate, which currently stands at 0.25 percent, putting the minimum cost of the emergency loan at 125 basis point, the ECB said in the refreshed ELA guidelines. Banks on ELA must provide a funding plan within two months of receiving ELA and this needs to be updated every quarter while it receives liquidity help, the ECB said. Banks also need to report regulatory capital ratios on a monthly basis and may also need to prepare a recapitalisation plan. If ELA, provided by each country's central bank, is given for more than six months, a detailed exit strategy must also be presented. Any extension of ELA beyond one year requires justification on a monthly basis and also the support of the rate-setting Governing Council. The ECB added that ELA is not legal if used to fund obligations to the state, as it would constitute monetary financing.

Some investors consider this a hefty price tag given that the Berlin-based company has yet to turn a profit and faces fierce competition from regional players like Britain's Just Eat (JE.L) and the Netherlands' Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), as well as global groups like Amazon (AMZN.O).and Uber [UBER.UL].  Delivery Hero will become the fourth major online food delivery firm to go public in the past few years globally, following Grub Hub (GRUB.N), Just Eat and Takeaway.com, which have all seen their shares soar since listing. The sale will provide a much-needed boost to German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which holds a 35 percent stake in Delivery Hero, making it the biggest holding in its portfolio. The initial public offering in Frankfurt, which includes the sale of new shares, is part of Delivery Hero's plans to grow and fend off the threat from Uber and Amazon.     Major European investors are expected to jump in and buy shares in the IPO because of the online food delivery market's growth potential. But there are also concerns about increasing competition.  I haven’t been inspired to look at it. , said Steve Sherman, who manages European equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.  Our challenge with the delivery aggregation companies has been the limited barriers to competition, which make us worry that they won’t make much money even if the demand is good,  he said.  Perhaps Delivery Hero will be different.   Delivery Hero has invested heavily to expand globally and is now present in 42 markets in Europe, Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific.  It has access to a total delivery market worth 72 billion euros ($80.65 billion), a source familiar with the matter said. This compares with 28 billion euros for smaller British rival Just Eat, which operates in 12 markets, and 13 billion euros for Dutch competitor Takeaway.com, which is present in about 10 markets, the source said.  The valuation is punchy ... but it's the same for any growth business across industries as investors are desperate for growth , one fund manager at a major European institutional investor said.  Food delivery offers a huge potential if you consider that only about 80 percent of restaurants do deliveries.  Delivery Hero's margins at 10-11 percent currently lag its competitors, with Just Eat at 15 percent and Grub at 17 percent. But it could boost margins to 13 percent when it handles the delivery itself, and still has room to raise fees, the source familiar with the matter said.  Just Eat and Takeaway.com trade at between 6 and 6.5 times expected 2019 sales, according to a Breakingviews calculation based on forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. To achieve a similar multiple, Delivery hero would need to double its sales by 2019. Delivery Hero, which has a delivery network for 271,000 restaurants in more than 40 countries, said 2016 sales rose 79 percent to 297 million euros, or 71 percent after accounting for disposals and acquisitions. Two bankers not involved in the deal said they expected Delivery Hero's fundraising would be successful. They think the company is well positioned to succeed thanks to its global footprint and strong backers, which include Rocket Internet. An investment in Delivery Hero by South African e-commerce firm Naspers (NPNJn.J) last month also sent an encouraging signal. Delivery Hero will offer a total of 39 million shares, with 19 million of which priced at 22.00 to 25.50 euros apiece via a capital increase, Delivery Hero said on Monday. Fifteen million shares will come from existing shareholders. An additional 5.1 million shares indirectly held by Rocket could be placed in an over-allotment, Delivery Hero said. The shares are expected to start trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on June 30. Founded in 2011, Delivery Hero has grown rapidly and now employs over 6,000 people, providing a digital platform to order meals from more than 150,000 restaurants in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.

Abe also said he would start thinking  carefully  about reshuffling his cabinet and key party posts to get the right people to push ahead with reforms. But he did not confirm a Nikkei business daily report that he would do so in August or September, and would retain Finance Minister Taro Aso and ally Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshide Suga. A slew of public opinion polls have showed support for Abe's cabinet slumping sharply, with the Mainichi newspaper reporting that his ratings had fallen 10 points to 36 percent, the biggest drop since he took office in December 2012.  Non-support for Abe rose to 44 percent, the first time it surpassed the percentage of backers since October 2015, after parliament enacted controversial security laws expanding the scope for military activities overseas, the Mainichi said. Last week, the education ministry unearthed documents that the opposition said suggested Abe wanted a new veterinary school run by a friend to be approved in a state-run special economic zone. The ministry had earlier said it could not find the documents but reopened the investigation under public pressure. Abe has denied abusing his authority to benefit his friend. On Monday, he repeated that procedures had not been  distorted  but acknowledged the government needed to win back public trust.  We must calmly explain each policy one by one so we can win the trust of Japanese citizens,  Abe told a news conference marking the end of parliament's latest session on Sunday.   I have renewed my determination to do so.  Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends a news conference after close of regular parliament session at his official residence in Tokyo, Japan, June 19, 2017.Toru Hanai'Arrogance' Opposition politicians and media have identified Abe's friend as Kotaro Kake, the director of the Kake Educational Institution, which plans to open a veterinary department. The government has not approved new veterinary schools for decades because of concern about a glut of veterinarians. Almost three-quarters of voters in the Mainichi survey were not convinced by the government's insistence there was nothing wrong with the approval process. The institution has said it had acted appropriately. Voters were split over parliament's enactment of a law to penalize conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes.  But many expressed distaste for the ruling coalition's tactics in rushing the bill through parliament. The ruling bloc took the rare step of skipping a vote in committee and going directly to a full upper house session. Experts said voters were irked at signs Abe was guilty of hubris after more than four years in office with no serious rivals, but for now they were betting he could ride out the storm.  The public doesn't like the arrogance, but they don’t like the alternatives even more than they don’t like Abe,  said Columbia University professor emeritus Gerry Curtis. Ruling Liberal Democratic Party support far outstripped that of the opposition Democratic Party, the polls showed.

The agreement, valued at $4.7 billion at current list prices, includes a new order for 20 planes and a conversion of 20 of SpiceJet's 737 MAX 8 aircraft from an existing order, the companies said at the Paris Airshow. SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said the 190-230-seat aircraft was right for India's growth, the fastest in global aviation.  As happens in many countries growing at the pace at which India is growing, many airports are running out of capacity and for those airports this is a perfect aircraft,  he told a news conference. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. It operates a fleet of 35 Boeing 737s and 20 Bombardier Q400s, agreed in January to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The budget carrier plans to grow its operational fleet to 200 airplanes by the end of the decade and expand regionally with the new 737 MAX family of airplanes.

His comments came at a joint news conference with his Turkish counterpart Binali Yildirim in Athens  The Greek justice system has ruled on this issue ... and this decision must be fully respected,  Tsipras said in response to a question. Turkey alleges the men were involved in efforts to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan last July and has repeatedly demanded they be sent back. Related CoverageTurkey respects Greece's decision not to extradite soldiers over coup, PM saysThe soldiers fled to Greece in a military helicopter last year as the coup against Erdogan unfolded. Greek courts have blocked two extradition requests by Ankara, drawing an angry rebuke from Turkey and highlighting the often strained relations between the NATO allies, who remain at odds over issues from territorial disputes to ethnically-split Cyprus.  We would like Greece to extradite those who clearly staged a coup against our nation,  Yildirim said.  We respect the judiciary's decision, but we do not want these putschists to strike a blow to Turkish-Greek relations,  he said. Monday's meeting was held against the backdrop of a fresh reunification bid in Cyprus, divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. The two countries and Britain will participate in peace talks along with the two estranged Cypriot sides in Switzerland on June 28. Mediators are seeking an accord on security arrangements in a post-settlement Cyprus, if the sides agree on a peace deal.  Turkey has some 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus, a contentious point for Greek Cypriots who want their withdrawal. Yildirim said Greece and Turkey had decided to  contribute in every positive way  to a Cyprus settlement.  The solution of the Cyprus issue should guarantee the security and future of Turkish and Greek people living on the island,  he said. Under a 1960 treaty, Britain, Turkey and Greece can intervene in Cyprus in the event of a breakdown of constitutional order. Greek Cypriots want the system dismantled and a withdrawal of troops, while Turkish Cypriots want some Turkish guarantees to continue.

The cargo, worth about $5 million dollars, was the first in what officials from the two countries hope will be many flights allowing Afghan and Indian companies to bypass Pakistan, which strictly limits the shipment of goods by land between India and Afghanistan and is often involved in border disputes with them.  Our aim is to change Afghanistan to an exporter country,  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said at a ceremony marking the inaugural flight.  As long as we are not an exporter country, then poverty and instability will not be eliminated.  The cargo service aims to improve landlocked Afghanistan's links to markets abroad and boost the growth prospects of its agricultural and carpet industries while it battles a deadly Taliban insurgency, Indian officials have said.  We will continue to assist you in various ways as this corridor expands and grows into a network of cargo flights as per demand of the market,  India's ambassador to Afghanistan, Manpreet Vohra, told Ghani.  There are bound to be some teething problems in any major initiatives such as this but my embassy and my government is committed to working together with your team to resolve all issues that may pop up from time to time.  Afghanistan depends on the Pakistani port of Karachi for its foreign trade. It is allowed to send a limited amount of goods overland through Pakistan into India, but imports from India are not allowed along this route. Border crossings are often closed as Afghan and Pakistani forces clash over the disputed border, and Afghan farmers have complained of fruit and other produce rotting without other options for shipping. Next week, a second flight to India is scheduled to depart from the southern city of Kandahar, carrying 40 tons of dried fruit.

So far, sanctions against Doha imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have stopped well short of compelling banks under their jurisdiction - including regional branches of international banks - to unload Qatari assets. The UAE central bank asked banks to apply  enhanced customer due diligence  when dealing with six Qatari banks, making UAE institutions reluctant to do fresh deals. Guidance from the Saudi and Bahraini central banks has also deterred new business. But banks across the Gulf have mostly held onto their existing stock of Qatari bonds and loans, hoping to avoid mass selling that could force them to book losses. That could change, however, if the diplomatic crisis drags on and Saudi Arabia or the UAE decide to impose harsher sanctions on Qatar, which they accuse of backing terrorism - an allegation Doha denies. For example, there could be formal or informal guidance to banks to dump Qatari debt. Local banks in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, many of them partly state-owned, would find it hard to ignore such guidance, and once their selling had begun, international banks might sell to avoid losses. “From a new transaction perspective, people are already extra-cautious, but for existing paper at the moment the sanctions have no implication,  said a Dubai-based lawyer specialising in debt capital markets.  But if the UAE central bank tells banks they cannot hold Qatari paper, you might expect a fire sale in tradable securities such as bonds and sukuk, which would be sold to international buyers.  The lawyer spoke on condition of anonymity because his firm, like many others in the region, has responded to the political tensions by asking its lawyers to refrain from commenting publicly on Qatar-related issues. Since early 2014, over $20 billion in international bonds have been issued from Qatar by companies, banks and the government, Thomson Reuters data shows. Yields on Qatar’s sovereign dollar bonds jumped over 40 basis points after the sanctions were announced on June 5 but have since fallen back nearly 20 bps, suggesting many bank investors still see Qatar as attractive. Some Qatari corporate bonds have been hit much harder. Loans A ban on holding Qatari assets could be more disruptive to loans than to bonds, another debt capital markets lawyer in Dubai said. That is because banks which extended the loans would search the documentation for ways to force borrowers to repay the loans early.  A bank could go back to the loan documentation to trigger prepayments based on illegality clauses,  he said. A ban imposed by the UAE would affect not only UAE banks but also loans that international banks had booked from their UAE branches, the lawyer added. The UAE serves as the Gulf's main banking centre. Qatari banks and companies have raised more than $23 billion through syndicated loans since early 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Lenders would search documentation for the right to declare  force majeure  - an unforeseeable event freeing them from their obligation. Many or most loan documents have a clause providing for this, bankers said. Michael O’Kane, senior partner at legal firm Peters & Peters in London, who has expertise in international sanctions, said: “Force majeure can usually only be relied upon with confidence if explicitly set out in a clause in the loan agreement, and if the sanctions imposed trigger that clause.  Sanctions would have to be official to permit banks to act, said a Dubai-based banker at an international financial institution with heavy exposure to Qatari banks; unofficial guidance would not give them enough justification. A European banker said his institution, which has traditionally lent extensively to Qatari banks, was not taking any action at this stage, though credit departments in the industry were becoming nervous. “There aren't many Qatari loans maturing before the end of this year so there is no pressure to do new business and quite a lot of time for the situation to unfold,  he said. Banks could also try to sell Qatari loans in the secondary market. When Russia was hit by economic sanctions in 2014 the secondary loan market was flooded with Russian paper, and the same happened with Turkish loans after the coup attempt in Turkey last year, traders said. So far, Qatari loans do not appear to have suffered the same fate. Some of Qatar National Bank's loan paper was spotted in the secondary market this month, a trader said, but he added that the price had not dropped and that Qatari banks’ loans remained very illiquid – suggesting most banks were still holding their Qatari exposure.

Mejia said that employees of the capital's subway, which has for years been closely controlled by the ruling Socialist Party, made announcements over loudspeakers warning of delays due to  a group of opposition sympathizers.  Maduro's critics say he is seeking to forge dictatorship through a legislative superbody known as a constituent assembly to be elected on July 30 in a vote opposition leaders say is rigged in favor of the Socialists.

Luis Vera, 20, was crushed by a car in the oil region of Zulia, while Jose Gregorio Perez was hit in the face in the mountain state of Tachira, the public prosecutor's office said.

It was the first time during the current wave of demonstrations that protesters were able to reach the institution. Previous marches to the headquarters were blocked by security forces. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence held up Venezuela on Thursday as a prime example of what happens when democracy is undermined and urged Latin American leaders to condemn its government, comments Maduro described as nauseating.

Absa said in a statement it had not received a copy of the report and denied any wrongdoing, saying it  met all its obligations in respect of the loan provided by the South African Reserve Bank by October 1995.   Once we have read it we will consider our legal options including seeking a High Court review. It is our firm position that there is no obligation to pay anything to the South African government,  Absa said. Shares in Barclays Africa fell 2.61 percent to 142.68 rand by 1253 GMT.

The S&P; technology sector is coming off its second straight weekly decline, triggered by fears over stretched valuations and investors moving money to other sectors. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's 8.7 percent rally this year. Leading the rebound, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet were all up about 1 percent in premarket trading. Retail stocks were battered on Friday after Amazon.com's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods . The deal by Amazon, a proven retail disruptor, marked a major step by the internet retailer into the brick-and-mortar retail sector. Amazon was up 0.8 percent, while Wal-Mart, Target and Kroger gained between 0.8 percent and 1.8 percent on Monday. Dow e-minis were up 71 points, or 0.33 percent, with 25,503 contracts changing hands at 8:42 a.m. ET (1242 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.3 percent, with 138,274 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 43.5 points, or 0.77 percent, on volume of 38,221 contracts. New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy. Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy following a batch of weak U.S. economic data.  The absence of macro data today shifts the focus back to the Fed as two Fed members Dudley and Evans speak today. We suspect, an upholding of least one more rate hike will likely be supported,  said aid Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Last month, the U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs, well below the expected gain of 185,000, while other data showed a fall in retail sales and inflation below the Fed's target of 2 percent. European stocks were headed for their biggest rise in two months, helped by a meaty parliamentary majority for pro-business French President Emmanuel Macron. Oil prices edged higher, after coming under pressure over the past month from rising production.

The world's largest independent leasing company is also the largest owner of 787s, with 122 in its portfolio including those bought directly from Boeing and those acquired from airlines in sale-and-leaseback transactions. AerCap Chief Executive Aengus Kelly called the 787 the  premier wide-body  and said the aircraft would serve parts of the world where traffic is growing fast, such as Asia. AerCap did not, however, join a number of other leasing companies in placing an immediate order for Boeing's new single-aisle model, the 737 MAX 10, launched earlier on Monday.  We think the MAX 10 will be a very good airplane and we are talking to our friends at Boeing,  Kelly said. At an industry conference earlier this year, Kelly voiced concerns that the five members of the 737 MAX family might  cannibalize each other  and said he was cautious about demand for models other than the best-selling 737 MAX 8.

The U.S. Navy confirmed that all seven missing sailors on the USS Fitzgerald were found dead in flooded berthing compartments after the destroyer's collision with the container ship off Japan early on Saturday. The Fitzgerald and a Philippine-flagged container ship collided south of Tokyo Bay early on Saturday. The cause of the collision is not known. Multiple U.S. and Japanese investigations are under way on how a ship as large as the container could collide with the smaller warship in clear weather. Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the ACX Crystal, chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, made a complete U-turn between 12:58 a.m. and 2:46 a.m. on June 17. (11.58 a.m. ET and 1.46 p.m. ET). The collision happened at around 1:30 a.m. but it was not until 2:25 a.m. that the container ship informed the Japanese coastguard of the accident, said coastguard spokesman Takeshi Aikawa told Reuters. He declined to elaborate on why the ship took nearly an hour to report the accident but said it could take ships time to notify authorities as they dealt with more urgent matters. Right after being notified of he accident by the container vessel, the Japanese coastguard made contact with the U.S. ship and confirmed it, Aikawa said. A significant portion of the crew on the U.S. ship was asleep when the collision occurred, tearing a gash under the warship's waterline and flooding two crew compartments, the radio room and the auxiliary machine room.     A large dent was clearly visible in its right mid-section as the destroyer limped back to Yokosuka naval base south of Tokyo, home of the Seventh fleet, on Saturday evening.  The U.S. Navy on Monday identified the dead sailors as: Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Virginia; Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego, California; Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Connecticut; Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas; Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, California; Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Maryland; and Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, from Elyria, Ohio. Two of three injured crew members who were evacuated from the ship by helicopter, including the ship's commanding officer, Commander Bryce Benson, were released from the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet said on its Facebook page on Monday. The last sailor remained in hospital and no details were given about his condition.

U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERSVice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, the Seventh Fleet commander, was asked on Sunday if damage on the starboard side indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, but he declined to speculate on the cause of the collision. Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard. Japanese authorities were looking into the possibility of  endangerment of traffic caused by professional negligence , Japanese media reported, but it was not clear whether that might apply to either or both of the vessels. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the  government was investigating with the cooperation of the U.S. side and every effort would be made to maintain regional deterrence in the face of North Korea, which has recently conducted a series of missile tests.  It is extremely important to maintain U.S. deterrence in the light of an increasingly severe regional security situation,  he told a news conference.  Slideshow (13 Images) We will maintain close contact with international society, including the United States and South Korea, to maintain vigilance and protect the safety of our people.  The incident has sparked as many as three investigations by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, and two by Japanese authorities. Complicating the inquiries could be issues of which side has jurisdiction and access to data such as radar records that the United States could deem classified. Although the collision occurred in Japanese waters, under a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that defines the scope of the U.S. military's authority in Japan, the U.S. Navy could claim it has the authority to lead the investigations. The three U.S. investigations include a JAGMAN command investigation often used to look into the cause of major incidents, which can be used as a basis to file lawsuits against the Navy.   We will coordinate with Japanese authorities on investigations and will address specific requests for access in accordance with normal procedures,  a Navy spokesman said.  The ship is salvageable, Aucoin said, but repairs would  likely take months.  This incident was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000, when 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured. Naval historians recall possibly the last time a warship was hit by a larger vessel in peacetime was in 1964 off the coast of Australia. The HMAS Melbourne, an aircraft carrier, collided with the destroyer HMAS Voyager, shearing the much smaller vessel in half and killing 82 of the Voyager's crew.

Tenreyro's appointment also comes amid a deepening split over the need to raise interest rates for the first time since before the global financial crisis a decade ago. She will replace the strongest advocate for a rate hike on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, meaning economists will scrutinise her opinions even more closely than usual. Tenreyro's work has focused on issues including trade and wage growth, both of which are important factors for the BoE's thinking as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and as pay increases have fallen behind inflation. Robert Barro, a Harvard University economics professor who steered Tenreyro through her doctorate, said she had been a great success -- particularly on research about the links between international trade and exchange rate regimes.  She is very knowledgeable about economic fluctuations and the role of monetary policy. So, I think she's a great appointment,  Barro said. Tenreyro - who has British, Italian and Argentine citizenships, according to her resume on the LSE website - was one of 280 economists who signed a public letter which said it would be a  major mistake  for Britain to leave the EU in the run-up to last year's Brexit referendum. In an annual Financial Times survey of economists published in January, Tenreyro described a  difficult trade-off  for the BoE in balancing rising inflation and weak growth - echoing Governor Mark Carney's language at the time.  The (next move in interest rates) could go either way. Certainly the terms for Brexit will affect where the economy ends up - and the subsequent actions of the BoE,  Tenreyro said. She also thought Britain's economy would expand around 1.5 percent this year, roughly in line with the BoE's central forecast at the time.  My pessimism regarding Brexit has not moved much: I think it will have a negative impact on the UK economy and Europe more generally,  Tenreyro said. She spoke about the risks of a  hard Brexit  in which Britain leaves the EU single market and imposes stringent immigration quotas.  The effects on the UK economy will certainly be negative -- many firms will need to rethink and reorganise production as they lose talented workers,  she told the FT. Replacing a Hawk Before working at the LSE, Tenreyro was an economist at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston between 2002-04 and an external member of MPC at the Bank of Mauritius between 2012 and 2104, the ministry said. She replaces Kristin Forbes whose MPC term expires this month. Forbes was one of the three policymakers who voted last week to raise interest rates. The MPC's five other members voted to keep rates on hold. Jordan Rochester, a foreign exchange strategist with Nomura in London, said it was unlikely that Tenreyro would immediately vote against the majority who remain in favour of keeping rates at 0.25 percent.  We would assume a slight swing to a more dovish vote,  he said in a note to clients. The BoE is also seeking a replacement for former deputy governor Charlotte Hogg who quit in March after failing to report a potential conflict of interest involving her brother's position at Barclays. The finance ministry said on Monday that Hogg's replacement would be appointed in due course, restoring the MPC to its full quota of nine members.

Risk was back in vogue and the Nasdaq was expected to regain 0.7 percent of the near 3.5 percent it has lost over the last couple of weeks as investors have top-sliced the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet that have been on a tear all year. Europe's banks also drove higher following broker upgrades for Credit Suisse, while there was little sign of tension for the sector or for the pound or euro as formal Brexit negotiations kicked off in Brussels. Projections showing Macron had won a commanding majority in France's weekend vote saw Paris stocks make a 1.1 percent gain as the country's bonds also outperformed in fixed income markets.  We expect the Macron reforms to transform France like the Thatcher reforms had cured the erstwhile sick man of Europe, the United Kingdom, some 35 years ago,  said Berenberg European economist Holger Schmieding.  And like the 'Agenda 2010' reforms had turned Germany from one of the weakest into one of the strongest economies in Europe almost 15 years ago.  Asia had kicked off the week strongly as well with a two-week closing high for Japan's Nikkei. There were 1-1.2 percent jumps in China  and Hong Kong too ahead of MSCI's annual review on Tuesday which expected to see it add mainland-listed Chinese stocks to its top share benchmarks for the first time. Chinese data had also helped, with signs of easier liquidity conditions and home prices up 10.4 percent in May from a year ago, although slowing from April's 10.7 percent gain.  A-shares could be included though at fairly limited weight,  Asha Mehta, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, said of the MSCI review, which will be announced at around 2130 GMT.  MSCI has expressed that while liquidity and now access is there, some regulatory requirements are not ideal for index inclusion.  Emerging markets went sailing higher with stocks enjoying their biggest daily gains in nearly four weeks though another day of weaker oil prices took a toll on Russia again, where the rouble was down another half a percent. Europe's retailers continued to claw back some ground having been clobbered along with U.S. peers like Wal-Mart and Target on Friday by net-giant Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. It was Amazon's first major bricks and mortar acquisition in the sector and spooked traders on worries it could now be going hard after the sector's traditional. Brexit Beckons In the currency markets, the differing messages of the world's major central banks on inflation and monetary policy prodded the dollar higher against the yen ahead of a series of appearances by U.S. Federal Reserve officials this week. Fed chief Janet Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy. Sterling also nudged higher to just under $1.28 and 87.42 pence per euro as formal negotiations got underway on Britain's exit from the European Union, which are expected to generate plenty of headlines for the currency in the weeks ahead. Brexit Secretary David Davis held negotiations in Brussels on Monday, which will be followed by a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday where Prime Minister Theresa May will meet - but not negotiate with - fellow European Union leaders. Davis's agreement to Monday's agenda led some EU officials to believe that May's government may at last be coming around to Brussels' view of how negotiations should be run. May's own political survival is in doubt after she lost her parliamentary majority in an election this month.  We are starting this negotiation in a positive and constructive tone,  Davis told reporters. His EU counterpart Michel Barnier's response was:  We must first tackle the uncertainties caused by Brexit.  The euro was steady at $1.1195, retaining Friday's 0.5 percent gain. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, was also little changed at 97.182. The market is awaiting comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Yellen's, when he speaks at a business roundtable in New York state.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. In commodities, oil futures lingered near six-week lows over concerns about a supply glut amid faltering demand. U.S. crude ticked up 0.2 percent to $44.83 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent rose 0.3 percent to $47.56. Gold touched a 3-1/2-week low earlier in the session and was trading down slightly at $1,250 an ounce ahead of U.S. trading.

The U.S. Navy confirmed that all seven missing sailors on the USS Fitzgerald were found dead in flooded berthing compartments after the destroyer's collision with the container ship off Japan early on Saturday. The Fitzgerald and a Philippine-flagged container ship collided south of Tokyo Bay early on Saturday. The cause of the collision is not known. Multiple U.S. and Japanese investigations are under way on how a ship as large as the container could collide with the smaller warship in clear weather. Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the ACX Crystal, chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, made a complete U-turn between 12:58 a.m. and 2:46 a.m. on June 17. (11.58 a.m. ET and 1.46 p.m. ET). The collision happened at around 1:30 a.m. but it was not until 2:25 a.m. that the container ship informed the Japanese coastguard of the accident, said coastguard spokesman Takeshi Aikawa told Reuters. He declined to elaborate on why the ship took nearly an hour to report the accident but said it could take ships time to notify authorities as they dealt with more urgent matters. Right after being notified of he accident by the container vessel, the Japanese coastguard made contact with the U.S. ship and confirmed it, Aikawa said. A significant portion of the crew on the U.S. ship was asleep when the collision occurred, tearing a gash under the warship's waterline and flooding two crew compartments, the radio room and the auxiliary machine room.     A large dent was clearly visible in its right mid-section as the destroyer limped back to Yokosuka naval base south of Tokyo, home of the Seventh fleet, on Saturday evening.  The U.S. Navy on Monday identified the dead sailors as: Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Virginia; Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego, California; Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Connecticut; Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas; Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, California; Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Maryland; and Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, from Elyria, Ohio. Two of three injured crew members who were evacuated from the ship by helicopter, including the ship's commanding officer, Commander Bryce Benson, were released from the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet said on its Facebook page on Monday. The last sailor remained in hospital and no details were given about his condition.

U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERSVice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, the Seventh Fleet commander, was asked on Sunday if damage on the starboard side indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, but he declined to speculate on the cause of the collision. Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard. Japanese authorities were looking into the possibility of  endangerment of traffic caused by professional negligence , Japanese media reported, but it was not clear whether that might apply to either or both of the vessels. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the  government was investigating with the cooperation of the U.S. side and every effort would be made to maintain regional deterrence in the face of North Korea, which has recently conducted a series of missile tests.  It is extremely important to maintain U.S. deterrence in the light of an increasingly severe regional security situation,  he told a news conference.  Slideshow (13 Images) We will maintain close contact with international society, including the United States and South Korea, to maintain vigilance and protect the safety of our people.  The incident has sparked as many as three investigations by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, and two by Japanese authorities. Complicating the inquiries could be issues of which side has jurisdiction and access to data such as radar records that the United States could deem classified. Although the collision occurred in Japanese waters, under a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that defines the scope of the U.S. military's authority in Japan, the U.S. Navy could claim it has the authority to lead the investigations. The three U.S. investigations include a JAGMAN command investigation often used to look into the cause of major incidents, which can be used as a basis to file lawsuits against the Navy.   We will coordinate with Japanese authorities on investigations and will address specific requests for access in accordance with normal procedures,  a Navy spokesman said.  The ship is salvageable, Aucoin said, but repairs would  likely take months.  This incident was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000, when 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured. Naval historians recall possibly the last time a warship was hit by a larger vessel in peacetime was in 1964 off the coast of Australia. The HMAS Melbourne, an aircraft carrier, collided with the destroyer HMAS Voyager, shearing the much smaller vessel in half and killing 82 of the Voyager's crew.

The beefing up of powers over the online world come as authorities are increasingly targeting social media for  violations of a law that makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent. The Digital Economy Ministry aims to spend 128.56 million baht ($3.8 million) on software including a  social network data analysis system  to monitor and map individuals and relationships between more than one million online users, according to a ministry document seen by Reuters.  The software will sweep and store all data available on social media to be analyzed and monitored,  Teerawut Thongpak, director of the ministry's Digital Service Infrastructure Department, told Reuters. He said the government would post a tender for the software and then consider offers. Governments around the world buy social media monitoring products to chart relationships and networks, as well as to monitor dissidents and identify their leaders.  New York University researchers have also found various U.S. jurisdictions had spent more than $5.82 million on social media monitoring software.  Since a May 2014 coup in Thailand, the military government  has arrested numerous people on suspicion of posting material on Facebook and other platforms deemed to violate the royal-insult law.  The legal watchdog group iLaw says 59 people have been found guilty over online posts since the coup. This month, in the toughest sentence yet, a man was jailed for 35 years under the law for posts online. The government has asked Facebook to block some 300 posts from users in Thailand this year, a sharp increase from 80 restrictions during the period from mid-2014 to the end of 2016, according to Facebook reports. The junta is also pushing for a cyber security bill, which is expected to be put before parliament this year, despite the concern of civil society and business groups that it will give the government powers for mass surveillance. National Security The bill is a more intrusive measure than a recently amended Computer Crime Act, say experts, which allows authorities to censor online content but not to pry into private data.  The bill is aimed at increasing national security, allowing the state to access data of anyone it suspects,  said Bhume Bhumiratana, a cyber security expert at Thai company G-Able, which provides services to businesses. A draft of the bill, seen by Reuters, proposes a National Cyber Security Committee, with junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha at the helm, with the broad power to command both public agencies and private businesses to help with cyber security investigations. Other provisions give authorities power to order anyone to report for questioning or hand over information, as well as to tap all communication devices including phones and computers in  emergency cases , without court approval. The digital ministry said Thailand had to protect itself against crime and denied the procurement of the software and the legislation were aimed at surveillance.  This isn't about violating privacy but protecting the network,  Somsak Khaosuwan, the ministry's deputy permanent secretary, told Reuters. However, Rittee Intarawut, chief of the army's cyber center, which monitors the web for content critical of the monarchy, said the bill would help the government prosecute royal-insult offences, but law-abiding citizens need not be alarmed.  There's nothing to fear if you have done nothing wrong,  he said.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar on June 5 in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years. The crisis has seen those countries close their airspace to Qatar Airways, forcing it to fly longer routes and thereby adding costs.  There has been monetary impact,  Chief Executive Akbar al Baker said in an interview onboard one of Qatar Airways' 777 jets at the Paris Airshow on Monday.  We have had a lot of cancellations, especially to the four countries that did this illegal blockade, but we have found new markets and this is our growth strategy,  he said, adding passengers were returning to the carrier after initially being deterred when the boycott started. He said Qatar was not the only country affected by the crisis.  All these countries have families on either side of the borders, they have relatives, children, investments. Eventually people will realise that the move they have done against my country was ill-thought out and ill-advised and that life has to come back to normal,  he said. Qatar is talking with the United Nations' aviation agency, ICAO, about the airspace rights' dispute, and Al Baker said he was disappointed with their actions thus far.  I don't think they have moved enough, I don't think they have taken this matter very seriously,  he said. He said Qatar Airways had plenty of growth opportunities elsewhere, citing new routes opening this month to Dublin, Skopje and Sarajevo as examples.  We are not going to defer any of our aircraft ... We are continuing our aircraft deliveries at the same pace as we are contractually obligated to do,  he said, adding Qatar was in talks to add more freighter capacity. Al Baker said Qatar Airways still wanted to buy a stake in Italian carrier Meridiana, though there were  a few things to iron out.  However, Qatar is not interested in struggling carrier Alitalia, which is in the process of seeking a buyer.  We are not interested to look at the books because I know how it has been left behind by one of the airlines that was too keen to relaunch it and failed,  he said. Separately, Qatar plans to set up a full service Indian carrier to fly domestic routes with around 100 narrowbody planes after the country opened up the airline industry to foreign investors. Al Baker said an application would be made for an operating licence soon, without giving a more precise timeframe.

While the lower-income families that have long been its core customers cut back, the spending of the wealthier class remains undented by the downturn.  In a bid to retain its leading industry position, the discount retailer's new boss is driving hard into the upmarket, higher-margin niche dominated by rival Woolworths. The stage is set for a turf war to win the hearts, minds and wallets of South Africa's richest 2 million households - and ultimately preeminence in the supermarket sector. Shoprite CEO Pieter Engelbrecht told Reuters that affluent areas and customers were where he saw growth in the maturing South African market.  A lot of those (wealthier) customers, 2 million of them, actually frequent our stores already, but not exclusively,  he said in an interview.  Our job is to get a better share of their wallets when they are in our stores and then impress them so that they come back again.   Shoprite is doubling its offering of the kind of high-end convenience foods that Woolworths has built its reputation on - from gourmet lamb shanks and oxtail stew to teriyaki-and-ginger basted pork ribs. Its range will reach around 500 products by the end of this year, Engelbrecht said. These products typically cost about 200 rand ($15) for a meal for four - 10 times the minimum wage of 20 rand an hour as set by new labor laws making their way through parliament. As part of the drive to expand its range, Engelbrecht said Shoprite had upgraded its food technology and development facilities and gone on a hiring spree for food developers and technologists. He said the department had grown 10-fold in a year, without giving more specific details on staff numbers. The mainly discount retail group is executing this strategic shift by expanding its higher-end Checkers chain of stores.  It plans to open 23 new outlets, mostly in wealthy suburbs such as Waterfall City north of Johannesburg, by June next year to bring the number of stores to about 230.  Checkers has for years been underrepresented in the wealthiest neighborhoods with the most spending power, according to analysts. New Checkers stores, and established ones that have been refurbished, resemble Woolworths outlets with sparse lighting and wood-panelled sections boasting extensive wine and gourmet coffee selections, as well as counters selling quality selections of cheese and meat.  Numbers Game Shoprite's core, low-income customer base has been battered by a year of high inflation, stagnant wages and unemployment reaching a 14-year peak. Higher interest rates and currency depreciation have further eroded consumers' disposable income. Africa's most advanced economy has fallen into recession for the first time since 2009, data showed last week, in a slide that has slowed profits across the grocery sector. The discount group's push upmarket has been driven by its own economics. It is grappling with an internal inflation rate - the rise in what it pays for its goods - of 7.4 percent, the highest level in years, but has not been able to fully pass the increase on to poorer consumers. This has undermined its traditional, mass-market strategy of low margins and high volumes. To absorb the hit, and continue to secure the growth demanded by investors, it is hunting the higher margins and healthier sales growth on offer at the higher-end of the market by expanding Checkers. While Shoprite-branded stores' sales have grown by 8.8 percent over the past 12 months, Checkers' have risen by 11.1 percent. A woman walks past an outlet of retailer Woolworths in Cape Town, South Africa, June 19, 2017.Mike Hutchings The Checkers supermarkets have reported low double-digit sales growth over the last three years, growing well ahead of the Shoprite brand, which supports management's ambition,  Investec Asset Management analyst Unathi Loos told Reuters. The Woolworths and Shoprite groups also variously encompass the likes of furniture and clothing. Woolworths Foods' margin is about 7 percent, according to the company's financial reports.  Shoprite does not separate the margin on its supermarket food division from the financial services products offered in-store, but Loos said the consensus view among analysts was that the figure was between 3.5 and 4 percent. Shoprite did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the food margin figure.  'I Love Woolies' The country's - and the continent's - two largest retailers have very different backgrounds. Slideshow (8 Images)Shoprite, which is 16 percent owned by retail tycoon Christo Wiese, has grown from 8 supermarkets in 1979 to a no-frills mass-market grocer with operations in 15 African countries. Woolworths, which is over 80 years old, morphed from a clothing chain into South Africa's fine-foods market leader in the early 2000s. Engelbrecht took the reins of Shoprite in February from Whitey Basson, who had led the group for 37 years. Part of his strategy is based on a bet that he can lure affluent shoppers away from Woolworths with high-quality convenience products priced slightly below those offered by its rival.  Woolworths over time has constantly moved the price of (those products) up and up, because they were virtually the only players in that market, which gives us the opportunity to come in,  Engelbrecht said. A crucial question is how will Woolworths respond to defend a market that has delivered handsome profits for the company and whose chief executive Ian Moir said in February its food business continued to grow ahead of the market.  When asked by Reuters about Shoprite's push into upmarket convenience food, Woolworths told Reuters that it had an  incredibly valuable emotional connection  with its customers.    Retail is a dynamic environment and the competition in the Grocery and Food market category means that we will always keep a watching brief on our competitors' activities,  it added.  We conduct weekly basket checks against the prices of competitors to ensure that our prices are comparable.   Analysts say the high-end clash between the two industry titans was unlikely to develop into a price war because that part of the market was not as price-sensitive as the lower end.  But Woolworths will be forced to respond and would likely push back with new products and pack sizes, they say.  They have been good at introducing new products and other innovations in line with consumer trends and feedback,  said Old Mutual Invest food retail analyst Kaya Nodada. It's a tall order for Shoprite to break Woolworths' stranglehold. If it is to prevail, it will have to win over shoppers like JF Fourie.  I love Woolies. The microwave meals are a bit overpriced, but they are tasty,  the 28-year-old who works in marketing said in the Woolworths branch in eastern Pretoria as she added shimeji mushrooms to the baby brinjals in her basket. But Fourie - a big fan of Gordon Ramsay - said she would need some convincing about the quality of Shoprite's products, but would give it a go because Checkers adverts feature the British celebrity chef.  I like the chef and he hates airplane food,  she added.  He's fussy and I am too.  Editing by Pravin Char","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-retailers-insight-idUSKBN19A1N8"},

The lower grants to the independents dealt the new group of crude oil buyers another blow because they were already barred from exporting refined fuel, squeezing margins in an oversupplied domestic fuel market. The Ministry of Commerce approved 22.92 million tonnes to 32 companies, against 29 recipients in the first issue for 2017, according to a document dated June 14 and viewed by Reuters on Monday. The 32 companies included mostly independent oil refineries, also known as teapots, and some state-run companies. That latest quotas take the total issued this year to 91.73 million tonnes, compared with 87.6 million tonnes in 2016. The second batch will be valid until year-end. Volumes for the 19 independent oil plants that make up two thirds of the total issues for 2017 dropped by 12.36 million tonnes, or nearly 17 percent, from last 2016.  The message is pretty clear: the government is tightening the screws as the industry is heavily oversupplied,  said a Beijing-based trading executive who deals with independents.  Those who have not played by the rules, under-using quotas for instance, are taking a bigger cut.  Four independents -- Baota Petrochemical, Wonfull Petrochemical, Haiyou and Chambroad -- took the deepest cuts, between 43 percent and 90 percent, according to data Reuters compiled based on official documents. Uncertainties over the time and the size of issues have led some independents to scramble for purchases, resulting in brimming fuel stocks and port congestion.  We are rushing to buy as much crude as we can because we thought the government is going to issue second batch of quotas based on the volumes (used) in the first half of the year,  said a trader with Shandong Wanda Group, owner of Tianhong Chemical.  That led to higher running rate as we don't have enough storage ... and in turn a glut of refined products.  The Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to request for comment. Company officials at five independent refiners told Reuters that they have received a second batch of crude import quotas. Beijing approved the oil quotas under the  non-state trade  designation, so they do not include state-owned oil companies Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp, Sinochem Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp and Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp The increased quotas buoyed the price of Oman crude on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange to its narrowest discount against Dubai swaps in four sessions. China buys most of Oman's crude output.

The ruling center-right coalition was shaken last week after Prime Minister Juha Sipila ejected the nationalist Finns Party which had just chosen a new leader with hardline views on immigration. Sipila initially said the government would fall - then said he had changed his mind after a more moderate faction in the Finns party broke away and said it could still work with the coalition. Finland's Aamulehti newspaper reported that the changes had been planned before the Finns Party chose a new leader, suggesting the process had been stage-managed - an accusation dismissed by the government.  It was not a crisis but a carefully planned strategy. Can politics get any more cynical?  said Li Andersson, chairwoman of the opposition Left Alliance. Antti Lindtman, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said the government in its new form was weaker  both morally and in the parliament .  Resignation and new government formation talks would have offered a chance to search for alternatives,  he said. The coalition - with Sipila's Center Party, the pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) and the  New Alternative  faction from the Finns party, has 106 of the parliament's 200 seats. The next elections are due in 2019. Vesa Vares, a political scientist at the University of Turku, said the government should have at least met the opposition parties before announcing they were carrying on under the new arrangement. Parliament will hold a vote of confidence on the reformed coalition on Tuesday. Laura Huhtasaari, from the part of the Finns party now in opposition called Sipila's move  an impudent act ...

While the lower-income families that have long been its core customers cut back, the spending of the wealthier class remains undented by the downturn.  In a bid to retain its leading industry position, the discount retailer's new boss is driving hard into the upmarket, higher-margin niche dominated by rival Woolworths. The stage is set for a turf war to win the hearts, minds and wallets of South Africa's richest 2 million households - and ultimately preeminence in the supermarket sector. Shoprite CEO Pieter Engelbrecht told Reuters that affluent areas and customers were where he saw growth in the maturing South African market.  A lot of those (wealthier) customers, 2 million of them, actually frequent our stores already, but not exclusively,  he said in an interview.  Our job is to get a better share of their wallets when they are in our stores and then impress them so that they come back again.   Shoprite is doubling its offering of the kind of high-end convenience foods that Woolworths has built its reputation on - from gourmet lamb shanks and oxtail stew to teriyaki-and-ginger basted pork ribs. Its range will reach around 500 products by the end of this year, Engelbrecht said. These products typically cost about 200 rand ($15) for a meal for four - 10 times the minimum wage of 20 rand an hour as set by new labor laws making their way through parliament. As part of the drive to expand its range, Engelbrecht said Shoprite had upgraded its food technology and development facilities and gone on a hiring spree for food developers and technologists. He said the department had grown 10-fold in a year, without giving more specific details on staff numbers. The mainly discount retail group is executing this strategic shift by expanding its higher-end Checkers chain of stores.  It plans to open 23 new outlets, mostly in wealthy suburbs such as Waterfall City north of Johannesburg, by June next year to bring the number of stores to about 230.  Checkers has for years been underrepresented in the wealthiest neighborhoods with the most spending power, according to analysts. New Checkers stores, and established ones that have been refurbished, resemble Woolworths outlets with sparse lighting and wood-panelled sections boasting extensive wine and gourmet coffee selections, as well as counters selling quality selections of cheese and meat.  Numbers Game Shoprite's core, low-income customer base has been battered by a year of high inflation, stagnant wages and unemployment reaching a 14-year peak. Higher interest rates and currency depreciation have further eroded consumers' disposable income. Africa's most advanced economy has fallen into recession for the first time since 2009, data showed last week, in a slide that has slowed profits across the grocery sector. The discount group's push upmarket has been driven by its own economics. It is grappling with an internal inflation rate - the rise in what it pays for its goods - of 7.4 percent, the highest level in years, but has not been able to fully pass the increase on to poorer consumers. This has undermined its traditional, mass-market strategy of low margins and high volumes. To absorb the hit, and continue to secure the growth demanded by investors, it is hunting the higher margins and healthier sales growth on offer at the higher-end of the market by expanding Checkers. While Shoprite-branded stores' sales have grown by 8.8 percent over the past 12 months, Checkers' have risen by 11.1 percent. A woman walks past an outlet of retailer Woolworths in Cape Town, South Africa, June 19, 2017.Mike Hutchings The Checkers supermarkets have reported low double-digit sales growth over the last three years, growing well ahead of the Shoprite brand, which supports management's ambition,  Investec Asset Management analyst Unathi Loos told Reuters. The Woolworths and Shoprite groups also variously encompass the likes of furniture and clothing. Woolworths Foods' margin is about 7 percent, according to the company's financial reports.  Shoprite does not separate the margin on its supermarket food division from the financial services products offered in-store, but Loos said the consensus view among analysts was that the figure was between 3.5 and 4 percent. Shoprite did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the food margin figure.  'I Love Woolies' The country's - and the continent's - two largest retailers have very different backgrounds. Slideshow (8 Images)Shoprite, which is 16 percent owned by retail tycoon Christo Wiese, has grown from 8 supermarkets in 1979 to a no-frills mass-market grocer with operations in 15 African countries. Woolworths, which is over 80 years old, morphed from a clothing chain into South Africa's fine-foods market leader in the early 2000s.

The bank's medium-term target for core inflation - which strips out food, fuel, metered water and electricity prices - is 5 percent. The annual rate rose to 5.1 percent in May from 4.9 percent in April. Bank of Uganda (BoU) Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said a supply side shock that caused inflation to rise in the last six months was expected to wane in the three months to September.  With domestic inflationary pressures remaining subdued and given the continued growth prospects, the BoU judges that continued easing of monetary policy is appropriate,  he told a news conference.  This will be consistent with achieving the core inflation target ...and will also support the recovery of real output in the economy.  Uganda's overall inflation rate rose to 7.2 percent last month from 6.8 percent. The shilling was stable after the rate announcement, but was expected to ease gradually following the move. Faisal Bukenya, Kampala-based economic analyst, said the 100 basis point cut was a  shock  move against a backdrop of rising overall inflation.  I had anticipated 50 basis points, but when they did 100 it was a bit of a shock. The shilling will be impacted on the depreciation side, but it will be gradual,  Bukenya said. The central bank's rate easing cycle has now been running for more than a year, and has brought the benchmark rate down from a high of 17 percent since April last year. Tumusiime-Mutebile said the economy expanded by 3.9 percent in the year to June, down from 4.7 percent the previous year, due to drought and the slow implementation of public investment projects. He forecast growth would rise to 5 percent in 2017/18, supported by better implementation of public investments, higher foreign direct investments and a pick-up in private sector credit.

Of the 577 newly elected lawmakers, 223 were female, beating the previous record of 155 set after the last election. That sent France leapfrogging from 64th to 17th in the world rankings of female parliamentary representation and to 6th place in Europe, overtaking Britain and Germany, according to Inter-parliamentary Union data compiled at the start of June.  LREM, which won an overwhelming majority in Sunday's ballot, had the highest proportion of women elected, at 47 percent.  For the first time under the (postwar) Fifth Republic, the National Assembly will be deeply renewed - more diverse, younger,  the party's acting president, Catherine Barbaroux, said.   But above all, allow me to rejoice, because this is a historic event for the representation of women in the National Assembly.    Female representation in the National Assembly has risen steadily, from 12.3 percent at the 2002 election to 38.6 percent this time.  But most parties still put up more men for election, despite France having a system in which a party's funding is restricted if women do not make up at least 49 percent of candidates. Female candidates have also tended to stand in constituencies they are unlikely to win, keeping the numbers of women who make it to the Palais-Bourbon low.    (Macron's) En Marche (party)... proactively decided to give winning seats to women,  said 34-year-old Brune Poirson, who beat the far-right National Front to be elected in the Vaucluse district in southeastern France.  This is a really bold move.   Normally political parties allocate women seats that are almost impossible to win, so they can say 'hey, we have as many female candidates as male,'  added Poirson, a parliamentary novice with masters degrees in political science from Harvard and the London School of Economics.     Poirson decided to become a candidate in January when Macron sent a video to LREM members urging more women to put themselves forward.  (Macron)... said: this is your responsibility as well - we need you. It was very powerful, and it really worked,  she told Reuters.   Long Way to Go   A culture with misogynistic tendencies has long characterized the upper echelons of French politics, but there have been signs of the veil being lifted on acts that might previously have gone unreported. Last year Denis Baupin resigned as vice-president of the National Assembly after being accused of sexual harassment by fellow politicians, while then finance minister Michel Sapin admitted behaving inappropriately toward a female journalist. Laurianne Rossi, elected to the Hauts-de-Seine district on the outskirts of Paris, said even with the increase in female lawmakers, it would take time to make a real difference.   There is still a long way to go before we get real equality...(but) the arrival of so many more women at the National Assembly will really help,  said Rossi, a 33-year-old former assistant to a Socialist senator.  Frances Scott, founder of Britain's 50:50 Parliament, a cross-party group campaigning for gender balance in the legislature, said the result in France would spur parties in other countries to field more women candidates. Britain set its own record in elections on June 8, with 30 percent of parliamentary seats going to women.   It looks like France is leading the way in terms of this democratic imperative,  said Scott.   The evidence suggests that having more women in parliament leads to more informed and more responsive decision-making. It leads to a better parliament.

The result, based on official figures and pollster projections, redraws France's political landscape, humiliating the Socialist and conservative parties that alternated in power for decades until Macron's election in May. Three pollsters projected that Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) and its Modem allies would win 355 to 365 seats in the 577-seat lower house, fewer than previously forecast.  They predicted the conservative Republicans and their allies would form the largest opposition bloc with 125 to 131 seats, while the Socialist Party, in power for the past five years, and its partners would secure 41 to 49 seats, their lowest ever in the postwar Fifth Republic. Official figures with 90 seats still left to be decided showed LREM had already won its majority.  This is an opportunity for France. One year ago no one would have imagined such a political renewal,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a statement. Voter turnout was projected to be a record low at about 42 percent. The high abstention rate underlines that Macron will have to tread carefully with reforms in a country with muscular trade unions and a history of street protests that have forced many a past government to dilute new legislation. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said it signaled voters  had not wanted to hand Macron a blank check.  Related CoverageFrance elects record number of women to parliamentNevertheless, the scale of victory gives the president, a pro-European Union centrist, a strong platform from which to make good on campaign promises to revive France's fortunes by cleaning up politics and relaxing regulations that investors say shackle the euro zone’s second-biggest economy. Political Routing Victory for Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon, marks the routing of the old political class.  Having never held elected office, he seized on the growing resentment toward a political elite perceived as out of touch, and on public frustration at its failure to create jobs and spur stronger growth, to win the presidency. French President Emmanuel Macron waves as he attends a ceremony marking the 77th anniversary of late French General Charles de Gaulle's resistance call of June 18, 1940, at the Mont Valerien memorial in Suresnes, near Paris, France, June 18, 2017.Bertrand Guay/PoolHis year-old party then filled the political space created by the disarray within the Socialist Party and the Republicans, with Sunday night capping a sequence of events that a year ago looked improbable.  Tonight, the collapse of the Socialist Party is beyond doubt. The president of the Republic has all the powers,  Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said after announcing he would step down as Socialist Party chief.  He said the party would have to rebuild itself from the top down. Cambadelis was knocked out of the running for parliament in last week's first round of voting.   Far-right leader Marine Le Pen won a seat in the National Assembly for the first time. Her National Front party clinched at least eight seats in total, a result she celebrated but which may disappoint supporters who a month ago dreamed of entering the Elysee.   We are the only force of resistance to the dilution of France, its social model and identity,  Le Pen said in a televised address in her northern fiefdom of Henin-Beaumont. Slideshow (14 Images) We shall fight with all our strength the harmful projects of the government, which is only in place to implement the road map sent by Brussels.  Francois Baroin, who led the Republicans' campaign, said the conservatives would emphasize their differences with Macron, especially on taxes.     Social Resistance The scale of LREM's projected win means Macron will enjoy an absolute majority even without the support of alliance partner Francois Bayrou and Modem, lending him a freer hand for reforms and room for a government reshuffle should he choose to carry one out. Modem currently has two ministers in the Cabinet.  Macron's rivals went into the second round trying only to limit the scale of the newcomer's win. They urged voters not to allow too much power to be concentrated in the hands of one party and warned Macron's MPs would be mere yes-men who would rubber-stamp legislation. It appeared the message had some impact. Opinion polls before the vote had projected Macron could win as many as 470 seats. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who won his Marseille seat, promised  social resistance  to Macron's reform agenda and said the high abstention rate meant the president lacked the legitimacy to destroy the labor code. Melenchon's resurgent France Unbowed and the Communist Party were on course to win 26 to 30 seats. In a combative speech, which contrasted sharply with the defeated tone of the Socialist Party, Melenchon reached out to disappointed left-wingers.  It is France Unbowed which will call the country, when the moment comes, to social resistance,  Melenchon said.  I hereby inform the new powers that not a foot of ground will be given up in the labor law struggle.

The agreement for 40 aircraft, valued at $4.7 billion at current list prices, includes an order for 20 new 737 MAX 10 planes and conversion of 20 of SpiceJet's 737 MAX 8 aircraft from an existing order, the two companies said in a statement on Monday.  We are proud to be a part of the launch of the 737 MAX 10 and to be the first airline in India to order the newest version of the 737, which will enable us to maximize revenue on our dense routes while having a lower unit seat cost,  SpiceJet's chairman and managing director, Ajay Singh, said in the statement. Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air and China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings could also be among the inaugural customers for Boeing's new 737 MAX 10 planes, sources have told Reuters. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. SpiceJet, which operates a fleet of 35 Boeing 737s and 20 Bombardier Q400s, agreed in January to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The budget carrier plans to grow its operational fleet to 200 airplanes by the end of the decade and expand regionally with the new 737 MAX family of airplanes. SpiceJet will take delivery of its first 737 MAX in 2018. (Reporting by Aditi Shah; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-spicejet-idUSL3N1JG3QT"},

Norway's $900 billion sovereign wealth fund (SWF) -- itself financed by oil sales -- and the New Zealand Super Fund (NZSF) are among those adjusting investments in anticipation of tougher environmental rules or damage from the impact of global warming. Rising temperatures could lead to more violent storms and flooding, posing a threat to infrastructure and prime real estate, both favored by sovereign investors.  U.N. scientists say greenhouse gases are the main cause of warming and while the U.S. administration has questioned the science, many countries are introducing rules to cut emissions.  Norway's SWF, the world's largest, is divesting from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their turnover or activity from coal, a major source of greenhouse gases. It is also investing in alternative fuel companies such as NextEra Energy, a U.S. wind farm developer. By July the fund's ethics watchdog is likely to recommend the fund excludes or puts on a watch list the first of several firms in the oil, cement and steel industries. The fund is also pushing companies to disclose carbon emissions and plans to handle climate change risk.  In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, we are actually expecting companies to increase reporting on it,  the fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters.   We want to have more transparency on investment plans and how they are affected.  The NZSF said last year it would set a target by the end of June to reduce its carbon footprint.   We should be able to increase our returns for the same risk, or get the same returns with less risk,  Adrian Orr, chief executive of NZSF, said in November.  In an update, an NZSF spokeswoman said the fund was looking at its passive portfolio rules and this would lead to a reduction in fossil fuel holdings. More details would be given when the changes have been made, she said.   It has already invested in energy efficient glass manufacturer View and waste gas-to-fuel firm LanzaTech. France's SWF Caisse des Depots (CDC) is also aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of its equity portfolio by 20 percent by 2020, and is exiting companies that derive more than 20 percent of revenue from coal.   Coal is a 19th century energy, it is not the energy of the future,  said Joel Prohin, head of portfolio management at CDC. Counting the Cost Investors have committed to divesting some $5 trillion from fossil fuel companies, according to Arabella Advisors, with pension funds leading the way.  In June, Swedish pension fund, AP7 sold its investments in six energy-related companies it says violate the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and has pushed environmental risk up the agenda.  That is despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision last month to take the United States out of the agreement, which attracted international condemnation.  A 2016 study by the London School of Economics and others put value at risk at $2.5 trillion in a 'business as usual' emissions scenario of 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100.  If you believe climate change is happening and there's going to be a cost to that, do you pay that cost upfront as a preventative measure, or wait for the impacts to happen and then pay the bills?  said Alex Millar, head of EMEA sovereigns at Invesco.  One SWF official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was steering clear of Miami real estate given the risk of rising sea levels in the low lying area.   It's very likely that in 10 years' time the parking is going to be flooded,  he said.  A 2017 Invesco study of sovereign investors found climate change was the most important environmental, social and governance (ESG) issue for those that had already incorporated ESG factors into their investment process. Seventy percent of ESG adopters perceived an increase in long-term returns. But it also noted adoption of ESG practices was patchy, with some investors in the United States and emerging markets reluctant to commit without harder data on risks and returns.   Energy for Free The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) is exploring the investment implications of the global commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions and will report back to its members in September.  Funds that are primarily funded through fossil fuel production will feel an accelerated demand to diversify as quickly as possible,  said NZSF's Orr, who also chairs the IFSWF.  Even where fossil fuel divestment is not a priority, more investors want to capture the upside in the green economy. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested in renewable energy firms Greenko and ReNew Power while Singapore's GIC has targeted investments in electric vehicles.  Ithmar Capital, Morocco's strategic investment fund, wants to raise $1-2 billion from infrastructure specialists and other SWFs for its Africa-focused green infrastructure fund.   Africa is contributing the least to climate change, but it is suffering the most so it needs a specific action plan,  Tarik Senhaji, chief executive of Ithmar Capital, said. Mahmood Alkooheji, chief executive of Bahrain's SWF Mumtalakat, also described renewables as  the way forward .   We can't not be thinking of the environment,  he told Reuters.  For Bahrain it's a very promising area, we have sunshine 366 days in a year ... so that's a lot of energy being wasted. It's energy for free so why not invest in it?

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the three major futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 51 million barrels in the week to June 13 (tmsnrt.rs/2rMOh9T). Fund managers cut their net long position for the second week running by a cumulative total of 91 million barrels, according to data published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2shCOmq). Portfolio managers also cut their net position in gasoline by 13 million barrels and heating oil by 19 million barrels last week (tmsnrt.rs/2shNukU and tmsnrt.rs/2rMooXW). Hedge funds have discounted the fact oil prices are already under than $50 per barrel and reassurances from OPEC ministers that global oil stocks will draw in the second half of the year. Instead they have focused on the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and signs gasoline and diesel demand may not be growing fast enough to absorb the record fuel being produced by U.S. refineries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts global oil stocks will draw down in the third quarter of 2017 as a result of OPEC’s output cuts. But global stocks are expected to rise again through 2018 as OPEC compliance deteriorates and supply from non-OPEC sources increases. Bearish sentiment among oil traders has triggered a wave of short selling, with hedge funds adding 45 million barrels of extra short positions in crude, as well as 15 million in gasoline and 16 million in heating oil. There are signs hedge funds may have embarked on the eighth cycle of short-selling in WTI since the start of 2015, though it is still too early to tell. The only supportive factor for oil prices in the short term is that so many short positions have been established and there are relatively few long positions left to liquidate. Conditions are in place for an eventual short-covering rally but the rebound may not come until there are clear signs global stocks are falling and U.S. shale drilling is levelling off.

Following a tip-off, Telangana state police raided the fertility clinic in the city of Hyderabad on Saturday and discovered the women, nearly all from northeastern India.  The women were all huddled in one large room and had access to just one bathroom,  investigating officer B. Limba Reddy told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday.  They were mostly migrants from northeastern states who had been brought here through agents and promised up to 400,000 rupees (around $6,000).  An official from the clinic, who declined to be named, said the facility operated within the law and the women were not confined against their will.  They were staying here as part of an agreement between the (adoptive) parent and the surrogate,  he said. India's surrogacy industry has come under attack from women's rights groups who say such clinics are  baby factories  for the rich, and lack of regulation results in poor and uneducated women signing contracts they do not fully understand. Activists say there has been a surge in demand for surrogates after the Indian government drafted a bill to outlaw commercial surrogacy - a multi-billion dollar industry. The bill is pending clearance in the Indian parliament. Until the ban on surrogacy passes, India continues to be among a handful of countries where women can be paid to carry another's child through in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.   The demand is very high right now and the involvement of migrant workers coming down from the northeast to take up surrogacy is new,  said Hari Ramasubramanian of the Indian Surrogacy Law Centre.   It raises concerns about the information the surrogates have, whether they have understood the agreement (and) the risks involved.  The Telangana health department is investigating the background of the surrogate mothers, said an official who declined to be named, adding the women are now under the department's supervision at the clinic.

The BMW (BMWG.DE) 530 plug-in hybrid will be manufactured beginning this summer at Magna's plant in Graz, Austria, where it already plans to produce Jaguar's I-PACE SUV beginning in early 2018. Global automakers and their suppliers are investing heavily in fully-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. Consumer demand is still low versus that for gasoline engine vehicles, but companies are beginning to offer more choices to respond to government mandates for greater sales of vehicles that emit little or no carbon dioxide, and prepare for a future experts believe will be dominated by electric vehicles. Rival tier-one auto supplier Continental AG (CONG.DE), for example, said in April it was increasing spending by 300 million euros ($334.68 million) on new products such as charging systems and battery management components related to electric vehicles. Magna, North America's largest automotive supplier and the third globally, is alone among the top auto suppliers to perform contract manufacturing for carmakers. Its Austrian plant can produce about 200,000 cars per year. Magna is currently building a new paint shop in Slovenia due to increased demand.  A Magna spokeswoman would not comment on a statement by the Slovenian government in March that the auto supplier would  potentially invest up to 1.24 billion euros in the country, including a car plant with capacity of 100,000 to 200,000 vehicles per year. Having contract manufacturing in its portfolio creates a niche for the company as automakers slowly bring more electrified vehicles to market over the next decade. For automakers, outsourcing the assembly can be an advantage on low-volume models to minimize capital expenditures and avoid tying up their own production lines.     Swamy Kotagiri, Magna's chief technology officer, said he sees contract manufacturing of electric vehicles as a  near-term opportunity  for the company, given that by 2025, 40 to 50 percent of all vehicles produced will include some electrification elements.   We are setting up knowing the penetration will be higher.  Magna has also produced non-electric cars at its Austrian facility, including BMW's Mini Countryman and Mercedes-Benz' (DAIGn.DE) luxury G-Wagen SUV.   Last month, Magna raised its full-year sales forecast on higher demand.

Trump,Janet Yellen,Steven Chubak,USA,BANKS/STRESS (REPEAT),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"June 19 (Reuters) - Investors are hoping the Federal Reserve will allow big U.S. banks to put an estimated $150 billion in idle capital toward stock buybacks, dividends and profit-boosting investments in the coming weeks after conducting a regular examination of financial strength. On Thursday, the Fed is scheduled to begin releasing results from its two-part annual stress test, which was adopted in response to the financial crisis, to gauge banks' ability to weather an economic storm that could threaten the stability of the system. The results will be the first since Republican President Donald Trump took office. Trump has not yet made any appointments to the Fed, but Republicans have turned up pressure on the central bank to cut red tape and ease regulations. Wall Street analysts said they will be parsing language the Fed uses in presenting the results for any signs that its approach is starting to soften. Analysts say they do not expect the Fed to announce any explicit changes to the stress test, but they do expect higher payouts. According to their estimates, the Fed could allow banks to distribute nearly as much capital to shareholders over the next year as they generate in profits, a benchmark not hit since before the 2008 crisis. Higher payouts  would be significant from a signaling standpoint  that regulators are easing up on capital requirements, said Steven Chubak, a bank analyst at Nomura Instinet.  That is a key part of the value case for a lot of these stocks.  Banks going through the stress tests have roughly $150 billion more capital than they need, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck estimates. She expects the typical big bank to be allowed to increase stock buybacks by 27 percent and dividends by 8 percent, for a combined capital payout of 95 percent of annual earnings, up from 84 percent last year. The Fed first conducted stress tests in 2009 as a way to boost confidence in the financial system. Congress codified the test into law the following year as part of a broader financial reform package, and the Fed came to see it as an important tool to ensure that banks not only maintain enough capital to withstand economic storms, but also run their businesses in ways that avoid operational calamities. However, bankers complain that stress tests have morphed into an overly complex and time-consuming process that occurs in the secrecy of a black box. They have pleaded for more details about models the Fed uses to conduct the numeric part of the tests, and more clarity on a qualitative component that judges factors like risk management. The Fed has been making some changes to enhance transparency, but officials say that revealing too much would allow lenders to game the exams.  We are concerned that releasing all details on the models would give banks an incentive to adjust their business practices in ways that change the results of the stress test without changing the risks faced by the firms,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress in a letter on Friday.  The result could be less effective stress tests.  Thursday's results, known as DFAST, will show how much capital the biggest banks would have after an imagined crisis. Shortly after the Fed posts its numbers, big banks tend to disclose results under their own models. Banks can compare the scoring and then scale back and resubmit their capital plans to improve their chances of a passing grade. On June 28, the Fed will announce whether it has approved the plans in a further examination known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. The Fed has been under pressure for some time to simplify the stress tests, and changes are widely expected under Trump. A proposed financial regulatory overhaul ordered by Trump and released by the Treasury Department last week included easing stress tests. Trump is also expected to name as many as five new officials to the Fed's seven-member governing board over the next two years. Although Wall Street is upbeat about the idea of lighter regulations and higher payouts, regulatory experts are less sure that the Fed will unleash bank balance sheets overnight. It takes time for large institutions like the Fed to shift, even after top officials and regulatory mandates change, they said.  It should change over time,  said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.  Markedly? That's tougher to determine.

Simpson,Paul Callan,Rodney Smolla,Ronald L. Goldman,PEOPLE,COSBY/LAWSUITS (CORRECTED,ANALYSIS),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"June 19 (Reuters) - Although Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial ended in a mistrial on Saturday, his legal problems persist as he faces assault and defamation claims in civil lawsuits, where the bar for evidence is lower than in criminal cases. In civil lawsuits in the United States, plaintiffs need only show that the weight of evidence is on their side, meaning they have information to tip the scales above 50 percent in their favor, as opposed to criminal cases in which prosecutors must prove claims beyond a reasonable doubt. At least 10 women have pending civil claims against Cosby in lawsuits filed in California and Massachusetts. Two have brought claims against the 79-year-old entertainer for sexual assault. Others, barred from doing so because their claims were too old, have brought defamation claims against him, saying he smeared their reputations by publicly denying their accusations. The judge in the criminal case against Cosby in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked and unable to reach a unanimous verdict on charges that Cosby sexually assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004. At the time, Constand worked at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University. David Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who specializes in criminal justice, said the hung jury did not mean that a civil jury would clear Cosby of liability. “There may not be enough evidence for a criminal conviction, but that does not rule out a civil verdict,” said Harris. Approximately 60 accusations of sexual assault have been made against Cosby over a number of years, but only Constand's resulted in criminal charges because the other alleged incidents were too old to prosecute. Cosby has denied all of the accusations. Constand herself sued Cosby in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed sum. Women bringing civil cases would also likely find it easier to introduce testimony from other accusers to support claims that Cosby engaged in a pattern of assault, said Douglas Wigdor, a plaintiffs' attorney who represents clients in sexual harassment cases. Little testimony about other accusations against Cosby was allowed in the Pennsylvania trial because of the strict standards for admitting evidence in criminal cases. Prosecutors had sought to have 13 other accusers testify in Constand's case, but the judge allowed only one, finding that more would unfairly prejudice the jury. Challenges All Around Even with the lower standard of evidence in civil cases, Rodney Smolla, dean of Delaware Law School, said that plaintiffs bringing defamation claims faced a significant legal challenge. In addition to proving that Cosby assaulted them, Smolla said, they would have to establish that he said something about them beyond denying the allegations, such as calling them known liars or promiscuous. “The defamation case is this clever way of saying, If I say you raped me and you say it didn’t happen, then you’re defaming me by calling me a liar,” he said. “And that in itself is a difficult defamation case. It’s not a classic defamation case.” Smolla said the outcome of any civil case would depend on how jurors behave in terms of how seriously they take the case, how they relate to one another and how they deal with holdout jurors. “That is the human side of the legal system that can be hard to predict,” he said. Damages vs Jail Paul Callan, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson in a civil case against her ex-husband, former football star O.J. Simpson, after he was found not guilty of her murder, said courts are much stricter in excluding evidence in criminal cases because a conviction could lead to incarceration. “In civil cases, the battle is over money damages, as opposed to sending someone to prison,  Callan said.  In my experience, the courts tend to be far more liberal in allowing both sides to introduce a greater volume of evidence than the stricter rules in criminal cases.  While Simpson was acquitted in the 1995 criminal case, a jury in the civil case ordered him to pay $25 million in punitive damages to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman, who were together when they were killed. The jury also awarded $8.5 million in compensatory damages to Goldman's family. Before it could decide the awards, the jury in the civil case had to determine if O.J. Simpson was the killer. Callan said the $33.5 million awarded in the case reflected the jury's reaction to a double homicide and was larger than a potential award to someone who has civil claims against Cosby. But in the aggregate, he said, Cosby could face a comparable award because of the number of alleged victims.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/people-cosby-lawsuits-idUSL1N1JG09M"},

The BMW (BMWG.DE) 530 plug-in hybrid will be manufactured beginning this summer at Magna's plant in Graz, Austria, where it already plans to produce Jaguar's I-PACE SUV beginning in early 2018. Global automakers and their suppliers are investing heavily in fully-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. Consumer demand is still low versus that for gasoline engine vehicles, but companies are beginning to offer more choices to respond to government mandates for greater sales of vehicles that emit little or no carbon dioxide, and prepare for a future experts believe will be dominated by electric vehicles. Rival tier-one auto supplier Continental AG (CONG.DE), for example, said in April it was increasing spending by 300 million euros ($334.68 million) on new products such as charging systems and battery management components related to electric vehicles. Magna, North America's largest automotive supplier and the third globally, is alone among the top auto suppliers to perform contract manufacturing for carmakers. Its Austrian plant can produce about 200,000 cars per year. Magna is currently building a new paint shop in Slovenia due to increased demand.  A Magna spokeswoman would not comment on a statement by the Slovenian government in March that the auto supplier would  potentially invest up to 1.24 billion euros in the country, including a car plant with capacity of 100,000 to 200,000 vehicles per year. Having contract manufacturing in its portfolio creates a niche for the company as automakers slowly bring more electrified vehicles to market over the next decade. For automakers, outsourcing the assembly can be an advantage on low-volume models to minimize capital expenditures and avoid tying up their own production lines.     Swamy Kotagiri, Magna's chief technology officer, said he sees contract manufacturing of electric vehicles as a  near-term opportunity  for the company, given that by 2025, 40 to 50 percent of all vehicles produced will include some electrification elements.   We are setting up knowing the penetration will be higher.  Magna has also produced non-electric cars at its Austrian facility, including BMW's Mini Countryman and Mercedes-Benz' (DAIGn.DE) luxury G-Wagen SUV.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 19 (Reuters) - There has been no shortage of advice doled out to incoming BHP Billiton chairman Ken MacKenzie on how to boost the world's largest mining company, but ultimately his role comes down to a fairly straightforward choice. Does BHP want to be a cutting edge mining company always on the prowl for the next big opportunity, or does it want to be a cautious, dividend-focused cash generator, something akin to being the telecoms utility of the mining world? If there is anything that can be learned from the performance of BHP, and indeed most of its global mining rivals, in the past decade, it's that escaping the ups and downs of the commodity cycle is extremely difficult for a miner. BHP's Australia-listed shares ended at A$22.99 ($17.51) on June 16, down 8.3 percent since the end of last year, but still above the closing low of A$14.20 on Jan. 21, 2016. On that view BHP's share price performance doesn't actually look that bad, with the stock gaining rapidly from the January low last year on the back of sharp gains in the price of its main profit earner, iron ore, as well as other commodities, especially coal. But over the longer term, BHP's performance becomes much less impressive. The stock dropped to just above A$19 in November of 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis. Buying BHP at that point would have been a good investment as the shares took off as China poured massive amounts of money into resource-heavy infrastructure projects in order to stimulate growth after the global downturn. BHP rode the wave to a peak of A$44.89 on April 11, 2011, but after that it was all downhill until the low of January 2016, as iron ore and coal notched up five consecutive losing years. Bhp's Role in Its Own Downturn It would be a simple argument to say that BHP merely tracked the decline in commodity prices, but that ignores the company's own complicity in causing prices to slide. In common with its peers, BHP decided to use the cash generated from the sharp rise in commodity prices on the back of Chinese stimulus to dramatically boost production, particularly in iron ore. As soon as one major producer decided that the China story was a never-ending gift to miners, basically they all had to follow or stand to lose market share. The management and board of BHP at the time made the mistake of believing the optimistic view of forecast Chinese steel output, while ignoring the historic fact that virtually every commodity boom is ended by too much supply being built. The company was perhaps too loose with its cash. With the benefit of hindsight it overpaid for its U.S. shale assets and it frittered money away on failed attempts to take over a Canadian potash producer. It took a few years to realise the errors, and BHP dramatically shifted course when appointing Andrew Mackenzie as chief executive in May 2013, with his razor-like focus on driving down costs and pulling back from the deal-making beloved by his predecessor Marius Kloppers. BHP today still appears to be running very much along the lines Andrew Mackenzie set, namely a strong focus on cost-control and boosting efficiencies in order to generate strong cash flow. The problem is some investors want more, with activist shareholder group Elliott Management pushing for BHP to exit its U.S. petroleum business and focus more on giving returns to shareholders. The appointment of former packaging executive Ken MacKenzie as chairman can be chalked up as a victory for Elliot, given the hedge fund's demand for board renewal and new thinking. But how much should MacKenzie listen to shareholders such as Elliott, given they are most likely focused on maximising returns on a fairly short-term basis, as opposed to longer-term investors such as pension funds that make up the bulk of BHP's shareholders. It's here where MacKenzie has to look at what kind of company BHP wants to be. If he chooses the Andrew Mackenzie model of trying to be the best at digging up and shipping various minerals, then BHP should focus on returning as much money as possible to shareholders as dividends, while making it explicit that those returns will be linked to the vagaries of commodity prices. On the other hand, BHP can try to run as leanly as possible while still aggressively seeking expansion opportunities using the cash generated from its existing operations. That sounds like the best path, but the problem is it seems that virtually every major mining company struggles to simultaneously be both a cutting-edge, growth-focused innovator and a cost-driven dividend play.

Flynn,Michael Dreeben,Mike Pence,Robert Mueller,Robert Ray,Sam Buell,Tom Kirkendall,Vincent,USA,TRUMP/RUSSIA,LAWYERS (PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"June 19 (Reuters) - A veteran federal prosecutor recruited onto special counsel Robert Mueller's team is known for a skill that may come in handy in the investigation of potential ties between Russia and U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team: persuading witnesses to turn on friends, colleagues and superiors. Andrew Weissmann, who headed the U.S. Justice Department's criminal fraud section before joining Mueller's team last month, is best known for two assignments - the investigation of now-defunct energy company Enron and organized crime cases in Brooklyn, New York - that depended heavily on gaining witness cooperation. Securing the cooperation of people close to Trump, many of whom have been retaining their own lawyers, could be important for Mueller, who was named by the Justice Department as special counsel on May 17 and is investigating, among other issues, whether Trump himself has sought to obstruct justice. Trump has denied allegations of both collusion and obstruction.  Flipping  witnesses is a common, although not always successful, tactic in criminal prosecutions. Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel examining former President Bill Clinton, noted that Trump's fired former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has already offered through his lawyer to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity, suggesting potential willingness to cooperate as a witness.  It would seem to me the time is now to make some decisions about what you have and what leverage can be applied to get the things you don't have,  Ray said, referring to Mueller's team. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and others close to the president already have hired their own lawyers to help navigate Mueller's expanding probe and ongoing congressional investigations. Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, said Weissmann is willing to take risks to secure witness testimony that other prosecutors might not. Ruemmler worked with Weissmann on the Justice Department's Enron task force that investigated the massive corporate fraud that led to the company's 2001 collapse. Ruemmler recalled that Weissmann had a hunch that former Enron treasurer Ben Glisan would be willing to talk despite already having pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate. So Weissmann had U.S. marshals bring Glisan before the grand jury from prison, Ruemmler said. 'Not Afraid to Lose' Other prosecutors might have feared Glisan's testimony could contradict their theory of the case, Ruemmler said, but Weissmann's gamble paid off when the former executive became a key witness.  He's not afraid to lose, and that is sometimes an unusual quality,  Ruemmler said of Weissmann. Weissmann also led lengthy negotiations with lawyers for Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer and a star prosecution witness in the case, gaining leverage from the fact that prosecutors had indicted Fastow's wife, also a former Enron employee, on tax fraud charges. Both pleaded guilty, and Fastow testified against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was convicted in 2006. Fastow declined to comment. Glisan could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Mueller and the Trump legal team declined to comment. Critics have said say Weissmann's hardball approach can lead to prosecutorial overreach. A number of Enron convictions were overturned on appeal, and Skilling's 24-year sentence was later reduced by 10 years. Defense lawyer Tom Kirkendall, who represented clients related to the Enron case, said the task force intimidated witnesses and misinterpreted the law. But Sam Buell, a former prosecutor who was a member of the Enron task force, called such criticism routine in high-stakes cases. Mueller has several other highly experienced lawyers on his team, including U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. Trump has also been building a legal team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, with veteran Washington defense lawyer John Dowd recently coming aboard. Before his work relating to Enron, Weissmann served as a federal prosecutor in the organized crime bureau in Brooklyn. In 1997, he and trial partner George Stamboulidis brought down one of the country's most powerful mob bosses, Vincent  the Chin  Gigante, with the help of turncoat witnesses.  We cut our teeth in the organized crime section,  said Stamboulidis, now in private practice.  And the only way you can make those cases is to get people to cooperate, even when the oath of Omerta (a Mafia code of silence and non-cooperation with authorities) was strong and in full play.

At a closed-door meeting last month, Arizona State University ecologist Leah Gerber presented a plan to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials that would use a mathematical formula to direct government money away from endangered and threatened species she calls  over-funded failures  and toward plants and animals that can more easily be saved. Gavin Shire, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an email to Reuters that the agency is examining the controversial proposal.  We have worked closely with this group of scientists as they developed this new conservation tool, and while we have not made any determinations yet, are impressed with its potential,  Shire said.  We will be exploring further if and how we may best use it to improve the effectiveness of our recovery efforts.  Gerber's May 5 meeting with administration officials and their stated interest in her proposal have not been previously reported. The agency would not comment further.  The proposal comes at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to cut billions from the budgets of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, which oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Endangered Species Act bars the government from deciding which animals and plants become extinct. But funding one species over another could let some decline or die out.   I just don’t think it’s possible to save all species even though I would like to,  said Gerber, a self-described Democrat and environmentalist.  That's an uncomfortable thing to say and I don’t like it but that’s the reality.  Gerber said as many as 200 additional species could be saved by directing funds away from species such as the iconic northern spotted owl - whose numbers have declined despite millions of dollars spent on conservation efforts - and toward those with a better chance of survival. So-called conservation triage is already being used in New Zealand and the Australian state of New South Wales, but Gerber has developed a specific algorithm for the United States that considers the expense and needs of local species as well as rules laid out by the Endangered Species Act. Gerber came up with the idea for a U.S. model while Democratic former President Barack Obama was in office, pitching the concept to  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials before her algorithm was developed. Given the proposed budget cuts, some proponents say it may have a better chance of adoption under the Trump administration. To opponents, conservation triage is an impractical and immoral policy that effectively allows bureaucrats to play God.   If we let species go extinct, there is no bringing them back,  said Rebecca Riley, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Increased funding would allow more species to be saved without sacrificing those that are costly to help, she said. Winners and Losers    In making her case to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Gerber flashed graphs and charts across brightly-colored monitors ringing the meeting room, but said she showed the names of species in code to avoid hot-button issues. According to research she conducted in 2013, species that might be recommended for an increase in funding include an endangered western reindeer called the woodland caribou, the Indiana bat, the Hawaiian crow and others. She expects the new algorithm to show similar results. The threatened Northern Spotted Owl is shown in this undated handout photo provided June 13, 2017.  Courtesy Shane Jeffries/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Handout via REUTERS    Those that could be left with less government help include the Florida scrub-jay, California's marbled murrelet, Texas' golden-cheeked warbler, the West Coast's white sturgeon fish and Florida's gopher tortoise. Numerous plants could also lose funding. Then there is the northern spotted owl, which in the 1990s became a symbol of the battle between conservationists and business when the government placed restrictions on the timber industry to protect its old-growth forest habitat.     Today, in struggling former lumber towns of the Pacific Northwest, some residents still blame the spotted owl in part for economic decline. Since 1990, amid habitat protections as well as unrelated economic pressures, the number of sawmills in California has dropped from 117 to 27, according to U.S. government figures.  The county has never recovered from the Spotted Owl,  said Keith Groves, a Trinity County Supervisor who spent his childhood in the Northern California area when it was logging country. Lumber-related work had sustained his father and grandfather, but Groves became a winemaker after the timber industry's collapse. Locals do not blame the loss entirely on protections for the owl, but the abrupt halt to most logging on federal land connected with the animal's protection shook the region's economy, he said.   Tom Wheeler, a spotted owl expert with the Environmental Protection Information Center, said even with current levels of support the bird could become extinct by 2050. Slideshow (5 Images) We need to do everything within our power to stop that from happening,  Wheeler said.  We have a legal obligation under the Endangered Species Act, but I think more forcefully we have a moral obligation to do it.   Despite protected habitat and about $4.5 million, adjusted for inflation, that Gerber calculates has been spent annually between 1989 and 2011 to help the owl recover, federal statistics show its numbers have declined by about 4 percent per year. About 4,800 northern spotted owls are left in North America, according to the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife.      Beloved Creatures  Supporters of the triage idea prefer the term  strategic prioritization,  saying there is a difference between actively deciding to let a species decline and choosing to spend more on those with better chances of recovery.     One proponent is Hugh Possingham, an Australian scientist and an architect of the policy in that country. Now the chief scientist for U.S. environmental group The Nature Conservancy, Possingham wants to see similar policies adopted in the United States.     “I’m always amazed that this is a contentious issue. I’ve had people discuss it with me and end up with a fit,  he said.  But the mathematics and the economics of doing the best you can with the resources you have - I don’t know why that’s contentious at all.”      The Australian state of New South Wales, which in 2013 adopted a strategic prioritization algorithm, decided to keep funding recovery efforts for some species that the model ranked as low priorities, said James Brazill-Boast, senior project officer with the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage.     For example, he said, the koala would be ranked low, but Australians would never support letting the beloved creatures, listed as vulnerable by law, become extinct.     Gerber said U.S. officials could similarly decide to continue supporting species that her algorithm might reject - or non-profits could step in to help.      I don't think the agency wants to let things go extinct,  Gerber said.  I don't want to let things go extinct. ... But we can actually achieve better outcomes by being strategic. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/endangered-species-triage-idUSL1N1JG09F"},

Inside the secured zone stand two ancient shrines, side-by-side - the Tomb of the Patriarchs revered by Jews, and the Ibrahimi Mosque revered by Muslims, ensuring Hebron's position as a source of religious friction for centuries. But as well as the conflict over land, settlements and religion, there is another battle in the largest city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank: an ideological conflict between left- and right-wing Israeli NGOs over how to explain Hebron to outsiders. On one side stands Breaking the Silence, a leftist group of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the occupation, which for years has led tours of Hebron for foreign visitors, highlighting the restrictions routinely faced by its 200,000 Palestinians. On the other stands Im Tirtzu, a right-wing NGO that over the last year has run a handful of tours denouncing Breaking the Silence, accusing it of deepening ethnic faultlines and fuelling anti-Semitism with its criticism of Israel's actions.  You have to understand, there's a war of narratives here,  said Yishai Fleisher, a spokesman for the Jewish community of Hebron, as he led a recent Im Tirtzu tour down Shuhada Street, once a busy market road but now mostly closed off to Palestinians and renamed  King David Street  by the city's Jews.  There are two wars we're fighting. The narrative war justifies the other war -- the war on terror,  he said.  We're good at fighting the physical war, but at the narrative war, sadly, we're behind.  That is not how Breaking the Silence sees it. Since it was set up in 2004, the organization has shared testimony from former soldiers opposed to the Israeli military's activities.  Nadav Weiman, the group's education director, said the aim of the Hebron tours, which happen monthly, was not to level criticism at the army but to open visitors' eyes to the realities of the occupation, now in its 50th year.  We want people to come here and understand what the occupation is,  he told Reuters.  We think the problem is the policy that sends the soldiers over here. The soldiers and the settlers are a symptom but not the problem.

You're lying to them!  one of them shouted, filming the scene on his phone.  You're trash, you're a stinking traitor.  Those taking part in the tour filmed the exchange themselves, each collecting a digital record of the battle. Slideshow (3 Images)Weiman brushed off Im Tirtzu's disruptions, saying his organization was focused on shedding light on wrongdoing.  Violations of human rights are not a domestic issue, they're an international issue,  he said.  It's not my secret or the Palestinians' secret, it's the truth.  The growing criticism of Breaking the Silence has been fuelled by right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose supporters in parliament are backing legislation that would prevent the organization from giving talks in Israeli schools. Matan Peleg, the head of Im Tirtzu, says he wants to expose  propaganda groups , some of which receive funding from European countries, and are painting Israel in a bad light.  Breaking the Silence is anti-Zionist,  he said, adding that Jews have lived in Hebron for thousands of years and have the right to live in the heart of the city. Weiman sees it very differently.  The problem is the occupation,  he says calmly.  The command given by our government.   As the shouting and denunciations continued during the tour, local Palestinians could only look on, nonplussed.

Although Hermon and Yonathan were given refugee status in 2015, being unable to find work, they could not afford to rent and shared a cramped one-bedroom flat with Hermon's sister and her two children in south London. As the family edged closer to breaking point, a caseworker introduced 32-year-old Yonathan to Rachel Mantell, who lived in nearby Brixton and offered them a spare room through Refugees at Home, a charity she helps run that matches homeless refugees with volunteer hosts across Britain. Tough asylum procedures, limited job opportunities and a shortage of homes in Britain have pushed thousands of refugees and asylum seekers into homelessness, which can spiral into labor abuses and sexual exploitation, charities say.  If we didn't find Rachel, if we didn't meet her, we could have ended up homeless and sleeping on the streets,  said 30-year-old Hermon, who declined to give her full name fearing reprisals against her family in Eritrea after the couple fled the country in 2014 for political reasons.  Thanks to them, we have a home. They are like family to us. They support us with everything,  Hermon said, sipping on a mug of tea in the house that her family now shares with Mantell, her husband Chris and toddler Joseph.  We Shouldn't Need to Exist  At least 250,000 people are estimated to be homeless across England, housing charity Shelter said last December, because of a lack of affordable homes, along with government funding cuts and restrictions on welfare benefits.  The government set out long-term plans in February to tackle England's chronic shortage of housing, largely blamed on failures to ensure homebuilding is keeping pace with demand..  Mantell said her charity has offered spare rooms to migrants sleeping rough in parks, on couches of friends or relatives, and even on night buses, traveling from one end of the route to the other.  Letting people be somewhere safe ... is a really valuable thing at that urgent time of their life,  said Mantell, who has hosted Yonathan, Hermon and Ruftana for nearly four months.  But it is very sad and it actually makes me quite angry that we (Refugees at Home) have to exist. We shouldn't need to exist,  she said. While there is no data on how many refugees or asylum seekers are hosted in British homes through various charities, Refugees At Home said it has provided nearly 29,300 hosted nights to hundreds of people since it started in October 2015. Destitution  London-based charity Housing Justice said people waiting for asylum, or those appealing their rejected claims, were most at risk of homelessness and destitution since they are not entitled to regular welfare benefits nor are they allowed to work.  These people have nowhere else to go, (there's) no provision for them,  said Jacob Quagliozzi, deputy director of Housing Justice which runs night shelters for the homeless, and also offers spare rooms to refugees in London.  Sometimes destitute migrants can fall through the safety net. They're vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking, and forced labor on the black market,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. With just over 38,500 claims in 2016, Britain receives the sixth most asylum applications in the European Union (EU), compared to more than 700,000 in Germany, the EU country with the highest number, statistics office Eurostat says.  The British Red Cross said it provided food parcels and clothing to more than 14,000 homeless and destitute asylum seekers in 2016 who relied on an asylum allowance of about 36 pounds ($46) a week.   Move on  Period Even if migrants are granted refugee status in Britain - and given access to regular benefits and the right to work - they must vacate their government-provided accommodation within 28 days. This  move on  period has left many refugees falling through the cracks, politicians and charities say, arguing the timeframe is unrealistic given language barriers and the paperwork needed to secure rental properties or employment. In April, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Refugees, which consists of cross-party members of parliament, urged the interior ministry to extend the period to 50 days.  But the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across the country, says the 28-day period is mostly an issue in larger cities like London, where there is a housing shortage, but not as problematic in smaller towns.  For people who feel they need to move to cities, perhaps to be with family or their communities, the availability of affordable housing can become a real issue,  said LGA's Simon Blackburn, a lead member for asylum, migration and refugees. He said some landlords exacerbate the problem by refusing to rent to refugees, while others exploit their desperation to find a home.   There are also people who see it as an opportunity to exploit refugees, who let properties that aren't really safe for human occupation,  Blackburn said in a phone interview.  For Eritrean refugees Yonathan and Hermon, who want to stay in London to be with relatives, the pressure to find a home for their growing infant looms large.  As Yonathan spends his days looking for work, Hermon waits by the phone to see if they are eligible for a council house in the northwestern city of Manchester, their second choice. But if all else fails, the young couple have the Mantell family in Brixton as a lifeline and can stay with them as long as necessary.  They're helping us even though we're not relatives. That's generosity. I don't have enough words. It's important to have people like them,  Hermon said.  Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert.

More than 80 tribal men and women in Chhattisgarh state who say they were coerced, threatened and duped into giving up their land, could not file First Information Reports (FIRs) - the preliminary step in a criminal case - last week in Raigarh city. Some of these cases date back to 2004.  These are poor, largely illiterate people, and they were cheated and threatened into giving up their land,  said Sudha Bharadwaj, a rights lawyer who participated in a legal aid clinic to help villagers prepare their cases.  They didn't even realize they no longer owned their land, or who the new owners were. That is why it took them so long to approach the police, who are always resistant to filing FIRs in these matters,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Some villagers did not agree to a sale, while others did not receive the amount mentioned in the sale deeds. In many cases, the deeds showed they had sold larger plots of land than they had agreed to, she said. A police official said they were conducting an inquiry into the allegations, and would file the reports when the inquiry was done.  We did not refuse to file FIRs; we have accepted their complaints, and we are doing a preliminary inquiry to see if there is a cognizable offense,  said B.N. Mina, a superintendent of police.  The inquiry will take time, as there are 81 complaints.  Conflicts over land have risen in India as demand for land for industrial use increases, affecting millions of people and jeopardizing billions of dollars of investment.. Among India's poorest states, Chhattisgarh is particularly vulnerable as it has some of India's largest reserves of minerals such as coal and iron ore. It also has a large indigenous population which has lived for generations in the forests and mountains coveted by industries. Laws to protect customary tribal lands are often poorly implemented.  Adivasi villagers have a constitutional right of access to justice,  said Karthik Navayan at Amnesty International.  Given the scale of the alleged abuses, the police must also investigate whether these allegations provide evidence of a pattern of wrongful dispossession of land,  he said in a statement.

After take-off, Hubbard and her crew spoke to the man and woman separately, who gave different names and ages for the boy. Hubbard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation she was suspicious that he was being trafficked, kidnapped or even being used as a drug mule.  The pilot alerted authorities in Miami who met the boy and his companions on arrival. While unable to reveal details, a customs official later told Hubbard that she had made the  right call  and the boy had been safely intercepted by officials.  Hubbard's actions are the kind of intervention the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recommended last week when it urged airline bosses at an international airline summit to train flight crews to help prevent human trafficking. Jean-Luc Lemahieu, UNODC policy director, told the International Air Transport Association (IATA) meeting:  It is not rocket science but most flight attendants spend one hour to eight hours with passengers.   They can see the signs. It's an invisible crime but in plain sight, you can you see it if you know what to look at.  The skies have long been on the frontlines of the fight against human trafficking as criminal gangs transport thousands of children and vulnerable people by air each year. These victims are among almost 46 million people globally living as slaves, trafficked into exploitation, sold for sex or trapped in debt bondage, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index. While some training of airline staff to spot and report potential trafficking is mandatory in the United States, it is not widespread across the industry. Campaigners say this must change. Nancy Rivard, founder of Airline Ambassadors International, a charity that trains global airline staff on trafficking, said the situation is improving slowly but much more needs to be done. More than 70,000 U.S. airline staff have been trained to spot smugglers and their victims under the Blue Lightning initiative, launched in 2013 with the support of JetBlue, Delta Air Lines and others. But Rivard said most airlines are  doing the very minimum against trafficking  on board their flights. Flight attendant Hubbard, who works with Rivard's charity, said some airlines had taken action but others were  afraid of the liability of acknowledging that (trafficking) happens on our airplanes even though they know it exists .   Anti-trafficking group ECPAT-USA said that airlines' work on the issue has lagged behind other travel and tourism sectors.   While we have seen large numbers of hotels train staff and their parent companies adopt policies, we see very little movement with airlines,  Michelle Guelbart of ECPAT-USA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She said Delta Air Lines was the first and remains one of only two global airlines - with Mexico's Volaris - to join 'The Code', an industry initiative to boost awareness and stop child sex exploitation.  It is shocking that so many have continued to lag behind but we hope this changes and their peers step up,  she said. Lack of Training Rivard, a former flight attendant, said her organization trains staff to be aware of young women or children who appear to be being controlled, show signs of mistreatment or who seem frightened, ashamed or nervous.  She said flight attendants regularly start conversations with women traveling alone, such one 18-year-old on a 2015 flight from Chicago, who said she was excited to see a boyfriend she had met on Facebook but who wasn't coming to meet her at the airport. When staff checked the seat reservation, Rivard said, they found it had been booked by a woman in a different part of the country with the a  nefarious looking  social media profile of  love me long, love me good . Following further investigation, the teenager was rescued by law enforcement officials three days later, she said. Rivard also cited a recent flight from Rome to Chicago, when staff noted a 7-year-old Albanian girl traveling with a middle-aged American man - a situation that seemed suspicious. The crew informed the flight deck, said Rivard, but the pilot had received no training on trafficking so refused to report anything.  Rivard said attendants should not try to rescue potential victims themselves and should inform appropriate authorities. If they don't, she said,  they're as guilty as the traffickers .  Growing Momentum? Hubbard said education, increasing public awareness and greater efforts by some airlines means the fight against trafficking in the air is gradually gaining momentum. Dubai-based Emirates, the world's largest longhaul carrier,  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it was working on a trafficking training program for all cabin crew.  Low-cost British airline Easyjet said in March it would introduce enhanced training on trafficking for crew and ground staff over the next year. Delta said it had trained over 54,000 employees to spot signs of trafficking and pointed to its partnership with anti-trafficking group Polaris, who map all calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the United States.  American Airlines said it was committed to the fight against trafficking, used training offered by Blue Lightning and has an air mile donation program to Airline Ambassadors International. U.S. airline Southwest said it gives training on trafficking to new hires and the information is widely available to existing employees. Ryanair said all of its crew undergo rigorous training in full compliance with European Union guidelines.   Of 13 major international airlines contacted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, seven did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  (Story refiles to correct typo in paragraph 28.)

Organisers of the June 29 to July 2 event in southern England said the sculpture towering above the stately home will celebrate the  Five Ages of Ecclestone .  This is not so much a tribute, but rather a Goodwood celebration of a racer who has had such a huge influence on the sport that we all love,  founder Charles March said.  Now that Bernie has stepped aside from running Formula One, he has agreed to spend the weekend at the Festival with many of the great names with whom he has worked during a life dedicated to racing.  It's his first visit to the Festival and he will bring with him some great historic Grand Prix cars from his incredible collection.  Ecclestone, an often divisive figure who ruled Formula One for decades and made billions from it while also transforming it into a global business, was moved aside in January when the sport's new owners Liberty Media took control. The Briton now has the title of  chairman emeritus , a position with no defined role, and has attended a couple of grands prix since the takeover. In his earlier days, he raced motorcycles and cars and entered the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix but failed to qualify. He then became a driver manager and owner of the Brabham team before becoming the sport's commercial supremo. The Festival of Speed attracts a sell-out crowd of 150,000 over the three days, billing itself as the world's largest automotive garden party. The festival is also celebrating 70 years of Ferrari, with  Peaks of Performance  the official theme.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar on June 5 in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years. The four countries accuse Qatar of fomenting instability in the Middle East, funding terrorism and cosying up to Shi'te power Iran, accusations that Qatar denies. Kuwait is attempting to mediate, although scant progress has been made so far.   The Kuwaiti mediation will be very useful and there will be demands coming,  Anwar Gargash UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs told a small group of reporters in Paris.  Qatar will realize that this is a new state of affairs and isolation can last years.   If they want to be isolated because of their perverted view of what their political role is, then let them be isolated. They are still in a phase of denial and anger.   Gargash said the priority concern was in dealing with Doha's links to al Qaeda-linked and other Islamist groups across the region as well as its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Palestinian Hamas group. Early Days He said a list of grievances Arab nations had with Qatar would be completed in the next few days.  Qatar earlier on Monday dismissed the accusations against it as a  publicity stunt  aimed solely at sulllying its image and reputation.  We don't really see an escalation, but isolation. You are part of our team, but you keep scoring an own goal,  Gargash said, citing Qatar's support of militant groups in Libya, Yemen and Syria.  Gargash said there was a risk Iran and Turkey would try to fill the vacuum caused by the rift, but urged Ankara, which has  supported Doha, to be neutral.  It's early days. Turkey is trying to balance between its ideological zeal and its national interests. We are still in the phase and let's hope they are wise and understand that it's in its best interest...what we are doing,  he said. Gargash, who was in Paris as part of efforts to lobby European allies to put pressure on Doha, said he believed that when Qatar did back down, there would be a need to monitor its activities in the region, something Western powers could undertake.   There is no trust. So far it's an idea to create a monitoring system...France, Britain, U.S. or Germany could monitor because they have the diplomatic clout and technical know-how,  Gargash said.

The sources did not specify the exact amount the finance ministry aims to raise but said it was likely to be of a benchmark size. Yield guidance for the 10-year paper was 4.0-4.5 percent and for the 30-year debt it was 5.0-5.5 percent, they said. Russian government debt stood at just 12.9 percent of gross domestic product at the end of last year, of which only about a quarter is owed to external investors. But the finance ministry plans to stay in international markets to help it develop its bond market.  The government intends to maintain its presence in international capital markets and continue to develop a benchmark yield curve,  the prospectus for the Eurobond offering seen by Reuters said. Settlement on Monday's issues is set for June 23 and both papers will be settled via Euroclear and the National Settlement Depository (NSD), the domestic clearing house, the sources said. VTB Capital is acting as a sole arranger. Last year Russia raised a total of $3 billion via two issues, its first foray into international markets since Western countries imposed sanctions on Moscow in 2014 over its role in the Ukraine crisis. The first tranche, worth $1.75 billion, did not go smoothly: it was cleared by NSD only in the first such type of deal for the domestic clearing house, as Euroclear decided to stay away from the issue. Euroclear started settlements with the paper in July. This year, Moscow intends to issue $3 billion in new debt and swap $4 billion in outstanding Eurobonds for new ones. Two financial market sources told Reuters earlier this month that the ministry planned to offer an outstanding sovereign Eurobond maturing in 2028 as a swap for new paper, but the timing of the swap was unclear. Overall, however, the finance ministry does not expect to increase its dependence on international markets as a source of funding.  The government expects that the relative share of domestic and external public debt in the overall public debt profile will not change materially over the next three years and that domestic debt capital markets will continue to provide a key source of capital in the medium term,  Monday's prospectus said.

The regime's forces have mounted large-scale attacks using planes, artillery, and tanks since June 17,  Syrian Democratic Forces spokesman Talal Selo said in a statement.      Selo said the attacks targeted SDF areas near the town of Tabqa and the adjacent dam, Syria's largest, which the alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias captured from Islamic State militants in May.  There was no immediate comment from the Syrian army. The Kurdish-led SDF began this month to push into Raqqa, Islamic State's base of operations in Syria. With air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition, they had been encircling the city since November.  If the regime continues attacking our positions in Raqqa province, we will be forced to retaliate...and defend our forces,  Selo said, accusing the government and its allies of trying to obstruct the Raqqa offensive.  The Syrian government has previously said it considers Deir al-Zor and the Badia region, south of Raqqa, as its military priorities, signaling that it did not intend to challenge the SDF's Raqqa campaign.  On Sunday, a U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet southwest of Raqqa, with Washington saying the army had dropped bombs near the SDF. Damascus said the plane was downed while flying a mission against Islamic State. The Syrian army said the plane crashed and the pilot was missing in the first such downing of a Syrian jet by the United States since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. The U.S. Central Command said the Syrian plane was downed in self-defense after  pro-Syrian regime forces  attacked an SDF-held town near Tabqa. Islamic State has been on the back foot in Syria over the past year, losing territory to separate military campaigns, including by the SDF and by the Russian-backed Syrian army.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar on June 5 in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years. The four countries accuse Qatar of fomenting instability in the Middle East, funding terrorism and cosying up to Shi'te power Iran, accusations that Qatar denies. Kuwait is attempting to mediate, although scant progress has been made so far.  The Kuwaiti mediation will be very useful and there will be demands coming,  Anwar Gargash UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs told a small group of reporters in Paris.  Qatar will realise that this is a new state of affairs and isolation can last years.  If they want to be isolated because of their perverted view of what their political role is, then let them be isolated. They are still in a phase of denial and anger.  Gargash said the priority concern was in dealing with Doha's links to al Qaeda-linked and other Islamist groups across the region as well as its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Palestinian Hamas group. Early Days He said a list of grievances Arab nations had with Qatar would be completed in the next few days. Qatar earlier on Monday dismissed the accusations against it as a  publicity stunt  aimed solely at sulllying its image and reputation.  We don't really see an escalation, but isolation. You are part of our team, but you keep scoring an own goal,  Gargash said, citing Qatar's support of militant groups in Libya, Yemen and Syria. Gargash said there was a risk Iran and Turkey would try to fill the vacuum caused by the rift, but urged Ankara, which has supported Doha, to be neutral.  It's early days. Turkey is trying to balance between its ideological zeal and its national interests. We are still in the phase and let's hope they are wise and understand that it's in its best interest...what we are doing,  he said. Gargash, who was in Paris as part of efforts to lobby European allies to put pressure on Doha, said he believed that when Qatar did back down, there would be a need to monitor its activities in the region, something Western powers could undertake.  There is no trust. So far it's an idea to create a monitoring system...France, Britain, U.S. or Germany could monitor because they have the diplomatic clout and technical know-how,  Gargash said.

India's air force needs hundreds of aircraft to replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said foreign suppliers would have to make the planes in India with a local partner to help build a domestic industrial base and cut outright imports. But Modi's Make-in-India drive runs the risk of conflicting with U.S. President Donald Trump's America First campaign under which he has been pressing for companies to invest in the United States and create jobs instead of setting up factories abroad. In announcing their agreement at the Paris Airshow, Lockheed and Tata said moving the production base to India would still retain jobs in the United States.    F-16 production in India supports thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the U.S., creates new manufacturing jobs in India, and positions Indian industry at the center of the most extensive fighter aircraft supply ecosystem in the world,  a joint statement by the firms said. Sweden's Saab (SAABb.ST) is the other contender to supply the Indian Air Force, offering to make its Gripen fighter in India. It has not yet announced a local partner for the plane which it has pitched as a modern alternative to the F-16s. The announcement comes days before Modi travels to Washington for a first meeting with Trump, scheduled for June. 26. India and the United States have built a close defense relationship in recent years with Washington emerging as among the top three arms suppliers to India, along with Russia and Israel. India will also have the chance to export the F-16 that is flown by air forces around the world, the joint statement said.  Some 3,200 of these planes are being flown by 26 countries and the model that is being offered to India will be Block 70, the most modern of all the F-16s.  This unprecedented F-16 production partnership between the world’s largest defense contractor and India’s premier industrial house provides India the opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft, the newest and most advanced version of the world’s most successful, combat-proven multi-role fighter,  the statement said.  Tata is already building airframe components for the C-130 military transport aircraft.  India has not opened formal bidding for the jet order, which is expected to be anything from 100 planes to 250.

The IPO will be the biggest on the Budapest bourse in years and offers hope for a possible revival of a market currently dominated by four blue-chip stocks.  This is a milestone in the life of the bourse as a new, large company enters the market ... and a new sector will be represented,  Richard Vegh, chief executive of the bourse told a news conference. Waberer's will be the fifth largest blue-chip on the bourse, and trading is expected to start on July 6, he added. Waberer's is one of Europe's biggest haulage businesses with a fleet of more than 3,500 vehicles. The company said on Monday it would offer up to 11,735,085 shares from now to June 29. It is priced in a range from 5,100 to 6,300 forints per share, with the price to be set on June 29. It will comprise up to 3,088,236 newly issued ordinary shares and existing shares held by CEE Transport Holding BV. The offering will include a private placement to institutional investors and a public offering of up to 1,379,718 existing shares, up to 297,175 over-allotment shares and up to 617,647 new shares in Hungary. Assuming all offered shares are sold at the mid-point of the offer price range, the total net proceeds are expected to amount to around 197 million euros, of which Waberer's will receive about 45 million, it said in a statement. The company said it would use around 32 million euros of the proceeds to help fund the acquisition of Polish peer Link, with the rest used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Waberer's signed a deal to buy Link in May.  This (Poland) is the strategic direction where we wanted to make our foothold,  Waberer's chief executive Ferenc Lajko told a news conference.  Our vision is that within 4-5 years we want to have a fleet of several thousand trucks in Poland.  Lajko said the company was also considering other acquisition targets, and its presence on the stock market could be a catalyst in growth. The company is indirectly controlled by funds advised by Mid Europa Partners, a financial investor. Shares held by the funds will be sold via CEE Transport Holding BV, Waberer's has said.

Some 3,200 of these planes are being flown by 26 countries and the model that is being offered to India will be Block 70, the most modern of all the F-16s.  This unprecedented F-16 production partnership between the world’s largest defense contractor and India’s premier industrial house provides India the opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft, the newest and most advanced version of the world’s most successful, combat-proven multi-role fighter,  the statement said. Tata is already building airframe components for the C-130 military transport aircraft. India has not opened formal bidding for the jet order, which is expected to be anything from 100 planes to 250.

The issue ratings on Oman's senior unsecured foreign-currency bonds and on the sukuk trust certificates issued by Oman Sovereign Sukuk S.A.O.C. have also been affirmed at 'BBB'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'A-' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F2'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Oman's fiscal deficit widened to 21.4% of GDP in 2016, the highest of any Fitch-rated sovereign, after 16.6% in 2015. Although government spending fell nearly 6% from 2015, it was still 8% above budget against a fall in revenue of 17%. High defence spending and the policy of completing infrastructure projects thwarted the government's efforts to achieve the much sharper spending adjustment outlined in the 2016 budget. A forecast recovery in oil prices, expenditure adjustment, and the implementation of new hydrocarbon projects play a key role in the expected fiscal consolidation in Oman. We forecast that the budget deficit will narrow to 11.9% of GDP in 2017 on the back of higher oil prices and lower defence and investment spending. More fiscal measures are also in the pipeline. A review of corporate tax exemptions and an increase of tax rates is effective from January 2017 and will begin to have a cash flow impact in 2018. The government expects to implement an excise tax this July and VAT in 2018, which Fitch expects to have a meaningful impact on revenue starting in 2019. The risks to fiscal consolidation are high and the credibility and cohesion of the government's approach continues to be tested. Defence spending could prove difficult to cut given regional security challenges. The government could be reluctant to let infrastructure spending fall because of its importance to growth and to the diversification plan. A small annual increase in civil service salaries highlights the social sensitivity of wage restraint. Similarly, the government's decision to cap the price of a particular grade of fuel pending the introduction of a compensatory mechanism for poorer citizens highlights that subsidy reforms are not yet entrenched. Oman's external balance sheet strengths are dwindling as the government issues debt and uses its wealth funds to finance deficits and bolster central bank reserves. Sovereign net foreign assets will fall to 14% of GDP in 2018 in our forecast, little more than a quarter of their peak of nearly 58% of GDP in 2015. We estimate that the country moved into an overall net external debtor position in 2016. Under our baseline assumptions, which include a moderate rise in oil prices, implementation of identified fiscal measures and no draw-downs from wealth funds beyond 2019, Oman's government debt will surpass 50% of GDP in 2026 (from 13% of GDP in 2015).  As a result, it will soon compare unfavourably with the 'BBB' median government debt ratio of nearly 43% of GDP. Oman's sovereign net foreign asset position will continue to exceed the 'BBB' median of 3% of GDP, underpinned by the USD18 billion in foreign assets held by the State General Reserve Fund of Oman (SGRF) as at end-2016, which is not included in central bank reserves. This buffer supports Oman's market access and the stability of the exchange rate peg. The reserve coverage ratio, at 5.6 months of current external payments, was slightly below the 'BBB' median and is inflated by the presence of Iranian deposits at the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) worth around USD4.4 billion. We expect real GDP to contract 0.3% in 2017 before rebounding in 2018. The contraction is led by Oman's commitment to cut oil production in line with Opec. Non-hydrocarbon growth will also slow amid government consolidation and somewhat tighter banking sector liquidity. Growth already slowed to 2.3% in 2016, as growing oil output and strong real estate and construction activity offset a contraction in trade and manufacturing. We expect the Khazzan gas field to come on stream in 2018, eventually increasing gas production by 25% (worth around USD5 billion), supporting domestic industries and allowing Oman to fully utilise its existing LNG export capacity. Oman scores in line with the 'BBB' median on World Bank governance indicators, held back by low scores on 'Voice and Accountability'. The domestic political scene remains stable, but uncertainty continues to surround the succession to 76-year old Sultan Qaboos, who has undergone extensive medical treatment abroad but has not publicly designated a successor. The constitution stipulates that the ruling family must choose a new Sultan within three days of the post becoming vacant; otherwise a letter is opened with the Sultan's recommendation. We see little risk of sanctions being directed at Oman over its close relationship with Iran. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Oman a score equivalent to a rating of 'BBB' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee did not adjust the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factor that could lead to a downgrade would be continued rapid erosion of the fiscal or external positions, for example as a result of a failure to implement fiscal reforms or due to a renewed fall in oil prices. The main factor that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable is: - Narrowing of the budget deficit allowing stabilisation of the government debt/GDP, either through active fiscal measures or a sustained increase in oil prices. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that Brent crude will average USD52.5/bbl in 2017 and USD55/bbl in 2018. Fitch assumes that an eventual transition of power from Sultan Qaboos will be smooth and ensure broad policy continuity. Fitch assumes no change to the peg of the Omani rial to the US dollar.

The spot rupee ended at 153.18/23 after it began trading for the first time since May 5 when the central bank had fixed the spot reference rate at 152.50. In the absence of active spot trade since then, rupee forwards have been active.  The spot rupee started trading today after a long time, I think the central bank decided to let it go,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Another dealer confirmed the spot trade, saying there was no intervention by the central bank. The banking regulator is not expected to intervene in the market, dealers said, due to a mid-year foreign exchange reserves target and seasonal demand for dollars, expected from August.

The cutback, announced last week by the Israeli government, is expected to shorten by at least 45 minutes the daily average of four hours of power that Gaza's 2 million residents receive from an electricity grid dependent on Israeli supplies, Palestinian officials said. The Palestinian Energy Authority said the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) had cut by eight megawatts the 120 megawatts it supplies to the Gaza Strip over power lines. An IEC spokeswoman confirmed a cutback had begun, in line with the West Bank-based Palestinian government's decision to cover only 70 percent of the monthly cost of Israeli electricity supplies to the Gaza Strip. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet gave the state-owned IEC the green light to implement the reduction, saying that Israel would not cover the shortfall in PA payments. The Palestinian Authority said it had acted because Hamas had failed to reimburse it for the electricity. But the PA's move was widely seen as a bid to pressure Hamas to relinquish its hold on the enclave the Islamist group seized in 2007. Any worsening of the power crisis - Gaza's main electrical plant has been off-line for two months in a Hamas-PA dispute over taxation of fuel supplies - could cause the collapse of health services, local health officials said. Hospitals largely rely on generators for power, as do Gaza residents who can afford the high cost of fuel to run them.

JLR, which employs more than 40,000 people globally, said it would hire 1,000 electronic and software engineers as well as 4,000 additional personnel including in manufacturing, most of whom will be based in Britain.  The recruitment process will take place over the next 12 months, during Britain's talks to leave the European Union, which carmakers have warned must result in a deal which retains free and unfettered trade to protect jobs.  May lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 general election that her Conservatives fought on the promise of a clean break with the EU single market and customs union.

FILE PHOTO: A worker on the assembly line at the Jaguar Land Rover facility in Solihull, Britain, January 30, 2017.Darren Staples/File PhotoHours before the talks were due to begin in Brussels, the heads of the UK's biggest business lobbies called on the government to engage  continuously  with UK business interests and strike a deal that preserves the benefits of EU membership including tariff-free trade, guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and minimal customs formalities.  Finance minister Philip Hammond said leaving the EU without an agreement would be a  very, very bad outcome for Britain  and he wanted an exit that would support employment and investment.

Fed chief Janet Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy. There are signs, however, that the market does not believe Fed forecasts that show it will be able to continue raising rates later this year and any signs of doubt from other Fed officials speaking this week may hurt the dollar. The dollar was down just under 0.1 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength in morning trade in London.  I think that the burden of proof for the dollar (to appreciate) is pretty high,  said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London.  Even if there isn't going to be any outright criticism of Yellen, if you don't think U.S. (10-year government bond) yields are going to be above 2.20 percent then it is tough to buy into it.  U.S. market interest rates point to a less than 40 percent chance of the Fed hiking rates once more by December and data on Friday showed investors had further reduced net bets on the dollar gaining ahead of last week's Fed meeting. Friday's Bank of Japan meeting, however, played down even the chance of it beginning to reduce emergency stimulus for the economy and the yen was again weak on Monday, down 0.1-0.2 percent against the dollar and euro. The positioning data also showed net bets on the euro at their highest in seven years and there was no discernible boost for the single currency from French President Emmanuel Macron's landslide in parliamentary elections on Sunday.  There are signs that the market may have gotten ahead of itself on the euro in the short-term,  said Societe Generale analyst Alvin Tan, pointing to the positioning numbers.  Euro-dollar is also higher than expected from rate differentials We would thus temper our bullish medium-term euro view with short-term caution.  Against the dollar, the euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1210 after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. Sterling also inched higher around the formal start of negotiations on Britain's planned exit from the European Union. Speculation that a surprise election result earlier in June could generate a drift towards a  soft Brexit  has given the currency some support although many analysts expect newsflow from the talks to hurt.  While medium-term (sterling) appreciation is still likely, the tail risks of a no-deal or disorderly Brexit scenarios have increased, and should weigh on (the pound),  currency strategists from Barclays wrote in a note to clients. Prime Minister Theresa May is also still struggling to secure the support of Northern Ireland's DUP party which she needs to proceed as a minority government after losing her majority 10 days ago. The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.2802 by 1105 GMT .

The rare price war kicked off in late March as Sinopec (0386.HK) reported first quarter retail sales had slid to a three-year low. Spurred by a glut of fuel, Sinopec started offering hefty discounts in response to ad-hoc but frequent promotions by independent petrol station operators. PetroChina (0857.HK) swiftly joined in, triggering a ferocious battle against independents and international firms including Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L), said three state oil sources involved in retail fuel marketing. The heavy discounting is now spreading from the most heavily oversupplied provinces in China's north, squeezing fat retail profit margins in the world's No. 2 fuel market. The battle is proving a boon for China's drivers. In the gritty northern coal town of Luliang, taxi and delivery drivers were queued up at a Sinopec outlet after it slashed pump prices by 1.4 yuan ($0.21) per liter, or nearly a quarter, one recent weekend.   We all know Sinopec has higher gas quality but it was so expensive, so before I went to independent stations to fill my vehicle,  one driver surnamed Zhang told Reuters as he waited to gas up his dusty, gray 7-seat van.  Now I switch to Sinopec and will keep visiting here as long as Sinopec offers discounts like this.  Nearby gas stations run by PetroChina and local private operator Taihua each offered the same discount, promoting the bargain prices with eye-catching red banners, free car washes, and credits in pre-paid petrol cards. Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said price cutting was  the most common approach in market competition . He didn't elaborate.  Rare Discounts Such basement prices are rare for Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS), and PetroChina, the listed subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation.  In late March, both were selling high grade fuel at a discount of just 0.20-0.40 yuan per liter.  FILE PHOTO: Banners showing discounts of gasoline prices are pictured at a Sinopec gas station in Qingdao, Shandong province, China March 27, 2017.Stringer As the independents deepened discounts to unbearable levels, Sinopec responded by launching targeted attacks to reclaim lost sales,  said a state oil marketing official. Price battles were rare before 2013 as rigid government price controls capped margins. As recently as 2010, gas stations rationed diesel fuel as shortage hit.    But the plunge in global oil prices since 2014 and the sudden rise of independent refineries known as teapots transformed the market by flooding the country's 90,000 petrol stations with cheaper fuels. Short of retail infrastructure and barred from exports, teapots sell oil mostly to the country's 40,000-plus private petrol stations, many run by families or independent fuel dealers   The huge surplus the teapot oil plants have created is eroding the 80-percent market share the two oil giants used to hold several years ago,  said Yan Kefeng, veteran oil researcher with IHS Markit.  Sinopec and PetroChina now control around two-thirds of retail sales and independents about a quarter, according to Yu Chang, a former retail director with Shell China and the founder of AutoGo, a fuel retailing e-platform.  The battle has also drawn in global players such as BP, Shell, Total (TOTF.PA) and Exxon (XOM.N). Foreign firms now own and operate nearly 4,000 stations accounting for about 8 percent of sales, mostly in joint-ventures with Sinopec or PetroChina.   There has been price volatility in the fuel retailing market with seasonal demand and supply changes,  Shell wrote in an email. Shell has rapidly boosted its retail network in China and now has a total of 1,200 sites.  Margin Hit While margins have taken a hit, Sinopec and PetroChina are far from losing money in their retail businesses, thanks to their market dominance in key consuming regions in the south and east where there is little need for discounts and wealthier motorists are less sensitive to price cuts.  Compared to 5.24 yuan a liter in Luliang, Beijing motorists pay around 6.66 yuan for 95-octane, euro-5 quality gasoline. Beijing prices are some 12 percent above the premium gasoline in California, but about half that of Singapore prices.    Sources at rivals say Sinopec may also be leading the charge as it aims to stem falling retail fuel sales and bolster its retail business ahead of a planned multi-billion-dollar IPO.  Even with the hit in sales, Sinopec's network of 30,000 fuel stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores is considered a jewel in the crown. The division is estimated by analysts to be worth as much as $58 billion. Reporting by Beijing newsroom and Chen Aizhu","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-petrol-idUSKBN19912D"},

Qatar's state-funded pan-Arab news channel Al Jazeera showed footage of a column of armoured personnel carriers moving through the streets. It reported that additional Turkish troops had arrived in Qatar on Sunday for the exercises, although military sources in the region told Reuters the operation actually involved Turkish troops that were already present rather than new arrivals. Turkey is one of the few powerful countries in the Middle East to stand squarely by Qatar after Saudi Arabia, Egypt and several other states proclaimed it a supporter of terrorism and cut off all economic and diplomatic ties. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, has used its wealth over the past decade to exert outsized influence in the Middle East, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the region. It denies supporting terrorism and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbours' political line of backing the region's authoritarian hereditary and military rulers.  The blockade has been ongoing for two weeks and the blockading nations have offered no formula for resolving the crisis,  Sheikh Saif Bin Ahmed al-Thani, Director of Qatar's Government Communications Office, said in a statement on Monday.  It is unfortunate that our neighbours have chosen to invest their time and resources in a baseless propaganda campaign,  he said, calling the terrorism accusations a  publicity stunt . The diplomatic dispute is an important test for the United States, which is close allies of countries on both sides and has the headquarters of its air power in the Middle East in Qatar. President Donald Trump has strongly supported the sanctions against Qatar, even though his State Department and Defense Department have tried to remain neutral. The Pentagon approved a $12 billion deal to sell warplanes to Qatar last week. In a show of support for Qatar, Turkey's parliament fast-tracked legislation on June 7 to allow more troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar that houses about 90 Turkish soldiers under an agreement signed in 2014. Turkey has said it will deploy 3,000 ground troops at the base, primarily to serve as a venue for joint training exercises. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbours. Turkey and Qatar both provided support for the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt that was toppled in 2013 by military leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, now Egypt's president. Families Separated Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the wealth produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million population are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual labourers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighbouring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday. Thousands of Qataris have been unable to board flights to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and cut off from relatives in those countries, in a region where cross-border marriages are common and rulers refer to each other as  brothers . The Qatari government communications director, Sheikh Saif, said Saudi, Emirati, and Bahraini families had been  forcibly recalled  on Monday by their governments despite being invited to stay by Qatar.  The humanitarian impact of the blockade is real,  he said.  The social-fabric of GCC population is being torn apart for political reasons and we will not allow ourselves to be a party to this injustice,  he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council which includes six Arabian peninsula monarchies.

After take-off, Hubbard and her crew spoke to the man and woman separately, who gave different names and ages for the boy. Hubbard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation she was suspicious that he was being trafficked, kidnapped or even being used as a drug mule.  The pilot alerted authorities in Miami who met the boy and his companions on arrival. While unable to reveal details, a customs official later told Hubbard that she had made the  right call  and the boy had been safely intercepted by officials.  Hubbard's actions are the kind of intervention the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recommended last week when it urged airline bosses at an international airline summit to train flight crews to help prevent human trafficking. Jean-Luc Lemahieu, UNODC policy director, told the International Air Transport Association (IATA) meeting:  It is not rocket science but most flight attendants spend one hour to eight hours with passengers.   They can see the signs. It's an invisible crime but in plain sight, you can you see it if you know what to look at.  The skies have long been on the frontlines of the fight against human trafficking as criminal gangs transport thousands of children and vulnerable people by air each year. These victims are among almost 46 million people globally living as slaves, trafficked into exploitation, sold for sex or trapped in debt bondage, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index. While some training of airline staff to spot and report potential trafficking is mandatory in the United States, it is not widespread across the industry. Campaigners say this must change. Nancy Rivard, founder of Airline Ambassadors International, a charity that trains global airline staff on trafficking, said the situation is improving slowly but much more needs to be done. More than 70,000 U.S. airline staff have been trained to spot smugglers and their victims under the Blue Lightning initiative, launched in 2013 with the support of JetBlue, Delta Air Lines and others. But Rivard said most airlines are  doing the very minimum against trafficking  on board their flights. Flight attendant Hubbard, who works with Rivard's charity, said some airlines had taken action but others were  afraid of the liability of acknowledging that (trafficking) happens on our airplanes even though they know it exists .   Anti-trafficking group ECPAT-USA said that airlines' work on the issue has lagged behind other travel and tourism sectors.   While we have seen large numbers of hotels train staff and their parent companies adopt policies, we see very little movement with airlines,  Michelle Guelbart of ECPAT-USA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She said Delta Air Lines was the first and remains one of only two global airlines - with Mexico's Volaris - to join 'The Code', an industry initiative to boost awareness and stop child sex exploitation.  It is shocking that so many have continued to lag behind but we hope this changes and their peers step up,  she said. Lack of Training Rivard, a former flight attendant, said her organization trains staff to be aware of young women or children who appear to be being controlled, show signs of mistreatment or who seem frightened, ashamed or nervous.  She said flight attendants regularly start conversations with women traveling alone, such one 18-year-old on a 2015 flight from Chicago, who said she was excited to see a boyfriend she had met on Facebook but who wasn't coming to meet her at the airport. When staff checked the seat reservation, Rivard said, they found it had been booked by a woman in a different part of the country with the a  nefarious looking  social media profile of  love me long, love me good . Following further investigation, the teenager was rescued by law enforcement officials three days later, she said. Rivard also cited a recent flight from Rome to Chicago, when staff noted a 7-year-old Albanian girl traveling with a middle-aged American man - a situation that seemed suspicious. The crew informed the flight deck, said Rivard, but the pilot had received no training on trafficking so refused to report anything.  Rivard said attendants should not try to rescue potential victims themselves and should inform appropriate authorities. If they don't, she said,  they're as guilty as the traffickers .  Growing Momentum? Hubbard said education, increasing public awareness and greater efforts by some airlines means the fight against trafficking in the air is gradually gaining momentum. Dubai-based Emirates, the world's largest longhaul carrier,  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it was working on a trafficking training program for all cabin crew.  Low-cost British airline Easyjet said in March it would introduce enhanced training on trafficking for crew and ground staff over the next year. Delta said it had trained over 54,000 employees to spot signs of trafficking and pointed to its partnership with anti-trafficking group Polaris, who map all calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the United States.  American Airlines said it was committed to the fight against trafficking, used training offered by Blue Lightning and has an air mile donation program to Airline Ambassadors International. U.S. airline Southwest said it gives training on trafficking to new hires and the information is widely available to existing employees. Ryanair said all of its crew undergo rigorous training in full compliance with European Union guidelines.   Of 13 major international airlines contacted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, seven did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  (Story refiles to correct typo in paragraph 28.)

While the Bank of Japan should maintain its ultra-loose policy, it should do so by focusing on capping long-term interest rates under its yield curve control policy, the IMF said on Monday. To clarify that stance and enhance communication of its policy, the central bank should  phase out  a loose pledge to  keep increasing its government bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($721 billion), the Fund said. IMF Deputy Managing Director David Lipton told Reuters in an interview later that it was premature for the BOJ to discuss an exit from massive monetary stimulus given that more time and efforts are needed to reach its 2 percent inflation target.  The BOJ should carefully calibrate its yield curve policy, if downside risks materialize, to provide additional monetary easing,  the IMF said in its annual Article 4 evaluation of Japan's economy. Lipton told reporters that the BOJ's new monetary policy framework was already showing some success by bringing down market volatility and stabilizing the bond yield curve.  We're comfortable with the stance of (BOJ) monetary policy. Recent changes to the monetary policy ... (are) the right, useful approach,  Lipton told a news conference.  What's important is the maintenance of the approach that has been laid out and accompanying it with structural and fiscal agenda,  he said.

In particular, Lipton singled out Abe's policies designed to narrow the wage gap between regular and contract employees performing the same task. The Article 4 report also welcomed the Japanese government's plans to curb excessive overtime hours, improve access to childcare and get even more women to enter the workforce. International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director David Lipton enters a venue for his news conference in Tokyo, Japan June 19, 2017.Kim Kyung-HoonHowever, the IMF rapped Japan for being too slow in introducing legislation to enact these policies and for its timid approach to lowering the income tax burden on married women with part-time jobs. The IMF also called on Japan to speed up its structural reform agenda to ensure a recent acceleration in growth continues.  It's important there not be stop-and-go policies in any of the policies of Abenomics that may interfere with the gathering momentum of the economy,  Lipton told reporters.  Abenomics has been successful and should be continued.  Slideshow (3 Images)View on Stimulus The IMF called on Japan to keep its near-term fiscal stance neutral and avoid withdrawing stimulus in 2018. To balance the need to sustain economic growth and achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation, Japan should gradually increase the consumption tax until it reaches at least 15 percent and start the process  as soon as possible,  it said.  The expiration of fiscal support in 2018 under current policies together with a smaller expansion in foreign demand would reduce growth to less than half of that in 2017,  the IMF said in its annual Article 4 evaluation of Japan's economy.  Without additional spending, the fiscal stance could become contractionary in 2018–20 due also to the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019.  The nation's sales tax is now at 8 percent. The government has pledged to raise it to 10 percent in October 2019. Under a new policy framework adopted last year, the BOJ now targets interest rates rather than the pace of money printing. But it left a loose pledge to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen, partly to appease advocates of aggressive asset purchases in the BOJ's nine-member board.

The Outlook is Negative. At the same time, we have downgraded the ratings on Tiphone's IDR2 trillion bond programme and IDR500 billion bonds issued under the programme to 'BBB+(idn)' from 'A-(idn)'. The downgrade and Negative Outlook reflect Tiphone's sustained negative cash flow from operations (CFO) and increasing leverage, which are likely to persist in the medium term. The negative CFO stems from the high working capital intensity of its voucher and handset businesses, which offsets the stable cash flow from the distribution of prepaid vouchers for PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel, AAA(idn)/Stable). 'BBB' National Ratings denote a moderate default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or economic conditions are more likely to affect the capacity for timely repayment than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated category.

We expect the trend to continue in the next few years due to expected volume growth; and this may impair the company's debt repayment capacity and its refinancing ability. Working Capital Keeps Leverage High: Tiphone has been borrowing to finance its high working capital and this resulted in total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR reaching a peak of 4.8x in 2016. We expect leverage to continue increasing in 2017-2020 due to additional planned debt issuance, despite higher EBITDA. Stable Cash Flow from Telkomsel: Tiphone's rating benefits from its 10-year relationship with Telkomsel, for which Tiphone is the largest distributor of prepaid vouchers and starter packs. Tiphone accounted for around 29% of Telkomsel voucher sales in 2016 (2015: 22%). Telkomsel, which is 65% owned by PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (Telkom, BBB-/Positive), is the leading mobile operator in Indonesia in terms of subscribers. Telkomsel's subscriber base increased 13.8% yoy in 2016, which supports cash flow stability for Tiphone. Lower Handset Contribution: We expect the voucher business to account for between 80% and 85% of Tiphone's EBITDA during 2017-2019 (2016: 80%) as the company continues to shift its focus away from the more competitive handset business. Handset sales are more competitive because of the large number of small retailers, expanding online sales platforms, rental expenses to establish stores and changing consumer tastes. We also believe that the voucher business carries less inventory risk than the handset business. Vouchers are easier to liquidate and are not prone to obsolescence, and demand has been rising as customers use more data services. DERIVATION SUMMARY Tiphone has no directly comparable industry peers rated on the Indonesian national scale, but the company's credit profile is weaker than that of telecoms transaction business PT Finnet Indonesia (Finnet, rated A-(idn) on a standalone basis).  Despite being smaller and having weaker margins, Finnet has stronger CFO, FCF and credit metrics. In addition, Fitch has compared Tiphone to companies in other sectors, such as PT Berlina Tbk (A-(idn)/Stable) and PT Aneka Gas Industri Tbk (A-(idn)/Stable). Berlina has higher margin, lower leverage and better coverage than Tiphone, while Aneka Gas has declining leverage and improving coverage with better profitability. Fitch assesses Tiphone's credit profile to be weaker than that of Berlina and Aneka Gas. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Voucher sales volume growth of 9%-15% in 2017-2020. - No change in the voucher business' average selling price. - Cellular phone sales growth of 4%-9% in 2017-2018, and around 15% in 2019-2020. - Capital expenditure at IDR31 billion in 2017, IDR22 billion in 2018, and IDR4 billion in 2019-2020. - Cash conversion cycle at 75 days in 2017-2020. - Indirect cash cost at 2.5% of revenue in 2017-2018, and 3% of revenue in 2019-2020. - Dividend payout of 25% of net income in 2017-2020. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR above 5x on a sustained basis. -Failure to roll over short-term lending facilities that leads to deterioration in the company's liquidity position. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR below 5x on a sustained basis would revert the Outlook to Stable. - Evidence of financial support from Telkom may revert the Outlook to Stable or lead to a rating upgrade. LIQUIDITY Available Working Capital Facilities: Tiphone had around IDR1 trillion of cash compared to IDR841 billion of short-term debt maturities at end-2016. The company still has around IDR100 billion of unutilised short-term facilities (uncommitted) at end-2016. We expect the company to refinance most of its loans in 2018, when debt maturity reaches its peak at more than IDR3 trillion.

Helicopters and surveillance planes flew overhead as ministers and army chiefs from the countries attended ceremonies to launch the patrols, with security taking on added urgency after militants overran a town in the southern Philippines. The Philippine military has said that some of the militants, both domestic insurgents who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State and some foreign fighters, may have mingled with evacuees to slip away during the battle for Marawi City that has raged for almost four weeks.  We need to watch out for the 500 to 600 terrorists there, 257 of whom have been killed already. The rest, based on information we are getting, are blending in with refugees to get out,  said Indonesian military chief Gatot Nurmantyo.   The spectacular collapse in security in the southern Philippines has alarmed neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia.  Indonesia has deployed three Sukhoi fighters to help with security in case militants try to flee southwards towards Indonesia, the head of the Tarakan air base, Colonel Didik Krisyanto, told the state news agency Antara. Indonesia also inaugurated a maritime command center in the naval base of Tarakan, a town in the province of North Kalimantan on Borneo island, witnessed by the defense ministers and army chiefs from the three countries.

NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN INDONESIA.Malaysian defense minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the three countries would increase the sharing of information because what had happened in Marawi could happen elsewhere. The neighbors would not allow Islamic State  to set foot, even just an inch, in our region , he said. Maritime command centers will also be set up in Tawau in Malaysia's Sabah state, also on Borneo, and Bongao in the Philippines.    Slideshow (2 Images) We see these functioning as a triangle, like a spider's web, where everything inside the triangle will be monitored,  said Nurmantyo said of the centers. A port town, Tarakan is just south of the Malaysian side of Borneo and looks out across to Mindanao in the southern Philippines, a sprawling island that has suffered from hostage taking and piracy for decades. Indonesian naval authorities had asked residents including fishermen in border areas facing the Philippines to report any suspicious people, Antara reported. Illustrating the insecurity in the area, Eman, a 31-year-old fisherman from a village near Tarakan, said he was robbed three times last year by pirates in speed boats.  They fired warning shots one time and forced us to lie face down,  he said.

Moscow's annexation of Crimea is not internationally recognized. Along with Moscow's subsequent backing of an armed separatist rebellion in Ukraine's industrial east, it has prompted the bloc to impose sanctions on the peninsula and on Moscow, in sync with the United States. EU sanctions on Crimea will now remain in place until at least June 23, 2018. They include a ban on all imports from Crimea and exports to the peninsula that relate to transport, energy and telecoms. The sanctions also prohibit EU investment and the provision of tourism services there. The bloc's sanctions on Moscow restrict the Russian banking sector's access to international money markets and ban most arms trading with Russia, as well as the sale of some energy-related equipment and technology. These are due to expire at the end of July but sources in Brussels said they would be rolled over for another six months after the EU leaders' summit on June 22-23.  As usual, the Italians have asked for a formal 'discussion'  at the summit but even they are not opposed to another six months,  said one senior EU diplomat. He believed the conclusion of this exchange was all but foregone. Italy, as well as Greece and Hungary, are among EU states more dovish on Russia. They criticize sanctions as ineffective and causing harm to the European businesses as well. The hawks include Poland, Sweden and the Baltic states.  Despite the divisions, the EU has so far been able to uphold its unity on sanctions. Its resolve would be tested further should the new U.S. President Donald Trump deliver on his early promises of a broad detente with Russia.  However, in May the United States joined its fellow members in the G7 group of major industrialized states in their stance that the duration of sanctions depended on Russia's complete implementation of a peace deal for Ukraine. The implementation of the agreement has been stuck for more than two years.   [T]he duration of sanctions is clearly linked to Russia's complete implementation of its commitments in the Minsk Agreements and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty,  the G7 leaders said, adding that the punitive measures  can be rolled back when Russia meets its commitments . Diplomats said they expected the move to extend sanctions to be formally finalised within days after the EU leaders' summit.   Such a decision requires unanimous support of all 28 EU states.

Seattle halted a three-game slide Sunday to finish with a 3-4 record on a trek on which it surrendered a total of 46 runs in its losses. Kyle Seager recorded a trio of RBI doubles in the Mariners' 7-3 win at Texas while Ben Gamel went 2-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games - a run during which he has registered seven multi-hit performances. Detroit is beginning a seven-game road trip after concluding a 2-4 homestand with a pair of setbacks against Tampa Bay. The Tigers managed only six hits in the 9-1 defeat Sunday, with Alex Avila and Dixon Machado notching two apiece.

The 33-year-old Venezuelan began the season in Detroit's bullpen and did not fare very well, surrendering 26 runs and 34 hits - nine homers - in 21 frames over 11 appearances. Sanchez, who was tagged by Seattle for four runs and six hits in four innings of relief on April 26, is 3-0 with a 3.86 ERA in six career games (four starts) against the Mariners. Gaviglio has won three straight decisions despite yielding four or more runs in two of the outings, including a triumph at Minnesota on Wednesday in which he gave up four runs and five hits - three homers - over 5 1/3 innings. The 27-year-old native of Oregon has been superb at home, allowing a total of two earned runs over 16 frames in three turns. Gaviglio, who will be facing Detroit for the first time, has served up nine home runs over 34 1/3 innings in his first major-league season. Walk-Offs 1.

The Royals have won seven of their last eight contests, closing within 3 ½ games of first-place Cleveland, and belted 18 homers on their 7-2 road trip that ended with Sunday's 7-3 win at the Los Angeles Angels. Salvador Perez belted a three-run homer Sunday to extend his hitting streak to 10 games (17-for-40) while Lorenzo Cain has hit safely in six straight (11-for-24) for Kansas City, which meets Boston for the first time this season after taking four of six in 2016. Jason Hammel tries to keep the Royals on the rise with a third straight win as he faces 28-year-old rookie Hector Velasquez of the Red Sox, who are 3-2 on their eight-game road trip. Boston took two of three at major league-best Houston over the weekend, including a 6-5 victory on Sunday in which Xander Bogaerts snapped out of a mini-slump by going 3-for-4 with four RBIs. The Red Sox, who have won seven of their last 10 games, moved into a virtual tie with the rival New York Yankees for first place in the AL East after Sunday’s victory.

The Mexican gave up six runs and nine hits - including three homers - over five frames against Oakland on May 18 in his first career start.

The Reds seek an end to a nine-game slide overall and hope to avoid their first 10-game road losing streak since 1998 on Monday when they play the first of three against the Tampa Bay Rays. Cincinnati found itself in third place and two games out of the lead in the NL Central on the morning of June 9 after completing a four-game sweep of St. Louis before proceeding to go winless on a six-game west coast trip through Los Angeles and San Diego. The Reds didn't fare any better against the Dodgers at home over the weekend, getting swept in three contests to fall into the division cellar and 7 1/2 games back of first-place Milwaukee. Tampa Bay belted five homers Sunday to back impressive rookie starter Jacob Faria in a 9-1 victory over Detroit and earn a split of its four-game road series with the Tigers. The Rays took three of four from Miami to begin May in their only other interleague series this season and have won seven of their last nine at home overall.

The Hawaii native was coming off seven scoreless innings at home against St. Louis five days earlier and has been markedly worse on the road (2-3, 5.58 ERA) than in Cincinnati (3-2, 3.45). Evan Longoria (5-for-17) and Derek Norris (6-for-14) have each homered against Feldman, who is 4-3 with a 3.05 ERA in 17 games (seven starts) versus the Rays. Odorizzi was fortunate to come away with a no-decision Wednesday at Toronto after giving up five runs (three earned) on five hits and three walks across only 4 1/3 innings. The 27-year-old has done some of his best work at Tropicana Field this year, however, posting a 3-2 record with a 3.11 ERA and 1.01 WHIP while allowing hitters to bat only .213 against him. Odorizzi carries a 6-3 record with a 3.12 ERA in 15 interleague starts as he squares off against Cincinnati for the first time. Walk-Offs 1. The Rays have the second-best record in the American League against right-handed starters (29-19) and the second-worst mark in the AL against southpaws (8-16). 2. Cincinnati starting pitchers are 0-6 with an 8.29 ERA during the Reds' nine-game losing streak. 3.

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc , the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan.  We're playing offense,  he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores.  We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that,  Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage.  I think this acquisition is a concern,  he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big.  That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart,  Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future. Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts. It will select merchandise based on Amazon's vaunted customer data, and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day. Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers. Ladd, who helped with AmazonFresh's global expansion and now is a supply chain consultant, said an Amazon-owned Whole Foods also likely will offer in-car pickup of online purchases, and home delivery from Whole Foods stores, add pharmacies and showcase Amazon devices inside the stores.  Amazon will reduce prices and change the assortment of products carried in Whole Foods stores to attract a larger customer base,  said Ladd.  Kroger and Wal-Mart will be impacted as their customers will defect to Amazon.

By Lisa Baertlein and Harriet McLeod LOS ANGELES/MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C., June 16 (Reuters) - The merger that shook food and retail stocks on Friday - Amazon.com Inc's proposed deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc - rattled some employees of the upscale grocery chain who expressed fears ranging from layoffs to the loss of their laid-back corporate culture. The online retailer hopes the $13.7 billion acquisition helps it disrupt the grocery business and expand its real-world store footprint. Carmen Clark, 37, a six-year employee at a store in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, said some workers worry that Amazon-led automation could lead to job cuts.  Everybody's been kind of joking that it's going to be robots and drones,  Clark said of potential changes from Amazon, which uses robots in its warehouses and is testing drones for delivery. But she is giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt.  I have purchased from Amazon for five years. It's a good company,  she said. Reuters approached a dozen employees in California, New York, Illinois, South Carolina and Rhode Island. Many said they had been told by managers not to speak to reporters. Several workers expressed relief and happiness about the planned sale, which came as Whole Foods faced pressure from hedge fund investor Jana Partners to improve results. Whole Foods recently overhauled its board and redoubled cost-cutting efforts, seeking to change a high-price image that has tagged it with the nickname  Whole Paycheck.  But Whole Foods has lost market share to rivals Kroger Co , Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and others that have elbowed into the natural and organic segment Whole Foods pioneered. Some workers at the nonunion grocery chain wondered whether Amazon, known for its hard-driving culture, would mean big changes to their pay, benefits or employment.  I think that they are a very profit-driven company, so there might be some streamlining as far as labor,  said Sasha Hardin, 28, of the Mount Pleasant store, who has been with Whole Foods for 6-1/2 years. A Los Angeles deli worker in his 30s, who is expecting his first child this summer, is worried about layoffs.  I want to keep working,  said the worker, who did not want his name used. Whole Foods has a corporate culture that prizes inclusive decision-making, such as allowing workers to vote on benefits every three years and disclosing executive pay.  I've heard that Amazon's culture is really cutthroat. That worries me,  one bagger at a Providence, Rhode Island, store said. At least one customer was concerned that an Amazon purchase would further distance Whole Foods from its roots as a purveyor of premium, organic and specialty foods.  This store has become a money-making machine,  said Tony Castro, a 40-year-old private chef, who shops daily in Whole Foods' sprawling downtown Los Angeles store.

On Thursday, the Fed is scheduled to begin releasing results from its two-part annual stress test, which was adopted in response to the financial crisis, to gauge banks' ability to weather an economic storm that could threaten the stability of the system. The results will be the first since Republican President Donald Trump took office. Trump has not yet made any appointments to the Fed, but Republicans have turned up pressure on the central bank to cut red tape and ease regulations. Wall Street analysts said they will be parsing language the Fed uses in presenting the results for any signs that its approach is starting to soften. Analysts say they do not expect the Fed to announce any explicit changes to the stress test, but they do expect higher payouts. According to their estimates, the Fed could allow banks to distribute nearly as much capital to shareholders over the next year as they generate in profits, a benchmark not hit since before the 2008 crisis. Higher payouts  would be significant from a signaling standpoint  that regulators are easing up on capital requirements, said Steven Chubak, a bank analyst at Nomura Instinet.  That is a key part of the value case for a lot of these stocks.  Banks going through the stress tests have roughly $150 billion more capital than they need, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck estimates. She expects the typical big bank to be allowed to increase stock buybacks by 27 percent and dividends by 8 percent, for a combined capital payout of 95 percent of annual earnings, up from 84 percent last year. The Fed first conducted stress tests in 2009 as a way to boost confidence in the financial system. Congress codified the test into law the following year as part of a broader financial reform package, and the Fed came to see it as an important tool to ensure that banks not only maintain enough capital to withstand economic storms, but also run their businesses in ways that avoid operational calamities. However, bankers complain that stress tests have morphed into an overly complex and time-consuming process that occurs in the secrecy of a black box. They have pleaded for more details about models the Fed uses to conduct the numeric part of the tests, and more clarity on a qualitative component that judges factors like risk management. The Fed has been making some changes to enhance transparency, but officials say that revealing too much would allow lenders to game the exams.  We are concerned that releasing all details on the models would give banks an incentive to adjust their business practices in ways that change the results of the stress test without changing the risks faced by the firms,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress in a letter on Friday.  The result could be less effective stress tests.  Thursday's results, known as DFAST, will show how much capital the biggest banks would have after an imagined crisis. Shortly after the Fed posts its numbers, big banks tend to disclose results under their own models. Banks can compare the scoring and then scale back and resubmit their capital plans to improve their chances of a passing grade. On June 28, the Fed will announce whether it has approved the plans in a further examination known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. The Fed has been under pressure for some time to simplify the stress tests, and changes are widely expected under Trump. A proposed financial regulatory overhaul ordered by Trump and released by the Treasury Department last week included easing stress tests. Trump is also expected to name as many as five new officials to the Fed's seven-member governing board over the next two years. Although Wall Street is upbeat about the idea of lighter regulations and higher payouts, regulatory experts are less sure that the Fed will unleash bank balance sheets overnight. It takes time for large institutions like the Fed to shift, even after top officials and regulatory mandates change, they said.  It should change over time,  said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.  Markedly? That's tougher to determine.

Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index has risen 24 percent year-to-date and has more than doubled from its January 2016 low. Some fund managers believe the expected MSCI upgrade has been largely behind the surge.  The underlying story on the macro front is hardly compelling,  said Tina Byles Williams, founder and chief executive of asset manager FIS Group.  So if you take out the euphoria around the MSCI inclusion there's not much there. Once it happens the bourse tends to go nowhere.  Argentina's economy has been slow to reap the expected gains from President Mauricio Macri's reversal of currency controls, relaxation of capital holding requirements and other market deregulation. Inflation has slowed but remains at 24 percent year on year, outstripping a government target of 17 percent. GDP is expected to grow to 2.8 percent after contracting in 2016, but that is still short of the government's 3.5 percent forecast. Another risk is that MSCI declines to add Argentina altogether, said Chuck Knudsen, emerging markets equity portfolio specialist at T Rowe Price.  Then you could see the market selling off,  he said. While Knudsen said the probability of Argentina being added to the index was only slightly more than even, other investors and analysts said they viewed the move as a near certainty. FIS Group's Williams sold out of her positions in Argentina entirely last month. She has history on her side. Data shows countries upgraded from frontier to emerging markets tend to follow the classic  buy the rumor, sell the fact  pattern. But the  news  seems to come once the markets are incorporated into the index, which tends to happen a year after the announcement. This pattern was seen most recently when Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were upgraded. From June 2013, when the reclassification was announced, to May 2014, when the UAE's stocks were included in the emerging markets index, Abu Dhabi's benchmark stock exchange rose 38.9 percent. Qatar's general stock index rose 42.8 percent during the equivalent period. In the year leading up to the announcement of inclusion, Abu Dhabi gained 49.1 percent while Qatar rose 14.9 percent, according to Reuters data. Both indexes have performed poorly since their stocks were included in the index. Qatari stocks have fallen 28.6 percent since their May 2014 peak and the Abu Dhabi exchange has slumped 14.3 percent over the same period. Still, some fund managers and analysts say Argentina has a more compelling growth story than previous countries, given its return to international credit markets after a 15-year absence last year following a settlement with holdout creditors and Macri's reforms.  An upgrade of Argentina to EM status is the result of a much longer-term tailwind created by the increasing openness of their capital markets,  said Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X Funds.  We believe this openness will stimulate greater foreign investment in much needed areas like infrastructure and create a more competitive business environment, both of which we believe will continue to promote strong growth over the long term.

Although Hermon and Yonathan were given refugee status in 2015, being unable to find work, they could not afford to rent and shared a cramped one-bedroom flat with Hermon's sister and her two children in south London. As the family edged closer to breaking point, a caseworker introduced 32-year-old Yonathan to Rachel Mantell, who lived in nearby Brixton and offered them a spare room through Refugees at Home, a charity she helps run that matches homeless refugees with volunteer hosts across Britain. Tough asylum procedures, limited job opportunities and a shortage of homes in Britain have pushed thousands of refugees and asylum seekers into homelessness, which can spiral into labor abuses and sexual exploitation, charities say.  If we didn't find Rachel, if we didn't meet her, we could have ended up homeless and sleeping on the streets,  said 30-year-old Hermon, who declined to give her full name fearing reprisals against her family in Eritrea after the couple fled the country in 2014 for political reasons.  Thanks to them, we have a home. They are like family to us. They support us with everything,  Hermon said, sipping on a mug of tea in the house that her family now shares with Mantell, her husband Chris and toddler Joseph.  We Shouldn't Need to Exist  At least 250,000 people are estimated to be homeless across England, housing charity Shelter said last December, because of a lack of affordable homes, along with government funding cuts and restrictions on welfare benefits.  The government set out long-term plans in February to tackle England's chronic shortage of housing, largely blamed on failures to ensure homebuilding is keeping pace with demand..  Mantell said her charity has offered spare rooms to migrants sleeping rough in parks, on couches of friends or relatives, and even on night buses, traveling from one end of the route to the other.  Letting people be somewhere safe ... is a really valuable thing at that urgent time of their life,  said Mantell, who has hosted Yonathan, Hermon and Ruftana for nearly four months.  But it is very sad and it actually makes me quite angry that we (Refugees at Home) have to exist. We shouldn't need to exist,  she said. While there is no data on how many refugees or asylum seekers are hosted in British homes through various charities, Refugees At Home said it has provided nearly 29,300 hosted nights to hundreds of people since it started in October 2015. Destitution  London-based charity Housing Justice said people waiting for asylum, or those appealing their rejected claims, were most at risk of homelessness and destitution since they are not entitled to regular welfare benefits nor are they allowed to work.  These people have nowhere else to go, (there's) no provision for them,  said Jacob Quagliozzi, deputy director of Housing Justice which runs night shelters for the homeless, and also offers spare rooms to refugees in London.  Sometimes destitute migrants can fall through the safety net. They're vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking, and forced labor on the black market,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. With just over 38,500 claims in 2016, Britain receives the sixth most asylum applications in the European Union (EU), compared to more than 700,000 in Germany, the EU country with the highest number, statistics office Eurostat says.  The British Red Cross said it provided food parcels and clothing to more than 14,000 homeless and destitute asylum seekers in 2016 who relied on an asylum allowance of about 36 pounds ($46) a week.   Move on  Period Even if migrants are granted refugee status in Britain - and given access to regular benefits and the right to work - they must vacate their government-provided accommodation within 28 days. This  move on  period has left many refugees falling through the cracks, politicians and charities say, arguing the timeframe is unrealistic given language barriers and the paperwork needed to secure rental properties or employment. In April, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Refugees, which consists of cross-party members of parliament, urged the interior ministry to extend the period to 50 days.  But the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across the country, says the 28-day period is mostly an issue in larger cities like London, where there is a housing shortage, but not as problematic in smaller towns.  For people who feel they need to move to cities, perhaps to be with family or their communities, the availability of affordable housing can become a real issue,  said LGA's Simon Blackburn, a lead member for asylum, migration and refugees. He said some landlords exacerbate the problem by refusing to rent to refugees, while others exploit their desperation to find a home.   There are also people who see it as an opportunity to exploit refugees, who let properties that aren't really safe for human occupation,  Blackburn said in a phone interview.  For Eritrean refugees Yonathan and Hermon, who want to stay in London to be with relatives, the pressure to find a home for their growing infant looms large.  As Yonathan spends his days looking for work, Hermon waits by the phone to see if they are eligible for a council house in the northwestern city of Manchester, their second choice. But if all else fails, the young couple have the Mantell family in Brixton as a lifeline and can stay with them as long as necessary.  They're helping us even though we're not relatives. That's generosity. I don't have enough words. It's important to have people like them,  Hermon said.  Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert.

The regime's forces have mounted large-scale attacks using planes, artillery, and tanks since June 17,  Syrian Democratic Forces spokesman Talal Selo said in a statement.      Selo said the attacks targeted SDF areas near the town of Tabqa and the adjacent dam, Syria's largest, which the alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias captured from Islamic State militants in May.  There was no immediate comment from the Syrian army. The Kurdish-led SDF began this month to push into Raqqa, Islamic State's base of operations in Syria. With air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition, they had been encircling the city since November.  If the regime continues attacking our positions in Raqqa province, we will be forced to retaliate...and defend our forces,  Selo said, accusing the government and its allies of trying to obstruct the Raqqa offensive.  The Syrian government has previously said it considers Deir al-Zor and the Badia region, south of Raqqa, as its military priorities, signaling that it did not intend to challenge the SDF's Raqqa campaign.  On Sunday, a U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet southwest of Raqqa, with Washington saying the army had dropped bombs near the SDF. Damascus said the plane was downed while flying a mission against Islamic State. The Syrian army said the plane crashed and the pilot was missing in the first such downing of a Syrian jet by the United States since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. The U.S. Central Command said the Syrian plane was downed in self-defense after  pro-Syrian regime forces  attacked an SDF-held town near Tabqa. Islamic State has been on the back foot in Syria over the past year, losing territory to separate military campaigns, including by the SDF and by the Russian-backed Syrian army.

The boars, which arrived in a chartered plane at the provincial capital Changsha, will be quarantined for 45 days before they are distributed to pig farms in Hunan and neighboring areas, Xinhua reported on Sunday.  Hunan is one of China's top hog-producing regions. The imports are expected to improve the quality of local breeding swine, Wang Xinwu, deputy head of the province's inspection and quarantine bureau, was cited as saying.   It shows that hog producers in China are expanding, given profits are currently quite good,  said Alice Xuan, an analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence.  Analysts have warned, though, that China's rising hog production due to rapid herd-building by farmers this year will damage profits in 2018.  China has been importing breeders since as early as the 1990s - from countries including the United States, Canada and Denmark - as foreign varieties have a shorter growing cycle and a higher percentage of lean meat, Xuan said.       They want steady supplies of breeders, which will help reduce farming costs and epidemic risks at the same time,  she said.  The U.S. hogs were imported by China Animal Husbandry Group. They were selected from six pig farms in the United States and underwent a quarantine inspection there before being loaded on a  plane for the flight to Hunan, according to Xinhua.  China Animal Husbandry Group was not immediately available for comment.

Chosen to fill what his country's foreign ministry has dubbed the first  techplomacy  posting on the U.S. West Coast, Denmark's Casper Klynge will be tasked with building direct ties between his country and the likes of Facebook, Apple and Alphabet's Google.  We are to continue doing traditional diplomacy with countries and organizations, but we also have to start looking into what relation you can have with these big tech companies,  Klynge told Reuters in an interview. The aim was to help Denmark understand the impact of rapid changes in digital technology while promoting the country's interests and values - setting up a channel of communication that would also benefit the companies.  If you look at these companies' involvement and significance for you and me, many of them have a much greater degree of influence than most nations,  he said in comments cleared for publication late on Friday. In economic terms, the new partners are comparable.

With tech companies under growing pressure to share encrypted information to prevent terrorism, Klynge also identified the ability of radical individuals or groups to exploit online platforms as a key issue.  Denmark's tech ambassador Casper Klynge poses for a picture in Copenhagen, Denmark, June 15 2017.Stine Jacobsen We saw what happened after the terror acts in London when Facebook came forward and said they are ready to discuss how we prevent terror organizations using its network to promote their actions,  said Klynge, who takes up his new role on Sept 1. In May, Facebook was fined 150,000 euros ($166,000) by France's data protection watchdog for failing to prevent users' data being accessed by advertisers.  If you look at what impacts us in our daily lives and how much data they can pull on all of us... (the firms) are truly influential players,  Klynge said.

Indonesia has been pushing multinational technology firms to be locally incorporated, arguing that companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google set up small business entities to provide  auxiliary  services and get away with minimal taxation, while booking most of their revenue from the country elsewhere. In fact, Google has been locked in a months-long dispute over allegations by Indonesia's government that the search giant had not made enough annual payments. The outcome of this is expected to indicate how the government may pursue others such as Facebook and Twitter Inc for taxes. Facebook is now in the process of establishing a local unit in the country, said the senior government source, who has direct knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as the information was not public. The social media giant currently operates in Indonesia through an office in central Jakarta. Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users as of the first quarter of 2014, placing the country fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, according to data from the company. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment and has not provided an update on the number of its users in Indonesia. The office that Facebook opened in Indonesia three years ago allows it to work with advertisers as well as small and medium businesses  that need an education on how to market their products , a Facebook executive told local media at the time. (bit.ly/1nRZJ0x)  But according to an official at Indonesia's communications ministry,  Facebook only appoints people in Jakarta when the need arises, no more than that. Whether they have a permanent office here or not, we don't even know.  Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last week, the communications minister said Google's Asia Pacific headquarters had agreed on future tax payments in Indonesia. But he declined to comment on whether they had resolved their dispute over taxes for past years.  It was also unclear if Google would set up a domestic unit that is separate from its existing local entity, PT Google Indonesia, which tax officials allege simply acts as a sales service provider. Indonesia's tax office estimates the total advertising revenue for the industry in the country at around $830 million, with Google and Facebook accounting for around 70 percent. However, Google has pointed to a joint study by the firm and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia's digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015.

Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users as of the first quarter of 2014, placing the country fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, according to data from the company. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment and has not provided an update on the number of its users in Indonesia. The office that Facebook opened in Indonesia three years ago allows it to work with advertisers as well as small and medium businesses  that need an education on how to market their products , a Facebook executive told local media at the time. (bit.ly/1nRZJ0x)  But according to an official at Indonesia's communications ministry,  Facebook only appoints people in Jakarta when the need arises, no more than that. Whether they have a permanent office here or not, we don't even know.  Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last week, the communications minister said Google's Asia Pacific headquarters had agreed on future tax payments in Indonesia. But he declined to comment on whether they had resolved their dispute over taxes for past years.  It was also unclear if Google would set up a domestic unit that is separate from its existing local entity, PT Google Indonesia, which tax officials allege simply acts as a sales service provider. Indonesia's tax office estimates the total advertising revenue for the industry in the country at around $830 million, with Google and Facebook accounting for around 70 percent. However, Google has pointed to a joint study by the firm and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia's digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015.

The boars, which arrived in a chartered plane at the provincial capital Changsha, will be quarantined for 45 days before they are distributed to pig farms in Hunan and neighboring areas, Xinhua reported on Sunday.  Hunan is one of China's top hog-producing regions. The imports are expected to improve the quality of local breeding swine, Wang Xinwu, deputy head of the province's inspection and quarantine bureau, was cited as saying.   It shows that hog producers in China are expanding, given profits are currently quite good,  said Alice Xuan, an analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence.  Analysts have warned, though, that China's rising hog production due to rapid herd-building by farmers this year will damage profits in 2018.  China has been importing breeders since as early as the 1990s - from countries including the United States, Canada and Denmark - as foreign varieties have a shorter growing cycle and a higher percentage of lean meat, Xuan said.       They want steady supplies of breeders, which will help reduce farming costs and epidemic risks at the same time,  she said.  The U.S. hogs were imported by China Animal Husbandry Group. They were selected from six pig farms in the United States and underwent a quarantine inspection there before being loaded on a  plane for the flight to Hunan, according to Xinhua.  China Animal Husbandry Group was not immediately available for comment.

Right now there's a need for continued accommodation because the inflation rate in Japan remains well below target,  David Lipton, the IMF's first deputy managing director, told Reuters in an interview.  There's need for the reflation effort to become more advanced.  The comments came after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reassured markets on Friday the central bank will lag well behind the Federal Reserve in dialling back its massive stimulus program, with inflation far from reaching his 2 percent target.  Lipton, in Tokyo for the IMF's  Article 4  consultations with Japanese officials, spoke to Reuters after the release of the Fund's annual report on the world's third-largest economy. Lipton hailed the BOJ's yield curve control policy, which targets interest rates rather than the pace of government bond purchases.  The IMF has urged the BOJ to clarify that stance and enhance communication of its policy, as well as to  phase out  a loose pledge to keep increasing its government bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($721.05 billion).  There's obviously quantities that go up and down when you do yield curve control, but you're doing it with a focus on price rather than a focus on quantity,  Lipton said.  We think that switch in strategy is a useful one and likely to be a sustainable one.   If the BOJ's accommodative policy is backed with the other two arrows - fiscal and structural policies - of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three-pronged  Abenomics  policy, inflation will get to 1 and 1-1/2 range within a few years, Lipton added.  To get to 2 percent requires more than is presently being done. We think in particular the third arrow will have to be strengthened,  he said. Lipton said the IMF feels  very strongly  that the 2 percent inflation target should be maintained, adding that it was not forecasting that the present policy will achieve the goal anytime soon.

Without full compliance, it would be much harder for Britain to obtain a trading deal with Brussels on continued access to EU financial markets after Brexit. The new rules aim to increase transparency requirements in stock, bond and commodities markets, applying lessons from the 2008 financial crisis  Firms who need to change their regulatory permissions as a result of MiFID II should submit a complete application for authorisation or a variation of permission now, to ensure that we can we determine it before MiFID II takes effect,  the FCA said in a statement.  To be sure that we can determine an application in time for 3 January 2018, it needs to be complete by 3 July 2017.  There is no guarantee that late applications will be processed in time, the FCA said.

FGV, the world's third-largest palm plantation group, has plunged into turmoil after Chairman Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad asked Chief Executive Zakaria Arshad to quit. Zakaria refused to leave but he and three other executives were later suspended by FGV's board as it investigates transactions at its Delima Oil Products subsidiary. The crisis at FGV - whose biggest shareholder is the state-owned Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) - could hurt Prime Minister Najib Razak, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. FGV's shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states and some smallholder groups have expressed concerns about the management battle and called for the chairman to step down. CEO Zakaria has denied wrongdoing and also called on the country's anti-graft body to conduct its own investigation into FGV. In addition to FGV's own internal probe and the investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), the government has also appointed a former cabinet minister to look into the suspensions. The Prime Minister's office said that based on the former cabinet minister's findings, it had decided to transfer Isa to a government agency. He will be replaced by Sulaiman Mahbob, who will be acting chairman effective immediately. Sulaiman has previously served on the boards of state energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad [PETR.UL] and Felda. The statement from the prime minister's office also said the decline in the financial performance of FGV and Felda warranted a comprehensive business review and noted that a review had started late last year. Shares of FGV were last up 3.4 percent at 1.82 ringgit per share on Monday.     Reporting by Emily Chow, A.

The epicentre is in Croatia, but the tremors are felt across the farmlands of neighbouring Bosnia and beyond. For a decade, Fakic's Milkos has built up business with Croatian supermarket chain Konzum, which now buys roughly 35 percent of its annual output of some 20 million litres of milk. Only Konzum isn't paying anymore, not since the sprawling conglomerate that it is part of – Agrokor – began to teeter under the weight of an estimated $6 billion in debt. Fakic's experience highlights the ripple effects of the crisis enveloping Agrokor as it now faces the risk of having to cut contracts with hundreds of farmers. It's a crisis that follows years of debt-fuelled expansion as Agrokor snapped up companies and well-known brands across the ex-Yugoslavia in countries torn apart by war 25 years ago. Thousands of jobs are now on the line as its dramatic collapse since the start of the year risks undermining efforts to further integrate the small economies of the region.  Agrokor's expansionary efforts were seen as a precursor of a new wave of regional business integration,  said Luka Oreskovic, a partner at investment and advisory firm Spitzberg Partners.  However, with the Agrokor crisis still unfolding, further regional economic integration will have to wait.  The likes of Slovenia and Serbia, he said,  have already moved to shield their domestic markets from a potential Agrokor collapse.  Jobs on the Line The Croatian government is scrambling to avert bankruptcy at the once family-run Agrokor, which employs 60,000 people across the region. Thousands more jobs are on the line among suppliers.  If we accumulate a surplus of goods, we'll have to cancel our contracts with farmers, about 300 of them in the worst-case scenario,  Fakic told Reuters.  That would mean thousands of job losses across the country.   Bosnia-Herzegovina is a small country and every irregular move on the market, which we could describe as a mild earthquake, has a strong impact,  he said.  The food industry is particularly sensitive.  The crisis at Agrokor – the biggest privately-owned company in the region with interests ranging from sausages to ice cream, and construction to tourism – has sent shockwaves across the region. Roughly half of the company's workforce is employed outside Croatia in fellow ex-Yugoslav republics Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. Serbia estimates that some 700 companies are linked to Agrokor either directly or via its suppliers, and that Serbian suppliers are owed some 130 million euros. Agrokor's debt to suppliers in Slovenia is estimated at 40 million euros. Croatia's neighbours are already taking steps to protect themselves. In May, the Slovenian government named a trustee to the management board of Agrokor-owned Mercator, Slovenia's largest retailer with some 10,000 employees, and tasked him with overseeing the firm's dealings with its parent company. In Serbia, the daily Politika reported this month that courts in Belgrade and the town of Zrenjanin had effectively issued a stay on the sale or use as collateral of two Agrokor-owned companies under a motion filed by Russian lender Sberbank, Agrokor's biggest creditor. The report could not be independently confirmed.  Every country in the region will turn to protectionism,  Sasa Djogovic of the Belgrade-based Institute for Market Research told Reuters. He said food manufacturers' stocks in Serbia were up 22 percent in April,  which suggests that producers would rather stockpile products than hand them over to Mercator S,  the Serbian arm of Agrokor's Mercator.  Pay the Debt  In Croatia, some 150,000 people are believed to be employed by Agrokor's suppliers. Faced with such a seismic threat to the country's fragile economy, the government intervened in April to take control of Agrokor from its founder, Ivica Todoric, with the aim of restructuring it over the next 12 months. Ante Ramljak, the crisis manager appointed by the government to secure Agrokor's immediate liquidity and start the process of restructuring, said his own  very conservative estimate  was that 30 percent of the 180,000 jobs dependent on Agrokor in Croatia – 30,000 direct, 150,000 indirect – would have disappeared immediately had the company simply gone bankrupt. That would have led to  a downward spiral to which there is no end,  he said last month. Restructuring will entail the quick sale of any number of Agrokor's dozens of companies, bringing with it possible downsizing and job losses. Many suppliers, too, fear they will never recoup the money Agrokor owes them, once the major creditors take their share. Creditors had until June 9 to submit claims, although it make be weeks before the true scale of Agrokor's liabilities is clear. Suppliers have twice threatened to halt deliveries over the repayment of debts. Some have raised alarm over promissory notes issued by Agrokor that could be cashed in at banks. But the notes said banks could claim the cash back from the suppliers if the banks were not paid by Agrokor. Deliveries have in general continued undisrupted, but some suppliers have started asking for payment in advance. At the Milkos dairy, which was established in 1952 under socialist Yugoslavia, survived Bosnia's 1992-95 war and was privatised in 2004, Fakic said he wanted his money back. Problems with payments from Agrokor began in March, he said, but he declined to specify how much Milkos was owed.  Suppliers want regular and secure payments, we need guarantees for the future,  Fakic said.  We expect them to pay the debt.

The Singapore-listed firm on Friday persuaded banks to extend a $2 billion credit line, due to be rolled over by the end of this week, but it was asked to find a strategic investor, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Noble, which has been seeking a cash injection for months, declined to comment on the credit line.  Any roll over is significant, purely because it allows this company to function for another four months,  said trading strategist Nicholas Teo at KGI Securities Singapore.  It doesn't mean (Noble) is completely clear.  Noble's decimated stock soared, closing up 46 percent at just under S$0.48. While this is the biggest percentage gain in 18 years, the value of the stock is still only a fraction of its 2011 peak price of about S$17 ($12.30). At its height, Hong Kong-based Noble was Asia's largest commodity trader, a powerhouse in coal and oil to rival larger European players like Glencore. Questions over its accounting and the sharp downturn in commodity markets since 2012, however, have left the company struggling to meet its debt obligations, and forced to dramatically reduce the scale of its operations. Scrambling to secure its short-term future beyond its debt, Noble has also sought to do more to retain its key asset - the people who account for the bulk of its revenue - turning to cash payments for those who agree to stay for the next six months. The company has in recent days converted 2016 cash-and-share bonuses into all-cash payouts for experienced traders and analysts who commit to remaining in place until the start of December, company sources told Reuters.  Noble has now approached me and my desk colleagues and offered to convert the bonus into a full cash payment. In return, I committed to stay until at least December 1,  one senior trading source said on condition of anonymity, as he is not permitted to discuss his contract. Noble did not comment on the payments. Breathing Room Trust is key in commodities trading, and Noble's ability to trade depends almost entirely on having enough trust in the market for counterparties to engage with it in multi-million dollar deals that can take months to execute and pay out. In the physical market, especially coal where Noble remains a major global supplier, traders within Noble and also with several of its counterparties said that Noble was working. But in derivatives, credit lines are key and industry sources said Noble was having a tougher time.  Unless they solve their credit situation without term limits (like the current four months), I can't engage with them in new deals,  said one source with a competitor. Noble, which has stood by its accounts, surprised investors this year with a first-quarter loss, prompting credit-rating firms to fret. Noble bonds due in 2022 traded half a point lower at 37/39 cents on the dollar on Monday, while its credit default swaps continued to imply a high default probability of 94 percent.  First, it is only four months and gives the company limited breathing room,  said Todd Schubert, head of fixed income research at Bank of Singapore.  Also, we do not know either the pricing/terms of the extension.  Noble's refinancing schedule was a top concern in the market, reflected in its perpetual bonds trading at 15/17 cents on the dollar. Coupon payments on the perpetual bonds are due later this month. Noble can defer payments without triggering a default under the bonds' terms, though the market would take a dim view. Coupon payments on other bonds are due in July and September.  What little hope remains is based on some form of white knight investor coupled with asset sales,  said Rick Mattila, strategy head at MUFG Securities Asia.  But clearly market pricing of bonds implies an expectation of default and restructuring at this point.

The present share of under 52 percent compares to almost 56 percent in 1991, a pay cut that works out to A$70 billion  ($53.3 billion) a year, according to Reuters calculations. Wages are rising at the slowest pace on record and, at an annual 1.9 percent, slipped below the inflation rate early this year. With household debt already at all-time highs, many consumers are having to save less just to cover essentials. The savings rate is at a 10-year low. At the same time, business profits are taking the largest share of the income pot since 2011. If not reversed, the trend could end Australia's remarkable recession-free run. The A$1.7 trillion economy expanded at its slowest pace in eight years last quarter, with annual growth of 1.7 percent.  We think there has been a sustained step-down in the pace of consumer spending growth as households adjust to the new world order of very low wage growth amidst the confronting reality of high mortgage debt,  said ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett. While this is a global phenomenon, Australians now get a smaller share of the income pie than households in most advanced nations, according to Capital Economics.   It wasn't always this way, with Australian households being close to the top of the international ladder in 1975. But they may need to get used to life closer to the bottom,  said chief economist Paul Dales. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), Capital Economics says, the compensation of Australian employees is below the United States, France, Canada, the United Kingdom and even Japan. That might surprise Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who long has berated companies to pay more, with little success. Possible reasons behind Australia's decline include the usual suspects - technological change, globalization, the growth of financial markets and the waning of worker bargaining power. In 1991, around 40 percent of workers were in a union and now fewer than 15 percent are. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has confessed to being perplexed, noting wage growth was well below what would normally be associated with the current unemployment rate, a four-year trough of 5.5 percent. Old Arguments Upended More Australian policymakers have recognized the danger.  Some pick-up in the labor share of national income would be welcome,  RBA Governor Philip Lowe said on Monday.  It would make us all feel better.       The country's Fair Work Commission (FWC) this month upended years of parsimonious restraint and raised minimum wages by more than double what industry bodies lobbied for.  The move affects about 2.3 million employees, or 20 percent of the workforce, and was bitterly opposed by business groups who presented the classic neo-liberal argument that higher pay awards killed jobs. But a host of economic reports, especially a RAND Corp study of studies on the UK labor market, convinced the commission it had been  overly cautious  in past awards.  Moderate increases in minimum wages are seen everywhere to have very low or no negative employment impacts,  the commission concluded.  No new studies to the contrary were presented to the Panel for this Review.  Even the right-wing coalition government of Malcolm Turnbull has been sounding less dogmatic on the subject, if only because it realized slower pay growth meant less income tax revenue. In May, Treasurer Scott Morrison declared record low wage growth the economy's  biggest challenge . Yet change comes hard for a coalition that for decades lectured workers about the evils of high pay claims. In its submission to the fair work decision, the government argued economists  generally agreed  that  excessive  minimum wage rises would cut employment, but did not cite evidence to support the assertion. Morrison's budget predicted annual wage growth would almost double to 3.75 percent over the next four years, but included no policies encouraging such a dramatic turnaround.     Analysts say something bolder is needed to break the slow-wage cycle.  The most direct way of boosting consumer incomes and potentially spending is for the federal government to deliver personal tax cuts,  said Citi economist Paul Brennan. Boosting consumer spending by 1 percent would cost the budget around A$17 billion. To pay for that, Brennan recommended abandoning a proposed corporate tax cut, delaying a rise in defense spending and slapping a tax on sugary drinks.

It reached a final close raising commitments of around €1.7bn from pension funds, insurance companies and family offices across Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. Over half of the investors are new relationships and with leverage, the fund will total €2.1bn. It will invest predominately in primary, senior secured loans to mid-market companies, both sponsor and non-sponsor backed and has so far deployed €660m in nine companies, since its first close in December 2016, including a £375m loan in April to UK private members’ club Soho House, PDM’s largest ever direct lending investment. Other investments include loans to Benelux medical equipment distributor Duomed and German auto parts manufacturer Reutter Group. PDM’s previous direct lending fund, PCS2, closed at around €800m in 2015 and is currently over 95% invested. Since inception, the fund has invested in 30 companies -- seven of which have been fully realised. Direct lenders have grown rapidly since the financial crisis in a bid to fill a liquidity gap from the reduction in traditional sources of debt. PDM has expanded its team hiring six people in 2017 so far, taking the total team size to over 30. “We continue to see a strong opportunity in Europe where traditional sources of debt capital have tightened and we have made significant investments in our team to ensure we find attractive businesses to back.” James Greenwood, PDM CEO said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. But the use of female suicide bombers in public places is a tactic used by Boko Haram, which has focused on Borno during its eight-year-old insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate. Borno state police spokesman Victor Isuku said the attacks occurred on Sunday at around 08:30 p.m. (3.30 a.m. ET) in the village of Kofa, 8 km (5 miles) from the state capital Maiduguri.   The first suicide bomber detonated near a mosque, killing seven persons. The second detonated in a house killing five persons,  he said, adding that 11 people hurt in the attacks. Isuku said the other three bombers also died.  Borno has been the state worst hit by the insurgency that has killed more than 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million people to flee their homes since 2009.  Boko Haram killed 14 people in bombings and shootings in Maiduguri on June 7.

People across Scandinavia have been taking increasing risks on housing as prices have soared over the last decade, fuelled by low interest rates and tax incentives. In March, Denmark's Systemic Risk Council called on the government to prevent most borrowers in Copenhagen and Aarhus, the country's two main cities, from taking on interest-only or variable-interest loans if their debts exceeded 400 percent of pretax income. Only about 15 percent of home loans granted by mortgage lenders should be exempt from these restrictions, business minister Brian Mikkelsen said in a statement on Monday, referring to recommendations made by the Systemic Risk Council, which was set up in 2013 in response to the 2008 financial crisis.  Credit institutions should exercise particular caution in lending in growth areas,  Mikkelsen said. Danish housing prices fell sharply in the wake of the crisis, but property prices in key urban areas have boomed since then alongside a surge in household debt. (Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen.

MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Reuters) - Mexico is looking forward to its next round of offshore oil auctions on Monday with guarded optimism thanks to robust interest from oil majors for the shallow-water tenders. On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform. In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output. Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp, ConocoPhillips, Eni SpA, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd) . All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list. Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.  The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids,  he told Reuters on Friday.  There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer.  How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added. The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data. Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that  a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent  could be assigned. The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers. If successful, the blocks could yield production of some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five years, the CNH estimates. Total crude oil production in Mexico now stands at 2.01 million bpd, down from a peak of 3.38 million bpd in 2004.

Boeing is expected to launch the 190-230 seat 737 MAX 10 with more seats and a modified landing gear at the opening of the Paris Airshow on Monday, adding a larger, new version to its narrowbody medium-haul family to plug a gap against Airbus.  We are working very closely with a large number of customers, with offers on the table,  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a briefing. He dismissed concerns by some financiers about fragmentation of the Boeing 737 MAX family into what would now be five separate models, potentially making some harder to finance.  There is significant demand for each model,  he said. Speaking before the world's largest air show at Le Bourget from June 19 to 25, McAllister offered a glimpse of new Boeing market forecasts due to be published on Tuesday. The world will need 41,000 commercial jets over the next 20 years, he said, a 4 percent increase from last year's Boeing forecast. By comparison, Airbus last week forecast 34,899 jets over the same period, which was 6 percent above its own 2016 forecast. Boeing will unveil detailed figures on Tuesday.  Services Push Workers move a Boeing 737 MAX on static display, before the opening of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 17, 2017.Pascal RossignolBoeing is working to complete a three-year study on the potential for a so-called  mid-market  jet that would sit between the existing narrowbody and widebody categories. The company is working on a cost and business case for such a plane.  I would like to do it as quickly as we can,  McAllister said, but added:  I would rather take the time to do it right.  Airbus has dismissed the case for such an aircraft, saying its A321neo, which can seat up to 240 people in an all-economy layout, mostly fits the gap. Boeing says the potential market spans 200 to 270 seats and requires an all-new plane. Empennage of a Boeing 737 MAX and a 787 are seen on the static display, before the opening of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 17, 2017.Pascal RossignolMcAllister, a former General Electric (GE.N) executive who was appointed in November, said there was huge potential for new digital technologies in production and in providing aftermarket services. Such services, which are key to engine makers and are now working their way into aircraft manufacturing, will be part of the decisions on whether to launch the mid-market jet. The Boeing official called for greater efficiency from suppliers including Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N), which builds the fuselage of 737 jets and parts of the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing is involved in pricing negotiations with its former subsidiary, formed in 2005 from the sale of its Wichita base.  We are still negotiating with Spirit. I expect the same accountability from the supply chain as we place on ourselves,  McAllister said. Spirit said in May talks were taking longer than expected and that there was still a gap on 737 and 787..    On the 777 mini-jumbo, whose production is slowing before the transition to a new model due to enter service in 2020, McAllister said the plane was sold out for 2017 but the firm had  some holes to fill  in the order book in 2018 and 2019.

White House officials said on a conference call on Friday that the administration believed there was an  economic opportunity  to save up to $1 trillion over 10 years by significantly cutting government information technology costs, reducing government costs through improved IT, leveraging government buying power and cutting fraud across government agencies. The meeting with nearly 20 chief executives comes as the White House pushes to shrink government, cut federal employees and eliminate regulations. Many business executives are eager to work with the new administration as they face numerous regulatory and other policy issues. In May, Trump created an  American Technology Council,  the latest in a series of efforts to modernize the U.S. government. He signed a separate order in March to overhaul the federal government and tapped son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions. Others planning to attend include Alphabet Inc Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr and the chief executives of Microsoft Corp IBM Corp, Mastercard Inc, Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Oracle Corp and Adobe Systems Inc, a White House official said on Sunday. In May, Trump asked lawmakers to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, taking aim at healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor in a budget that also boosted spending on defense. A 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report estimated the U.S. government spent more than $80 billion in IT annually, excluding classified operations. In 2015, there were at least 7,000 separate IT investments by the U.S. government and some agencies were using systems that had components at least 50 years old. Chris Liddell, a White House official who directs the American Technology Council and is a former Microsoft and General Motors Co chief financial officer, said on Friday the Trump administration aimed to improve government services to at least the level of the private sector. Visa Program The tech CEOs and White House also plan to discuss Trump's review announced in April of the U.S. visa program for bringing high-skilled foreign workers into the country. More than a dozen Trump administration officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Kushner and Liddell will hold group sessions with the chief executives before they jointly meet with Trump. The council also seeks to boost the cyber security of U.S. government IT systems and wants to learn from private-sector practices. In 2015, hackers exposed the personal information of 22 million people from U.S. government databases. In a document outlining the working-group sessions, the White House said the federal government should require  making it easy for agencies to use the cloud.  The White House thinks it can take lessons from credit card companies in significantly reducing fraud. A 2016 government audit found that in Medicaid alone, there was $29 billion in fraud in a single year. Following Trump's June 1 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger stepped down from White House advisory panels. White House officials said the dispute had little impact and that they had to turn away tech leaders from Monday's event because of lack of space.

We are to continue doing traditional diplomacy with countries and organizations, but we also have to start looking into what relation you can have with these big tech companies,  Klynge told Reuters in an interview. The aim was to help Denmark understand the impact of rapid changes in digital technology while promoting the country's interests and values - setting up a channel of communication that would also benefit the companies.  If you look at these companies' involvement and significance for you and me, many of them have a much greater degree of influence than most nations,  he said in comments cleared for publication late on Friday.

If you look at what impacts us in our daily lives and how much data they can pull on all of us... (the firms) are truly influential players,  Klynge said.

Insurance policies typically last a year but some can last for two years or longer. Britain and the EU hold Brexit talks on Monday and Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019.  The aim of the new clause is to provide additional certainty for clients as the UK leaves the European Union,  Chris Jones, director of legal and market services at the IUA, said in a statement.  Without any new trade agreement or business continuity arrangement, it is possible that some insurers may not be in a position to continue providing cover or pay claims on cross-border contracts.  Insurers need to set up EU subsidiaries to carry on business in the EU if Britain does not remain part of the European single market. Analysts say smaller players may instead choose to pull out of Europe. The clause allows an insurer to transfer its policy to another insurer which is still able to trade in the EU and has the same or higher credit rating. The clause is the first of its kind and could be adapted to other classes of insurance business, an IUA spokesman said. The clause was developed by the Aviation Insurance Clauses Group, whose members include large reinsurers Hannover Re , Munich Re and Swiss Re.

Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier added the manufacturer was in talks with several potential customer over a planned upgrade for its A380 superjumbo, dubbed the A380plus. The new wingtips, unveiled on Sunday, would only be put into production if Airbus received  a large order , he said.

At least 24 people have died in the centers since fighting between security forces and Islamist militants erupted in Marawi City, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial told reporters. Alinader Minalang, the health director for the Lanao del Sur province which includes Marawi, said 300 cases of diarrhoea had been recorded among the nearly 40,000 people huddled in emergency shelters set up in community halls, gymnasiums and Islamic schools. Many of those who died were elderly and had pre-existing conditions, but at least two of the fatalities were due to diarrhoea.  The cause of the increase in diarrhoea cases is sanitation issues and a lack of sources of potable water,  Minalang said. In the centers, families of up to a dozen people sleep together on concrete floors, and in some places hundreds are sharing a single toilet.  My children are getting sick. One has diarrhoea and another has an allergic reaction on his skin – the water we have to use here is not good,  said Tarhata Mostare, who was staying with more than 800 people in a high school hall in Iligan City, 40 km (25 miles) km from Marawi. She walked out of Marawi City along with thousands of others just hours after delivering her fifth child, and trekked for hours with the infant swaddled in cloth and her own traditional malong, or long skirt, drenched in blood.  We call him Martial Law,  she said, looking at her baby boy Sahir, his head now crowned with fine hair. On the date of Sahir's birth, May 23, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law across the southern island of Mindanao, vowing to drive out the militants – an alliance of groups that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. The army says nearly 350 people have been killed in the fighting, including 257 militants, 62 soldiers and 26 civilians. Hundreds of people are unaccounted for, believed to be hiding in the basements of a city that has been pummeled by government air strikes. Residents have said they have seen 100 bodies in the debris of ruined homes in the battle zone. A girl who left her home with her family to avoid the intense fighting between government forces and insurgents from the Maute group, eats her meal inside the evacuation centre in Baloi Village, Lanao Del Norte, Philippines June 19, 2017.Romeo RanocoWant to Go Home The mostly Muslim evacuees are eager to return home by the weekend for Eid al-Fitr, the biggest festival of the year that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. But for many, their homes have been devastated by weeks of artillery fire and aerial bombardment. The army says it is nearing victory, but hostilities will have to be followed by a lengthy cleanup operation – unearthing and disarming unexploded ordnance, and scouring for possible booby traps – before residents can go home. Saliha Guinar, 23, with her newly born baby Norlaila, who gave birth three days after the fighting between government forces and insurgents from the Maute group, stays inside the evacuation center in Baloi Village, Lanao Del Norte, Philippines June 19, 2017.Romeo Ranoco I will be the happiest woman in the world if I am allowed to return,  said Salema Ampasong, 28, who was among about 1,000 evacuees given shelter in a gymnasium in the town of Balo-i, several miles outside Marawi. A fruit vendor, she said she had lost all her possessions,  but I would still want to come home . In Balo-i, there's just one working toilet for the center's 1,025 residents. On the wall a poster produced by the Philippine Red Cross instructs evacuees how to wash their hands. There are no basins with taps, and evacuees wash  - and even defecate - in a nearby river. Malnutrition is another worry in the centers. Melia Sarap, the provincial nutritionist for Lanau del Sur, said initial surveys of more than 600 evacuees had found six cases of severe malnutrition and 20 cases of moderate malnutrition.  The evacuation centers are very congested and the infection you can catch could result in malnutrition,  Sarap said.  If we just depend on rations alone (the malnutrition rate) can rise up.  Particularly of concern were lactating mothers, she said, for whom a nutritious diet is vital for both the mother’s health and the development of the child.  It's not good to feed children just on canned goods like this,  said Tarhata, breastfeeding her baby.  But it's the only way we can survive.

Data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed speculators took bets against the pound to the highest since early May in the week up to last Tuesday, amid political turmoil in Britain after no party managed to win a parliamentary majority in the June 8 election. And although sterling climbed sharply on Thursday after it emerged that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee had seen a 5-3 split on whether to raise interest rates immediately on the back of rapidly increasing domestic consumer prices, the pound did not manage to hold onto those gains.  There's a general wariness of sterling,  said Societe Generale currency strategist Alvin Tan.  Despite the BoE’s surprise 5-3 vote we saw last week, it hasn’t been able to gain traction. The political situation is dominating.  Brexit Secretary David Davis on Monday morning began negotiations in Brussels that will set Britain's terms for leaving the EU. The pound has fallen over 15 percent since in the year since the referendum vote for Brexit, hit by worries that Brexit will damage the economy if foreign investment dries up, and that political uncertainty will dominate. Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Conservative party lost its majority in parliament on June 8, is now trying to form a minority government with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party. But investors are worried that even when that deal is finalised, it will not make for a stable political environment. Sterling inched up 0.2 percent on Monday to $1.2803 and to 87.45 pence per euro, after posting a modest rise last week against both currencies. Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note to clients that the fact Brexit talks were  finally starting  should be temporarily sterling-positive and  a step in the right direction . But they said the talks were likely to reveal either very different negotiating positions or - worse - that Britain has no clear strategy.  We have to consider this asymmetry: the Europeans can afford to enter into the negotiations without a strategy. They have presented their Brexit bill to the UK and that is that,  they wrote.  But Downing Street is likely to be busy navel gazing, (with the) prime minister in a precarious position following the election disaster and the (Grenfell Tower block) fire catastrophe.  (We) fear that it will become clear pretty quickly just how difficult these negotiations will become. And that is when the real high-risk period for sterling starts.

In a bourse filing on Monday afternoon, the company said it planned to issue 300 million new shares in a private placement, representing 4 percent of the total number of issued shares. The actual proceeds to be raised can only be determined after the bookbuilding exercise for the placement, it said. Maxis said its indicative issue price for the exercise was 5.47 ringgit apiece, assuming a 10 percent discount to the volume weighted average market price of Maxis shares for the five market days immediately leading up to the date of bookbuilding. The company said the proceeds would go to repayment of borrowings and related incidental costs within 12 months. It is proposing an equity fund-raising exercise to strengthen its financial position by reducing part of the group's existing borrowings.  This will also create financial flexibility for the Maxis Group to fund its future spectrum assignment fees, expansion plans and its growth strategy should the opportunities arise,  it said. Maxis did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on the share sale plan. IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, citing a term sheet of the transaction, reported earlier on Monday that the offering consists of 300 million new shares in an indicative range of 5.52–5.75 ringgit each, valuing the deal at up to 1.73 billion ringgit ($406 million). The pricing represents a discount of between 2.2 percent and 6.1 percent to Friday's close of 5.88 ringgit, the term sheet showed. The company earlier requested trading of its shares to be halted, pending a material announcement. It did not disclose further information. The new shares will increase Maxis' free float to 37.1 percent from 35.1 percent, the terms showed. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and Credit Suisse were hired as joint bookrunners for the offering.

The BJP's parliamentary board backed the nomination of Ram Nath Kovind, governor of the state of Bihar, party president Amit Shah told a news conference in New Delhi. Kovind's nomination to the largely ceremonial post of president would be expected to garner enough votes from the BJP and its allies in an electoral college that brings together federal and state lawmakers.  We hope to have a political consensus,  Shah said. Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's closest adviser and top campaign strategist, played up the humble origins of Kovind, 71, who has served two terms in the upper house of parliament and is a practicing lawyer. Kovind also used to lead a BJP unit that represents Dalits, a community at the bottom of the traditional caste hierarchy of Hinduism.  Ramnath has risen through the political ranks, waging a long and hard struggle as a Dalit,  said Shah. The BJP's traditional support base is among upper-caste Hindus but the party has sought to broaden its appeal, winning a landslide victory in a state election in Uttar Pradesh in March with the backing of many low-caste voters. Nominations close on June 28 and the electoral college would hold a vote, should one be required, on July 17, according to the Election Commission of India.  Under a complex electoral formula, the BJP and its allies control 48.1 percent of votes in the electoral college. They should be able to count on enough support from other parties to secure a majority, say BJP officials. Incumbent President Pranab Mukherjee's term ends on July 24.

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the 'A-' long-term foreign-currency ratings of the following notes issued by Zhaohai Investment (BVI) Limited: USD300 million 3.1% senior unsecured notes due 2018 USD500 million 4.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020 The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Binhai Jiantou (Hong Kong) Development Limited (BJHK), BHCIG's wholly owned subsidiary. Under the keepwell structure, BHCIG will undertake to ensure BJHK has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations. BHCIG commenced a consent solicitation for the two notes on 26 May 2017; the company will replace the keepwell structure by a direct guarantee from the parent in lieu of waving a technical breach of its financial covenant. Fitch will monitor the progress of the consent solicitation process. According to the solicitation, early voting will expire on 20 June 2017 and the final results will be announced on 30 June 2017. Fitch has affirmed BHCIG's IDRs and the senior debt ratings because linkages with Tianjin, a municipality about 170 kilometres south-east of Beijing, remain unchanged. BHCIG's 100% municipality ownership, the city's supervision of its financials and the strategic importance of the company's public-sector business to the city suggest a high likelihood of BHCIG receiving extraordinary support, if needed. KEY RATING DRIVERS Consent Solicitation: BHCIG announced a consent solicitation on 26 May 2017 for the two senior unsecured notes in which the company will replace the keepwell structure by a direct guarantee from the parent in lieu of waving a technical breach of its financial covenant. The covenant was triggered by exchange-rate volatility rather than by liquidity issues. Fitch believes the consent solicitation is likely to be accepted, as a direct-guarantee structure should provide more protection for bondholders. BHCIG should have sufficient liquidity in the unlikely event that it fails to obtain the consent and faces an accelerated bond repayment schedule. Links to Tianjin Municipality: BHCIG's ratings are closely credit-linked to, but not equalised with, Tianjin municipality. Fitch's view is based on BHCIG's 100% government ownership and the strong municipal oversight of its financials, as well as the strategic importance of the entity's operation to Tianjin. These factors mean there is a strong likelihood of BHCIG receiving extraordinary state support, if needed. Tianjin's Creditworthiness: Tianjin is a provincial-level city and a key logistics hub in northern China. Tianjin has benefited from increasing integration of the Jing-Jin-Ji economic zone with the city of Beijing and Hebei province resulting from central government initiatives. Tianjin also has a favourable socio-economic profile, with the highest GDP per capita among provincial-level cities, as well as a stable budgetary performance. These strengths mitigate Tianjin's moderately high contingent liabilities arising from its state-owned entities. Legal Status 'Mid-Range': BHCIG was established in 2008 as a wholly state-owned limited liability company. Under this legal status, the company's major decisions require government verification and approval. The government has no plans to dilute its BHCIG shareholding. Fitch assesses BHCIG's legal status attribute as mid-range. Control 'Stronger': The company's board is appointed by Tianjin and Binhai New Area authorities and the board's major projects require government approval. Moreover, the municipality closely monitors BHCIG's financing plan and debt level and the company needs to regularly report its operational and financial results to the government. Fitch has given this attribute more weight in the rating. Strategic Importance 'Mid-Range': BHCIG is Binhai New Area's major infrastructure project construction company and the operator of key public services. BHCIG's geographical concentration and asset size rank third out of Tianjin's local government funding vehicles (LGFV) and were the main factors behind our rating. BHCIG is a flagship LGFV with a dominant position in the state-level new area, which accounted for 56% of Tianjin's total gross regional product in 2016. A default could have negative political consequences and a large effect on Tianjin's economic growth considering the strategic importance of the new area. Government Integration 'Mid-Range': BHCIG's operation, as the provider of key public services in the new area, remains closely linked to that of the sponsor's budget. Historically, BHCIG has enjoyed a combination of capital injections and financial subsidies. BHCIG received CNY14.6 billion in debt swap and CNY535 million in capital injection from the government in 2016. Fitch believes government financial support should continue considering BHCIG's strategic importance. Standalone Financial Profile 'Weak': BHCIG's financial profile is borne by large capital expenditure, negative free cash flow and high leverage, with characteristics of a 'B' standalone rating. BHCIG repaid some of its debt in 2016 as part of the debt swap, which slightly improves its credit metrics, although its total debt/total assets of 58% remains high. Fitch expects Tianjin's tight control and support to mitigate these risks, despite ongoing infrastructure developments in Binhai New Area. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of Fitch's credit assessment of Tianjin and a stronger or more explicit support commitment from the municipality may trigger positive rating action on BHCIG. A significant weakening of BHCIG's strategic importance to the city, dilution of the municipality's shareholding or reduced explicit and implicit municipality support may result in a downgrade. A downgrade could also stem from weaker fiscal performance or increased indebtedness of the municipality, leading to deterioration in Fitch's assessment of the sponsor's creditworthiness. Rating action on BHCIG would lead to similar action of the senior notes.

France's blue-chips .FCHI gained 1 percent after President Emmanuel Macron cemented an overwhelming parliamentary majority further increasing his party's capacity to push through reforms.  Banks BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) underpinned gains on the index.   Markets are celebrating the fact the Macron government has been strengthened by this outcome,  said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  Planned reforms could enhance the growth potential of the country and reduce the structural deficit, something which would lift French GDP going forward,  he added. Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding said France could become the strongest major economy in Europe in a decade. He said this would outclass  a Germany that is resting on its laurels and a UK that is impairing its long-term growth prospects by losing (some of) its preferential access to its major market, the EU,  Schmieding said. Britain began negotiations on Monday on leaving the European Union.  Euro zone blue-chips .STOXX50E rose 1 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600  rose 0.8 percent. The retail sector, particularly grocers, which were sent into a tailspin on Friday after Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods, bounced back, partly on hopes of more deal activity in the sector. The regional retail index .SXRP, which suffered its worst week in 16 months last week, rose 0.8 percent. Britain's Ocado (OCDO.L) was up more than 6 percent, the top performing major stock across the region. Exane upgraded Ocado to  outperform  on hopes that partnerships, if not a takeout, were more likely.  Analysts at the French broker said Amazon's progress could be hemmed in short-term by the limitations of the store pick model - in which employees pick online orders from the store floor rather than in distribution centers.  We're minded to not overreact therefore, but the deal is still bad news for the sector, we think, unless of course you are a target,  they added.  Ocado might not be a target but the probability of a partnership just increased materially.  Dutch healthcare technology firm Philips (PHG.AS) jumped to a 15-year high after The Times reported activist hedge fund Third Point was building a stake in the company. Also, in notable broker activity, Credit Suisse found favor among analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citi and Deutsche Bank. Citi named Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) its preferred Swiss bank, while Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage on the stock with an  outperform.  Credit Suisse shares rose more than 3 percent. Mediaset Espana (TL5.MC), meanwhile, fell 3.1 percent after Deutsche Bank cut it to a 'sell', saying a recovery in Spanish advertising looks to be over. Formal Brexit negotiations got under way on Monday with Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, though this did not ruffle market sentiment in the short-term.

The acquisition will give YIT the size to compete better in its core Nordic markets as well as Russia, following a drop in profits due to the Ukraine crisis, Russian recession and weakened rouble. Lemminkainen shareholders will receive 3.6146 new shares in YIT for each share held, valuing Lemminkainen at 27.29 euros per share, a 40 percent premium to its closing price on Friday. Shares in Lemminkainen jumped 40.6 percent to 27.34 euros, while YIT was 4.8 percent higher at 0837 GMT.  The combination is expected to create significant value for the shareholders of the combined company through decreased sensitivity to economic cycles and improved competitiveness providing a strong platform for growth,  the firms said. The combined company will have sales of about 3.4 billion euros and it is expected to generate annual synergies of some 40 million euros by 2020. YIT shareholders will own 60 percent of the firm and Lemminkainen's owners the remaining 40 percent.  It makes sense, both companies needed more size. Synergies seem to be very significant if they can achieve them. The businesses complement each other with not very much overlaps,  said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Hjalmar Ahlberg, who has a  hold  rating on YIT's stock. The deal is subject to approvals by shareholder meetings due on September, as well as competition authorities. The company and analysts said they were not expecting objections from antitrust authorities as big Swedish players NCC and Skanska, as well as smaller local rivals, are active in the Finnish market. More than half of YIT's and Lemminkainen's combined sales in 2016 came from Finland, while the rest was generated in other Nordic and Baltic countries, Russia and Central Eastern Europe.

Europe's banks jumped too following broker upgrades for Credit Suisse, while there was little sign of tension for the sector or for the pound or euro as formal Brexit negotiations kicked off in Brussels. Projections showing that Macron had won a commanding majority in France's weekend vote saw Paris stocks make a 1.1 percent gain as the country's bonds also outperformed in fixed income markets.  We expect the Macron reforms to transform France like the Thatcher reforms had cured the erstwhile sick man of Europe, the United Kingdom, some 35 years ago,  said Berenberg European economist Holger Schmieding.  And like the 'Agenda 2010' reforms had turned Germany from one of the weakest into one of the strongest economies in Europe almost 15 years ago.  Asia had kicked off the week strongly as well with a two-week closing high for Japan's Nikkei and 0.3 - 0.7 gains for Australian and South Korean KOSPI Chinese and Hong Kong stocks jumped 1 and 1.2 percent ahead of a decision by index provider MSCI on Tuesday, expected to see it add mainland-listed Chinese stocks to its top share benchmarks for the first time. Chinese data had also helped, with tight liquidity conditions looking to have eased and home prices up 10.4 percent in May from a year ago, although slowing from April's 10.7 percent gain.  Generally, the environment still remains fairly positive for risk appetite,  said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore. Europe's retailers also clawed back some ground having been clobbered along with U.S. peers like Wal-Mart and Target on Friday by net-giant Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. It was Amazon's first major bricks and mortar acquisition in the sector and spooked traders on worries it could now be going hard after the traditional grocers. Brexit Negotiations In the currency markets, the differing messages of the world's major central banks on inflation and monetary policy prodded the dollar higher against the yen ahead of a series of appearances by U.S. Federal Reserve officials this week. Fed chief Janet Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy. Sterling also nudged higher at just over $1.28 and 87.42 pence per euro ahead of the formal start of negotiations on Britain's planned exit from the European Union, expected to generate plenty of headlines for the currency in the weeks ahead. Brexit Secretary David Davis starts negotiations in Brussels on Monday, which will be followed by a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday where Prime Minister Theresa May will meet - but not negotiate with - fellow European Union leaders. Davis's agreement to Monday's agenda led some EU officials to believe that May's government may at last be coming around to Brussels' view of how negotiations should be run. May's own political survival is in doubt after she lost her parliamentary majority in an election this month. The euro was steady at $1.1195, retaining Friday's 0.5 percent gain. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, was also little changed at 97.182. The market is awaiting comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Yellen's, when he speaks at a business roundtable in New York state.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. In commodities, oil futures lingered near six-week lows over concerns about a supply glut amid faltering demand. U.S. crude slipped 0.35 percent to $44.58 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent dropped 0.3 percent to $47.21. Gold touched a 3-1/2-week low earlier in the session and was trading down slightly at $1,250 an ounce at 0900 GMT.

MSCI's emerging equity benchmark rose 0.7 percent lifted by healthy gains in heavyweights Taiwan and Hong Kong which jumped around 1 percent, with stocks in mainland China  matching those gains thanks to signs of tight liquidity conditions easing. However, currencies failed to take advantage of a tepid dollar after weaker-than-forecast data on U.S. housing and consumer sentiment on Friday cast doubt on the health of the world's top economy. This led the greenback to reverse gains made in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rate hike. The rouble slipped 0.5 percent against the dollar, trading at its weakest in one month as oil prices slid lower. The crude price fall prompted a decision by Moscow policy makers on Friday to trim the key interest rate by 25 basis points to 9.00 percent - less than some of analysts had expected. Explaining the decision, central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said annual inflation had neared its long-awaited goal of 4 percent as inflationary expectations of households had fallen to an all-time low in May.  What was interesting about that meeting, more than the decision itself, was the rhetoric,  said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.  The Central Bank of Russia came across more hawkish than what the market had expected.  The market was in the process of repricing, Maggio said. Before the meeting the expectation was 300 basis points worth of cuts over the year. Other currencies fared little better with Mexico's peso and Israel's shekel easing 0.3 percent while Turkey's lira slipped 0.2 percent. Currencies across central Europe weakened against the dollar, with the Polish zloty and the Hungarian forint easing 0.2 percent. Romania's leu hovered near a more than four-year low. The currency was hit by political upheavals last week. The ruing leftists have filed a no-confidence motion in parliament against Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu.

The beefing up of powers over the online world come as authorities are increasingly targeting social media for  violations of a law that makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent. The Digital Economy Ministry aims to spend 128.56 million baht ($3.8 million) on software including a  social network data analysis system  to monitor and map individuals and relationships between more than one million online users, according to a ministry document seen by Reuters.  The software will sweep and store all data available on social media to be analyzed and monitored,  Teerawut Thongpak, director of the ministry's Digital Service Infrastructure Department, told Reuters. He said the government would post a tender for the software and then consider offers. Governments around the world buy social media monitoring products to chart relationships and networks, as well as to monitor dissidents and identify their leaders.  New York University researchers have also found various U.S. jurisdictions had spent more than $5.82 million on social media monitoring software.  Since a May 2014 coup in Thailand, the military government  has arrested numerous people on suspicion of posting material on Facebook and other platforms deemed to violate the royal-insult law.  The legal watchdog group iLaw says 59 people have been found guilty over online posts since the coup. This month, in the toughest sentence yet, a man was jailed for 35 years under the law for posts online. The government has asked Facebook to block some 300 posts from users in Thailand this year, a sharp increase from 80 restrictions during the period from mid-2014 to the end of 2016, according to Facebook reports. The junta is also pushing for a cyber security bill, which is expected to be put before parliament this year, despite the concern of civil society and business groups that it will give the government powers for mass surveillance. National Security The bill is a more intrusive measure than a recently amended Computer Crime Act, say experts, which allows authorities to censor online content but not to pry into private data.  The bill is aimed at increasing national security, allowing the state to access data of anyone it suspects,  said Bhume Bhumiratana, a cyber security expert at Thai company G-Able, which provides services to businesses. A draft of the bill, seen by Reuters, proposes a National Cyber Security Committee, with junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha at the helm, with the broad power to command both public agencies and private businesses to help with cyber security investigations. Other provisions give authorities power to order anyone to report for questioning or hand over information, as well as to tap all communication devices including phones and computers in  emergency cases , without court approval. The digital ministry said Thailand had to protect itself against crime and denied the procurement of the software and the legislation were aimed at surveillance.  This isn't about violating privacy but protecting the network,  Somsak Khaosuwan, the ministry's deputy permanent secretary, told Reuters. However, Rittee Intarawut, chief of the army's cyber center, which monitors the web for content critical of the monarchy, said the bill would help the government prosecute royal-insult offences, but law-abiding citizens need not be alarmed.  There's nothing to fear if you have done nothing wrong,  he said.

France's blue-chips .FCHI gained 1 percent after President Emmanuel Macron cemented an overwhelming parliamentary majority further increasing his party's capacity to push through reforms.  Banks BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) underpinned gains on the index.   Markets are celebrating the fact the Macron government has been strengthened by this outcome,  said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  Planned reforms could enhance the growth potential of the country and reduce the structural deficit, something which would lift French GDP going forward,  he added. Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding said France could become the strongest major economy in Europe in a decade. He said this would outclass  a Germany that is resting on its laurels and a UK that is impairing its long-term growth prospects by losing (some of) its preferential access to its major market, the EU,  Schmieding said. Britain began negotiations on Monday on leaving the European Union.  Euro zone blue-chips .STOXX50E rose 1 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600  rose 0.8 percent. The retail sector, particularly grocers, which were sent into a tailspin on Friday after Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods, bounced back, partly on hopes of more deal activity in the sector. The regional retail index .SXRP, which suffered its worst week in 16 months last week, rose 0.8 percent. Britain's Ocado (OCDO.L) was up more than 6 percent, the top performing major stock across the region. Exane upgraded Ocado to  outperform  on hopes that partnerships, if not a takeout, were more likely.  Analysts at the French broker said Amazon's progress could be hemmed in short-term by the limitations of the store pick model - in which employees pick online orders from the store floor rather than in distribution centers.  We're minded to not overreact therefore, but the deal is still bad news for the sector, we think, unless of course you are a target,  they added.  Ocado might not be a target but the probability of a partnership just increased materially.  Dutch healthcare technology firm Philips (PHG.AS) jumped to a 15-year high after The Times reported activist hedge fund Third Point was building a stake in the company. Also, in notable broker activity, Credit Suisse found favor among analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citi and Deutsche Bank. Citi named Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) its preferred Swiss bank, while Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage on the stock with an  outperform.  Credit Suisse shares rose more than 3 percent. Mediaset Espana (TL5.MC), meanwhile, fell 3.1 percent after Deutsche Bank cut it to a 'sell', saying a recovery in Spanish advertising looks to be over. Formal Brexit negotiations got under way on Monday with Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, though this did not ruffle market sentiment in the short-term.

Such risk was heightening the sensitivity of the banks' credit profiles to an adverse shock, according to the ratings agency.  While Moody's does not anticipate a sharp housing downturn as a core scenario, the tail risk represented by increased household sector indebtedness becomes a material consideration in the context of the very high ratings assigned to Australian banks,   it said. Moody's said the long-term credit ratings for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank an Westpac Banking Corp were downgraded to Aa3 from Aa2. It reaffirmed their short-term ratings. The Australian government has taken steps in recent months to cool the red-hot property market amid concerns that speculation in housing could ultimately hurt consumers, banks and the economy. House prices in Sydney and Melbourne have more than doubled since 2009. With cash interest rates at a record low and house prices near record highs, the nation's household debt-to-income ratio has climbed to an all-time peak of 189 percent, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). That means there are an increasing number of people who have little cash for discretionary spending – on everything from cars to electrical appliances and new clothes - as their pay packets get consumed by large mortgages and high rental payments.  The resilience of household balance sheets and consequently bank portfolios to a serious economic downturn has not been tested at these levels of private sector indebtedness,  Moody's said.

JLR, which employs more than 40,000 people globally, said it would hire 1,000 electronic and software engineers as well as 4,000 additional personnel including in manufacturing, most of whom will be based in Britain.  The recruitment process will take place over the next 12 months, during Britain's talks to leave the European Union, which carmakers have warned must result in a deal which retains free and unfettered trade to protect jobs.  May lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 general election that her Conservatives fought on the promise of a clean break with the EU single market and customs union.  The renewed political uncertainty has seen business confidence tumble in recent days, according to surveys and business groups.  FILE PHOTO: A worker on the assembly line at the Jaguar Land Rover facility in Solihull, Britain, January 30, 2017.Darren Staples/File PhotoHours before the talks were due to begin in Brussels, the heads of the UK's biggest business lobbies called on the government to engage  continuously  with UK business interests and strike a deal that preserves the benefits of EU membership including tariff-free trade, guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and minimal customs formalities.  Finance minister Philip Hammond said leaving the EU without an agreement would be a  very, very bad outcome for Britain  and he wanted an exit that would support employment and investment. Signs are seen outside the Jaguar Land Rover plant at Halewood in Liverpool, northern England, September 12 , 2016.Phil Noble When I talk about a Brexit that supports British jobs, British investment and British business I mean a Brexit that avoids those cliff edges,  Hammond said in an interview with BBC television on Sunday.  JLR, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, will build its first electric vehicle, the I-PACE, in Austria but has said it wants to build such models in Britain if conditions such as support from government and academia are met.  Automakers are racing to produce greener cars and improve charge times in a bid to meet rising customer demand and fulfil air quality targets but Britain lacks sufficient manufacturing capacity, an area ministers have said they want to build up. JLR, which builds just under a third of Britain's 1.7 million cars, has said half of all its new models will be available in an electric version by the end of the decade, requiring new skills among its staff.

Two sources familiar with the matter said Nomura (8604.T) plans to add a dozen senior- and mid-level investment bankers over the next 12 to 18 months in the United States, covering mergers and acquisitions, equity capital markets and leveraged financing - building out a team of around 200 there. Nomura has poached investment bankers from global investment banks as well as boutiques such as Jefferies and Houlihan Lokey since the beginning of this year. It has hired Jim Voorheis from UBS (UBSG.S), where he was head of specialty finance in the Americas, as managing director for its financial institutions group, and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) veteran Thomas Chung as managing director for U.S. equity capital markets. The number of hires could eventually be much higher, one of the sources said, depending on deals momentum and the outlook for the profitability of Nomura's international operations. The sources, who have direct knowledge of Nomura plans, did not want to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. They said Nomura has made a U.S. expansion of its wholesale business, which includes global markets and investment banking,  one of its priorities. This comes after a major restructuring – including a big shrinking of its operations in Europe last year - following its disastrous acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Asian and European businesses in 2008. That led to internal clashes, and was followed by six consecutive years of losses for its international operations.  As a result previous plans to expand in the U.S. were put on hold and Nomura reduced its total staff across all divisions in the Americas to 2,279 at the end of 2016 from 2,501 a year earlier. The number had crept back up to 2,314 by the end of March.  Strong Candidate  In March, it named company veteran Kentaro Okuda, head of investment banking and a contender to become Nomura’s future chief executive, as head of its Americas arm.  He knows all of our clients from Japan and he can look after their deals,  said one of the sources.  If Okuda does well in the U.S., he might emerge as a strong candidate to become group CEO.   Two of the sources said Nomura plans to bolster its coverage of the technology, financial and healthcare sectors in the U.S. where it sees growing dealmaking opportunities within the country and outside. It expects to benefit from American companies doing deals in Japan, a market where it has strong presence and contacts in the local corporate sectors, they said, and even China - where it has been increasing its presence.  Nomura currently only has about 0.5 percent of the U.S. investment banking fee pool. Even getting this up a little can make a meaningful difference given its size – the fees were worth an estimated $39.6 billion last year, one of the sources said. In response to Reuters queries, Nomura said that it sees its Americas business as a key element of its international strategy and it would continue to make  strategic additions  in areas, including sales and trading, and financing.  Nomura is ... well-positioned to connect markets east and west. Part of our continued strategy is to capture more cross-border client transactions,  it said, without giving details on expansion plans. In part, the U.S. push is a response to concerns at home. Once a go-to bank for the Japanese firms and top of the Japanese M&A; league table for years, Nomura took the number 6 rank in the home league table last year, down from second position in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the first quarter of this year, the bank slipped to 11th position, lagging behind Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and even smaller domestic rival Daiwa Securities (8601.T). In the overall investment banking fee league table, Nomura's share of the revenue in Japan has dropped to 14 percent last year from 18 percent in 2008, the data shows.

Automakers such as Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Nissan Motor Co are increasingly looking beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry that is moving into electric and self-driving cars. Smaller players are doing the same, but automakers like Subaru with limited research and development resources than their bigger rivals are showing caution in committing to advanced technologies on their own. At a recent demonstration of its driving assist system  Eyesight , Subaru said its goals for autonomous driving were modest versus bigger rivals, some of which aim for self-driving cars on city streets by 2025.  We're looking at how to develop (more advanced)capabilities, but we believe such functions will remain beyond the reach of Subaru customers,  Tetsuo Onuki, chief general manager at Subaru's technical research centre, said last week in comments for publication on Monday.  We're not aiming to develop driverless cars. What we're trying to do is make driving safer for people.  Subaru's new automated cruise control system can track cars travelling in front at low speeds, building on a similar feature marketed by bigger rival Nissan last year. The automaker has said it will continue to develop automated functions on its own, tapping outside technology as needed. It has plans to start developing an all-battery electric car this year, but it will use technology developed by Toyota Motor in a plug-in hybrid model planned for release in 2018.  The risk Subaru runs with tempering their ambitions is that, if the market wants (more sophisticated technologies) ... and they don't make it on their own, they'll have to buy it off the shelf from a supplier,  CLSA analyst Chris Richter said. He added that an increased dependence on suppliers would leave Subaru with less control over developing new technologies. Other smaller Japanese automakers have also acknowledged the challenges of competing with bigger rivals on advanced technologies given their relatively limited budgets. Mazda Motor Corp has yet to announce plans to develop self-driving cars, while it will draw on its partnership with Toyota to develop electric cars. Mitsubishi Motors Corp has said its takeover by Nissan last year had given it access to Nissan's automated driving technology, something it had lacked the resources to pursue on its own.

The issue ratings on Namibia's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BBB-'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs have been affirmed at 'F3'. Fitch has also affirmed Namibia's National Long-Term Rating on the South African scale at 'AAA(zaf)' with a Negative Outlook. The issue ratings on Namibia's bonds with a National rating have been affirmed at 'AAA(zaf)'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB-' rating reflects Namibia's strong growth potential and record of political stability, balanced by high fiscal and external deficits. The Negative Outlook reflects uncertainties about the growth outlook and the ability of the government to reverse the rise in debt. The Namibian authorities have committed to a significant front-loaded adjustment that will likely narrow the fiscal deficit in the coming two years. Fitch forecasts the gross general government deficit to narrow to 4.2% of GDP in FY17 and 3.1% in FY18, against the government targets of 3.6% and 2.5%. High public expenditure growth coupled with underperforming revenues from Namibia's Southern African Customs Union (SACU) proceeds and from the domestic mining sector, pushed the deficit to 8.5% of GDP in FY15 (ending March 2016). The deficit fell to 6.3% of GDP according to official estimates in FY16, much higher than the initial budget target of 4.3%, but a substantial achievement against the backdrop of stagnant GDP growth. According to the 2017/18 Budget Statement, fiscal consolidation this year will be achieved primarily through expenditure cuts across goods and services and capital spending. Fitch forecasts general government expenditures to fall by to 2% of GDP. The government's fiscal tightening will be aided by an expected one-off increase in SACU revenues in FY17. Namibia's large deficits in recent years have substantially increased the public debt burden, to 42% at end-2016 from 26% at end-FY12, against a 'BBB' median of 41% of GDP. Fitch believes that debt levels have likely plateaued. In 2016, the Namibian economy experienced consecutive quarters of negative growth for the first time since 2009 and, at 0.2% for the full year only narrowly avoided a contraction. Fitch forecasts a recovery in growth in 2017, to 2.0%, notwithstanding slow growth in neighbouring South Africa. Over the medium term, we expect growth to return to around 5% or higher, similar to the 2010-2015 levels. The recovery will be supported by an end to drought conditions and associated increase in agricultural output, as well as an expected increase in uranium and gold mining. However, tight fiscal policy and low global commodity prices have put downward pressure on growth and will continue to present downside risks. CPI inflation peaked at 8.2% in January 2017, as two years of drought conditions contributed to rising food prices. With food and fuel inflation declining, Fitch forecasts inflation to drop to 6% by end-2017. We expect the Bank of Namibia to hold the policy rate at its current level through the year to support the currency peg to the South African rand. Better performance in the mining sector will narrow the current account deficit to 8.3% of GDP, from 10.5% in 2016, but the external deficit remains a weakness to the sovereign ratings. By comparison, the 'BBB' current account median is a deficit of 1.8% of GDP. Namibia's current account deficit has steadily increased since first going into deficit in 2008, eroding Namibia's external creditor position. Fitch forecasts Namibia to become a net external debtor by end-2017. External vulnerability is somewhat mitigated by the structure of external debt; much of the debt is intercompany, with parent companies funding Namibian mining operations. At just above three months of current external payments, foreign reserves are low compared with the 'BBB' median of six months. Slowing private sector credit growth signals that the Namibian banking sector is adjusting after rapidly increasing housing prices fuelled an expansion in credit. The central bank imposed measures aimed at reducing risks from mortgages and other retail lending, including a maximum loan/value ratio of 80% on second homes and a 90% loan/value ratio on auto loans. Non-performing loans stood at 1.6% of total loans as of end-2016. Namibian banks are generally well-capitalised and have a return on equity of around 20%. Namibia's ratings are supported by a track record of political stability and governance indicators that are slightly higher than peers. Government plans to implement the New Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework, which would seek to increase the economic participation and ownership levels of racially disadvantaged persons, represent a modest risk to Namibia's business and investment climate. The draft law has been published for consultation, but uncertainties remain about what will ultimately be approved as legislation. Fitch analysis assumes policies to address inequality will be formulated in a way that avoids deterring foreign investors on a large scale. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Namibia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BB+' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: Macro: +1 notch, to reflect the medium-term growth potential and credible macroeconomic policies, including substantial fiscal tightening despite much lower than expected growth. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that could result in a downgrade include: - A failure to narrow the fiscal deficit sufficient to put the government debt/GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. - Failure to narrow the current account deficit or significant drawdown in international reserves. - Weaker than expected economic growth, for example, due to a worsening of the business environment. Future developments that could result in the Outlook being revised to Stable include: - A narrowing of the budget deficit consistent with a downward trajectory of the government debt/GDP ratio. -A marked improvement in the current account balance and increase in foreign exchange reserves. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Global assumptions are consistent with Fitch's 'Global Economic Outlook,' including a subdued outlook for commodity prices.

South African business confidence fell in the second quarter to a level not seen since the 2009 recession, a survey showed last week, as concerns over politics weighed.  Reduced business confidence implies reduced investment, which would negatively affect growth in South Africa’s already-weak economy, and will ultimately make fiscal consolidation more challenging,  Moody's senior analyst Zuzana Brixiova said in a research note.  Without improved trust in policymaking, it is likely that South Africa will remain in a low-growth trap,  Brixiova said. South Africa entered recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, data showed on June 6, putting pressure on the government just as it must cope with credit downgrades. Moody's lowered South Africa's rating to the bottom of the investment grade table with a negative outlook on June 9, citing a recent abrupt cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects for the economy. S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch rate South Africa as  junk .

Czech stocks gained around 1 percent putting the PX index   just above the psychological level of 1,000 points.       Komercni Banka shares led the rise, gaining 1.9 percent, and rebounding after hitting their lowest since February last week after the central bank put higher capital requirements on banks.     Hungarian stocks also jumped 1 percent, with OTP shares gaining 1.3 percent by 0838 GMT and oil and gas group MOL shares also rising as much as 1.6 percent.      These gains in stocks are partly due to Macron's win ...sentiment is positive as Asian stock markets also look good,  Zoltan Varga, an analyst at brokerage Equilor said.     He said shares of drug firm Richter also had room to rise further towards 7,600 forints per share from 7,241 forints on Monday, after it rose to historic highs last week.     Central European bourses have soared to new highs this year helped by a strong performance of the region's economies, and good prospects for this year and next.     Riding the positive sentiment, Hungarian road transport firm Waberer's International launched an initial public offering (IPO) in Budapest on Monday, in which it plans to raise about 45 million euros in capital to help finance its purchase of Polish peer Link.     Polish stocks also gained 1.1 percent in early trade.     Meanwhile, currencies across the region were little changed.     The Serbian dinar, which hit 17-month highs against the euro last week, gained a further 0.15 percent on Monday.     The dinar is mainly helped by fiscal reforms and to some extent also the nomination of a new prime minister Ana Brnabic, who is seen as business-friendly.     A dealer with a Belgrade-based bank said the dinar  was bolstered by seasonal demand, lending in dinars, more euros from Serbs working abroad and because overall good state fiscal performance.       The fundamental support to the dinar is the fiscal reforms which secured a budget surplus worth 1.2 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2017 instead of a deficit agreed with the International Monetary Fund.

Firm price gains highlight the challenge Chinese authorities face in calming a frothy market without disrupting the economy, in which real estate is a major driver of growth.    Economists say the pace of price growth across different market tiers clearly shows a passing of the baton from the centre to the regions. They also fret over still-rising prices against an already high base, saying upward price pressure remains.  While a moderation in price growth in first- and second-tier cities shows the curbs had some effects, we must note that prices are still rising with new unit prices at record high levels,  said Sam Xie, head of research at property services provider CBRE China.     We expect more cities to impose curbs in the future.  Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.7 percent in May from the previous month, in line with April and remaining the quickest gain since October, Reuters calculated from an official survey out on Monday. Compared with a year ago, new home prices rose 10.4 percent in May, easing from a 10.7 percent gain in April, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. Policymakers have prioritised stabilising an overheated market ahead of a Communist Party reshuffle later this year, reiterating the need to avoid dramatic price volatility that could threaten the financial system and harm social stability.  The housing bureau in Guangdong province's Qingyuan city  said last week prices for pre-sold new units must be sold at no more than 5 percent higher or no more than 15 percent lower than in similar projects in the area in the past month, effectively setting a price cap and floor to stabilise the market.   The NBS said price growth for new homes in China's 15 most overheated cities - mainly provincial capitals with the most stringent curbs - has remained  basically stable  from the previous month as city-based control measures continued to take effect. Prices for new homes in China's biggest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai stopped climbing in May on a monthly basis, while prices fell 0.6 percent in Shenzhen, the fastest seen in three months.  Compared to a year ago, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen prices still grew 13.5 percent, 11 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.  The actions of authorities, who also stressed the need to actively push for inventory destocking in smaller cities experiencing a housing glut, have spread investor activity more broadly rather than halting it outright.  Investors, banned from the hottest markets, are increasingly looking inland, driving up prices in more remote, smaller cities with fewer buying restrictions, leading to a surprise pick-up in May sales.   For example, Bengbu, a mid-sized city in central China's  Anhui province, topped the list in May, with prices of new units rising 3.4 percent on-month, compared to a 2.2 percent gain in April.   Price growth in smaller third-tier cities rose to 0.9 percent in May from April's 0.8 percent, CBRE's Xie said. The Statistics Bureau does not release price index data by market tiers. Central bank data published last Wednesday showed Chinese banks extended more credit than expected in May, with home loans expanding even as policymakers struggled to rein in riskier borrowing without impeding economic growth. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 610.6 billion yuan in May from 571 billion yuan in April, accounting for 55 percent of total new loans last month, up from 52 percent in April, the data showed. But analysts say new tightening measures introduced since mid-March have started taking some heat out of the market, and property investment is likely to have peaked following a sharp drop in sales because of such curbs. Indeed, annual growth in China's real estate investment slowed in May, the first fall-off in three months, taking a toll on new developments. New construction starts almost halved from the previous month, official data showed last Wednesday.

The latest steps are an extension of curbs announced in November 2016, when the government started turning the screws on speculative housing investments amid concerns a worrying build-up in household debt could leave the economy exposed to a crash.  Effective July 3, the government will tighten loan limits for home buyers to 60 percent of a property's value from the current 70 percent in regions showing signs of overheating including Seoul, the finance ministry and financial regulator said in a statement. Debt repayments will be limited to 50 percent of home buyers' annual income in those selected regions, down from the current 60 percent, it said. The government will also restrict the resale of newly built apartments in Seoul and some parts of Busan until registration of property ownership is complete, to cool speculation in those regions, it said. Analysts expect the fresh curbs - the tightest restrictions since August 2014 - to have only a moderate impact on the overall housing market.  This is not a nation-wide measure, so it will pause some buying frenzy in some regions rather than cooling the overall housing market sentiment,  Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities said.  Indeed, rather than nationwide measures, the government is trying a targeted approach aimed at cities with the most heated property prices to reduce the impact on the construction sector, which grew almost five times faster than the gross domestic product in the first quarter.  As for the economy, looks like the construction sector will continue to drive growth albeit at a slower pace,  Kim said, adding the broad economic recovery underway is unlikely to be dented by the housing restrictions.  South Korea property stocks hardly moved as Monday's measures were in line with market expectations.  In a briefing, vice finance minister Ko Hyoung-kwon warned of more curbs if overheating continues in the targeted regions.  If we see and confirm overheating widening, we will be firm in adopting more measures, including designating some regions as 'overheated speculation zone,'  Ko said.  The central bank’s eight rate cuts since 2012 helped send  home prices and household debt to record levels. The average price of a Seoul apartment in March exceeded 600 million won ($529,918.30) for the first time, an increase of more than 20 percent from four years earlier.  Despite a steady rise in mortgage rates, apartment prices in Seoul were up 0.3 percent in the week of June 12 from a week earlier, the fastest clip since 2009, according to Kookmin Bank data. The average mortgage rate was at 3.21 percent in April, the highest in about 2 years and up from 3.13 percent as of December 2016, Bank of Korea data shows.   Curbing the property market speculation would limit  overall household debt growth,  Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment said. At 92.8 percent of the GDP, South Korea’s household debt even exceeds that of the U.S. and Japan, Bank for International Settlement data shows.   ($1 = 1,132.2500 won) Reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Kim Coghill & Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-economy-housing-idUSKBN19A0P0"},

Thirteen smelters with a combined capacity of 750,000 tonnes of nickel pig iron a year  were forced to cease operation  because nickel prices reached as low as around $8,000 a tonne, Jonatan Handojo, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Smelter Association told Reuters, declining to name the owners of the smelters. Three-month nickel touched a one-year low of $8,680 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange last week and is down more than 10 percent so far this year. The metal was trading at $8,975 per tonne on Monday at 0800 GMT. There are 12 other nickel smelters in Indonesia which have been able to carry on producing, but they have suffered from losses, Handojo added. Indonesia enacted a policy in 2014 restricting nickel ore exports that fostered the construction of new smelters. That year, nickel prices hit a record $21,625 a tonne. The country reversed those rules earlier this year, allowing the export of nickel ore and bauxite under certain conditions. Indonesian state-controlled miner Aneka Tambang resumed nickel ore exports last month. Refined nickel prices have been pressured by expectations of more nickel ore supply from the Philippines and Indonesia. Nickel ore output in the Philippines, the world's top supplier, fell 51 percent in the first quarter due to rains and the suspension of mine operations by former environment minister Regina Lopez. But Lopez was ousted in May by a panel of lawmakers and President Rodrige Duterte's choice for her replacement was one welcomed by miners. The country's finance minister Carlos Dominguez has promised investors there would be no more arbitrary suspensions of mining operations.

The officers from the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) joined the Japanese ship in Singapore on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said in an outline of the plan. Other ASEAN military representatives will attend a separate three-day event from Tuesday in Japan, to observe Self Defense Forces (SDF) military disaster relief drills, the ministry said.  It is the first time we have done this,  a ministry official said at a press briefing in Tokyo. The events show a hitherto unseen degree of coordination between Japan's military services and civilian defense officials to bolster foreign ties.  It also marks a concerted push into military diplomacy by Japan's hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe.  Japan is worried that China is cementing its control in the South China Sea with the construction of island bases, arms sales and development aid. Some $5 trillion of ship-borne trade passes through the strategic waterway each year, much of it sailing to and from Japanese ports.  As Japan looks for a greater regional security role as part of its alliance with the United States, Abe's administration believes Japan is better placed than the United States to woo Southeast Asian nations away from Chinese influence. Japan can help bolster countries' capabilities in disaster relief and is able to emphasize its status as a fellow Asian nation, two Japanese government officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media. A 2014 military coup in Thailand means that the U.S. government has limited engagement with the regime there, while U.S. relations with the Philippines have been strained since President Rodrigo Duterte took office last year, seeking to reduce what he sees as dependence on the United States. Another plank of Japan's emerging military diplomacy is military-industrial cooperation. Abe in 2014 ended a decades old weapons export ban, allowing Japan to offer arms technology as a lure for closer military ties. Japan last week held a military technology seminar with representatives of Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

The potential of the 2017 U.S. corn crop has come into question with less-than-ideal condition ratings and marginal weather forecasts, and no one wants to be last out the door in case corn yields go bust.     Money managers slashed their net corn short in the week ended June 13 to just 17,929 futures and options contracts, representing a dump of 120,829 on the week (reut.rs/2saSk3g).  Last week also marked the second-ever biggest round of short-covering in the corn market. Funds bought back 109,295 short positions, slightly missing the June 30, 2015 record of 119,265 contracts. Funds had also considerably cut their net short position in the week ended June 6 - though not to the extent of last week - but that move was just as much the result of new longs in the market as it was short-covering. Through June 13, funds only extended their outright longs by 5 percent while slashing their shorts by 29 percent. Although the data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that money managers are still net short the yellow grain through June 13, they are presumably long heading into the week of June 19. Corn futures rallied again late last week, which had funds buying up even more contracts. Wheat on the Rise It is likely that speculators are also much less bearish on Chicago wheat in real-time than what is reflected in the latest Commitment of Traders report based on last week’s futures rally. Still, pessimism proved lighter in the week ended June 13. Hedge funds cut their Chicago wheat net short to 82,859 futures and options contracts, which represents the least bearish view on soft red winter wheat since early March. This compares with 106,136 contracts in the week before, and the new stance is only half has large as the recent max short of 162,327 contracts in the week ended April 25 (reut.rs/2sClTwa). The K.C. wheat bulls were out in force last week as funds extended their net long to 23,888 futures and options contracts. The move from last week’s 2,394-contract long marks the largest-ever weekly extension in either direction on the hard red winter wheat spec stance (reut.rs/2rFrywg). U.S. hard red spring wheat conditions were slashed to just 45 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition as of June 11 and the wheat market is now garnering evidence that the crop is not going to be great. But funds modestly extended their net long to 11,780 futures and options contracts from 9,486 the week before (reut.rs/2rFwYaG). This is not even the most bullish that speculators have been this year on Minneapolis wheat, as the net long position exceeded 12,000 contracts for six straight weeks from Jan. 11 through Feb. 21, which topped out at 16,717 contracts in the week ended Jan. 24. Bears Still Rule the Soy Complex Funds bought back positions across the CBOT soy complex in the week ended June 13, lifting the combined bets off of the previous week’s all-time bearish stance (reut.rs/2saVdkD). Short-covering was the theme in oilseeds as soybean futures rose from June 6 through the end of the week over U.S. crop weather concerns, though to a lesser degree percentage-wise than the grains. Funds cut their net soybean short to 79,673 futures and options contracts from 94,737 in the prior week, which had been their second all-time bearish view on the oilseed. Money managers were also covering shorts in soybean oil, chopping their short position to just 16,840 futures and options contracts from 34,301 in the week prior. Soybean meal bets moved the least last week as funds reduced their net short to 44,746 contracts from the previous week’s 50,941 contracts, which was an all-time spec short. Since June 13, trade sources indicate that commodity funds had been net buyers of both soybeans and soybean oil, but net sellers of soybean meal.

FGV, the world's third-largest palm plantation group, has plunged into turmoil after Chairman Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad asked Chief Executive Zakaria Arshad to quit. Zakaria refused to leave but he and three other executives were later suspended by FGV's board as it investigates transactions at its Delima Oil Products subsidiary. The crisis at FGV - whose biggest shareholder is the state-owned Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) - could hurt Prime Minister Najib Razak, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. FGV's shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states and some smallholder groups have expressed concerns about the management battle and called for the chairman to step down. CEO Zakaria has denied wrongdoing and also called on the country's anti-graft body to conduct its own investigation into FGV. In addition to FGV's own internal probe and the investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), the government has also appointed a former cabinet minister to look into the suspensions. The Prime Minister's office said that based on the former cabinet minister's findings, it had decided to transfer Isa to a government agency. He will be replaced by Sulaiman Mahbob, who will be acting chairman effective immediately. Sulaiman has previously served on the boards of state energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad [PETR.UL] and Felda. The statement from the prime minister's office also said the decline in the financial performance of FGV and Felda warranted a comprehensive business review and noted that a review had started late last year. Shares of FGV were last up 3.4 percent at 1.82 ringgit per share on Monday.     Reporting by Emily Chow, A.

During a tense standoff with officers, two of whom had weapons drawn, the woman told police they were  devils and also members of the KKK,  a reference to the white-supremacy group, the police report said of the earlier incident. An officer was able to convince the woman to drop the scissors and she was arrested. The report also said family members told police Lyles was experiencing a sudden decline in her mental health condition and had not behaved similarly in the past. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a e-mail asking whether the officers on June 5 were the same officers who shot Lyles on Sunday, or whether the officers had received training on how to properly handle a mental health or domestic crisis.  The police statement said two officers were required to respond because of  information pertaining to this address that presented an increased risk to officers . Both officers will be placed on paid administrative leave as the department investigates the shooting, police said. The Seattle Police Department has been implementing court-ordered reforms since 2012 to address what a U.S. Justice Department investigation found to be a pattern of excessive force by officers that often arose during encounters with the mentally ill or drug-addled suspects.  Federal investigators also found evidence of biased policing. Several mourners gathered outside the apartment complex early on Sunday evening for a vigil and memorial for Lyles, according to photos posted online by local media.  Photos of Lyles and her children were posted on black plastic chairs and people brought placards that read Black Lives Matter, a movement that grew out of protests against the police killings of unarmed black men in a number of cities across the United States.

Does BHP want to be a cutting edge mining company always on the prowl for the next big opportunity, or does it want to be a cautious, dividend-focused cash generator, something akin to being the telecoms utility of the mining world? If there is anything that can be learned from the performance of BHP, and indeed most of its global mining rivals, in the past decade, it's that escaping the ups and downs of the commodity cycle is extremely difficult for a miner. BHP's Australia-listed shares ended at A$22.99 ($17.51) on June 16, down 8.3 percent since the end of last year, but still above the closing low of A$14.20 on Jan. 21, 2016. On that view BHP's share price performance doesn't actually look that bad, with the stock gaining rapidly from the January low last year on the back of sharp gains in the price of its main profit earner, iron ore, as well as other commodities, especially coal. But over the longer term, BHP's performance becomes much less impressive. The stock dropped to just above A$19 in November of 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis. Buying BHP at that point would have been a good investment as the shares took off as China poured massive amounts of money into resource-heavy infrastructure projects in order to stimulate growth after the global downturn. BHP rode the wave to a peak of A$44.89 on April 11, 2011, but after that it was all downhill until the low of January 2016, as iron ore and coal notched up five consecutive losing years. Bhp's Role in Its Own Downturn It would be a simple argument to say that BHP merely tracked the decline in commodity prices, but that ignores the company's own complicity in causing prices to slide. In common with its peers, BHP decided to use the cash generated from the sharp rise in commodity prices on the back of Chinese stimulus to dramatically boost production, particularly in iron ore. As soon as one major producer decided that the China story was a never-ending gift to miners, basically they all had to follow or stand to lose market share. The management and board of BHP at the time made the mistake of believing the optimistic view of forecast Chinese steel output, while ignoring the historic fact that virtually every commodity boom is ended by too much supply being built. The company was perhaps too loose with its cash. With the benefit of hindsight it overpaid for its U.S. shale assets and it frittered money away on failed attempts to take over a Canadian potash producer. It took a few years to realize the errors, and BHP dramatically shifted course when appointing Andrew Mackenzie as chief executive in May 2013, with his razor-like focus on driving down costs and pulling back from the deal-making beloved by his predecessor Marius Kloppers. BHP today still appears to be running very much along the lines Andrew Mackenzie set, namely a strong focus on cost-control and boosting efficiencies in order to generate strong cash flow. The problem is some investors want more, with activist shareholder group Elliott Management pushing for BHP to exit its U.S. petroleum business and focus more on giving returns to shareholders. The appointment of former packaging executive Ken MacKenzie as chairman can be chalked up as a victory for Elliot, given the hedge fund's demand for board renewal and new thinking. But how much should MacKenzie listen to shareholders such as Elliott, given they are most likely focused on maximizing returns on a fairly short-term basis, as opposed to longer-term investors such as pension funds that make up the bulk of BHP's shareholders. It's here where MacKenzie has to look at what kind of company BHP wants to be. If he chooses the Andrew Mackenzie model of trying to be the best at digging up and shipping various minerals, then BHP should focus on returning as much money as possible to shareholders as dividends, while making it explicit that those returns will be linked to the vagaries of commodity prices. On the other hand, BHP can try to run as leanly as possible while still aggressively seeking expansion opportunities using the cash generated from its existing operations. That sounds like the best path, but the problem is it seems that virtually every major mining company struggles to simultaneously be both a cutting-edge, growth-focused innovator and a cost-driven dividend play.

A southern Italian court ordered the man's arrest for conspiracy to commit international terrorism and inciting others to break the law, they said in a statement. The man sought to convince other asylum seekers living in a state-funded shelter in the southern city of Crotone to  perpetrate acts of violence with terrorist objectives , the police said.  The Iraqi - considered violent and inclined toward criminal activity - had celebrated after the recent terrorist attack in Manchester,  they said, referring to a suicide bombing last month at a pop concert in the northern English city that killed 22 people. In a recorded telephone conversation between the arrested man and his sister, he said he had been called to join the  holy war  in his country, but had decided instead to stay in Italy to  redeem the infidels  who  should have their throats cut . Police gave no further details and said they would elaborate on the case later in the day. The case will fuel Italy's increasingly bitter political debate over citizenship laws and the management of boat migrant arrivals ahead of a national election expected in the first half of next year.   Over the weekend, some 1,500 migrants were pulled from unsafe and overcrowded boats off the coast of Libya and are now being brought to Italy by rescue ships. Italy is on the frontline of Europe's migration crisis, especially after an agreement between the European Union and Turkey last year that virtually stopped boat crossings to Greece.   Half a million people, many of them Muslims from North Africa and the Middle East, have come to Europe via Italy in the past three years, and boat arrivals are up more than 17 percent in 2017 on the previous year. Almost 200,000 asylum seekers are living in Italian shelters as they wait to hear whether they qualify for international protection.

The IPO will be the biggest on the Budapest bourse in years and offers some hope for a possible revival of a market currently dominated by four blue-chip stocks. Waberer's is one of Europe's biggest haulage businesses with a fleet of more than 3,500 vehicles and a total revenue of 572.4 million euros in 2016. The company said on Monday that it would offer up to 11,735,085 shares beginning on Monday and ending on June 29. The offering is priced in a range from 5,100 to 6,300 forints per share. The price will be set on June 29. It will comprise up to 3,088,236 newly issued ordinary shares and also existing shares held by CEE Transport Holding BV. The offering will include a private placement to institutional investors and a public offering of up to 1,379,718 existing shares, up to 297,175 over-allotment shares and up to 617,647 new shares in Hungary. Assuming all the offered shares are sold at the mid-point of the offer price range, the total net proceeds are expected to amount to about 197 million euros, of which Waberer's will receive about 45 million, it said. The company said it would use around 32 million euros of the proceeds to help fund the acquisition of Polish peer Link, with the rest used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Waberer's signed a deal to buy Link in May. The company will hold a news conference at 1000 GMT. The company is indirectly controlled by funds advised by Mid Europa Partners, a financial investor. Shares held by those funds will be sold via CEE Transport Holding BV, Waberer's said.

After years of booming orders, driven by rising air travel and more fuel-efficient planes, passenger jetmakers are bracing for a slowdown in demand while they focus on meeting tight delivery schedules and ambitious production targets. But U.S. planemaker Boeing is expected to generate a fresh burst of activity at the world's biggest airshow by launching the 737 MAX 10 to plug a gap against European rival Airbus's A321neo. Industry sources say the 190-230 seat plane could attract in the region of 150 orders at the July 19-25 Paris event. Not to be outdone, Airbus is close to clinching a roughly $5 billion deal with low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru for about 30 planes, two industry sources said on Sunday. While demand for passenger jets may be faltering, there are signs interest in military aircraft is picking up after years in the doldrums due to budget cuts and weak economic growth. Lockheed Martin is in the final stages of negotiating a $37 billion-plus deal to sell 440 F-35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That would be the biggest deal yet for the stealthy warplane, set to make its Paris Airshow debut this week. In another boost for a defence project, French President Emmanuel Macron was due to fly into the show on an Airbus A400M military transporter in his first official engagement since winning a parliamentary majority in elections on Sunday. His arrival is expected to be followed by a flypast by the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and France's aerial display team. The ceremony will lend high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by problems in recent years: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. Airbus said on Sunday it was working on an upgrade of the A380 - called A380plus - with fuel-saving wingtips, confirming plans reported by Reuters in March. Boeing, however, is expected to say at the Paris show that demand for mammoth planes such as the A380 and its own 747 is moribund.

Abadi had been due to visit Riyadh last week but postponed his trip to avoid appearing to take sides in a diplomatic dispute that erupted between Qatar and several other Arab states including Saudi Arabia, officials have said. Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies, which accuse Doha of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and cozying up to their enemy Iran. Qatar denies the charges. Abadi's meeting with King Salman of Saudi Arabia will be their second meeting this year as the neighbors try to heal a rift over Iraq's alliance with Shi'ite Iran.

The reassurance from top air force general Andre Lanata offers some respite to manufacturer Airbus after months of renewed debate over the delayed plane. The A400M - ordered by Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - has been hit by engine gearbox problems and delays in fitting parachuting capacity and advanced defenses. Related CoverageGE says planemakers calling for more CFM enginesA confidential report by the German defense ministry  warned recently that such problems as well as contract disputes could impair the full operational use of the transporter. But speaking to journalists to mark the start of the June 19-25 air show at Le Bourget, near Paris, Lanata said he believed Airbus was getting to grips with the problems.  I believe that all that is now mainly behind us,  he told the AJPAE media association. Earlier this year, Airbus took a new writedown of 1.2 billion euros against losses on the A400M, and urged the seven NATO buyers to limit its exposure to heavy fines and payment delays caused by new technical snags and delays. France currently has 11 A400M planes, of which six are fully operational - a tally which Lanata called  very satisfactory , even though not all of them yet have the specifications originally envisaged in Europe's largest defense contract. The French army is due to get another 15 A400M planes by 2019, and French President Emmanuel Macron was due to arrive at the Paris Airshow on Monday on board an A400M in a further show of support for the model. Lanata said that while there were technical issues that needed to be resolved, France remained fully behind the A400M.  It is very important that optimism and support shown by France is not hampered by any industrial problems, given how tough the Germans have been on this matter,  added another French army official, asking not to be named.

Banks are unlikely to face significantly higher currency-related risks from greater exchange-rate volatility as their foreign-currency (FC) exposure is minimal in their domestic activities, FC lending is almost entirely trade related, FC deposits are rare and use of international capital markets is minimal. Net open FC positions are small and typically amount to less than 5% of equity. The liberalisation of the dirham is likely to have a limited impact on macroeconomic stability in the short and medium term. Fitch expects the new exchange-rate regime to be phased in gradually, leading to little increase in the volatility of the dirham against the currency basket currently anchoring the peg. The risks of a sharp adjustment of the dirham are low as the exchange rate is consistent with fundamentals, according to the IMF's latest assessment. Public finances and market access should not be significantly affected as public debt is mostly denominated in dirhams and held domestically. Morocco's reserves and the IMF's precautionary and liquidity line would provide an important buffer in case of external stress, which is not Fitch's base case. Small- and medium-sized Moroccan importers would be most affected in the event of any weakening of the dirham, given their limited access to currency hedging tools. However, these companies' forward purchase orders tend to be short-term, so they should soon be able to pass the rising import costs to their customers. We do not expect a surge in impairments in the largest banks' SME loan portfolios triggered by exchange-rate movements. Larger Moroccan corporates already actively use currency derivatives and banks do not expect these borrowers to have problems servicing their FC loans once the currency regime changes. Banks that are active in currency trading or able to offer hedging instruments to their customers may benefit from opportunities brought about by greater exchange-rate volatility. These include Attijariwafa Bank, one of the largest banks with the most developed corporate and investment banking franchise, and the subsidiaries of leading French banks, which can tap into their parents' derivative expertise. Demand for derivatives is likely to increase among SME borrowers, boosting business volumes for banks in a position to offer such products. The dirham is currently tied to a basket of currencies comprising the euro (60%) and US dollar (40%). The Moroccan central bank can intervene to limit fluctuations and restricts bid-offer spreads to 0.6%, meaning that all official dirham exchange transactions are settled within this tight band. Dirham volatility has been low in recent years. It is not clear how soon the new exchange regime will start. A June 2017 date, indicated by the authorities this year, now looks unlikely but we expect the reforms to begin in 2H17 with a long rollout period, which some banks expect could be as long as 15 years.

The parent company of China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS) (0670.HK) said in a statement it signed the deal for Eastern Air Logistics with the four companies, which also include Chinese express delivery firm Deppon Logistics and Greenland Financial, at a ceremony in Shanghai. The deal comes as China has prioritized implementing mixed ownership reforms to revamp the country's bloated and debt-ridden state sector. The reforms envision private capital investing in firms run directly by the central government. China Eastern Air Holding (CEA Holding) said it will retain a 45 percent stake in the cargo unit, while Legend Holdings, GLP, Deppon and Greenland Financial will hold 25 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent and 5 percent respectively. The remaining 10 percent will be held by Eastern Air Logistics' core employees.  Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, CEA Holdings said 4.1 billion yuan ($601.61 million) of state and non-state capital was invested in the freight unit, bringing its debt ratio down to 75 percent, from 87.86 percent at the end of 2016.  The deal aims to turn the company into a  world-class air logistics national team capable of competing with FedEx, UPS and DHL, and will pave the way for the reform of China's state-owned enterprises,  CEA Holding said in the statement.  Eastern Air Logistics will be involved in logistics real estate, cross-border e-commerce and express delivery through its new shareholders, it added.  China Eastern Airlines sold Eastern Air Logistics to its parent in February for 2.43 billion yuan ($356.57 million), saying the unit's shrinking market share and debts were crimping the airline's overall operating performance.

Frontline, which according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data holds a 10.3 percent stake in DHT and is controlled by shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, has been trying for the past year to take over its New York-listed rival. However, DHT struck a tankers-for-shares deal with BW Group in March, making the latter DHT's biggest shareholder with a stake of over 30 percent. On June 7 the same Marshall Islands court had rejected a preliminary injunction by Frontline in the same case.  Frontline is now precluded from bringing similar claims against DHT, its directors and BW Group in any other court,  DHT said in a statement.  Under Marshall Islands' law, the dismissal also constitutes a ruling on the merits in favor of DHT.  DHT's chairman Erik Lind said DHT  was very pleased with the dismissal .  We have consistently stated, both in court and to our shareholders, that Frontline's claims are without merit.

The parent company of China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS) (0670.HK) said in a statement it signed the deal for Eastern Air Logistics with the four companies, which also include Chinese express delivery firm Deppon Logistics and Greenland Financial, at a ceremony in Shanghai. The deal comes as China has prioritized implementing mixed ownership reforms to revamp the country's bloated and debt-ridden state sector. The reforms envision private capital investing in firms run directly by the central government. China Eastern Air Holding (CEA Holding) said it will retain a 45 percent stake in the cargo unit, while Legend Holdings, GLP, Deppon and Greenland Financial will hold 25 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent and 5 percent respectively. The remaining 10 percent will be held by Eastern Air Logistics' core employees.  Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, CEA Holdings said 4.1 billion yuan ($601.61 million) of state and non-state capital was invested in the freight unit, bringing its debt ratio down to 75 percent, from 87.86 percent at the end of 2016.  The deal aims to turn the company into a  world-class air logistics national team capable of competing with FedEx, UPS and DHL, and will pave the way for the reform of China's state-owned enterprises,  CEA Holding said in the statement.  Eastern Air Logistics will be involved in logistics real estate, cross-border e-commerce and express delivery through its new shareholders, it added.  China Eastern Airlines sold Eastern Air Logistics to its parent in February for 2.43 billion yuan ($356.57 million), saying the unit's shrinking market share and debts were crimping the airline's overall operating performance. Air China (0753.HK)(601111.SS) is also expected to introduce mixed-ownership reforms in its air freight logistics business after it gained approval from China's top state planner in April.

The EU, which seeks to promote free speech and end capital punishment around the world, was due to make its statement last week at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, but failed to win the necessary agreement from all 28 EU states. It marked the first time the EU had failed to make its statement at the U.N.'s top rights body, rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said.  A Greek foreign ministry official said Athens blocked the statement, calling it  unconstructive criticism of China  and said separate EU talks with China outside the U.N. were a better avenue for discussions.   Greece's position is that unproductive and in many cases, selective criticism against specific countries does not facilitate the promotion of human rights in these states, nor the development of their relation with the EU,  a Greek foreign ministry spokesperson said on Sunday. Presented three times a year, the statement gives the EU a way to highlight abuses by states around the world on issues that other countries are unwilling to raise. The impasse is the latest blow to the EU's credentials as a defender of human rights, three diplomats said, and raises questions about the economically powerful EU's  soft power  that relies on inspiring countries to follow its example by outlawing the death penalty and upholding press freedoms. It also underscores the EU's awkward ties with China, its second-largest trade partner, diplomats said. Brussels has welcomed Beijing as an ally against U.S. President Donald Trump in the fight against climate change and trade protectionism. But as business ties grow, the bloc is struggling to speak out against a Chinese government crackdown on human rights lawyers and other activists since 2015. China's COSCO Shipping, owner of the world's fourth-largest container fleet, took a 51 percent stake in Greece's largest port last year. Hungary, another large recipient of Chinese investment, has repeatedly blocked EU statements criticizing China's rights record under communist President Xi Jinping, diplomats said.

One EU diplomat expressed frustration that Greece's decision to block the statement came at the same time the International Monetary Fund and EU governments agreed to release funds under Greece's emergency financial bailout last week in Luxembourg.  It was dishonorable, to say the least,  the diplomat said.

Fed chief Janet Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy. There are signs, however, that the market does not believe Fed forecasts that show it will be able to continue raising rates later this year and any signs of doubt from other Fed officials speaking this week may hurt the dollar. The dollar was up just under 0.1 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength.  I think that the burden of proof for the dollar (to appreciate) is pretty high,  said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London.  Even if there isn't going to be any outright criticism of Yellen, if you don't think U.S. (10-year government bond) yields are going to be above 2.20 percent then it is tough to buy into it.  U.S. market interest rates point to a less than 40 percent chance of the Fed hiking rates by December and data on Friday showed investors had further reduced net bets on the dollar gaining ahead of last week's Fed meeting. Friday's Bank of Japan meeting, however, played down even the chance of it beginning to reduce emergency stimulus for the economy and the yen was again weak on Monday, down 0.2-0.3 percent against the dollar and euro. Against the dollar, the euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1185 after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday, taking little from French President Emmanuel Macron's landslide in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Polls had widely favoured Macron and interest in French politics has declined since the risk of a far-right president who might take the country out of the euro abated with his defeat of Marine Le Pen last month. Sterling was steady ahead of the formal start of negotiations on Britain's planned exit from the European Union, expected by many analysts to generate negative headlines for the currency in the weeks ahead.  While medium-term (sterling) appreciation is still likely, the tail risks of a no-deal or disorderly Brexit scenarios have increased, and should weigh on (the pound),  currency strategists from Barclays wrote in a note to clients. Prime Minister Theresa May is also still struggling to secure the support of Northern Ireland's DUP party she needs to proceed as a minority government after losing her majority 10 days ago.

Military leaders and officials in Iran, a predominantly Shi'ite country, often refer to Sunni Muslim radicals as Takfiris. The Revolutionary Guards are fighting in Syria against militant groups who oppose President Bashar al-Assad. The attack last week, which included shootings and at least one suicide bombing, was on Iran's parliament and the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.  The spilling of any pure blood will not go unanswered,  the Revolutionary Guards said in the statement quoted by Tasnim.  Islamic State issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Tehran attack.  Senior Iranian officials, however, have pointed a finger at Saudi Arabia, Iran's Sunni regional rival.

New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, is due to take part in a roundtable with local business leaders in Plattsburgh, New York.       If Dudley confirms that the Fed will remain hawkish towards interest rate hikes, I do not think gold will be able to recover anytime soon,  said Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau.      Spot gold        was down 0.3 percent to $1,249.61 per ounce, as of 0804 GMT. During the session, it hit $1,248.63, its lowest since May 24.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1,251 an ounce.     Although the Fed raised rates last week, weaker economic data has cast doubts over the central bank's ability to pursue an aggressive monetary policy for the rest of the year.                  U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to the lowest level in eight months as construction activity declined broadly, suggesting that housing could be a drag on economic growth in the second quarter.                  Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar, putting pressure on gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.      Spot gold is expected to drop to $1,243 per ounce, as suggested by its wave pattern and a Fibonacci projection analysis, according to Reuters technicals analyst, Wang Tao.                  Gold is likely to be tested on the downside for at least the first half of the week, Alex Thorndike, a trader at MKS PAMP Group, said in a note.           Hedge funds and money managers raised their net long position in COMEX gold for the third straight week to the highest in seven months in the week to June 6, and upped it slightly in silver, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.                  In wider markets, the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies on Monday, and Asian stocks rose, shaking off Wall Street's uninspiring performance on Friday.                  Among other metals, spot palladium        climbed 0.8 percent to $867.20, and platinum        slipped 0.5 percent to $921.95 per ounce.     Silver        edged 0.1 percent down to $16.57 per ounce.

It cited a slowing economy, rising inflation, political uncertainty following a snap general election and negotiations Britain now faces after its vote late June to leave the European Union. Global advertising expenditure is expected to grow by 4.2 percent in 2017, down from 4.8 percent in 2016. However, underlying growth will strengthen from 3.6 percent in 2016 to 5.4 percent in 2017 as year-ago results benefitted from non-annual events such the U.S. presidential elections, Rio Olympics and Euro Cup 2016, it said. The slowdown in Britain, a persistent outperformer in ad spending in Western Europe, will drag regional spending growth down to 2 percent in 2017 from 4.6 percent last year. WPP, world's largest advertising group, cut its 2017 sales forecasts in March and said clients were seeking to drive down costs. In other regions, economic recovery in Brazil and Argentina will help drive 4.1 percent growth in Latin America this year after a 0.2 percent contraction last year, it said. The United States, the world's largest economy, will be the leading contributor of new ad dollars to the global market over the next three years and China will rank second, it said.

Borrowing from nature, some machines now have arms that curl and grip like an octopus, others wriggle their way inside an airplane engine or forage underwater to create their own energy. This is technology that challenges how we think of, and interact with, the robots of the not-too-distant future. Robots are big business: by 2020, the industry will have more than doubled to $188 billion, predicts IDC, a consultancy. But there's still a lot that today's models can't do, partly because they are mostly made of rigid metal or plastic. Softer, lighter and less reliant on external power, future robots could interact more safely and predictably with humans, go where humans can't, and do some of the robotic jobs that other robots still can't manage. A recent academic conference in Singapore showcased the latest advances in soft robotics, highlighting how far they are moving away from what we see as traditional robots.   The theme here,  says Nikolaus Correll of Colorado University,  is a departure from gears, joints and links.  One robot on display was made of origami paper; another resembled a rolling colostomy bag. They are more likely to move via muscles that expand and contract through heat or hydraulics than by electricity. Some combine sensing and movement into the same component - just as our fingertips react to touch without needing our brain to make a decision. These ideas are already escaping from the lab. Small, Agile Rolls-Royce, for example, is testing a snake-like robot that can worm its way inside an aircraft engine mounted on the wing, saving the days it can take to remove the engine, inspect it and put it back. Of all the technologies Rolls-Royce is exploring to solve this bottleneck,  this is the killer one,  says Oliver Walker-Jones, head of communications. The snake, says its creator, Arnau Garriga Casanovas, is made largely of pressurized silicone chambers, allowing the controller to propel and bend it through the engine with bursts of air. Using soft materials, he says, means it can be small and agile. For now, much of the commercial action for softer robots is in logistics, replacing production-line jobs that can't yet be handled by hard robots.  Food preparation companies and growers like Blue Apron, Plated and HelloFresh already use soft robotics for handling produce, says Mike Rocky, of recruiter PrincetonOne. REFILE - CLARIFYING CAPTION  A soft robot designed by a team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the U.S., in the form of a salamander, is displayed in Singapore June 5, 2017. Picture taken June 5, 2017.Edgar SuThe challenge, says Cambridge Consultants' Nathan Wrench, is to overcome the uncertainty when handling something - which humans deal with unconsciously: figuring out its shape and location and how hard to grip it, and distinguishing one object from another.  This is an area robots traditionally can't do, but where (soft robots) are on the cusp of being able to,  said Wrench. Marine Inspiration Investors are excited, says Leif Jentoft, co-founder of RightHand Robotics, because it addresses a major pain point in the logistics industry.  Ecommerce is growing rapidly and warehouses are struggling to find enough labor, especially in remote areas where warehouses tend to be located.  Some hope to ditch the idea that robots need hands. German automation company Festo and China's Beihang University have built a prototype OctopusGripper, which has a pneumatic tentacle made of silicone that gently wraps itself around an object, while air is pumped in or out of suction cups to grasp it. Slideshow (2 Images)The ocean has inspired other robots, too. A soft robot fish from China's Zhejiang University swims by ditching the usual rigid motors and propellers for an artificial muscle which flexes. It's lifelike enough, says creator Tiefeng Li, to fool other fish into embracing it as one of their own, and is being tested to explore or monitor water salinity. And Bristol University in the UK is working on underwater robots that generate electrical energy by foraging for biomatter to feed a chain of microbial fuel-cell stomachs. Hemma Philamore says her team is talking to companies and environmental organizations about using its soft robots to decontaminate polluted waterways and monitor industrial infrastructure. This doesn't mean the end of hard-shelled robots. Part of the problem, says Mark Freudenberg, executive technology director at frog, a design company, is that soft materials break easily, noting that most animatronic dolls like Teddy Ruxpin and Furby have rigid motors and plastic casings beneath their fur exteriors. To be sure, the nascent soft robot industry lacks an ecosystem of software, hardware components and standards - and some companies have already failed. Empire Robotics, one of the first soft robot gripper companies, closed last year. RightHand's Jentoft says the problem is that customers don't just want a robot, but the whole package, including computer vision and machine learning.  It's hard to be a standalone gripper company,  he says. And even if soft robots find a niche, chances are they still won't replace all the jobs done by human or hard-shelled robots. Wrench, whose Cambridge Consultants has built its own fruit picking robot, says he expects to see soft robots working with humans to harvest fruit like apples and pears which are harder to damage. Once the robot has passed through, human pickers would follow to grab fruit hidden behind leaves and in hard-to-reach spots.  It's a constant race to the bottom, so there's a pressing business need,  Wrench said.

Abadi had been due to visit Riyadh last week but postponed his trip to avoid appearing to take sides in a diplomatic dispute that erupted between Qatar and several other Arab states including Saudi Arabia, officials have said. Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies, which accuse Doha of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and cosying up to their enemy Iran. Qatar denies the charges. (Reporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Gareth Jones)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-saudi-idUSL8N1JG1C7"},

Rosatom was formed in 2007 from the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry and is tasked with turning nuclear power into a major export industry. Its fortunes have been helped by the fact the two leading Western reactor makers, France's Areva and Japanese-owned Westinghouse, have been hit by delays and cost overruns at various reactor projects. Rosatom first deputy CEO Kirill Komarov told a nuclear conference in Moscow that as of last year Rosatom had an overseas order book of $133 billion for the next 10 years, with almost three times more foreign orders than in 2011. Last year, Rosatom made 47 percent of its revenue overseas, and the company thinks it will reach its goal of making two-thirds of revenue from foreign orders far ahead of 2030 as originally planned, Komarov said.  Our profit and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) are rising, our debt is falling. This gives us grounds to feel very confident and have the strength to take on new, ambitious international projects, including those that require financing,  he said. Last week, Rosatom won approval from Turkey's energy watchdog to go ahead with building its $20 billion Akkuyu nuclear power plant in southern Turkey.

Speaking at the Paris Airshow, GE Aviation Chief Executive David Joyce declined to give a breakdown, but said CFM would quicken output of the LEAP engine to keep up with demand.  That means we slow down the reduction of CFM, come down that slope more slowly, at the same time as we come up the LEAP ramp-up faster,  Joyce told reporters. CFM is sticking with plans to produce 1,400 CFM56 and 500 LEAP engines this year, he said. Next year it will produce 1,200 LEAP engines, in 2019 it will produce 1,900 and in 2020 it will produce 2,100 engines.  So it is game on and we feel we are ready,  he added.

In a letter sent to the Indian ambassador to Washington last month, and seen by Reuters, 18 members of Congress said they were  troubled  by the price cap, warning that it could deter firms from launching new medical products in India. Modi's government has in recent years capped prices of hundreds of life-saving drugs to make them more affordable. And in February, it imposed a 75 percent price cut for certain heart stents - wire mesh tubes used to treat blocked arteries.  The government justified its action by citing  huge unethical markups . But global medical device makers have protested the new cap, with some saying it would force them to sell below cost. The U.S. lawmakers warned that people would be denied access to the latest medical advances if companies backed away from India's $5 billion medical-technology market.  The sudden and unprecedented nature of the decision threatens citizens' access to the newest and most innovative medical technologies and raises strong concerns about the business environment in India,  they said in the May 22 letter, which has not previously been made public. The Indian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Department of Commerce is likely to raise the issue with Modi during his visit on June 25-26, according to an industry source aware of the plans.  It's one of the biggest pain points,  the source said.  Be Prepared to Quit  An aide to Modi said companies were being asked to bring down prices of medical devices  or be prepared to quit  the country, and a bureaucrat who works closely with the prime minister's office said raising the matter to diplomatic levels would not influence India's position. FILE PHOTO: A worker waters plants next to an advertisement billboard of Abbott in Mumbai, India, November 12, 2015.Danish Siddiqui/File photoU.S.-based companies such as Boston Scientific Corp and Abbott Laboratories sell heart stents in India, while Johnson & Johnson sells other devices. Following the February decision, Abbott moved to withdraw one of its stents from India, but its plea was rejected by Modi's government.          Boston Scientific - which also has a research base near New Delhi - sought a higher price for one of its stents but a government panel declined the request.  Such decisions, the group of U.S. Congress members wrote, had forced companies to sell  leading edge technology in India at a loss . Signatories to the letter included Indiana Republican Jackie Walorski, and Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat. Both are members of the House Ways and Means Committee. Before the pricing order, for example, Boston Scientific was selling its high-end Synergy stent for about $3,000 in India, well above its $750 cost, according to a company document seen by Reuters. The new cap reduces the price to $450, and the company says it would result in losses of at least $7 million this year.  Indian health activists have lauded the government decision to cap heart stent prices, saying it is in the public interest.  It was found that huge unethical mark-ups are charged at each stage in the supply chain of coronary stents resulting in irrational, restrictive and exorbitant prices in a failed market system,  the Indian government said in February. A month later, India's federal drug pricing regulator privately asked the health ministry to add at least four more medical devices to a list of essential medicines, opening the way for them to be made subject to price controls.  In their letter, the U.S. lawmakers echoed concerns raised by the medical device industry, saying India's interventionist policy on pricing would hamper innovation and jeopardize investment.  We are especially worried that comments by government officials signal the intention to double down on this dangerous policy and expand price cuts to other medical devices,  they wrote in their letter.

CFM produces engines exclusively for the Boeing 737 MAX family and competes with Pratt & Whitney to provide engines for the Airbus A320neo. It is co-owned by GE Aviation and France's Safran. Speaking at the Paris Airshow, GE Aviation Chief Executive David Joyce declined to give a breakdown, but said CFM would quicken output of the LEAP engine to keep up with demand.  That means we slow down the reduction of CFM, come down that slope more slowly, at the same time as we come up the LEAP ramp-up faster,  Joyce told reporters. CFM is sticking with plans to produce 1,400 CFM56 and 500 LEAP engines this year, he said. Next year it will produce 1,200 LEAP engines, in 2019 it will produce 1,900 and in 2020 it will produce 2,100 engines.  So it is game on and we feel we are ready,  he added.

The Outlook is Stable. 'AAA' National Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by Fitch on its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other issuers or obligations in the same country. KEY RATING DRIVERS YSID's National Ratings reflect Fitch's assessment of a high ability and propensity of support from its Taiwan-based ultimate parent, Yuanta Financial Holding Co., Ltd. (Yuanta Financial Holdings, BBB+/Stable), should it be needed. YSID was formerly known as PT AM Capital Indonesia. It changed its name to PT Yuanta Sekuritas Indonesia following the acquisition by Yuanta Group in April 2015. Fitch assesses YSID as strategically important to Yuanta Financial Holdings given the parent's ownership of 99% of the subsidiary, risk management supervision, liquidity assistance, timely capital injections and appointment of key personnel at the subsidiary, as well as their name association. Fitch considers the parent's ability to support its subsidiary as high given that YSID accounted for only 0.04% and 0.4% of Yuanta Financial Holdings' total consolidated assets and equity, respectively at end-2016. Fitch views YSID as important to its parent's goal of business growth in south-east Asia. However, YSID is still a relatively new acquisition, so Fitch expects synergies with the parent to materialise only after some time. Fitch also believes that reputational risk to the Yuanta Group if YSID were to default, while significant given the name sharing, would be contained for the parent. YSID is a small securities company in Indonesia. It ranked 30th out of the 114 securities houses in Indonesia by stock transaction value, with around 0.9% market share in 2016. It derives almost all of its revenue from brokerage commission from retail customers and it focuses on middle- to high-end individuals. YSID's asset management subsidiary, PT Yuanta Asset Management, which focuses on fixed-income products, had assets under management of IDR95 billion (USD7 million) at end-March 2017. Fitch believes that brokerage commission will continue to be YSID's primary source of revenue in the near to medium term. YSID's revenue and earnings generation are highly volatile over business cycles, similar to other securities companies operating in Indonesia. The company has had small profits starting 4Q16 after operational losses since 2012. EBITDA margin was 13.3% in 1Q17 (2016: 5.4%). Fitch believes that capital injections will be forthcoming from its parent, if needed, to support YSID's future business growth, as was the case when Yuanta Financial Holdings injected about USD10 million in capital in early 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES YSID's rating is sensitive to changes in its parent's rating  - a two-notch downgrade of Yuanta Financial Holdings' rating would likely result in a downgrade of YSID's rating. Downward rating pressure may also arise from any developments that lead to significant perceived weakening of the parent's propensity to provide support to the subsidiary. There is no upward rating potential as the rating is already at the highest point on the National Ratings scale.

The region is awash with private-equity money. Yet big targets are relatively scarce. Acquisitions, especially in ultra-pricey China, will only work out for the buyers if companies can grow fast, and market multiples hold up, for years to come – an unlikely combination. Earlier this month, KKR closed a record $9.3 billion Asian fund. Morgan Stanley is among others looking to raise fresh capital for regional buyouts, according to the Wall Street Journal. The new money will add to the existing supply-demand imbalance. Asia-Pacific fund managers ended last year with $136 billion of spare capital, according to Bain & Co. Smaller, inexperienced firms can be undisciplined, especially in China. Meanwhile, it's hard to find opportunities that include control of the companies concerned, since many are in the grip of tycoons or governments. The result is that deals become costly. The average enterprise value in Asia-Pacific buyouts climbed to 17 times EBITDA last year, according to Bain's research, versus roughly 10 times that measure of profit in the United States. In China, Mergermarket reckons private-equity investments since 2014 have averaged an eye-watering 26 times trailing EBITDA. Excluding sell-offs and purchases of minority interests, that figure falls to a still punchy 18 times. Graphic: Eastern premium: tmsnrt.rs/2rDiubh Suppose a U.S. leveraged buyout is priced at 10 times EBITDA, and an Asian one is struck at a 17 times multiple. Say each outfit raises debt worth six times EBITDA and writes an equity cheque for the rest. Then suppose the owners sell after five years at the same respective multiples, having repaid half their borrowings. For the American LBO to deliver a 20 percent annualised return, the company's operating profit must increase just 5 percent per year, Breakingviews calculates. For the same return, the Asian deal requires 12 percent annual growth. That is not wholly crazy. China and many other Asian economies are expanding faster than the United States, and some deals involve fast-growing technology firms. But any slowdown could crimp profit. Lofty multiples may not last, either – investors' enthusiasm and resources wax and wane. For the hypothetical Asian LBO to generate the same return with an exit at a reduced 12 times EBITDA multiple would require sustained 20 percent annual growth. No wonder KKR, for one, seems keen on slower-growing but cheaper Japan.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Huaxing is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of China-based Zhuhai Huafa Group Co., Ltd. (Zhuhai Huafa, BBB/Stable). The tap issuance carries the same terms and conditions as the earlier USD200 million issuance of 3.5% guaranteed bonds due 2020. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 23 March 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS The bonds will constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of Huaxing and shall at all times rank pari passu with its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and without any preference among themselves. The bonds are rated at the same level as Zhuhai Huafa's Issuer Default Rating because the direct guarantee structure transfers the ultimate responsibility of payment to Zhuhai Huafa. Zhuhai Huafa's ratings are credit-linked with, but not equalised to, Fitch's internal credit assessment of Zhuhai municipality. This is due to the company's full-municipal ownership, strong municipal oversight of its financials and the strategic importance of Zhuhai Huafa's public-sector business to the municipality. These factors suggest a strong likelihood of extraordinary support from the municipality for Zhuhai Huafa, if needed. Zhuhai Huafa is registered as a wholly state-owned entity and the Zhuhai State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has full control over the company. Zhuhai SASAC has decision-making power over Zhuhai Huafa's major investment and financing choices and the company's board is mostly appointed by the municipality, which also closely monitors its financing plan and indebtedness levels. In addition, Zhuhai Huafa is required to regularly report its operational and financial results to the municipality. Zhuhai Huafa plays an important role in implementing the municipality's urban planning and development blueprint. The company is involved with large-scale social-housing projects and urban developments, such as Shizimen Central Business District. Zhuhai Huafa also owns majority shares in Zhuhai Financial Investment Holdings Group Co., Ltd., a key municipality-owned investment holding platform for financial institutions and industrial-equity investment. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any rating action on Zhuhai Huafa's Issuer Default Rating would result in similar rating action on the rated bonds.

France's 10-year government bond yield edged back towards seven-month lows around 0.58 percent hit last week after a first round of parliamentary elections pointed to a strong showing for Macron's fledgling party. Three pollsters projected that his Republic on the Move and its Modem allies would win 355 to 365 seats in the 577-seat lower house following Sunday's second-round vote, fewer than previously forecast. Record low voter turnout suggested France's new leader, the youngest since Napoleon, would need to proceed carefully with reforms in a country where trade unions and street protests have in the past forced new legislation to be diluted.  Macron will need to tread carefully, with some questioning the validity of his mandate on a 45 percent turnout, the lowest in fifty years,  said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.  He will also face an enormous amount of resistance on the ground from the vested interests of the trade unions which still wield an enormous amount of influence, and could make life very difficult for the inexperienced new President and his party.  But the scale of his victory gives Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, a solid platform to carry out his campaign promises to revive the euro zone's second biggest economy. Sunday's votes also draws a line under French elections, which had been viewed as a key risk to markets earlier this year given the popularity of anti-euro far-right leader Marine Le Pen heading into presidential elections in April and May. The gap between French and German bond yields - an important gauge of risk appetite - had widened sharply heading into those elections but has since tightened as Macron's election as president and growing expectations that his new party would perform well in the parliamentary elections lifted investor sentiment. The French/German 10-year bond yield gap was at 35 bps on Monday, having hit its tightest levels since November last week. That's down more than 40 bps from highs seen in February at the height of French election jitters.  Macron's overwhelming majority should confirm already constructive sentiment,  Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Positive developments in French politics contrasted with turbulence in Britain, where a weakened government on Monday kicks off divorce talks with the EU. Outside France, most euro zone bond yields were little changed on the day.

Workers at the mine downed tools almost two weeks ago, angered by a company drive to root out illegal miners which has included the arrest of employees for collusion. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.

Macron's centrist Republic on the Move (LREM) party and its centre-right Modem ally won 350 seats out of 577 in the lower house, the results showed after a vote that saw a record low turnout for a parliamentary poll in the postwar Fifth Republic. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said the high abstention rate -- more than 50 percent of voters stayed at home -- was a failure for the political class and highlighted the need to change politics in France.  The real victory wasn't last night, it will be in five years time when we have really changed things,  Castaner told RTL radio. Though lower than forecast by pollsters in the run-up to the vote, Macron's majority swept aside France's main traditional parties, humiliating the Socialist and conservative The Republicans party that alternated in power for decades.  Victory for the Centre  read the headline of the left-leaning Liberation newspaper. Financial paper Les Echos' banner read  The Successful Gamble . Castaner said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and his government would resign later in the day and a new cabinet formed in the coming days. He said he believed Philippe would be reappointed premier. Sunday's high abstention rate underlines that Macron will have to tread carefully with reforms in a country with muscular trade unions and a history of street protests that have forced many a past government to dilute new legislation. Macron's twin victories in last month's presidential election and in Sunday's parliamentary vote marks the routing of the old political class. Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon who had never before held elected office, seized on the growing resentment towards a political elite perceived as out of touch, and on public frustration at its failure to create jobs and spur stronger growth, to win the presidency. His year-old party then filled the political space created by the disarray within the Socialist Party and the Republicans, with Sunday night capping a sequence of events that a year ago looked improbable.  The collapse of the Socialist Party is beyond doubt. The president of the Republic has all the powers,  Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said late on Sunday after announcing he would step down as Socialist Party chief. The election saw a record number of women voted into parliament, due largely to Macron's decision to field a gender-balanced candidate list.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.0 percent, to 3,553.67 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.7 percent to 3,144.37 points. Traders said liquidity conditions improved as the central bank continued to provide funds via open market operations, after injecting a net 410 billion yuan into money markets last week, the biggest weekly injection since mid-January. Still, authorities appear to have paused their campaign in recent weeks, possibly due to concerns over liquidity or perhaps an indication that they are assessing earlier policy steps to see if they are starting to slow the real economy, as many analysts predict.  Liquidity conditions have eased as the government has recently decreased its focus on tightening financial regulations,  UBS Securities wrote in a report. Expectations of fewer new listings also supported Chinese stocks on Monday, particularly small-caps whose valuations had been pressured by worries of more equity supply. The securities regulator approved six initial public offerings (IPOs) on Friday, which was the fourth straight week that the pace had slowed from an average of around 10 IPOs in the past months. Chinese investors are also awaiting a decision by U.S. index provider MSCI, which will decide on June 20 whether to include A shares in its Emerging Market Index. The stock regulator said it would be happy for MSCI index inclusion, but Chinese capital market reform will not be derailed without the inclusion.  The inclusion could bring about 60.7 billion yuan into the (A-share) market, but the impact would be limited if the inclusion does not happen,  Haitong Securities wrote. Most sectors gained ground, led by financial and consumer stocks.

Engie will become Tabreed's second-biggest shareholder after Mubadala, which will retain a 42 percent stake in a deal that is subject to regulatory approval, the two companies said on Monday. Mubadala which owned about 82 percent of Tabreed through a combination of equity and mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) will be converting all its MCBs into shares or equivalent to 40 percent shareholding in Tabreed that will be transferred to Engie at a price of 2.62 dirhams per share. Shares of Tabreed surged 15 percent, its daily limit to 2.12 dirhams at 10.48 a.m local time. The two companies have also agreed certain cooperation arrangements that are designed to support Tabreed's growth strategy and management team, they said. Reuters had reported in November that Mubadala was considering the sale of a least part of its stake Tabreed.  Tabreed is a company with a strong growth trajectory and will benefit from Engie's experience as an operator of world-class utility businesses,  said Homaid al Shimmari, deputy group chief executive of Mubadala in a statement, adding that Mubadala will continue to be a significant, long-standing shareholder in Tabreed.

We remain passionate about the opportunity and intend to continue pursuing discussions,  Liberty House said in an email to Reuters.  The Seoul-based private equity syndicate led by Newlake Alliance and JB Asset Management was named on June 15 as the preferred bidder over Liberty, and that was thought to be the end of more than a year of Morgan Stanley-led (MS.N) efforts to provide a financial rescue package to Arrium.  Morgan Stanley recommended the Newlake and JB Asset consortium to Arrium's committee of creditors, which overwhelmingly supported the South Korean group, according to the steelmaker's financial administrator, KordaMentha.  The creditors' committee includes Australian lenders Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), Westpac (WBC.AX) and ANZ Bank (ANZ.AX), which together are owed a combined A$1 billion ($761 million).  KordaMentha confirmed a revised bid had been submitted by Liberty House, but said administrators continued to deal with the Korean consortium on an exclusive basis.  South Australia state has pledged A$50 million to the new owner to help upgrade Arrium's steelworks.     A spokesman for the South Australia treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, said the state would work with either group to keep Arrium in business.  Newlake's and JB's bid proposes spending more than A$1 billion on the Whyalla upgrade and on Arrium's mini-mills, steel distribution and iron ore mining divisions. The consortium also plans to build a gas-fired power station to feed the steelworks, which would help combat South Australia's energy shortage.  Newlake has said it will use the Finex steelmaking technology under license from South Korean steelmaker POSCO (005490.KS) to revamp the Arrium's main Whyalla steelworks. The decision to use the technology played a key role in the selection process, according to KordaMentha.   Newlake and JB West were not immediately available for comment.  Liberty House, which operates together with commodities and energy conglomerate SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, hit the headlines last year when it offered to rescue steel plants owned by Tata Steel UK (TISC.NS) that were on the verge of shutdown.  Liberty's so-called green metal model is based on using renewable energy to fire furnaces and smelters that recycle local scrap and sell the finished metal to manufacturers.

The Reserve Bank of India urged lenders to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against a dozen companies, including Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel Ltd and Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The RBI said it had identified the 12 defaulters last week, but did not publicise their names.

The IEA estimates carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be needed to cut 14 percent of the emissions that have to be abated by 2060 to limit the global rise in temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  The size of the challenge really requires all technologies to be deployed,  IEA energy analyst Samantha McCulloch told Reuters on the sidelines of a Global CCS Institute forum in Melbourne. By one estimate, $80 billion has been invested in renewable energy compared with $20 billion in CCS, Australia's ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, told the forum. Efforts to expand carbon capture and storage include a Japanese project to bury carbon dioxide below the seabed off Hokkaido island and construction of China's first large-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) project at a coal-to-chemicals plant run by Yanchang Petroleum in Xian. In Australia, the government has proposed allowing its A$10 billion ($7.6 billion) Clean Energy Finance Corp to provide loans to carbon capture projects as part of a  technology-neutral  approach to cutting carbon emissions.  We're seeing renewed interest from governments,  McCulloch said. Two projects in Australia are driving hope for the technology. Chevron Corp is in the final stages of starting up the world's largest CCS operation, estimated at A$2 billion at its huge Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant on Barrow Island off Western Australia, where carbon dioxide will be stripped from natural gas, compressed, piped and injected 2 kms (1.2 miles) below the island. The other project, CarbonNet, is a A$150 million government study in the state of Victoria. CarbonNet has identified a site 1.5 kms below the seabed off the state's coast where it estimates it could store 125 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, project director Ian Filby told the forum. It aims to have the Pelican site approved for storage and secure an injection license by 2020. Filby said the lowest cost applications for CCS would be for industrial operations, like gas processing, fertiliser manufacturing and hydrogen production, at an estimated A$30 a ton for compressing, transporting and burying carbon dioxide. That could suit a project that Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is pursuing to use Victoria's brown coal to produce ultra clean hydrogen fuel, a project it has said will need CCS. $1 = 1.3137 Australian dollars Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-carboncapture-idUSL3N1JD2MW"},

The latest steps are an extension of curbs announced in November 2016, when the government started turning the screws on speculative housing investments amid concerns a worrying build-up in household debt could leave the economy exposed to a crash.  Effective July 3, the government will tighten loan limits for home buyers to 60 percent of a property's value from the current 70 percent in regions showing signs of overheating including Seoul, the finance ministry and financial regulator said in a statement. Debt repayments will be limited to 50 percent of home buyers' annual income in those selected regions, down from the current 60 percent, it said. The government will also restrict the resale of newly built apartments in Seoul and some parts of Busan until registration of property ownership is complete, to cool speculation in those regions, it said. Analysts expect the fresh curbs - the tightest restrictions since August 2014 - to have only a moderate impact on the overall housing market.  This is not a nation-wide measure, so it will pause some buying frenzy in some regions rather than cooling the overall housing market sentiment,  Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities said.  Indeed, rather than nationwide measures, the government is trying a targeted approach aimed at cities with the most heated property prices to reduce the impact on the construction sector, which grew almost five times faster than the gross domestic product in the first quarter.  As for the economy, looks like the construction sector will continue to drive growth albeit at a slower pace,  Kim said, adding the broad economic recovery underway is unlikely to be dented by the housing restrictions.  South Korea property stocks hardly moved as Monday's measures were in line with market expectations.  In a briefing, vice finance minister Ko Hyoung-kwon warned of more curbs if overheating continues in the targeted regions.  If we see and confirm overheating widening, we will be firm in adopting more measures, including designating some regions as 'overheated speculation zone,'  Ko said.  The central bank’s eight rate cuts since 2012 helped send  home prices and household debt to record levels. The average price of a Seoul apartment in March exceeded 600 million won ($529,918.30) for the first time, an increase of more than 20 percent from four years earlier.  Despite a steady rise in mortgage rates, apartment prices in Seoul were up 0.3 percent in the week of June 12 from a week earlier, the fastest clip since 2009, according to Kookmin Bank data. The average mortgage rate was at 3.21 percent in April, the highest in about 2 years and up from 3.13 percent as of December 2016, Bank of Korea data shows.

The reassurance from top air force general Andre Lanata offers some respite to manufacturer Airbus after months of renewed debate over the delayed plane. The A400M - ordered by Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - has been hit by engine gearbox problems and delays in fitting parachuting capacity and advanced defenses. Related CoverageGE says planemakers calling for more CFM enginesA confidential report by the German defense ministry  warned recently that such problems as well as contract disputes could impair the full operational use of the transporter. But speaking to journalists to mark the start of the June 19-25 air show at Le Bourget, near Paris, Lanata said he believed Airbus was getting to grips with the problems.  I believe that all that is now mainly behind us,  he told the AJPAE media association. Earlier this year, Airbus took a new writedown of 1.2 billion euros against losses on the A400M, and urged the seven NATO buyers to limit its exposure to heavy fines and payment delays caused by new technical snags and delays. France currently has 11 A400M planes, of which six are fully operational - a tally which Lanata called  very satisfactory , even though not all of them yet have the specifications originally envisaged in Europe's largest defense contract. The French army is due to get another 15 A400M planes by 2019, and French President Emmanuel Macron was due to arrive at the Paris Airshow on Monday on board an A400M in a further show of support for the model. Lanata said that while there were technical issues that needed to be resolved, France remained fully behind the A400M.  It is very important that optimism and support shown by France is not hampered by any industrial problems, given how tough the Germans have been on this matter,  added another French army official, asking not to be named.

The Nikkei gained 0.6 percent to 20,067.75, its highest close since June 5. The broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,606.07, but only 1.48 billion shares changed hands, the lowest volume since May 30. Turnover was also the lowest since then.  Investors are buying futures today... it's more like today's trading is futures-led than trade-led by individual stocks,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. The dollar was up 0.2 percent to comfortably stay above 111 yen during most of the session, which lifted U.S. futures , underpinning risk appetites in Asian trade. Investors also believe Wall Street will fare better on Monday than on Friday, when it was  subdued, Mizuho's Miura said. The Nikkei remained above the psychologically important 20,000-line as the market digested the Bank of Japan's decision to keep policy unchanged on Friday. After the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike and the BOJ's meeting, traders see no major catalysts this week but will stay focused on coming U.S. economic indicators.  We expect that the 20,000 level will become the Nikkei's support level soon, and it will likely depend on whether the long-term U.S. yields will rise or not,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. Monday's notable gainers included domestic-demand sensitive stocks. Construction companies Taisei Corp rose 2.4 percent and Kajima Corp soared 2.5 percent. Nomura Real Estate Holdings sank 14 percent after it confirmed weekend media reports that Japan Post Holdings would likely scrap the talks to buy a stake in Nomura as the two companies had struggled to agree on terms. The potential deal, first reported in mid-May, had pushed Nomura's shares up by 20 percent. Major exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 0.1 percent, Nissan Motor Co shedding 0.9 percent and Hitachi Ltd gaining 0.3 percent. On Monday, the exchange's suspension of Takata Corp , the troubled maker of air bag inflators, was lifted. There was a glut of sell orders and a trade at the end of the day left the stock at 404 yen, compared with 484 yen where it last traded on Thursday. Trading in Takata was suspended throughout Friday because the company offered no official statement after sources said it was preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as this week.

Reuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy. New items are marked with (*). For a complete list of diary events in Italy please click on . Companies Veneto Banks Italy has ruled out the idea of winding down two struggling lenders in the northern Veneto area, a source said on Sunday, following a report Brussels was set to tell Rome it could not use direct state support to rescue them. The report in Sunday's La Stampa said the lenders' assets would be hived off into a good bank and the sour loans placed in a bad bank The bad bank to be used could be the one set up for Banco di Napoli or SGA, la Repubblica reported on Sunday. Italy on Friday approved an emergency decree that will stop Veneto Banca from having to repay 86 million euros of subordinated bonds due to mature next week. The EU approved the move. A source familiar with the matter on Saturday confirmed press reports that Rothschild would be hired by Italy's government as an adviser over the two Veneto banks. Corriere on Sunday said some of the lenders' assets could be sold to reduce the amount of fresh private capital needed to press ahead with a precautionary recapitalisation. Potential investors have been given access to the two banks' books for a quick due diligence, La Stampa and La Repubblica reported. According to the latter Intesa may still put in alone the full 1.2 billion euros of private capital needed as UniCredit was having second thoughts about the plan. MilanoFinanza said the bidding consortium was likely to comprise 3 or 4 big banks led by Intesa and UniCredit. La Repubblica reported the government was considering significantly boosting the endowment of a fund to support layoffs in order to help the two banks cut staff. Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena Two U.S. private equity funds have quit talks to buy a mountain of bad loans from ailing Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources said on Friday, dealing a blow to plans to secure a state bailout for the bank. Telecom Italia, Enel Telecom Italia will go ahead with plans to roll out an ultrafast broadband network in rural or sparely populated areas of Italy despite objections from the government, the phone group's chief executive told a newspaper on Sunday. Claudio De Vincenti, a cabinet minister and the head of an ultra broadband committee, told Corriere della Sera on Saturday that the government would claim damages from Telecom Italia if the company did not drop a plan to build an ultra broadband infrastructure in areas where it's not profitable after telling the government that it was not going to invest in those areas and forcing the State to step in. Undersecretary Antonello Giacomelli told la Repubblica on Saturday that he was convinced Telecom Italia would not press ahead with the plan and that, if it did, the government would have to assess damages caused to public interests and act accordingly. (*) Enel, Open Fiber Open Fiber is in talks with around 15 banks for 4.5 billion euros in project financing and expects to finalise an agreement within two to three months, the company's Chief Executive Tommaso Pompei told Corriere della Sera's L'Economia insert in an interview. He dismissed suggestions that Open Fiber's project may not be bankable, saying  banks are queuing up ... there is liquidity around, there is appetite for infrastructure . Fiat Chrysler FCA does not expect its diesel problems in the United States to have an impact on its short-term business targets to 2018, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday. U.S. regulators told Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in November 2015 that they suspected some of the automaker's vehicles were equipped with secret software allowing them to violate emission control standards, according to emails disclosed on Friday. (*) Fiat Chrysler denied it had decided to pull the plug on the Chrysler brand in Japan, after local media reported it was planning to stop selling the U.S. cars in the country as early as next year following years of poor sales. Banca Carige The Italian bank said on Friday it had transferred gross bad loans worth 938 million euros to a vehicle that would sell them on to investors repackaged as securities. The bank is likely to name former UniCredit top executive Paolo Fiorentino as its next CEO, Il Messaggero reported on Saturday. (*) The bank will appoint a new chief executive  within days  and definitely before the end of the month, Carige's Chairman Giuseppe Tesauro was quoted on Monday as saying by la Repubblica Affari & Finanza. Mediaset The broadcaster would be able to buy up to 10 percent of its own capital without triggering a mandatory bid by top shareholder Fininvest if shareholders representing at least 10 percent of Mediaset's floating share capital attend a June 28 general meeting and at least half of them vote in favour of the treasury share buyback, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Saturday. Vivendi will present on Monday to Italy's telecommunications authority its plan to fix its dominant position in the country's telecoms sector, Il Sole said. (*) Salvatore Ferragamo The Ferragamo family will unveil by autumn an agreement that sets rules such as the maximum number of family members that can work in the company. (*) Credito Emiliano General Manager Nazzareno Gregori told la Repubblica Affari & Finanza on Monday that Credem would be ready to consider an acquisition but added there were very few interesting assets on the market. Atlantia La Stampa on Saturday quoted a Spanish government source as saying the Atlantia-Abertis deal should be different from Enel's takeover of Endesa which handed control of a strategic group to an Italian company that did not invest further in Spain. The paper said Atlantia would be ready to keep the group's headquarters in Barcelona. Intesa Sanpaolo The bank's board will meet over the new business plan on Tuesday and the plan will  almost certainly  be approved in January, Il Messaggero reported on Saturday. Cattolica Assicurazioni The Italian insurer said on Friday police searched the company and made a seizure in relation to a judicial case involving at least one executive and one contractor. Unicredit Mediobanca's MB Credit Solution said on Friday it bought 450 million euros in bad loans from Italy's top bank UniCredit.

Schofield, who led the European Tour for 30 years and in 2013 was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, told Reuters that Koepka had won a lot of respect during his days on the European Challenge Tour, beginning as a 22-year-old in 2012. Koepka recorded three quick victories on the satellite circuit to make the step up to the European Tour before the Floridian eventually progressed to the U.S.-based PGA Tour.

A changing of golf's old guard has been underway for some time but the 117th U.S. Open signaled that it can be considered complete with neither Phil Mickelson and/or Tiger Woods teeing up at major for the first time since the 1994 U.S. Masters. Fans now run to see Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day, the youth movement having firmly taken hold. Koepka, South Korea's Kim Si-woo, Japan's Hideki Matusyama, Englishman Tommy Fleetwood and Americans Brian Harman and Rickie Fowler were the names battling for major glory on Sunday, rather than the likes of Jim Furyk, Stewart Cink and Ernie Els. Sentiment and nostalgia will always find a place on the leaderboard, as 37-year-old Sergio Garcia showed by notching his first major win at the Masters in April, while 50-year-old Wisconsin-native Steve Stricker provided an emotional touchstone in an Erin Hills swan-song. But the year's second major belonged to the young guns who tackled the longest layout ever for a U.S. Open. Related CoverageKoepka takes road less traveled to U.S. Open triumphSchofield says Koepka made great impression in EuropeMatsuyama joins Aoki as major runner-up from JapanKoepka, who looks as if he would be at home in a National Football League huddle, held firm against buffeting winds and crushing pressure to claim a sensational four-shot victory over Harman and Matsuyama. The muscular American, who started the day one back of the lead, tamed his nerves and a wind-whipped course, carding six birdies, including two to kick-start his round, against a single bogey for a five-under 67. Koepka's winning total of 16-under equals the lowest score to par for a U.S. Open, matching Rory McIlroy's victory at Congressional in 2011 on a par-71 layout. Jun 18, 2017; Erin, WI, USA; Brooks Koepka poses with the trophy after winning the U.S. Open golf tournament at Erin Hills.  Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY SportsAfter days of being humbled, Erin Hills turned nasty for the final round as heavy winds pummeled the links-style layout adding an intriguing wrinkle to the year's second major. But Koepka would not be blown off course producing a near-flawless final round, subduing the winds with a mix of power and precision.  Obviously the wind picked up and I felt like that played right into my hand,  said Koepka, who considers himself a good ball-striker and good putter.  Slideshow (8 Images)“And I felt confident all week, so to feel as confident as I did on a Sunday of a major and coming down the stretch was pretty neat.  One of golf's biggest hitters, the 27-year-old also demonstrated a killer instinct along with a deft touch with the putter, rolling in a monster 41-foot birdie putt at the eighth. When Matsuyama, at number four the highest ranked player to make the cut, delivered the round of the day a six-under 66 to get within one of the lead, a rampaging Koepka countered with golf's version of the knockout punch, clinching victory in ruthless style by registering three straight birdies from the 14th. Harman, level with Koepka with six to play and without a bogey on the back nine all week, took his first at the 12th after his tee shot ended up in the belt-high fescue and followed that up with another at the 13th. The miscues put Koepka alone back on top of the leaderboard, a perch from which he would not be removed.  It hasn't sunk in, obviously, yet, and probably won't for a few days,  said Koepka.  That's probably one of the coolest things I've ever experienced and to do it on Father's Day it's pretty neat.  I didn't exactly get my dad a card, so this works.

He declined to give details of discussions at the gathering, where producers had been expected to talk about rubber prices that touched seven-month lows early this month, partly due to a slowdown in imports by top consumer China.  Supply and demand conditions now are quite healthy, even better than two years ago,  Soedargo said.  Fundamentals are good, Gapkindo is not worried about prices.  He added that global rubber stocks currently stood at around 2.4 million tonnes, down from more than 3 million tonnes in 2015.  What is happening now is technical factors ... are affecting market condition and putting pressure on prices,  he said, without elaborating. Soedargo also said that Indonesian production would taper off over the next few months as part of the usual production cycle, helping tighten global supply and supporting prices.  Starting July, leaves will start falling and rubber production will gradually drop from month to month ... until September,  he said.

Does BHP want to be a cutting edge mining company always on the prowl for the next big opportunity, or does it want to be a cautious, dividend-focused cash generator, something akin to being the telecoms utility of the mining world? If there is anything that can be learned from the performance of BHP, and indeed most of its global mining rivals, in the past decade, it's that escaping the ups and downs of the commodity cycle is extremely difficult for a miner. BHP's Australia-listed shares ended at A$22.99 ($17.51) on June 16, down 8.3 percent since the end of last year, but still above the closing low of A$14.20 on Jan. 21, 2016. On that view BHP's share price performance doesn't actually look that bad, with the stock gaining rapidly from the January low last year on the back of sharp gains in the price of its main profit earner, iron ore, as well as other commodities, especially coal. But over the longer term, BHP's performance becomes much less impressive. The stock dropped to just above A$19 in November of 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis. Buying BHP at that point would have been a good investment as the shares took off as China poured massive amounts of money into resource-heavy infrastructure projects in order to stimulate growth after the global downturn. BHP rode the wave to a peak of A$44.89 on April 11, 2011, but after that it was all downhill until the low of January 2016, as iron ore and coal notched up five consecutive losing years. Bhp's Role in Its Own Downturn It would be a simple argument to say that BHP merely tracked the decline in commodity prices, but that ignores the company's own complicity in causing prices to slide. In common with its peers, BHP decided to use the cash generated from the sharp rise in commodity prices on the back of Chinese stimulus to dramatically boost production, particularly in iron ore. As soon as one major producer decided that the China story was a never-ending gift to miners, basically they all had to follow or stand to lose market share. The management and board of BHP at the time made the mistake of believing the optimistic view of forecast Chinese steel output, while ignoring the historic fact that virtually every commodity boom is ended by too much supply being built. The company was perhaps too loose with its cash. With the benefit of hindsight it overpaid for its U.S. shale assets and it frittered money away on failed attempts to take over a Canadian potash producer. It took a few years to realize the errors, and BHP dramatically shifted course when appointing Andrew Mackenzie as chief executive in May 2013, with his razor-like focus on driving down costs and pulling back from the deal-making beloved by his predecessor Marius Kloppers. BHP today still appears to be running very much along the lines Andrew Mackenzie set, namely a strong focus on cost-control and boosting efficiencies in order to generate strong cash flow. The problem is some investors want more, with activist shareholder group Elliott Management pushing for BHP to exit its U.S. petroleum business and focus more on giving returns to shareholders. The appointment of former packaging executive Ken MacKenzie as chairman can be chalked up as a victory for Elliot, given the hedge fund's demand for board renewal and new thinking. But how much should MacKenzie listen to shareholders such as Elliott, given they are most likely focused on maximizing returns on a fairly short-term basis, as opposed to longer-term investors such as pension funds that make up the bulk of BHP's shareholders. It's here where MacKenzie has to look at what kind of company BHP wants to be. If he chooses the Andrew Mackenzie model of trying to be the best at digging up and shipping various minerals, then BHP should focus on returning as much money as possible to shareholders as dividends, while making it explicit that those returns will be linked to the vagaries of commodity prices. On the other hand, BHP can try to run as leanly as possible while still aggressively seeking expansion opportunities using the cash generated from its existing operations. That sounds like the best path, but the problem is it seems that virtually every major mining company struggles to simultaneously be both a cutting-edge, growth-focused innovator and a cost-driven dividend play.

The regulator will loosen restrictions that limit how commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds invest in commodity futures, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said in a speech on Saturday that was released on the CSRC's website. Fang, who was speaking at a financial forum in Qingdao, did not give further details on the proposal. His comments underscore growing government backing for derivatives markets for commodities ranging from copper to oil to fruits in a bid to support the real economy, as Beijing ramps up regulation of equities markets and tries to tame its red-hot property market. However, any major push by wealth managers into the futures sector could also increase volatility in prices of raw materials, like iron ore, which have been whipsawed by speculative and institutional investors in recent years.  Commodities are indispensable resources for the industrial economy,  Fang said.  While securities and futures institutions had developed derivatives-based products for commodities, the overall size was still small, he said. Exchanges must continue to develop futures and options contracts to add to the 54 existing agricultural, metals, energy and financial products, while regulators will accelerate efforts to open up commodity markets to foreign investors, he said. To illustrate the vast size of China's personal wealth, Fang referred to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which showed assets held by individuals reached 1.2 trillion yuan ($176 billion) last year, behind only the United States. About 40 percent of that is in bank savings and wealth management, another 40 percent is in real estate, 10 percent in the stock market and another 10 percent in trusts and other products, the report showed.

The regulator will loosen restrictions that limit how commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds invest in commodity futures, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said in a speech on Saturday that was released on the CSRC's website. Fang, who was speaking at a financial forum in Qingdao, did not give further details on the proposal. His comments underscore growing government backing for derivatives markets for commodities ranging from copper to oil to fruits in a bid to support the real economy, as Beijing ramps up regulation of equities markets and tries to tame its red-hot property market. However, any major push by wealth managers into the futures sector could also increase volatility in prices of raw materials, like iron ore, which have been whipsawed by speculative and institutional investors in recent years.  Commodities are indispensable resources for the industrial economy,  Fang said.  While securities and futures institutions had developed derivatives-based products for commodities, the overall size was still small, he said. Exchanges must continue to develop futures and options contracts to add to the 54 existing agricultural, metals, energy and financial products, while regulators will accelerate efforts to open up commodity markets to foreign investors, he said. To illustrate the vast size of China's personal wealth, Fang referred to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which showed assets held by individuals reached 1.2 trillion yuan ($176 billion) last year, behind only the United States. About 40 percent of that is in bank savings and wealth management, another 40 percent is in real estate, 10 percent in the stock market and another 10 percent in trusts and other products, the report showed.

But even as the father-of-four endured poverty and isolation, the Muslim religious school, which doubles as a mosque, had remained a focal point of his community - until a month ago, when Buddhist nationalists raided it and forced authorities to shut it down on the grounds it did not have a permit to operate as a place of worship. When Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, started some three weeks ago, hundreds of residents braved the monsoon rain to join prayers organized in the street nearby. Local authorities banned the event and threatened those attending with jail.  I feel deeply sad, as if the sky has fallen down,  said Chit Tin, one of the few Muslims from the neighborhood who agreed to speak to Reuters. Most residents refused to discuss the restrictions, saying they feared repercussions. One of the youth members of the community, Moe Zaw, now faces a fine or six months in jail for not obtaining a permit to organize the prayers, according to a notification he received from a court. The closure of the religious school is among a series of incidents that have stoked religious tensions in the country's commercial capital in recent weeks. Although some of the Buddhist hardliners involved were arrested, human rights monitors say the incident shows how Aung San Suu Kyi's 14-month-old civilian administration is struggling to tackle discrimination against Muslims. Suu Kyi's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) did not field any Muslim candidates in the historic 2015 election that elevated it to power on pledges of modernizing the country and democratization. Tensions between the two communities have simmered since scores were killed and tens of thousands displaced in clashes between Buddhists and Muslims accompanying the start of the country's democratic transition in 2012 and 2013. A Muslim man prays after breaking fast in a mosque in Yangon June 7, 2017. Picture taken June 7, 2017.Soe Zeya Tun Mosques and madrassas that have been forcibly shuttered should be immediately re-opened, and religious believers should not be threatened or criminally charged simply for exercising their fundamental right to observe and practice their religion,  said Phil Robertson from watchdog Human Rights Watch. Local administrators refused repeated requests for comment. Myanmar's government spokesman was not available for comment, and two other government officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment. No Reply Slideshow (6 Images)The madrassa, opened nearly half a century ago, typically attracted around 1,000 people on Friday nights. Around 300 children between the ages of five and 12 studied Islam there daily. The two-story building is now cordoned off by barbed wire and the gate is locked.  The children were about to sit exams, so we feel it's a big loss for their education,  said Chit Tin, whose two 6-year-old grandchildren started classes at the madrassa a year ago. He now attends another mosque 20 minutes walk away, where the congregation has swelled from 5,000 to 8,000 in recent weeks due to the closure of his madrassa and another nearby that was also targeted by Buddhist nationalists. In the city of Meikhtila, 500 km (310 miles) north of Yangon in central Myanmar, three private homes that have been used by about 150 people for prayers since mosques in the city were destroyed in the 2013 violence were also ordered to close down by local administrators. The police has been patrolling the neighborhood since last week, checking whether the houses have stayed closed and whether the prayers have ceased during Ramadan.  Since the authorities don't allow us to pray anymore, we requested them to arrange a suitable place for us,  San Win Shein, an Islamic scholar and a secretary of a local inter-faith group told Reuters by telephone.  There is no reply until now.  Wrting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Alex Richardson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-muslims-idUSKBN19912R"},

Koepka won the U.S. Open by four shots, closing with a five-under 67 at Erin Hills to triumph with a record-tying 16-under total, reaching the pinnacle of a professional journey that began five years ago on Europe's secondary Challenge Tour. The long-hitting American traveled far and wide, from Kazakhstan to Kenya and mainland Europe, cramming into bed and breakfast rooms with fellow players, spending some nights sleeping in cars, and learning about life and how to win.  Going over to play the Challenge Tour was really, really cool, to get to travel the world at 22 and do what you do for a living is pretty neat,  he told reporters with the gleaming silver U.S. Open trophy by his side.  To go over there, I think it helped me grow up a little bit and really figure out that, hey, play golf, get it done, and then you can really take this somewhere. And I built a lot of confidence off of that.  Three quick wins in Spain, Italy and Scotland earned him automatic entry to the European Tour, where he won in Turkey in 2014. A tie for fourth at the U.S. Open that same year helped Koepka earn his U.S. PGA Tour card. The fast-moving Koepka captured the 2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open but despite often putting himself in contention, the wins did not continue to flow and from 21 top-10 finishes on the U.S.-based tour, he only had the one victory.  I'd won once on the PGA Tour, once on the European Tour. And I felt like I put myself in contention so many times,  Koepka said.  I felt like I just never fully came together.  Koepka said he found himself trying too hard to win.  I've been trying to win so badly. I felt like I've underachieved,  he said.  I just felt like I should be winning more... I just couldn't stand the fact that I'd only won once.  Fitness Regime His friends and professional support team preached patience and pleaded with him to focus less on obsessing about victories and avoid getting down on himself. Guided by power-hitting mentor and friend Dustin Johnson, Koepka dedicated himself to fitness.   I've worked my tail off over the last six months, made some changes, from grinding every day in the gym, trying to make sure that I was physically ready and strong enough to be able to swing the club the way I wanted to,  he said. This week he received pep talks from swing coach Claude Harmon III, master short game coach Pete Cowen and from world number one Johnson, last year's winner.  Dustin actually called me last night and told me the same thing, 'just stay patient. Just keep doing what you're doing, you're going to win the thing. Just don't get ahead of yourself',  the laconic Koepka added.  It was a long phone call for us, it was like two minutes.   It all came together this week for the talented Koepka, who said he practiced patience and it paid off. As did his globe-trotting apprenticeship as a pro.  I look at all these places I won. I just won in Japan in November,  he said about the Dunlop Phoenix event.  And to win on the European Tour in Turkey and (PGA Tour in) Phoenix. You look back at all the wins, even on the Challenge Tour. It's pretty cool. I'd love to get a map and just look at all the places I've won. It's pretty cool.

Hundreds - many in their teens - were arrested; some were beaten. Alexei Navalny, the organizer and now undisputed leader of street-level opposition, was sentenced to 30 days in prison.   These were the most widespread protests since Moscow put down the last lot in 2012 and passed tougher laws to stop them happening again. Since then, Russian President Vladimir Putin won another presidential election, invaded Crimea and saw his approval rating soar above 80 percent in spite of a falling Russian economy.  The difference from those marches of five years ago is that they are directed more precisely at Putin in particular and corruption in general. Navalny has taken aim at Russian leadership before. Last September he circulated a drone-shot video showing Prime Minister Medvedev’s vast, luxurious estate - allegedly a gift from an admiring oligarch. Medvedev’s approval ratings declined, but the allegations against the prime minister did not touch the president's command of public trust. Now, however, Navalny - still little known beyond Moscow - has seen that the metropolitan young want a more powerful and visible target for their disillusionment - one who bears ultimate responsibility for the state of Russia.  The Russian president doesn't get an 80 percent approval rating in the United States, but surprisingly his supporters extend beyond Donald Trump. A recent Gallup poll found that almost a quarter of Americans surveyed approved of the Russian president.  One of these supporters, much in the news this month, is the film director Oliver Stone. Stone’s four-part interview with Putin, shot over the past two years and airing in the United States this week, has been criticized for being a homage more than a questioning. Stone’s appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show caused the audience to erupt in laughter when, asked what most surprised him about Putin, the director told his host “I think (he’s) devoted to his country and I’m amazed at his calmness, his courtesy - he never really said anything bad about anybody and, I mean, he’s been through a lot. He’s been insulted and abused … abused by the press, in the media.”  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Tim Weiner: What Sessions didn't tell the Senate Peter Van Buren: Trump's silver lining in Iraq Riot police detain a man during an anti-corruption protest in central Moscow, June 12, 2017.Maxim ShemetovAmir Handjani: Inside Trump's Middle East mess Most reviewers of the lengthy interviews agree with Colbert in highlighting the softball nature of Stone’s questions - though the final interview did show a more inquiring side as Stone pushed Putin on the hacking, attributed to Moscow, of the Democratic National Committee’s emails before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It wasn't too forensic, but it seemed to make Putin uncomfortable.  It’s Stone who should be uncomfortable. A free and successful man in a democratic country with a strong civil society, he chose in his series to amplify Russian propaganda and to ignore the suppression of dissent, the choking of critical news media, the support for Ukraine secessionists trying to destabilize their country, Moscow’s enthusiastic efforts to win victory for the brutal regime of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the kleptocratic nature of the Russian regime, Moscow’s funding of populist-nationalist parties in the European Union and what a Forbes writer describes as Putin’s success in showing “every budding autocrat in the region and beyond, how to roll back human rights and freedoms with impunity.”  Director Oliver Stone poses as he arrives for the gala screening of the film  Snowden , during the 60th British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at Leicester Square in London, Britain October 15, 2016.Peter NichollsPutin was trained by the KGB, which he joined in 1975, to dissemble - to play a part. He emerged, or has developed, into a master actor. This week, he did one of his annual phone-ins, in which he described the demonstrations as “a provocation” by people who “only exploit problems.” He was calm, reassuring, even witty as he offered asylum to James Comey, the former FBI director fired by Trump over the investigation of Russia’s alleged election meddling. Putin also bragged about Russia’s minimal GDP growth after two years of recession.   It may be that Putin’s acting is no longer as convincing as it was. Russia, unlike China or Iran, does not possess a religious or secular ideology that legitimizes authoritarian rule. It has depended on growth, on the “return” of Russian-majority areas outside the borders, on - until three years ago - rising living standards and an end to major conflict in Chechnya, where Putin has sanctioned the brutal and anti-gay rule of the region's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.  Russia’s civil society is now more entrenched, more knowledgeable and more skeptical. It consists not of institutions like NGOs, but of a middle class that travels, goes online and talks without fear of the secret police. Many, especially the young, consider themselves European. Putin has granted enough freedom to keep that class quiescent. This week’s protests raise the question of whether that will continue.  In London this week, I stood behind two young Russian women in the metro, overhearing their excited conversation about a lecture they had attended about Britain and Europe.   I wondered whether this generation would see the questions which vex the West - the weakness of the European Union or the presidency of Donald Trump - as a sign of Western decadence. If they’d prefer the ordered universe the Russian media portrays, an order which has, among other freedoms, allowed them to travel and live abroad? Or would they see the many messy and politically fraught expressions of Western democratic societies, in which central issues are fought out in public, as preferable to the  tightly managed politics and severely constricted civil society they have back home?   Russia’s protesters, many with no direct experience of the Soviet Union, now face that choice. As, in a more existential way, does Vladimir Putin.

The 10-year cash JGB yield added half a basis point to 0.055 percent, while the September 10-year JGB futures contract finished down 0.01 point at 150.42. In the superlong zone, the 20-year JGB yield rose half a basis point to 0.565 percent, while the 30-year JGB yield was up one basis point at 0.815 percent. The Nikkei stock index ended up 0.6 percent. JGB yields also garnered some upward directional pressure from U.S. Treasury yields, which edged up on Monday as Asian equities firmed. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note was at 2.160 percent in afternoon Asian trading, up from its U.S. close of 2.157 percent on Friday. Economic data released early on Monday also undermined bond market sentiment. Japan's exports surged in May by the fastest in more than two years on higher shipments of cars and steel, an encouraging sign that robust global demand will help keep the country's modest economic recovery on track. The 14.9 percent annual increase in exports in May was below analysts' expectations of 16.1 percent, but was still the biggest rise since January 2015, and was nearly twice the pace seen in April. International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said on Monday that the Bank of Japan's new monetary policy framework was already showing some success by bringing down market volatility and stabilising the bond yield curve. On Friday, the BOJ held policy steady as widely expected, and also continued to state that it plans to increase its JGB holdings by about 80 trillion yen a year, even though the bank's actual pace has lagged that level for the past several months. Analysts expect the BOJ to slow its buying to around 60 trillion yen by year-end, and eventually omit the 80-trillion-yen pledge from its policy statement.

But now their resilience is being chipped away, says Adirak Sangnut, the slum's elected leader.  Before, it started flooding after raining for three days. But now, it floods after just three hours of rain,  the 47-year-old said.  After a while, if nothing is done, it'll be less than an hour before it starts flooding.  As Thailand's rainy season gets underway, residents in and around Bangkok say they are experiencing more intense and frequent seasonal floods since 2011, when the capital was hit by its worst flooding in half a century. That flood disaster - caused by factors including an unusually heavy monsoon, building on flood plains and changes in water management - affected millions of people and caused $45.7 billion in losses. Experts do not expect floods of that magnitude again any time soon but say the city's low-lying location, continued urbanization and extreme weather linked to climate change are raising Bangkok's vulnerability to floods.  The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is planning 28 flood protection projects worth nearly 26 billion baht ($765.6 million).  They include dredging and expanding canals, and constructing flood barriers and water retention areas to drain and divert floodwater to Thailand's main conduit, the Chao Phraya River.   The budget for four projects to build embankments along canals has already been approved, and an extra 2 billion baht from the military government is being used to carve out giant underground tunnels, said Vallop Suwandee, chairman of an advisory group to the Bangkok governor. The city also issued a resilience strategy earlier this year that includes improved weather forecasts and drainage systems.  Yet not everyone approves of the BMA's plans. Adirak says nearly half of his neighbours, who live near Don Muang airport, disagree with the canal works, fearing they will lose their homes.  Experts have criticized the plans for focusing too much on hard infrastructure solutions which they say are costly and will never be adequate. Barriers such as flood walls could trap rainwater, worsening flash floods, and create a two-tier system where some areas are protected at the expense of others, usually the urban poor and those in neighboring provinces, they add.  But Vallop said climate change makes it imperative for Bangkok to prepare.  It's necessary for Bangkok and Thailand to invest in infrastructure. If we do not do it now, the damage may cost a lot more in the future,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The city government has warned investors and home-owners whose properties are on major floodways - spillover channels for floodwater - but they have built there anyway, he added.  Deputy government spokesman Lieutenant-General Werachon Sukhondhapatipak said Bangkok lacks effective infrastructure to handle large-scale flooding.  Problems include inadequate town planning, construction blocking waterways and littering of drainage systems, he said by email.  Effective flood management requires genuine cooperation from all sides,  he added.  Uneven Exposure In the aftermath of the 2011 floods, the government unveiled a much-criticized $11-billion flood prevention plan, which was scrapped after the military coup of May 2014.  Despite Thailand's frequent cycle of floods and droughts, its approach to water management has always been piecemeal, said Nipon Poapongsakorn of the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).  Whenever a disaster hits, committees are set up, but they soon disappear, leaving no institutional memory. The absence of a single water agency and a national water law are other major challenges, he added.  In Siriwan Klai-iam's neighborhood of Bang Bua Thong market in Nonthaburi, a province to the north of Bangkok, flooding has become more common since 2011. Then water reached chest height, and her home and workplace were submerged for nearly three months.    It's happening every monsoon,  said the 39-year-old, pointing at the road outside that was flooded again in early June.  The government helps sometimes... but mostly after the floods.  Danny Marks, a researcher on urban climate resilience in Southeast Asia at the University of Toronto, said neighborhoods like Siriwan's could be adversely affected by the BMA's plans. The main government response has been to construct more and higher flood walls and other infrastructure rather than significantly improve water management, data collection and land-use planning, said Marks, whose doctoral thesis examined the authorities' handling of the 2011 floods.   Flood walls create uneven exposure to future flooding, he added, with urban economic areas protected while marginalized groups such as farmers, fishermen and rural communities are exposed to losses and damage.     The TDRI's Nipon said Bangkok needs to become a  sponge city  - a concept promoted by China where infrastructure, including pavements and green roofs, is designed to absorb water.  Rising Risks  When Bangkok became Thailand's capital in 1782, it was a backwater village crisscrossed by canals known as the  Venice of the East . But many were filled in to make way for cars, while squatter settlements have encroached on others.  With that, Bangkok lost much of its drainage capacity.   It's easier to fill canals instead of appropriating land, but now we are paying a very high price,  said Apichart Anukularmphai, president of the Thailand Water Resources Association.  Many also blame slum residents for throwing trash into the canals and blocking the waterways, calling for them to be evicted.  There are hundreds of such communities in Bangkok and they cannot all be dismantled, said Thipparat Noppaladarom, advisor to the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI), a government agency that upgrades slums.  CODI is currently working with residents along a major canal that is being expanded. They will be relocated to higher ground but still live in the same area - a  win-win  situation, said Thipparat.  The complexity of acquiring land for infrastructure projects is a familiar challenge to Thongchai Roachanakanan, an urban planning expert at the Department of Town and Country Planning and Public Works.  He designed a floodway after 2011, but almost all the governors he met rejected the plan because much of the land was owned by the rich and powerful.  Meanwhile, Bangkok is becoming more vulnerable each year, he added. Thongchai is particularly concerned about flood walls to the east of the ancient capital Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok. Built after 2011, these walls - some as high as 6 meters (19.7 ft) - could cause problems should a major storm hit central Thailand, he said. If that happens, the water could flow south fast, threatening Bangkok's two international airports, he warned.

The biggest Mexican oil refinery Salina Cruz has been offline since a fire broke out at the coastal facility on Wednesday following a tropical storm, the latest in a string of mishaps. Violent summer storms have visited Mexico for years, but the country has very little experience in deep water drilling, a risky activity still marked by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon well blow out in the northern Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people and pumped 5 million barrels of oil into the sea. That disaster prompted a rethink of safety measures in the United States. As a result, U.S. operators now have on permanent standby a so-called capping stack that ultimately sealed the well, while third-party inspectors verify deepwater project safety. Mexico, which awarded its first eight deepwater projects in a December auction, so far has none of these safeguards.  All these companies are going into Mexican deep waters naked with none of the protections set up on the U.S. side,  said George Baker, publisher of Mexico Energy Intelligence. Industry executives and regulators say there is still time to ensure adequate protections are in place. The first wells will be drilled as soon as 2019 and a second round of deep water blocks is due to be auctioned in December. Carlos de Regules, head of Mexico's oil safety regulator ASEA, said companies beginning deepwater operations, like France's Total and China National Offshore Oil Corporation , already have clear rules to follow.  The operators have to show they can react, contain and deal with the possibility of an out-of-control well,  he said. De Regules said ASEA aims to certify third-party inspectors in the next year, but noted it was up to companies whether they wanted to follow the U.S. capping stack model or create their own. Leaving it up to companies may not be enough, said Miriam Grunstein, a Mexico City-based oil regulation expert.  It's up to (ASEA) to make sure the industry does it,  she said. Alberto de la Fuente, president of the AMEXHI association of Mexican oil producers, said emergency response firms such as Oil Spill Response have entered Mexico, and the industry is examining its options.  I'm positive about what's been achieved, but we need to redouble our efforts,  he said.

Moon campaigned on a program of cutting South Korea's traditional reliance on coal and nuclear for the bulk of its power, but has not previously commented on the commitment to end nuclear power since being elected in early May.  We will end the nuclear-oriented power generation plan and pave the way for a nuclear-free era,  Moon said at an event marking the closure of the Kori No.1 nuclear reactor in Busan, some 300 kms (186 miles) southeast of Seoul.   We will withdraw existing plans to build new nuclear power plants and not extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants.  South Korea's oldest nuclear reactor Kori No.1 was permanently shut down at midnight on Sunday after reaching the end of its 40-year-lifespan, the first South Korean nuclear power plants to be closed permanently. South Korea has 25 nuclear reactors, supplying about a third of the country's total electricity. During his campaign, Moon vowed to review plans to add new eight nuclear reactors, including the part-completed Shin Kori No.5 and Kori No.6.  Moon said he will soon reach a consensus on the Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 reactors after fully considering their construction costs, safety and the potential costs of paying compensation. He also said the government will seek to shut down the country's second-oldest nuclear reactor, the Wolsong No.1, as soon as possible depending on the country's power supply conditions.  Public support for nuclear power has been undermined by a local scandal in 2010 over forged certificates for spare parts and the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in neighbouring Japan. South Korea is seeking to scale back reliance on nuclear, and Moon has said he will support renewables and liquefied natural gas sectors in a bid to boost clean and safe energy.  The new government plans to increase the use of renewables to 20 percent of the country's total power generation by 2030.

The 587-megawatt Kori No.1, located near the city of Busan some 300 kms (186 miles) southeast of Seoul, halted operations at midnight on Sunday after reaching the end of its 40-year-lifespan. It is the first South Korean nuclear plant to be closed permanently. Decommissioning of Kori No.1 will be carried out by South Korea companies using local technology and is expected to cost 644 billion won ($570 million) and take 15-and-a-half years, the energy ministry said in a statement. South Korea's nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co (KHNP) will draft a plan for the project by the first half of 2019 and submit it to the country's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission following a public hearing.  The KHNP will also seek a review of its plans by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Once approved, plant decommissioning will start from mid-2022. At the same time, spent nuclear fuel will be cooled for 6 to 7 years and then transferred by December 2025 to a yet-to-built dry storage facility able to store a total of 1,391 spent fuel bundles.  Complete dismantling of the plant and a decision on future uses of the site will be completed by December 2032.   South Korea last year unveiled a plan to pick a site for permanent storage of its high level radioactive waste by 2028. A permanent underground storage site for low-to-medium level radioactive waste opened in 2015.

Bogaerts produced his first career multi-homer game while left fielder Andrew Benintendi and catcher Christian Vazquez showcased the value of accurate throwing arms as the Boston Red Sox won the rubber match of their three-game set with the Houston Astros 6-5 on Sunday night at Minute Maid Park. Bogaerts finished 3-for-4 with four RBIs, doubling his season total for home runs to four by clubbing both blasts off Astros right-hander Joe Musgrove (4-6). His two-run shot in the sixth inning sparked a four-run frame, and he added an RBI single in the seventh that scored Mookie Betts with what proved to be the decisive run. That tally stood thanks to Benintendi and Vazquez, with Benintendi erasing Jose Altuve at the plate to preserve a one-run lead in the eighth before Vazquez threw out Derek Fisher to end the game as he tried to steal second.  Bogey offensively is the difference in this one but our ability to throw the baseball on the defensive side is what preserved this win tonight,  Farrell said. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at AstrosBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchWhile Boston (39-30) pulled into a tie atop the American League East with the New York Yankees, Houston dropped all three series on its nine-game homestand. The Astros (46-24) clubbed three home runs, including back-to-back blasts in the sixth inning off Boston starter David Price (2-1) and reliever Heath Hembree. While Carlos Correa, who hit his 13th homer, Jake Marisnick (eighth) and George Springer (19th) all went deep, Houston couldn't quite get over the hump, stranding 13 baserunners and finishing 3-for-15 with runners in scoring position.  You look up and down the order, we had tremendous amount of good at-bats,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  Maybe not at the right time when we needed it the most, but even some of those we didn't come through with runners in scoring position were pretty good at-bats. In small-margin games, this is going to be key.  Trailing 6-4 with Correa and Altuve on third and second, Carlos Beltran drove home Correa with a single to left-center. With Altuve darting home, Benintendi delivered a perfect toss to Vazquez, whose swipe tag nipped Altuve on the back. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel recorded his 20th save, aided by Vazquez nabbing the speedy Fisher as he attempted to get into scoring position for Springer. Price allowed three runs and eight hits in five-plus innings. But his ability to hunker down with traffic on the bases proved key to his earning the victory. The Astros managed three baserunners in the second inning and two more in the third but failed to score each time. It wasn't until Correa led off the fifth with his homer that Houston again capitalized on an opportunity.  The amount of runners I had in scoring position, on second and third base there in the first inning, first and third with one out to be able to get out of that with just one run (helped),  Price said.  And whatever other innings I had with runners in scoring position with two outs or less than two, to be able to limit those innings and not allow that big inning to happen was big.  Musgrove surrendered a jarring blast to Bogaerts to straightaway center in the first and three additional hits before he found a rhythm with nine consecutive batters retired. But Bogaerts struck again in the sixth, his shot to left representing the beginning of the end for Musgrove, who allowed six runs over 5 2/3 innings.  They're good hitters,  Musgrove said.  If I execute pitches better, the results going to be different I think. Kind of expect that with any team, if you give them cookies they're going to take advantage of it.  NOTES: Astros LHP Dallas Keuchel will begin a throwing program on Monday in Oakland by playing catch for the first time since landing on the 10-day disabled list on June 5 with neck discomfort. This is the second DL stint for Keuchel related to his neck. He will not pitch on the upcoming seven-game road trip through Oakland and Seattle. ... Red Sox LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, on the 10-day disabled list since June 2 with a right knee subluxation, completed a bullpen session without issue and will ramp up defensive work to continue re-establishing mobility. ... Astros RHP Collin McHugh will travel to Florida and begin extended spring training on Monday. McHugh has yet to pitch this season after arriving in West Palm Beach with right shoulder tendinitis and later developing a right elbow impingement in a subsequent rehab start.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED6JS25V4C"},

Brooks is a good friend of ours, and happy for him. Wish him well and congratulate him. I'll try to beat him the next time.

He followed that with a sizzling second-round 65 and a 71.  If I learned anything, you've got to put four good rounds together. I played two good rounds, but it wasn't enough,  Matsuyama said.

Hopefully though, in future majors I can play in the last or next to last group to give myself a better chance. But I'm happy with the way I played, and it gives me confidence going forward.  Harman led by one stroke going into the final round but took back-to-back bogeys from the 12th and finished with another bogey at 18 as he shot 72.  It bites a little bit right now,  the diminutive left-hander said after his first experience at being in contention at a major.  But Brooks played so well today.  I mean, you've got to tip your cap. He went and won the golf tournament on the back nine,  Harman said about Koepka, who clinched his victory with a run of three birdies in a row from the 14th.

The present share of under 52 percent compares to almost 56 percent in 1991, a pay cut that works out to A$70 billion  ($53.3 billion) a year, according to Reuters calculations. Wages are rising at the slowest pace on record and, at an annual 1.9 percent, slipped below the inflation rate early this year. With household debt already at all-time highs, many consumers are having to save less just to cover essentials. The savings rate is at a 10-year low. At the same time, business profits are taking the largest share of the income pot since 2011. If not reversed, the trend could end Australia's remarkable recession-free run. The A$1.7 trillion economy expanded at its slowest pace in eight years last quarter, with annual growth of 1.7 percent.  We think there has been a sustained step-down in the pace of consumer spending growth as households adjust to the new world order of very low wage growth amidst the confronting reality of high mortgage debt,  said ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett. While this is a global phenomenon, Australians now get a smaller share of the income pie than households in most advanced nations, according to Capital Economics.   It wasn't always this way, with Australian households being close to the top of the international ladder in 1975. But they may need to get used to life closer to the bottom,  said chief economist Paul Dales. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), Capital Economics says, the compensation of Australian employees is below the United States, France, Canada, the United Kingdom and even Japan. That might surprise Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who long has berated companies to pay more, with little success. Possible reasons behind Australia's decline include the usual suspects - technological change, globalization, the growth of financial markets and the waning of worker bargaining power. In 1991, around 40 percent of workers were in a union and now fewer than 15 percent are. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has confessed to being perplexed, noting wage growth was well below what would normally be associated with the current unemployment rate, a four-year trough of 5.5 percent. Old Arguments Upended More Australian policymakers have recognized the danger.  Some pick-up in the labor share of national income would be welcome,  RBA Governor Philip Lowe said on Monday.  It would make us all feel better.       The country's Fair Work Commission (FWC) this month upended years of parsimonious restraint and raised minimum wages by more than double what industry bodies lobbied for.  The move affects about 2.3 million employees, or 20 percent of the workforce, and was bitterly opposed by business groups who presented the classic neo-liberal argument that higher pay awards killed jobs. But a host of economic reports, especially a RAND Corp study of studies on the UK labor market, convinced the commission it had been  overly cautious  in past awards.  Moderate increases in minimum wages are seen everywhere to have very low or no negative employment impacts,  the commission concluded.  No new studies to the contrary were presented to the Panel for this Review.  Even the right-wing coalition government of Malcolm Turnbull has been sounding less dogmatic on the subject, if only because it realized slower pay growth meant less income tax revenue. In May, Treasurer Scott Morrison declared record low wage growth the economy's  biggest challenge . Yet change comes hard for a coalition that for decades lectured workers about the evils of high pay claims. In its submission to the fair work decision, the government argued economists  generally agreed  that  excessive  minimum wage rises would cut employment, but did not cite evidence to support the assertion. Morrison's budget predicted annual wage growth would almost double to 3.75 percent over the next four years, but included no policies encouraging such a dramatic turnaround.     Analysts say something bolder is needed to break the slow-wage cycle.  The most direct way of boosting consumer incomes and potentially spending is for the federal government to deliver personal tax cuts,  said Citi economist Paul Brennan. Boosting consumer spending by 1 percent would cost the budget around A$17 billion. To pay for that, Brennan recommended abandoning a proposed corporate tax cut, delaying a rise in defense spending and slapping a tax on sugary drinks.

Saudi-listed stocks that could benefit from the the MSCI upgrade have already been jovial include food producers Savola and  Almarai and some of the blue-chips lenders like National Commercial Bank and the largest petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries. The MSCI review will be announced on Tuesday. It is not unusual for stocks to rise ahead of such an event as investors try to buy stocks before foreign funds start to move money into the market once the decision has been made, but some analysts are cautious, saying that current market fundamentals are not very supportive.  While we believe that an inclusion in watchlist for Saudi will lead to enhanced market liquidity and generate more interest in the Saudi market, we caution investors to be wary of irrational exuberance as an inclusion is unlikely to change market fundamentals which currently remain tepid,  said a note by Saudi's Alrajhi Capital.

European stock markets were set for a strong start to the week, with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE 100 to open 0.6 percent higher, France's CAC 40 to be up 0.3 percent and Germany's DAX 0.2 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.6 percent. Australian shares added 0.3 percent and South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.4 percent. Chinese blue-chip shares advanced 0.8 percent on signs tight liquidity conditions were easing. Data showing home prices rose 10.4 percent in May from a year ago, although slowing from April's 10.7 percent gain, helped boost real estate stocks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.9 percent.  Generally, the environment still remains fairly positive for risk appetite,  said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore.  Now that the (Federal Reserve interest rate decision) is out of the way, the focus, for this region anyway, will remain on whether the economic environment will stay positive and the recovery will continue.  On Friday, Wall Street ended mixed, with energy names offsetting declines in consumer stocks, which were clobbered by Amazon.com's $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. The S&P; 500 index closed flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq lost 0.2 percent. Europe had a more upbeat session on Friday, with British , German and French stocks, as well as the broader STOXX Europe 600, closing higher. The British pound was flat at $1.2777 after a van rammed into worshippers as they were leaving a Finsbury Park mosque in North London early on Monday. Police said one man had been pronounced dead and 10 people were injured, in what Britain's largest Muslim organization said was a deliberate act of Islamophobia. The van driver has been arrested. British Prime Minister Theresa May said police confirmed the incident was being treated as a potential terrorist attack. Brexit Secretary David Davis starts negotiations in Brussels on Monday, which will be followed by a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday where May will encounter - but not negotiate with - fellow European Union leaders. Davis's agreement to Monday's agenda led some EU officials to believe that May's government may at last be coming around to Brussels' view of how negotiations should be run for Britain's exit from the EU. May's own immediate political survival is in doubt after she lost her parliamentary majority in an election. Projections showing a strong parliamentary majority for French President Emmanuel Macron following Sunday's vote, giving him a powerful mandate to push through pro-business reforms, lent support to the euro. The common currency was steady at $1.1195, retaining Friday's 0.5 percent gain. The dollar was little changed on Monday. On Friday, it fell after U.S. homebuilding dropped for a third month in May to the lowest in eight months and a barometer of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early June, prompting concerns about the Federal Reserve's plans to stick with its monetary policy tightening. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, was little changed at 97.182, failing to make up any of Friday's 0.3 percent loss. The market is awaiting comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, when he speaks at a business roundtable in New York state.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  My view is that Dudley won't sound too dovish, and thus allow the dollar's gradual rise to resume.  The greenback fared better against the Japanese yen , which remained weak after the Bank of Japan left its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged last week. The yen didn't respond to data on Monday showing Japanese exports rose at their fastest pace in May since January 2015. The dollar added 0.1 percent to 110.98 yen, after touching a two-week high on Friday. In commodities, oil futures lingered near six-week lows, as concerns about a supply glut amid faltering demand. U.S. crude slipped 0.35 percent to $44.58 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent dropped 0.3 percent to $47.21. Gold touched a 3-1/2-week low earlier in the session, and was trading down slightly at $1,252.70 an ounce at 0500 GMT.

The attack spurred an outpouring of grief and horror in a Muslim community that has been gathering to pray at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque about 30 miles outside Washington in observance of the last 10 days of Ramadan. The attack happened early on Sunday after the victim and several friends walking outside the mosque got into a dispute with a motorist in the community of Sterling, the Fairfax County Police Department said in a statement.  At one point, the motorist got out of his car and assaulted the girl, police said.  The teen was reported missing by her friends who scattered during the attack and could not find her afterwards, touching off an hours-long search by authorities in Fairfax and Loudoun counties.  At around 3 p.m., the remains of a female believed to be the teen victim were found in a pond in Sterling, police said. During the search for the missing teen, authorities stopped a motorist  driving suspiciously in the area  and arrested the driver, later identified as identified as Darwin Martinez Torres, 22. Police obtained a murder warrant that charges Torres for her death, the Fairfax County Police Department said. A police spokeswoman told reporters the attack followed some sort of dispute between the man and the girls, and authorities had not ruled out hate as a motivation for the attack. The number of anti-Muslim bias incidents in the United States jumped 57 percent in 2016 to 2,213, up from 1,409 in 2015, the Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group said in a report last month. While the group had been seeing a rise in anti-Muslim incidents prior to Donald Trump's stunning rise in last year's presidential primaries and November election victory, it said the acceleration in bias incidents was due in part to Trump's focus on militant Islamist groups and anti-immigrant rhetoric.  In an incident in London on Monday, a van ploughed into worshippers leaving a mosque, killing at least one person and injuring several in what Britain's largest Muslim organization said was a deliberate act of Islamophobia. Isra Chaker, a person who said in a Facebook post that she was close to a family friend of the victim in the Virginia incident, said the driver came out with a baseball bat and began swinging it at the girls, Chaker said.  She then went missing (presumably kidnapped/moved by the suspect) and was found dead this afternoon,  Chaker said. An online fundraiser for the girl's family had raised $61,606 by Sunday evening.

Norway's $900 billion sovereign wealth fund (SWF) -- itself financed by oil sales -- and the New Zealand Super Fund (NZSF) are among those adjusting investments in anticipation of tougher environmental rules or damage from the impact of global warming. Rising temperatures could lead to more violent storms and flooding, posing a threat to infrastructure and prime real estate, both favored by sovereign investors.  U.N. scientists say greenhouse gases are the main cause of warming and while the U.S. administration has questioned the science, many countries are introducing rules to cut emissions.  Norway's SWF, the world's largest, is divesting from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their turnover or activity from coal, a major source of greenhouse gases. It is also investing in alternative fuel companies such as NextEra Energy, a U.S. wind farm developer. By July the fund's ethics watchdog is likely to recommend the fund excludes or puts on a watch list the first of several firms in the oil, cement and steel industries. The fund is also pushing companies to disclose carbon emissions and plans to handle climate change risk.  In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, we are actually expecting companies to increase reporting on it,  the fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters.   We want to have more transparency on investment plans and how they are affected.  The NZSF said last year it would set a target by the end of June to reduce its carbon footprint.   We should be able to increase our returns for the same risk, or get the same returns with less risk,  Adrian Orr, chief executive of NZSF, said in November.  In an update, an NZSF spokeswoman said the fund was looking at its passive portfolio rules and this would lead to a reduction in fossil fuel holdings. More details would be given when the changes have been made, she said.   It has already invested in energy efficient glass manufacturer View and waste gas-to-fuel firm LanzaTech. France's SWF Caisse des Depots (CDC) is also aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of its equity portfolio by 20 percent by 2020, and is exiting companies that derive more than 20 percent of revenue from coal.   Coal is a 19th century energy, it is not the energy of the future,  said Joel Prohin, head of portfolio management at CDC. Counting the Cost Investors have committed to divesting some $5 trillion from fossil fuel companies, according to Arabella Advisors, with pension funds leading the way.  In June, Swedish pension fund, AP7 sold its investments in six energy-related companies it says violate the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and has pushed environmental risk up the agenda.  That is despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision last month to take the United States out of the agreement, which attracted international condemnation.  A 2016 study by the London School of Economics and others put value at risk at $2.5 trillion in a 'business as usual' emissions scenario of 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100.  If you believe climate change is happening and there's going to be a cost to that, do you pay that cost upfront as a preventative measure, or wait for the impacts to happen and then pay the bills?  said Alex Millar, head of EMEA sovereigns at Invesco.  One SWF official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was steering clear of Miami real estate given the risk of rising sea levels in the low lying area.   It's very likely that in 10 years' time the parking is going to be flooded,  he said.  A 2017 Invesco study of sovereign investors found climate change was the most important environmental, social and governance (ESG) issue for those that had already incorporated ESG factors into their investment process. Seventy percent of ESG adopters perceived an increase in long-term returns. But it also noted adoption of ESG practices was patchy, with some investors in the United States and emerging markets reluctant to commit without harder data on risks and returns.   Energy for Free The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) is exploring the investment implications of the global commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions and will report back to its members in September.  Funds that are primarily funded through fossil fuel production will feel an accelerated demand to diversify as quickly as possible,  said NZSF's Orr, who also chairs the IFSWF.  Even where fossil fuel divestment is not a priority, more investors want to capture the upside in the green economy. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested in renewable energy firms Greenko and ReNew Power while Singapore's GIC has targeted investments in electric vehicles.  Ithmar Capital, Morocco's strategic investment fund, wants to raise $1-2 billion from infrastructure specialists and other SWFs for its Africa-focused green infrastructure fund.   Africa is contributing the least to climate change, but it is suffering the most so it needs a specific action plan,  Tarik Senhaji, chief executive of Ithmar Capital, said. Mahmood Alkooheji, chief executive of Bahrain's SWF Mumtalakat, also described renewables as  the way forward .   We can't not be thinking of the environment,  he told Reuters.  For Bahrain it's a very promising area, we have sunshine 366 days in a year ... so that's a lot of energy being wasted. It's energy for free so why not invest in it?

The British pound was little changed at $1.2777. It hardly budged on news that a van ploughed into worshippers leaving a London mosque on Monday, killing at least one person and injuring several. Sterling has been through a turbulent month, sinking to a near two-month low of $1.2636 on June 9 on the British election shock, but rallying last week as the Bank of England came close to hiking rates after a split vote in its monetary policy committee. It is expected to remain vulnerable to bouts of volatility in coming months as negotiations proceed on Britain's divorce from European Union. Investors are focusing on the UK government's stance in the talks, after the ruling Conservative party's setback in this month's election deepened uncertainty over both Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans and her political future. The UK government may be open to making some concessions, and aim for a  soft  Brexit, said Tareck Horchani, head of sales trading Asia-Pacific, for Saxo Bank Group in Singapore.  At least for a while, I don't think the (Brexit) negotiations will be on the hard landing side,  he said, adding that sterling is likely to be well supported at $1.25. There is considerable uncertainty over the UK's stance on Brexit talks, however, and some analysts are cautious about sterling's near-term prospects.  While medium-term GBP appreciation is still likely, the tail risks of a no-deal or disorderly Brexit scenarios have increased, and should weigh on GBP,  wrote currency strategists at Barclays. The euro treaded water at $1.1194 after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. The common currency showed little reaction to French President Emmanuel Macron winning a commanding majority in his country's parliamentary election on Sunday, according to official figures and pollster projections. Analysts said polls had favoured Macron and that his victory had been mostly factored in. With concerns about euro zone political risks having receded after Macron was elected as France's president in May, the euro is likely to hold firm in the coming months, said Peter Chia, FX strategist for United Overseas Bank (UOB) in Singapore.  Our bias is for euro currency to eventually benefit from inflows. I think investors are under-invested for that region for the longest time,  he said. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basked of six major rivals, held steady at 97.172. The index had climbed to a two-week high of 97.560 late the previous week after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017. But its rally was tempered by Friday's weaker-than-expected housing and consumer sentiment data. The market is looking to comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, who is due to take part in a roundtable with local business leaders on Monday.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  My view is that Dudley won't sound too dovish, and thus allow the dollar's gradual rise to resume.  Against the yen, the dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 110.95 yen.

Firm price gains highlight the challenge Chinese authorities face in calming a frothy market without disrupting the economy, in which real estate is a major driver of growth.    Economists say the pace of price growth across different market tiers clearly shows a passing of the baton from the centre to the regions. They also fret over still-rising prices against an already high base, saying upward price pressure remains.  While a moderation in price growth in first- and second-tier cities shows the curbs had some effects, we must note that prices are still rising with new unit prices at record high levels,  said Sam Xie, head of research at property services provider CBRE China.     We expect more cities to impose curbs in the future.  Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.7 percent in May from the previous month, in line with April and remaining the quickest gain since October, Reuters calculated from an official survey out on Monday. Compared with a year ago, new home prices rose 10.4 percent in May, easing from a 10.7 percent gain in April, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. Policymakers have prioritised stabilising an overheated market ahead of a Communist Party reshuffle later this year, reiterating the need to avoid dramatic price volatility that could threaten the financial system and harm social stability.  The housing bureau in Guangdong province's Qingyuan city  said last week prices for pre-sold new units must be sold at no more than 5 percent higher or no more than 15 percent lower than in similar projects in the area in the past month, effectively setting a price cap and floor to stabilise the market.   The NBS said price growth for new homes in China's 15 most overheated cities - mainly provincial capitals with the most stringent curbs - has remained  basically stable  from the previous month as city-based control measures continued to take effect. Prices for new homes in China's biggest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai stopped climbing in May on a monthly basis, while prices fell 0.6 percent in Shenzhen, the fastest seen in three months.  Compared to a year ago, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen prices still grew 13.5 percent, 11 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.  The actions of authorities, who also stressed the need to actively push for inventory destocking in smaller cities experiencing a housing glut, have spread investor activity more broadly rather than halting it outright.  Investors, banned from the hottest markets, are increasingly looking inland, driving up prices in more remote, smaller cities with fewer buying restrictions, leading to a surprise pick-up in May sales.   For example, Bengbu, a mid-sized city in central China's  Anhui province, topped the list in May, with prices of new units rising 3.4 percent on-month, compared to a 2.2 percent gain in April.   Price growth in smaller third-tier cities rose to 0.9 percent in May from April's 0.8 percent, CBRE's Xie said. The Statistics Bureau does not release price index data by market tiers. Central bank data published last Wednesday showed Chinese banks extended more credit than expected in May, with home loans expanding even as policymakers struggled to rein in riskier borrowing without impeding economic growth. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 610.6 billion yuan in May from 571 billion yuan in April, accounting for 55 percent of total new loans last month, up from 52 percent in April, the data showed. But analysts say new tightening measures introduced since mid-March have started taking some heat out of the market, and property investment is likely to have peaked following a sharp drop in sales because of such curbs. Indeed, annual growth in China's real estate investment slowed in May, the first fall-off in three months, taking a toll on new developments. New construction starts almost halved from the previous month, official data showed last Wednesday.

In the past few days, the softly spoken Hammond, whose future as Chancellor seemed to hang in the balance before May lost her Conservative party's majority in this month's vote, has made clear the silence he kept during the campaign had ended. Many in business, concerned that former interior minister May will prioritize controlling immigration over preferential access to the European Union's lucrative single market, hope an emboldened Hammond will mean their voices are listened to. A representative of a leading business group said access to government was improving.  It's early days still, but we've had more access in the last week to government quite broadly than we did in the previous four or five months.  Hammond was kept out of the Conservatives' election campaign after a backlash over his plan to raise taxes on entrepreneurs. The imminent sacking of a man nicknamed  the undertaker  for his dry manner was openly discussed in the ruling party. But he was reappointed after the vote and appeared on several political talk shows on Sunday. When one interviewer asked if he had been locked in a cupboard during the campaign by May's aides, he said with a smirk:  Not quite in a cupboard.  His anger was evident in his criticism of his party for having not focused more on the economy, which has performed more strongly than predicted in the year since Britons voted by a narrow majority to leave the European Union.  I would have liked to have highlighted our economic record, and I think if we had focused on that we probably would have done better in the election than we did,  Hammond told the BBC, echoing earlier comments to Reuters. Such criticism would have been unthinkable before the June 8 election, in which the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn capitalized on its opposition to austerity cuts, leaving May scrambling to shore up a minority government. Hammond has no direct part in Brexit talks which begin in Brussels on Monday but his new confidence means he is likely to press May and other ministers to prioritize the economy in the complicated negotiations for Britain's EU departure.  I'm sure business will get a better hearing,  a Conservative Party source said on condition of anonymity, while playing down any idea that Hammond might radically change the party's Brexit stance. Control That source, and another in the Conservative party, said May's misjudged election gamble had undermined her authority, leaving her in the thrall of the two wings of her party that have differing views for Brexit -  purists  who want a clean break and  remainers  pressing for close ties. So far she has balanced the two by having ministers from both wings in her top team or cabinet, and by carefully controlling any message on her approach to Brexit, fearful she could give away her hand to EU negotiators. Hammond is the first of her ministers to break rank. In Luxembourg last week for a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers, Hammond underlined that he wanted both the EU and Britain to take a  pragmatic  approach to the talks.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward,  he said. But on Sunday, he also backed up May's approach, saying Britain would leave the single market and the customs union that sets external tariffs for goods imported into the bloc.  The question is not whether we are leaving the customs union, the question is what do we put in its place in order to deliver the objectives which the prime minister set out,  he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.  Huge Evolution  May has said she is open to some kind of association agreement with the customs union and wants to avoid any so-called 'cliff-edge' into uncertain trading conditions, but she has also said Britain must be able to control immigration - something it cannot do while a member of the EU. What concerned companies most was May's threat to walk away from the talks if they did not go her way - a pledge made to reassure eurosceptics in her party that she would not crumble. Hammond may go some way to soften that and could find an unlikely ally in Brexit minister David Davis, whose earlier criticism of businesses for hiring foreigners has also troubled companies.  (Davis) has shown a  huge evolution ,  a Western diplomat said, adding that the Brexit minister seemed to be well on top of his brief. For now, both men, and the rest of the Conservative party, appear to be backing May, despite media speculation that rivals were lining up to take her place. Asked how long the prime minister would remain in office, Hammond dodged the question.  Theresa is leading the government and I think the government needs to get on with the job,  he said.

On Thursday, the Fed is scheduled to begin releasing results from its two-part annual stress test, which was adopted in response to the financial crisis, to gauge banks' ability to weather an economic storm that could threaten the stability of the system. The results will be the first since Republican President Donald Trump took office. Trump has not yet made any appointments to the Fed, but Republicans have turned up pressure on the central bank to cut red tape and ease regulations. Wall Street analysts said they will be parsing language the Fed uses in presenting the results for any signs that its approach is starting to soften. Analysts say they do not expect the Fed to announce any explicit changes to the stress test, but they do expect higher payouts. According to their estimates, the Fed could allow banks to distribute nearly as much capital to shareholders over the next year as they generate in profits, a benchmark not hit since before the 2008 crisis. Higher payouts  would be significant from a signaling standpoint  that regulators are easing up on capital requirements, said Steven Chubak, a bank analyst at Nomura Instinet.  That is a key part of the value case for a lot of these stocks.  Banks going through the stress tests have roughly $150 billion more capital than they need, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck estimates. She expects the typical big bank to be allowed to increase stock buybacks by 27 percent and dividends by 8 percent, for a combined capital payout of 95 percent of annual earnings, up from 84 percent last year. The Fed first conducted stress tests in 2009 as a way to boost confidence in the financial system. Congress codified the test into law the following year as part of a broader financial reform package, and the Fed came to see it as an important tool to ensure that banks not only maintain enough capital to withstand economic storms, but also run their businesses in ways that avoid operational calamities. However, bankers complain that stress tests have morphed into an overly complex and time-consuming process that occurs in the secrecy of a black box. They have pleaded for more details about models the Fed uses to conduct the numeric part of the tests, and more clarity on a qualitative component that judges factors like risk management. The Fed has been making some changes to enhance transparency, but officials say that revealing too much would allow lenders to game the exams.  We are concerned that releasing all details on the models would give banks an incentive to adjust their business practices in ways that change the results of the stress test without changing the risks faced by the firms,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress in a letter on Friday.  The result could be less effective stress tests.  Thursday's results, known as DFAST, will show how much capital the biggest banks would have after an imagined crisis. Shortly after the Fed posts its numbers, big banks tend to disclose results under their own models. Banks can compare the scoring and then scale back and resubmit their capital plans to improve their chances of a passing grade. On June 28, the Fed will announce whether it has approved the plans in a further examination known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. The Fed has been under pressure for some time to simplify the stress tests, and changes are widely expected under Trump. A proposed financial regulatory overhaul ordered by Trump and released by the Treasury Department last week included easing stress tests. Trump is also expected to name as many as five new officials to the Fed's seven-member governing board over the next two years. Although Wall Street is upbeat about the idea of lighter regulations and higher payouts, regulatory experts are less sure that the Fed will unleash bank balance sheets overnight. It takes time for large institutions like the Fed to shift, even after top officials and regulatory mandates change, they said.  It should change over time,  said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.  Markedly? That's tougher to determine.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States. If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors. This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale. Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil. Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.   It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.  The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',  said Kuhach.  It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk.   Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy (SU.TO) at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.  Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil (IMO.TO), controlled by ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said. The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital. The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in. Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.     The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Statoil ASA (STL.OL) from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.     Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO), which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially. Dating and Marriage The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure. Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail. Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy (NBL.N) and Devon Energy (DVN.N) and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment. Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.  Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,  he said.  The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money.   Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later. The company is supported by GE's (GE.N) Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada. Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.  At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,  Reed said.  But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial.    Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions. 'Incremental Gains' Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd. Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices CLc1 of around $45 a barrel. Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more. The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D;), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.  It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,  Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate. Suncor and Imperial both held R&D; spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls  step-change technologies , while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed. The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D; budgets. A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations. Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.  Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance. Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in  technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.  I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,  he said.  Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home.

Banks can compare the scoring and then scale back and resubmit their capital plans to improve their chances of a passing grade. On June 28, the Fed will announce whether it has approved the plans in a further examination known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. The Fed has been under pressure for some time to simplify the stress tests, and changes are widely expected under Trump. A proposed financial regulatory overhaul ordered by Trump and released by the Treasury Department last week included easing stress tests. Trump is also expected to name as many as five new officials to the Fed's seven-member governing board over the next two years. Although Wall Street is upbeat about the idea of lighter regulations and higher payouts, regulatory experts are less sure that the Fed will unleash bank balance sheets overnight. It takes time for large institutions like the Fed to shift, even after top officials and regulatory mandates change, they said.  It should change over time,  said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.  Markedly? That's tougher to determine.

Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index has risen 24 percent year-to-date and has more than doubled from its January 2016 low. Some fund managers believe the expected MSCI upgrade has been largely behind the surge.  The underlying story on the macro front is hardly compelling,  said Tina Byles Williams, founder and chief executive of asset manager FIS Group.  So if you take out the euphoria around the MSCI inclusion there's not much there. Once it happens the bourse tends to go nowhere.  Argentina's economy has been slow to reap the expected gains from President Mauricio Macri's reversal of currency controls, relaxation of capital holding requirements and other market deregulation. Inflation has slowed but remains at 24 percent year on year, outstripping a government target of 17 percent. GDP is expected to grow to 2.8 percent after contracting in 2016, but that is still short of the government's 3.5 percent forecast. Another risk is that MSCI declines to add Argentina altogether, said Chuck Knudsen, emerging markets equity portfolio specialist at T Rowe Price.  Then you could see the market selling off,  he said. While Knudsen said the probability of Argentina being added to the index was only slightly more than even, other investors and analysts said they viewed the move as a near certainty. FIS Group's Williams sold out of her positions in Argentina entirely last month. She has history on her side. Data shows countries upgraded from frontier to emerging markets tend to follow the classic  buy the rumor, sell the fact  pattern. But the  news  seems to come once the markets are incorporated into the index, which tends to happen a year after the announcement. This pattern was seen most recently when Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were upgraded. From June 2013, when the reclassification was announced, to May 2014, when the UAE's stocks were included in the emerging markets index, Abu Dhabi's benchmark stock exchange rose 38.9 percent. Qatar's general stock index rose 42.8 percent during the equivalent period. In the year leading up to the announcement of inclusion, Abu Dhabi gained 49.1 percent while Qatar rose 14.9 percent, according to Reuters data. Both indexes have performed poorly since their stocks were included in the index. Qatari stocks have fallen 28.6 percent since their May 2014 peak and the Abu Dhabi exchange has slumped 14.3 percent over the same period. Still, some fund managers and analysts say Argentina has a more compelling growth story than previous countries, given its return to international credit markets after a 15-year absence last year following a settlement with holdout creditors and Macri's reforms.  An upgrade of Argentina to EM status is the result of a much longer-term tailwind created by the increasing openness of their capital markets,  said Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X Funds.  We believe this openness will stimulate greater foreign investment in much needed areas like infrastructure and create a more competitive business environment, both of which we believe will continue to promote strong growth over the long term.

The CSI300 index rose 1.0 percent to 3,552.05 points by the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 3,143.77. Traders said liquidity conditions improved as the central bank continued to provide funds via open market operations, after injecting a net 410 billion yuan into money markets last week, the biggest weekly injection since mid-January. Liquidity typically tightens in China's financial system in June due to tax payments and as banks look to make their books look better for the end of the month and quarter. But the seasonal pinch has been compounded this year by a regulatory clampdown on riskier forms of financing which has been banks hoarding more cash than usual. Still, authorities appear to have paused their campaign in recent weeks, possibly due to concerns over liquidity or perhaps an indication that they are assessing earlier policy steps to see if they are starting to slow the real economy, as many analysts predict.  Liquidity conditions have eased as the government has recently decreased its focus on tightening financial regulations,  UBS Securities wrote in a report. Expectations of fewer new listings also supported Chinese stocks on Monday, particularly small-caps whose valuations had been pressured by worries of more equity supply. China's securities regulator approved six initial public offerings (IPOs) that aimed to raise a combined total of up to 3.4 billion yuan ($499.22 million). It was the fourth straight week that the pace had slowed down from an average of around 10 IPOs in the past months. Chinese investors are also awaiting a decision by U.S. index provider MSCI, which will decide on June 20 whether to include A shares in its Emerging Market Index. The stock regulator said it would be happy for MSCI index inclusion, but Chinese capital market reform will not be derailed without the inclusion.  The inclusion could bring about 60.7 billion yuan into the (A-share) market, but the impact would be limited if the inclusion does not happen,  Haitong Securities wrote. Sectors rallied across the board, led by financial and consumer stocks. Real estate stocks gained 0.7 percent, after data showed China's month-on-month home price growth remained robust in May, rising 0.7 percent nationwide despite a string of cooling measures across the country. Still, monthly price rises largely stalled in the country's biggest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Hong Kong stocks follow other Asian markets higher, shaking off Wall Street's uninspiring performance on Friday. The Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent to 25,868.02 points.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was up 0.3 percent, or 15.27 points, to 5,789.30 by 0431 GMT. The index ended 0.2 percent higher on Friday. The benchmark index is on track to record its sixth gaining session out of seven. The financials index rose as much as 1.1 percent with the  Big Four  banks gaining between 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent. Investors were responding to the acknowledgement by Australia's five biggest lenders that they would be able to pay a new annual levy of about A$4.6 billion without disrupting the financial system or being driven offshore, although they had lobbied hard against the proposed charge. The desire for high dividend yields - which are a feature of Australian banking stocks - was a driving factor in financial sector buying on Monday, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Sentiment was also boosted by comments from central bank governor Philip Lowe, who said Australia's economy was likely to grow a bit faster over the next couple of years. Packaging company Amcor Ltd rose 1.2 percent, hitting a one-year high, although consumer staples fell with Woolworths Limited shedding 3.9 percent. Energy stocks declined. Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd lost 0.9 percent to its lowest in more than six months. Oil prices reversed Friday's gains following a steady rise in U.S. production, undermining OPEC's efforts to curb production in order to tighten supplies.

The Colorado Rockies had one run home with runners at the corners and one out when Arenado stepped in against San Francisco Giants closer Mark Melancon.  Honestly, I was just trying to get the ball to the outfield,  Arenado said.  I'm not going to let my ego get in the way here. We got to win the ballgame.  The Rockies did that in stunning fashion when Arenado hit a first-pitch, three-run homer to win 7-5 and sweep a four-game series from the Giants for the first time. Arenado is the eighth player in Rockies history to hit for the cycle and first since Michael Cuddyer on Aug. 17, 2014, against Cincinnati. Arenado is the fifth player in major league history to hit a walk-off homer to complete the cycle and first since teammate Carlos Gonzalez did it July 31, 2010, against the Chicago Cubs. It was the first cycle for Arenado, who tripled in the first, singled in the fourth and doubled in the sixth before hitting his 15th home run. It was his first homer since June 3 and first at Coors Field since May 14. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at RockiesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch I back-spinned it,  Arenado said.  That's my whole goal is to backspin the baseball. Thank God it went out. I was a little nervous, because I saw (left fielder Austin Slater) go back and I hadn't hit a homer in awhile.  The Giants had scored three runs in the ninth to take a 5-3 lead against Jake McGee, who was pitching because closer Greg Holland was unavailable. Hunter Pence hit a two-run homer, No. 211 in his career and his first as a pinch hitter, and Brandon Crawford, whose two-run homer gave the Giants a 2-0 lead in the fifth, doubled home a run before Carlos Estevez (4-0), recalled Sunday from Triple-A Albuquerque, struck out Buster Posey to end the inning. Melancon, who signed a four-year, $62 million contract with the Giants as a free agent in December, retired pinch-hitter Tony Wolters on a ground out to open the inning. But Raimel Tapia singled, as did Charlie Blackmon, sending Tapia to third. DJ LeMahieu drove in Tapia with a single, putting runners on the corners for Arenado. Arenado said the sell-out crowd of 48,341 at Coors Field was  the loudest I've ever heard in this place.  Before he drove Melancon's first-pitch cutter into the left-field stands, Arenado had a moment of reflection.  I just literally said like a little prayer,  Arenado said. 'I was like, 'Calm down. Give me the strength to slow this game down.' I want to be up in that situation. I feel confident. I'm not afraid in those situations. You fail a lot in this game, and I just wanted that last at-bat. Thank God it worked out.  The win was the fifth straight and 12th in 15 games for the Rockies (46-26), who remained one game ahead of Arizona and Los Angeles in the National League West. The Rockies are 10-1 against the Giants this season and have beaten them nine straight times, a franchise-record winning streak against any NL West opponent. The Giants (26-45) have lost six straight and 15 of their past 19 games to fall a season-high 19 games below .500. Melancon pitched for the first time in 10 days but said the layoff had no effect.  They were making contact,  said Melancon (1-2), who has a 5.09 ERA in 19 games.  I don't think it was good contact. Arenado's was, obviously. I wanted to surprise him in and go from there. I was hoping to get a ground ball to short. My performance has been absolutely terrible. Yeah. I need to be better.  Giants starter Ty Blach, a Denver native, pitched 6 2/3 innings in his first start at Coors Field, where he made his major league debut in September. He gave up a run in the sixth when LeMahieu drew a leadoff walk and Arenado followed with a double. The Rockies went ahead 3-2 in the sixth when Trevor Story hit his 10th homer, and Pat Valaika hit his first career pinch-hit homer and his fifth of the season. He's 7-for-21 with four RBIs as a pinch hitter. After putting their leadoff batter on base without scoring in the first four innings, San Francisco finally broke through against Tyler Chatwood in the fifth when Denard Span walked for the third straight time and Crawford hit an opposite-field home run down the left-field line with two outs. The homer gave the Giants a 2-0 lead. And they pulled ahead 5-3 in the ninth before Arenado's blast resulted in a disheartening defeat. San Francisco lost two games by two runs and another by one in this series.  It's a shame, the way they're fighting here, and they couldn't come away with a win,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  This, really, was as tough a one as we've had.  NOTES: Rockies RHP Carlos Estevez was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque and struck out the one batter he faced in the ninth. ...
