Thirty-eight more of these man-made wildlife crossings allow all manner of critters to take a safe route over or under the stretch of highway between Evaro and Polson, 56 miles to the north.But do the crossings, the last of which was completed in 2010, work? Cameras in 29 of the structures show almost 23,000 crossings in 2015, about double the number from five years earlier, according to data compiled by the Western Transportation Institute, a research arm of Montana State University in Bozeman. Even more intriguing, scientists found through scenes caught on camera that some animals\u2014deer and bear among them\u2014were teaching their young to use the crossings.As significant, a November 2016 Western Transportation Institute report based on five years of animal-vehicle collision data showed that roadkill numbers for large wild mammals fell 80% along sections of the highway served by three of the more prominent crossings, while such deaths increased along sections with no structures.Crossings, especially when combined with miles-long fences that steer animals toward them, \u201ccan substantially reduce collisions,\u201d says       Marcel Huijser,        a Western Transportation Institute road ecologist and the report\u2019s lead author.Something of a novelty in the U.S. a decade ago, wildlife crossings are proliferating all across North America and are increasingly being built into the design of new highway projects where vehicle and wildlife crashes are a major threat. Last fall, Washington state\u2019s Transportation Department began putting up two sweeping, 66-foot wide arches that will form the backbone of the Keechelus Lake Wildlife Overcrossing, one of more than 30 crossings that will be built into a multiyear makeover of a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 east of Snoqualmie Pass.Safety\u2014for both animals and humans\u2014is the main driver in crossings growth in the U.S. Collisions between wildlife and vehicles have risen 50% in the past 15 years, and such accidents now cost Americans $8 billion annually in damages and cleanup costs, according to research by ARC Solutions, a coalition of conservationists, ecologists, engineers and planners that advocates for crossing construction.About 200 people a year die and 29,000 are hurt in wildlife-vehicle crashes in the U.S., according to data published by Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group. For animals, it\u2019s a slaughterhouse: There may be as many as 1.5 million wildlife-vehicle collisions a year\u2014and the animals almost always die, the group says.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be acclimating to roadkill,\u201d says Nina-Marie Lister, a landscape ecologist and ARC adviser who teaches at Ryerson University in Toronto. Crossings, she says, are a solution to a \u201cproblem that we all own but no single government agency is in charge of solving.\u201dAwareness of both roadkill data and the effectiveness of crossings is growing. \u201cIt\u2019s a values shift, like seat belts. Nobody had them when I was growing up but these days everyone wears them,\u201d says       Jeremy Guth,        an ARC founder and a trustee of the Woodcock Foundation, which works on land-conservation issues.Also driving growth in crossings is conservation, or the notion of using them to reconnect wildlife habitats fragmented by roads and bridges. The Trappers Point Wildlife Crossing over U.S. 191 near Pinedale, Wyo., completed in 2012, diverts thousands of mule deer and pronghorns over the highway as they seek passage to the spring and fall pastures they\u2019ve used for millennia.In Southern California, environmentalists are seeking to help raise an estimated $55 million to build the Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing over Highway 101 in Agoura Hills, 35 miles west of Los Angeles. The project\u2019s main goal is to provide safe passage over the 10-lane freeway for mountain lions in the surrounding Santa Monica Mountains whose population has dwindled because of suburban sprawl and habitat fragmentation. Among them is the solitary young lion known as P-22 that has settled in Los Angeles\u2019s 4,310-acre Griffith Park after somehow safely crossing both the 405 and 101 freeways from mountains to the east.\u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to raise every bit of the money we need because P-22 is such a great story,\u201d says       Beth Pratt,        California director of the National Wildlife Federation, which is seeking to raise $10 million this year to help fund the engineering and design portion of the project. \u201cWe have a lonely bachelor lion living in L.A., cut off from a potential mate. The crossing is his chance for happiness.\u201dMr. Guth, meanwhile, says he was recently invited to St.       Mary Parish,        La., to consult with wildlife officials seeking to save an indigenous population of black bears that are essentially stranded in the Atchafalaya Basin, America\u2019s largest contiguous hardwood swamp. Cut off from upland populations by highways, the bears have begun to inbreed, and their only hope of long-term survival may be crossings that connect them to upland populations, he says.\u201cThe old model of conservation\u2014acquire large islands of habitat for wildlife and check the box, done\u2014well, we know that alone doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d says Ms. Pratt. \u201cWe have to look at large landscape corridors for all wildlife.\u201dThe challenge in building crossings isn\u2019t simply where to put them but also in their design. To encourage animals to use them, Ms. Lister says, the goal is to fold them seamlessly into the natural landscape.For people , the aim is no longer just utilitarian\u2014an afterthought of road construction\u2014but something more aesthetically pleasing.The I-90 Keechelus Lake crossing is the product of an intensive collaboration of wildlife scientists at Central Washington University and engineers, architects and planners from the Washington state Transportation Department and the U.S. Forest Service. The idea was to build a structure that animals more or less see as a path through the woods, yet one whose sweeping arches will become something of a landmark for the 27,000 motorists who travel that section of the freeway every day.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason,\u201d says Ms. Lister, \u201cthat they can\u2019t be pretty, even iconic.\u201dMr. Wells is a writer in Chicago.

But in the future, it may be akin to owning a horse today\u2014a rare luxury.Ride sharing as we know it will grow in popularity as people get even more comfortable with the sharing economy, and more people migrate to dense cities where owning a car is a burden. One-quarter of miles driven in the U.S. may be through shared, self-driving vehicles by 2030, according to an estimate by Boston Consulting Group.And the business of ride sharing may take on some new forms.Startups such as Los Angeles-based Faraday Future envision selling subscriptions to a vehicle\u2014for instance, allowing people to use it for a certain number of hours a day, on a regular schedule for a fixed price. So, people who need a vehicle for a few hours daily to attend meetings or make deliveries could subscribe and avoid having to summon on-demand rides every day (and potentially paying a lot more).Other companies are experimenting with the idea of allowing drivers to access more than just one kind of vehicle through a subscription\u2014so, a driver might choose a compact model one day but a minivan another day if she needed more passenger space.\u201cBy 2022, 2023, the majority of transportation in urban cities with temperate weather will be on demand, shared and likely autonomous,\u201d says       Aarjav Trivedi,        chief executive of Ridecell, a San Francisco company that provides the back-end software for car sharing.Even people who do end up buying a car may come to see it as a short-term arrangement\u2014and a source of income.Chief Executive       Elon Musk       has hinted that he\u2019s preparing to create a network of Tesla owners that could rent out their self-driving cars to make money. Already, some drivers are testing this idea using other services that let them market their cars, something like Airbnb rentals on wheels.Take       Jeff Cohen,        who works for an electric-vehicle-charging company. His wife balked at his desire to buy the Model S sedan, which             Tesla Inc.       typically sells for about $100,000.He persuaded her to allow him to buy a Tesla if he would in turn rent it out on a site called Turo. Doing so\u2014at $189 a day\u2014almost covered the cost of the entire monthly loan payment while giving him the ability to drive the electric car around Atlanta when not in service, he says. \u201cIt allowed me to get the car,\u201d says Mr. Cohen, 58 years old. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in agreement that we could get a car like this without some way to fund it.\u201dTuro, which had more than three million people sign up for the service through the end of May, says Teslas, along with BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars are among the more popular searched vehicles on the site.\u201cA lot of people are realizing that the car is no longer just a cost\u2014it\u2019s an asset,\u201d says       Andre Haddad,        Turo\u2019s chief executive.Of course, the biggest obstacle to many of the changes may be the most simple: People have to be willing to give up the idea of owning their car\u2014something that has been culturally ingrained over many decades.What\u2019s more, under this vision, car buyers won\u2019t just give up the idea of sole ownership. They may also give up the idea of sitting behind the wheel by using autonomous vehicles.They will have a powerful incentive to do so. A study by Deloitte Consulting, for example, estimates that the cost of personal car ownership is on average 97 cents a mile today but could drop by two-thirds in a world of shared, self-driving vehicles\u2014a tipping point that could usher the technology into daily life for many people. In cities, the idea will be even more appealing, because it takes away the unpleasant sides of ownership, such as parking and negotiating traffic jams.Companies are already looking at how to market vehicles to overcome some of the possible psychological resistance to nonownership. Waymo, the self-driving tech unit of Google parent         Alphabet Inc.,       has begun public trials of self-driving minivans in Phoenix for select users, with the eventual goal of testing them with hundreds of families.The goal is a better understanding how to make such a service appealing enough to take the place of a family car.\u201cWe\u2019re really experimenting here with how far our users can go in terms of using a service like this one to replace their own personal transportation,\u201d says       John Krafcik,        head of Waymo and a former automotive-industry executive.For auto giants, the new ownership models\u2014whether for traditional cars or self-driving ones\u2014constitute a major threat.As a result of both driverless cars and fleets of robot taxis, sales of conventionally purchased automobiles may likely drop. What\u2019s more, because autonomous cars will likely be designed to be on the road longer with easily upgradable or replaceable parts, the results could be devastating to auto makers that have built businesses around two-car households buying new vehicles regularly. Currently, cars get replaced every 60 months on average, according to Experian.\u201cIt may become more like the airline business where we see jets that have been in service for 50 years,\u201d says       Chris Ballinger,        chief financial officer and head of mobility services at the Toyota Research Institute. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think a car will be in service for 50 years but I\u2019m saying it may move in that direction\u2026with tens of millions of miles and decades of service.\u201dIn response, some car companies are trying to meet that threat head-on, by experimenting with different ownership models.One plan to get drivers to buy a vehicle of their own is to help owners rent out their vehicles, as they would in Mr. Musk\u2019s planned network of Tesla owners. Toyota\u2019s Lexus brand is testing payment plans that let people subsidize the purchase of pricey cars by renting them through a service called Getaround. The hope is that young buyers, who have been eschewing traditional ownership but are still attracted to luxury nameplates, will grab the chance to afford fancy cars on Corolla budgets.BMW,       meanwhile, is experimenting with shared rides through its Reachnow service. Members can get access to a fleet of BMW vehicles\u2014and Minis, in some areas\u2014that they pick up as needed and can drop off anywhere when they\u2019re done.General Motors Co.      , the largest U.S. auto maker by sales, seems to be hedging all bets. The company acquired an autonomous-car tech startup called Cruise Automation last year in a deal with a potential value of more than $1 billion. It also invested $500 million in ride-share company Lyft, as well as starting a car-sharing service of its own called Maven.Meanwhile, it\u2019s offering Cadillac customers the ability to subscribe to ownership, letting them use a vehicle for a month at a flat fee.The advent of self-driving cars will give people more free time while in the vehicle. And that will create new opportunities for car makers and others to make money.Autonomous vehicles could ultimately free up more than 250 million hours of consumers\u2019 commuting time a year, unlocking a new so-called passenger economy, according to             Intel Corp.      , which is trying to provide the computing power behind self-driving software.The chip maker released a study in June that estimates as much as $800 billion could be generated by 2035 by this passenger economy, while as much as $7 trillion could be in play by 2050.All of which might explain why new entrants to transportation, such as             Apple Inc.,Amazon.com Inc.       and         Samsung Electronics Co.      , are exploring the field. Apple in April, for example, became licensed to test-drive autonomous vehicles on California roadways.This could lead to a turn away from using the exterior of the vehicle as a selling point and focusing on making the interior as comfortable and loaded with features as possible.In some cases, that means turning cars into living rooms on wheels: Harman International Industries Inc., the auto-parts supplier acquired by Samsung for $8 billion, demonstrated in Las Vegas earlier this year a vision of a car that replaces a vehicle\u2019s windows with video screens that create a wraparound movie theater inside the cabin.Design firms will also cook up features designed to ease people into the practice of sharing rides regularly. IDEO, the design firm that came up with Apple\u2019s first computer mouse, has released a vision of autonomous vehicles designed to accommodate strangers who end up riding together.One central feature is \u201cpods\u201d\u2014seats that can be adjusted to block a passenger from the view of the others\u2014and there are areas in the vehicle that allow them to lock items while other people use the car.Other companies are working on ways to make cars recognize passengers\u2019 digital profiles and become more responsive to their needs. That might involve things such as reminding someone that a calendar appointment is coming up, and nudging them to leave earlier that day, or giving advice on places to eat along their route or ways to shop online while in traffic.Zoox, a startup valued at more than $1.5 billion, is working on designing a robot taxi that takes the entire riding experience into consideration, co-founder       Timothy Kentley-Klay       said last year.Although he didn\u2019t go into details on the so-called mobility service\u2019s features, Mr. Kentley-Klay said that such a vehicle would be \u201csmart enough to understand its environment, but importantly, it\u2019s also smart enough to understand you, where you need to be, what you want to do in the vehicle and how you want to move around the city.\u201dExisting industries may change to support an autonomous, shared future. For instance, the alcohol industry might see a rise in drinks consumed weekly with customers not having to worry about driving home, says a Morgan Stanley report by analyst       Adam Jonas.       He estimates the $1.5 trillion annual market might expand by $250 billion due to autonomous vehicles.One industry that knows cars very well\u2014dealerships\u2014may also adjust to fit the changing times: Managing autonomous car fleets may be a new line of business. Toyota\u2019s Mr. Ballinger noted that auto makers\u2019 finance arms largely finance local franchise dealers\u2019 inventories, called floor plans.\u201cIt may be a variation of that model where we continue to finance the floor plan, only the floor plan now isn\u2019t an inventory of cars ready for sale but an inventory of cars going around providing services\u2014maintained and managed by the dealer or somebody like the dealer,\u201d Mr. Ballinger says.For all the speculation about big changes on the way, and plans to meet those changes, it\u2019s important to remember that drivers may want to hang onto some form of ownership even if others are more convenient and cost-effective.Mr. Cohen, after spending about two years renting out his Model S on Turo, has begun to wind down that effort.\u201cAt almost exactly the second anniversary of that note, I paid off my Tesla,\u201d he says. He\u2019s keeping an eye on Tesla\u2019s ambitions for renting out autonomous vehicles, though he is dubious about giving up the thrill of driving. \u201cFor me, autonomous driving is not something I am looking forward to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can tell you that my 25-year-old son and recent UVA Law School graduate certainly is.\u201dMr. Higgins is reporter for The Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

In an era when ride-sharing services offer convenience, speed and trip-planning information, transit agencies are trying to catch up.These efforts include offering their own on-demand transportation services, joining with private transit services to give customers more options for getting around, adding apps that help riders plan trips across public and private transit, and making it easier to pay on mobile apps.Transit agencies have no choice: With the growth of Uber and Lyft, people may be using those services instead of public transit in some cases, says       Zak Accuardi,        program analyst at TransitCenter, a New York-based foundation that supports public transit across the country. A 2016 study of eight metropolitan areas by the Transit Cooperative Research Program sponsored by the Federal Transit Administration found that 15% of people whose top transit mode is Uber or Lyft would use public transit instead if Uber and Lyft weren\u2019t available.\u201cWe like to say this is not your grandfather\u2019s bus system,\u201d says       Dan Dawson,        vice president of marketing and communications at Austin\u2019s Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or Cap Metro. \u201cWe can\u2019t operate the same way we did 50 years ago and expect to be relevant. We have to use technology and new types of transit to both entice and provide the type of experience our customers want.\u201dCap Metro rolled out a test of an on-demand shared van service this month, using an app designed for Austin by Via Transportation Inc., a New York-based company that also has created versions of its Pickup app operated by local private partners in Paris and in the U.K. county of Kent. Similar services are sprouting across the U.S., with local twists, as cities work with various app developers.The transit agency in Nashville, Tenn., working with TransLoc Inc., is testing an on-demand van service that takes riders crosstown, a trip that has less fixed-line public transit service than other routes. TransLoc, of Durham, N.C., provides software that routes the vans to the riders on the most efficient path. In King County, Wash., where Seattle is located, the metro system\u2019s TripPool service provides vans private citizens can use to commute to and from park-and-ride lots or transit centers, picking up passengers along the way who request rides through an app from iCarpool.Some cities are working with Lyft and Uber. Transit agencies in Centennial, Colo., and in the California cities of Dublin and San Clemente have formed partnerships with Lyft to offer subsidized or free Lyft service\u2014to train stations or other destinations\u2014in areas where it isn\u2019t efficient to run fixed-line bus or train routes because the population is less dense. Los Angeles\u2019s LA Metro and Seattle\u2019s regional Sound Transit system in 2016 received a federal grant to test a program of discounted Lyft rides to and from transit stations. Uber has similar partnerships in Pinellas Park, Fla., Summit, N.J., and elsewhere to connect riders with transit.In addition to connecting commuters with mass transit and providing service in underserved areas, these services are helping reduce the need to build parking lots for people who drive themselves to transit stops.Providing easier ways to get around town can make a difference for many residents. A 2014 study by professors at the University of Southern California found that residents in San Diego who could drive 30 minutes to work could get access to about 32 times more jobs than those making a 30-minute commute by mass transit.Some cities are helping residents integrate ride-sharing services into trip planning, with apps that allow users to plug in a destination and get various public or private travel options\u2014and the best combinations.Los Angeles\u2019s Go LA app presents train, bus, bike, Lyft and other options. For example, a commuter looking to go from Santa Monica to USC would find options including Zipcar, train service, a Lyft ride to a train, and a ride to a bus on a bike. Riders can choose the fastest, cheapest or greenest option.             Conduent Inc.       built the app, as well as a similar app for Denver.\u201cWe want to give Angelenos multiple transportation options,\u201d says Bruce Gillman, spokesman for the city\u2019s Transportation Department. \u201cNo one is just a cyclist, driver or rider. We\u2019re some of those people at all different times.\u201dPortland, Ore.\u2019s TriMet system, which has a trip-planner app that includes biking and walking options in addition to mass transit, has received a U.S. Transportation Department grant to integrate ride services such as Uber and Lyft. In the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, riders using TransLoc\u2019s Rider app can see trip options that include a bus and then an Uber, and can click to request the Uber ride. And Austin\u2019s Cap Metro is working on expanding its trip-planning apps to show commuters options including public transit, bike sharing, car sharing and ride sharing.\u201cFor Cap Metro and probably other transit agencies, this is a real paradigm shift\u2014not looking at ourselves as a bus or rail company anymore.\u201d says Joe Iannello, vice president and chief information officer at Cap Metro. \u201cWe have to look at ourselves as a transportation provider. That means all kinds of transportation.\u201dThe next step: one payment for every mode of transportation. MaaS Global Ltd. in Helsinki offers an app that enables users to pay a flat monthly fee for seamless access to a range of private and public transit options, including bus, train, taxi and rental bike. In the U.S., agencies in Austin, Portland and other cities are working on technology that will eventually allow residents to pay once for access to many different kinds of public and private transportation systems.Meanwhile, many agencies now offer the ability to buy rides or monthly passes on a mobile app and use the app to get on buses or trains. The Regional Transportation Commission of Nevada\u2019s Washoe County, which includes Reno, rolled out a mobile app from San Francisco-based Token Transit Inc. in December that allows people to show a changing daily bus pass to the driver for rides. After four months, 4% of the system\u2019s riders are using the app and 6% of all bus passes are digital, says       Ed Park,        project manager at the commission. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by how quickly people adopted it,\u201d he says.Big transit agencies such as Miami-Dade County\u2019s are also aiming to make payments easier by adding mobile apps. The county rolled out a mobile app in October for riders to use a one-day mobile bus pass and will soon add monthly passes. The app, built by Cubic Transportation Systems Inc., which also provides systems for the San Francisco Bay Area, London and Chicago, is expected to add near-field communication technology next year, which will enable riders to wave their phones to board buses, says       Alice Bravo,        director of transportation and public works for Miami-Dade County.That ability offers several advantages. There\u2019s no risk of the bus driver being tricked by a fake or outdated pass. And because the bus driver doesn\u2019t have to visually verify each person\u2019s pass, boarding could be faster, especially since passengers could board through both the front and rear doors.Mr. Geron is a Wall Street Journal reporter in San Francisco.

Elon Musk\u2019s       Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX),       Richard Branson\u2019s       Virgin Galactic LLC, and       Jeff Bezos      \u2019 Blue Origin LLC are among the private companies developing space vehicles designed to launch multiple times with scant refurbishment.Public references to Pentagon research, some classified, that describe how this new space technology could be used for spy planes, or to rapidly replace national-security satellites destroyed in a conflict, also have helped fuel talk of using similar concepts to revolutionize air travel.Now, despite daunting technical and cost challenges, some entrepreneurs are betting they can do it.By incorporating innovative engine designs, the benefits of 3-D printing and principles of using the same booster repeatedly, these entrepreneurs plan to transform commercial aircraft into so-called hypersonic space planes capable of carrying passengers. Powered by engines that burn hydrogen fuel with oxygen from the atmosphere, but without the piping and moving parts essential for today\u2019s rockets, they would travel at least five times the speed of sound, or about 3,500 miles an hour, versus the 500 mph or so at which conventional jetliners typically cruise.Among those championing hypersonic travel for fare-paying passengers is       Chris Milam,        a Texas real-estate developer and technology investor who has pledged to invest as much as $20 million of his own funds over the next few years to design such a system. Along with       Preston Carter,        an expert formerly with the Pentagon\u2019s advanced-research arm, Mr. Milam aims to develop a two-stage concept in which a rocket carries a hypersonic, winged vehicle and releases it to cruise at high altitude. The passenger-carrying craft would land at its destination like a conventional airliner.\u201cThere has been lots of discussion about high-speed flight since the end of Concorde, but little has been realized,\u201d Mr. Milam says. \u201cThe reality is systems like this are expensive.\u201dPreliminary designs call for the space plane to carry about 100 passengers and cruise at an altitude of 70,000 to 100,000 feet, with the goal of reaching any point on Earth within four hours. It would have a total takeoff weight of some 500,000 pounds, less than half of a fully loaded         Airbus               A380 superjumbo.The upshot, proponents argue, would provide options far beyond those promised by most of today\u2019s civilian supersonic projects, which remain focused on building business jets or mini-airliners that essentially are updated versions of the Concorde on steroids. Closely held Boom Technology Inc., for example, is developing a three-engine, 45-passenger jet intended to fly 1,500 miles an hour\u2014or roughly twice the speed of sound.But if an entirely new category of airliner-like suborbital vehicles becomes reality in coming decades, they would fly many times faster and higher, traveling from London to New York in some 40 minutes\u2014or 10 times as fast as current airline schedules. That is still less than the anticipated top speed of the Pentagon\u2019s unmanned XS-1 experimental craft being developed to launch satellites (the Pentagon approved the design a month ago), or NASA\u2019s earlier X-43 rocket ship demonstrator that hit a record-breaking velocity of more than 7,500 miles an hour without a pilot.For a hypersonic passenger jet to become a reality, some major hurdles need to be cleared. The biggest one is that engineers so far have failed to produce materials or devise other means to safely handle the intense heat when airliners reach such hypersonic speeds. Aerospace giants including Boeing Co. and Airbus SE have had limited success, while Lockheed Martin Corp. only recently decided to pursue a scaled-down test vehicle for military purposes.Skeptics such as consultant and entrepreneur       Joel Sercel,        a former government space researcher, consider that hurdle particularly challenging. \u201cThe problem of cooling any vehicle going that fast isn\u2019t solvable,\u201d he says. \u201cThese issues have been plowed before.\u201dBut others in the aerospace industry are more optimistic. Julie Van Kleeck, vice president at engine maker             Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc.,       says 3-D printing allows production of engine parts and other structures with unique shapes that allow them to stay cooler. Longer term, she says, \u201cit can probably be broadened\u201d to commercial applications.Mr. Milam says there are other potential solutions to the overheating problem, some of which he is paying NASA experts to help develop. Entrepreneurs, he argues, \u201csimply have never been willing to engineer\u201d such fast airliners.Part of the impetus for the renewed focus on hypersonic options stems from an initially little-noticed report prepared by Air Force planners and outside experts in late 2016. Titled \u201cFast Space,\u201d the document spells out various strategies for \u201cultra low-cost,\u201d entirely reusable launchers eventually able to whisk cargo, soldiers and weapons around the globe in a matter of minutes rather than many hours.Citing a \u201cconfluence of government research and private sector innovation,\u201d the report describes \u201ca window of opportunity for the U.S. to shift its approach\u201d to space access. Increasingly embraced by Air Force brass, parts of the document emphasize the long-term advantages of joining with industry to revamp commercial transportation.Mr. Milam says his Austin, Texas, startup, Supernature LLC, needs substantial federal funding or additional private investors to build a prototype. On the upside, he says, interest among potential backers has been \u201cbolstered by the success of commercial space.\u201dMr. Pasztor is a senior special writer for The Wall Street Journal in Los Angeles.

And that is allowing public officials to better integrate public transportation systems with the informal ones, creating a future in which residents in cities such as Delhi, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, will be able to plan an efficient trip that involves taking a public bus two stops and then transferring to a tuk-tuk (a three-wheeled rickshaw known for its distinctive engine sound).The issue is becoming more critical because in the coming decades, hundreds of millions of people will move to vast urban areas already choked with pollution and snarled by traffic congestion. In 1950, there were two cities of more than 10 million people; by 2040, there will be more than 40. From Lagos, Nigeria, to Karachi, Pakistan, to Kinshasa in the Congo, populations rely on informal mass-transit systems employing everything from minibuses to motorbikes to get them from place to place.In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, 20,000 colorful \u201cmatatu\u201d minibuses operate with little regulation, and many routes are run by local gangs. To maximize income, drivers try to carry as many passengers as possible and drive as fast as possible. The vehicles are poorly maintained and often unsafe.In India, tuk-tuks account for 20% of motorized trips in some cities. But an inability to match supply and demand can result in inefficient pricing and low usage rates. Drivers spending hours looking for fares are more likely to refuse to take passengers to distant locations, or to jack up rates if they worry about finding a return fare. Residents thus spend even more of their already meager incomes on transportation. Uncertainty about being able to hail a ride also raises safety concerns, especially for female travelers.Even in areas where local officials want to improve the transportation situation, they often lack good information about riding habits and preferences or about the informal network that most people use, making it difficult to build a public transportation system that connects with the informal one.But that is starting to change.In Nairobi, my colleagues from Columbia University, working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Nairobi, and Groupshot, a local technology design firm, produced a map of the seemingly Byzantine matatu system based on GPS data collected from riders\u2019 mobile phones. They discovered that these bottom-up networks actually have a logic and pattern to them. With these networks now mapped, users can access the system more easily and efficiently, and local officials can plan bus and train routes around it. This comprehensive database of the matatu system allows easy mapping in Google Maps or other trip-planning applications.Elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East, a startup backed by an Uber Technologies executive and an investment group formed by the founder of             eBay Inc.       is compiling information on the routes of minibuses and tuk-tuks so that it, too, can be compiled into network maps. This company, called WhereIsMyTransport, has data for 21 cities, and has fully mapped the informal transportation networks in Gaborone, Botswana, as well as in East London and Cape Town in South Africa.In South Africa, planners initially intended to replace the informal networks, but they now plan to integrate them more seamlessly into new Bus Rapid Transit systems, since the informal networks are carrying an increasing fraction of passengers in the country. Similar efforts are under way in Manila; Mexico City; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Middle Eastern cities such as Beirut, Cairo, and Amman, Jordan.In India, local startups have developed new mobile applications so that riders can hail rickshaws more easily, reducing uncertainty for riders and standardizing fares. Data collected through ride-hailing apps also allows for route optimization. And ride-hailing apps improve safety, especially for female riders now able to identify their drivers and more easily report harassment.Technology also can ease congestion by improving the efficiency of carpooling, already very much part of the culture in many developing economies.In Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore, the ride-hailing company Grab has created a service called GrabHitch in which people can earn extra cash by allowing others to hitch a ride on their motorbikes.Even in poorer cities, most people own mobile phones, and thus can pay for rides using mobile payments. This improves safety and convenience, reduces haggling, and enables innovative pricing schemes like peak and off-peak pricing.Although new forces of information technology, data analytics and local entrepreneurship are coming together to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the informal mass-transit networks that many in the developing world rely on, that doesn\u2019t mean governments are off the hook.In the long term, rapidly growing megacities will struggle to keep pace with the demand for urban mobility without an increase in government investment.Prof. Bordoff is a professor of professional practice in international and public affairs and founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.

You may soon be able to hail a helicopter with almost the same ease as getting an Uber car.Voom, a unit of airplane maker         Airbus SE,       launched a service earlier this year here in South America\u2019s most populous city to ferry customers to and from the city\u2019s two main airports.The company is already planning to launch the service in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro, possibly by the end of this year, and is looking at other Latin American cities, including Belo Horizonte in Brazil. Congested cities in other parts of the world, such as Los Angeles and Jakarta, are future possibilities, Voom says.The piloted on-demand flight service, which was market-tested in the city by Uber Technologies Inc. last year, promises trips for as much as 80% less than traditional helicopter services, according to Voom Chief Executive       Uma Subramanian.       To order a ride, users first have to sign up on the company\u2019s website. Once signed up, they fill out an online form saying where they\u2019re going, where they\u2019re leaving from and how many bags they have. The site then informs them which helipad the flight will leave from, when, and how much it will cost. The user can then accept the flight or not. Clients can also book up to a week in advance.A trip from S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main business district of Faria Lima to the giant city\u2019s international airport costs $55 or more by taxi and can take as long as an hour with light traffic. With Voom, a similar trip can cost $100 to $200, depending on demand and availability, and take 15 minutes.The price for a similar trip with a competing helicopter company is about $1,000 for two people.Getting more people to use helicopters is the key to making the service work, says Ms. Subramanian. \u201cEverything hinges on delivering more demand. That\u2019s the single most important thing we can do to help bring down costs.\u201dLos Angeles and Jakarta \u201care cities that are viable with this kind of service, though our plan is to focus on Latin America for the first 18 to 24 months,\u201d says Ms. Subramanian.Reporters from The Wall Street Journal tried to take two trips with Voom in April, one from Faria Lima to nearby Congonhas airport, the second from Faria Lima to the international airport outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Guarulhos. The first went off without a hitch. The website worked correctly, the payment system functioned, the flight left on time, and everyone survived.Ricardo Politi,        a 29-year-old who works in equity crowdfunding, who was also on that trip, says he only took it because it was so cheap. Voom is sending new clients a voucher for 250 reais (about $76) for their first flight, and Mr. Politi\u2019s flight without the voucher would have cost about $82, he says. So, for around $6, he got a quick and fun trip to Congonhas airport from Faria Lima.Mr. Politi booked a second trip, in June, saying the regular price had come down enough to make it worthwhile, but that flight was cancelled because of bad weather. He also tried to use the service during the Uber test period, but in the end had to take a regular taxi because of bad weather. \u201cI almost missed my flight that time,\u201d he says.The second trip by the reporter from The Wall Street Journal suffered the same weather problem, along with unresolved difficulties paying. More than one credit card had security issues with the new company\u2019s payment system and declined to let the reporter pay for the flight, which in the end was canceled because of fog at Guarulhos airport.The payment issues have since been worked out, a Voom spokeswoman says.European aerospace company Airbus chose the Brazilian megalopolis to start its service because of the poor condition and crowded nature of the ground transportation system\u2014and because it has the best infrastructure for helicopter service of any city in the world, Ms. Subramanian says. (Airbus and other companies are also developing flying cars that can navigate tight spaces as another option for getting around congested cities.)S\u00e3o Paulo has one of the world\u2019s biggest fleets of private helicopters. The metro area has close to 200 functioning helipads, and even has its own air-traffic-control system dedicated to helicopters, the only such system in the world, according to       Arthur Fioratti,        president of the Brazilian Association of Helicopter Pilots.The city can handle a big increase in chopper traffic, Mr. Fioratti says. Helicopter flights are down about 40%, on a daily basis, from the busiest time in the city\u2019s history, from 2008 through 2013, he says.\u201cThe infrastructure is definitely up to an increase\u201d in helicopter flights, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had less use in the past few years\u201d because of the country\u2019s economic and political crises, among other things, he says.Airbus, which also makes helicopters, plans to expand the service to other cities with big traffic jams, meager public transport, a sufficient number of helipads and a big enough helicopter fleet, starting first in Latin America.For users of the service in S\u00e3o Paulo, the system is similar to how Uber works with cars. Voom doesn\u2019t own or lease any helicopters; it instead directs fliers to existing helicopter companies, all of which meet the rules and regulations that apply to the sector.Fliers have to state their weight (standard industry practice, as is adding 22 pounds to the declared weight for safety\u2019s sake, Ms. Subramanian says). If you\u2019re morbidly obese, or just very tall and chunky, you\u2019re out of luck, though. The weight limit for people is 331 pounds.Clients must also say how many pieces of luggage they\u2019re bringing. They can check two bags and bring two carry-on pieces, with the maximum weight for a checked bag set at 55 pounds per piece.Once the booking has been made, it is up to the client to reach the designated helipad on time. The company currently sells flights from three helipads in the city, along with one each at Guarulhos and Congonhas airports, and passengers can travel between any of those five points.Mr. Lewis and Ms. Magalhaes are reporters in the S\u00e3o Paulo bureau of The Wall Street Journal.

For the modern traveler, the airport experience has become a chore.Airports, airlines and their technology providers are as frustrated as passengers are with the current state of affairs\u2014a frustration that will only rise as more rules are put in place designed to enhance security, such as the Trump administration\u2019s suggestion that it might ban laptops from cabins on all international flights in and out of the U.S.So what can be done? Plenty, airport officials say. Among other things, the whole passenger experience, from arrival at the airport to departure, can be streamlined and coordinated so that the experience is more seamless.The promise to passengers is more safety and less stress; to airports, meanwhile, it is better security\u2014and more time for passengers to shop.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really scratched the surface on what changes in processes supported by current and future technologies can deliver to the airport experience,\u201d says Dubai Airport Chief Executive       Paul Griffiths.Integrating all stakeholders in airport security into a single process with as few checkpoints as possible could be a good place to start. Currently, at U.S. international airports there are checks by airline personnel and the Transportation Security Administration, as well as separate screenings by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials. Working more closely with government security and immigration representatives could allow airports to boost capacity by processing passengers more quickly. Document checks, security checks, immigration and customs could be streamlined into one step rather than repeatedly disrupting passengers, Mr. Griffiths says.Dubai Airport is testing technology that allows some passengers to pass through immigration using digitally stored biometric data carried on their smartphones. This could eliminate the need to use a passport or other government-issued identification card. The test is being run in conjunction with the Dubai government, which maintains the biometric database.Many industry officials believe improvements in airport logistics can be made before passengers even arrive at a terminal. Munich Airport wants to help passengers make their trip more seamless from their initial point of departure all the way to their destination.\u201cIf we could get all mobility companies to cooperate, with a single ticket\u2014including for the parking lot, the airline, all customized for one passenger\u2014that would be really seamless travel,\u201d says       Sarah Wittlieb,        head of innovation at Munich Airport, which handled more than 42 million passengers last year.As a first step, the airport this year will test an app that draws on traffic and public-transport-services data to tell passengers how long it will take them to reach the airport. Ultimately, she says, the goal is for the app to include projected wait times at airport security and other choke points, so that passengers have a complete picture of how much time they need to catch their plane.Others are trying to cure different traveler headaches. Dutch carrier KLM last year tested a robot, called Spencer, to help passengers navigate its big hub airport, Schiphol. The large, adult-size robot on wheels was designed to look almost human to help interaction with customers. It had a screen to help provide instructions in multiple languages. For people with connecting flights, Spencer would meet them at their arriving gate and guide them to their connecting gate. The trial convinced KLM that robots could help, though Spencer wasn\u2019t ready for prime time.Delta Air Lines Inc.        DAL -0.32%       is testing technology that could lead to passengers being able to check bags and board their planes with just their fingerprints. As the first stage of its tests, some passengers flying from Ronald Reagan National Airport will be able to access the airline\u2019s lounge using their fingerprint as proof of identity. Down the road, the airline said last month, the same fingerprint could be used to check a bag or board a flight.JetBlue Airways Corp.        JBLU 0.30%       has launched a self-boarding trial in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection using biometric and facial recognition technology, the airline announced late last month. The first trial will be on flights from Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport to Aruba\u2019s Queen Beatrix International Airport.After checking in and passing through security screening, the passenger steps in front of a specialized camera that takes an image, which is then compared with information stored in a U.S. government database to verify passenger identities. Once they are cleared, they can board without further checks.\u201cWe hope to learn how we can further reduce friction points in the airport experience,\u201d       Joanna Geraghty,        the airline\u2019s executive vice president for customer experience, said in a statement announcing the trial.Aviation information-technology provider SITA, which is supporting the JetBlue trial, is working with airports and airlines also to find other ways to make travel more seamless. Validating passenger identity is a particular choke point, says       Andrew O\u2019Connor,        the company\u2019s vice president for airline operations and border management.\u201cI can see a day where somebody steps into an airport, they walk up to the bag-drop unit, it knows who they are, they are asked to check their bag into the system if they have one,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor says. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, they merely proceed to security and without stopping, doors open in front of them.\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too difficult to envisage.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor adds that he expects the same type of nonstop process for boarding the aircraft as well.Innovators have to be careful not to go overboard in the meantime. Pushing airport information to a passenger\u2019s smartphone when he or she is still passing through security or passport control could add to their stress, rather than ease it, Munich Airport\u2019s Ms. Wittlieb says.There is also still a generation of well-heeled passengers, she points out, the \u201csilver generation,\u201d that prefers to talk to someone, rather than just deal with an app.Mr. Wall is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in London.

It\u2019s \u201ccongestion pricing\u201d: Charge drivers more to use roads and bridges during the busiest times, and clogged roadways will clear up overnight.Now, at last, technology can make that miracle a reality.With apps, GPS and other tools, roadway officials can track traffic and set prices in real time. Then drivers will get updates about traffic conditions and costs\u2014letting them decide as they travel if they want to pay more to take a crowded road or pay less to use an emptier one.But keeping traffic moving smoothly day to day is just one benefit of this system. Congestion pricing will enhance safety by making sure cars aren\u2019t closely bunched in stop-and-go traffic. It will reduce the need for new roads, by using existing ones to their fullest capacity. And, as dynamic pricing has done in other industries, it will raise enough revenue to modernize decaying infrastructure.Reducing congestion is urgent because, as things stand, it imposes massive costs\u2014in air pollution and wasted fuel, for instance, not to mention wasted time and frustration. Traffic jams cost $23.3 billion a year in Los Angeles alone, according to an analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economics consulting firm. The cost of congestion will rise as the population and number of vehicles on the road grows in coming years.Managing a problem by congestion pricing isn\u2019t a novel idea. For example, wholesale electricity markets have been dynamically priced for more than a decade, charging higher rates at times of peak demand. But efficient road-use pricing has become feasible only recently, as advances in mobile communications now make it possible to identify and communicate the location of a vehicle with great accuracy.How would the system work? The price of a given route would vary in real time depending on current demand and supply\u2014increasing, for instance, if a lane was closed for repairs or an accident. In uncongested times and locations, motorists would pay only a nominal fee, to recover operating and maintenance costs. The costs would apply to all roads, not just those with tolls, and would likely be collected through a monthly credit-card charge.Drivers would receive the price information in real time\u2014perhaps every five minutes\u2014through an app in their car or smartphone, to make their driving choice. It\u2019s similar to how Google Maps presents people with real-time driving information, and then they decide how to use it.Drivers could lock in that low price for their trip or take their chances of paying more or less along the way, depending on how congestion turns out to be. So, if they must be at an urgent meeting, then they would tell the system to take the fastest route regardless of cost, based on fluctuating conditions along the way. If they weren\u2019t in a rush, they might tell it to choose the lowest-cost route regardless of how long it takes.Real-time road prices would also allow the motorist to properly schedule travel. If they discovered after several days that waiting 15 minutes to leave for work would save money, then a few minutes of properly scheduled work at home may pay handsome dividends, both to the driver and to others who want a less-crowded roadway.This system will also have a big impact on driverless vehicles when they eventually reach the market. Just as wholesale electricity prices direct energy around the grid, real-time road prices will become part of what driverless cars and buses \u201cconsider\u201d in deciding how to take passengers to school or work. They will change their routes in real time to avoid, and thus eliminate, congestion and bottlenecks. Those vehicles will also communicate with one another, allowing virtually bumper-to-bumper travel at relatively high speed (called \u201cplatooning\u201d).Accurate road prices will also help us make smarter infrastructure investments. A new lane, for instance, can be targeted to where its value\u2014as reflected in prices\u2014is greatest. Real-time road prices will reveal that value, thus reducing or eliminating the politicization that has afflicted infrastructure investment.One concern is that real-time road prices would put greater cost burdens on drivers who need to travel at certain times and on certain routes\u2014and poor drivers in particular. What if road prices are high when low-income drivers need to get to work? We shouldn\u2019t distort the market to help them, but instead allow prices to move as they will, and then provide vouchers or credits to help them along.We shouldn\u2019t allow problems like these\u2014which can be solved with smart planning\u2014to stop us from moving ahead with congestion pricing. This major step in the transport transformation can happen now. With today\u2019s technology we can monitor a vehicle\u2019s road use and directly charge for that use. With the right prices to guide behavior, we can eliminate congestion, accurately direct investment and maximize the value of scarce road capacity. The only thing lacking is the political will.Dr. Cramton is a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, and Dr. Geddes is a professor in the department of policy analysis and management and director of the program in infrastructure policy at Cornell University.

Amtrak funding gets slashed in the White House\u2019s 2018 budget, which also calls for the elimination of most long-distance rail service.And Amtrak leadership is facing heavy criticism for delays in service, a March derailment at New York\u2019s Penn Station and the handling of overdue repairs there.Advocates of faster service and more business-class amenities, meanwhile, see hope in several privately funded projects under way, including a line starting service soon in Florida and efforts to launch a high-speed Dallas-Houston train.A federal grant for electrification of tracks in California, meanwhile, has breathed new life into a long-delayed proposal for faster service between San Francisco and Los Angeles.To get a clear picture of what passenger rail transport might look like going forward, The Wall Street Journal reached out to three experts in rail travel and policy:       Andy Kunz,        president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, a nonprofit advocating for the creation of a high-tech, cross-country rail network;       Baruch Feigenbaum,        assistant director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank; and       Robert Puentes,        president and chief executive of the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonprofit that provides professional development for executives and managers in the transportation sector. Here are edited excerpts.WSJ: What is your vision of passenger rail transport for America?MR. KUNZ: Our vision [at the U.S. High Speed Rail Association] includes a network of fast trains connecting America\u2019s metro areas as our main form of national transportation. This would be seamlessly integrated with local rail, bus and bicycle networks in each city, and supported by dense, walkable communities around the stations.In 2009 we laid out a national high-speed-rail [HSR] vision map showing a 17,000-mile HSR network of 220-mph trains to be built in phases for completion by 2030. This was modeled after the European HSR network that had evolved over 30 years. Then China built a much larger national network in nine years, so we now have China\u2019s HSR network as the best global model.MR. PUENTES: The country\u2019s 100 largest metropolitan areas are primarily behind the recent growth in Amtrak passengers: Ten major cities are responsible for nearly two-thirds of total ridership. Driving the connection between these metropolitan areas are 26 short-distance corridors, or routes traveling less than 400 miles, that carry 83% of all Amtrak passengers. States now have formalized relationships with Amtrak to upgrade tracks, operate routes and redevelop stations.To continue the growth, my vision is a system where the federal government and states broker a new agreement between Amtrak and the states to share operating costs and other responsibilities for corridors longer than 750 miles; refine, empower and create a dedicated funding source for future rail investments; and complete a national rail plan that fosters a stronger relationship between public agencies and private capital and management firms.MR. FEIGENBAUM: I work for a free-market think tank. So in general I oppose subsidies to transportation modes that don\u2019t recover their costs.Having said that, I support funding for transit targeted at low-income passengers and the disabled even though transit does not come close to covering its costs. That does not mean we support every transit project; I oppose many because I see them as a poor use of taxpayer funds.High-speed rail is different. In Europe and Asia, HSR\u2019s biggest customer is businesspeople who do not need a taxpayer subsidy. As a result I don\u2019t believe in subsidizing high-speed rail. My vision is limited to building out areas in which rail can be profitable or break even, like the Northeast Corridor between Boston and D.C., as well as a direct line between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I have looked at the Midwest, and although Chicago is a good city, no other cities in that region have sufficient central-city employment/population density and good enough local transit systems to make HSR work.MR. KUNZ: First off, Baruch, the biggest customers of HSR around the world are people\u2026all sorts of people, not just businesspeople, but families going on trips, students, retired people, young professionals, schoolchildren, basically their entire society. In countries that have HSR, it becomes their main form of transportation for everyone.And your statement that no other cities in the Midwest have sufficient density or local transit systems to make HSR work is completely false. If you look all around the world at the 20-plus countries that have high-speed rail, most of them serve smaller cities than the size of U.S. cities, and they get enormous ridership. The point is to create a network so the HSR lines connect all the major cities together, and along the way are also connecting into smaller cities. This gives wide access to the populations in the smaller cities, with access to opportunities along the line.WSJ: Who bears the cost?MR. KUNZ: For the past 70 years, rail has been at the bottom of the priority list for investment and focus. We funded a national interstate system somehow, and a trillion-dollar aviation system somehow. Before that we funded the transcontinental railroad. We currently are spending something like $200 billion a year between federal and state funds on endlessly expanding our highways. Some of that money should be moved to fund rail projects right away. Getting the nation off foreign oil is certainly a top national-security goal, and building a national HSR system is the fastest way to get the nation off foreign oil.MR. FEIGENBAUM: I would prefer our system be operated by the private sector or as a public-private partnership. If the government can operate rails more cheaply, that would be an option. Relaxing rules on Davis-Bacon and Buy America [public-works laws focused on wages and domestic sourcing] would help build the lines more quickly and cheaply.WSJ: Does it make sense to keep putting money into existing Amtrak rail lines, which are government-subsidized and often shared with freight?MR. PUENTES:America\u2019s passenger rail network is really made up of two types of routes: those less than 400 miles and those greater than 400 miles. The former typically enjoy direct state support and always serve at least one large metropolitan area. The latter represent the \u201cgeographic equity\u201d portion of the network. These routes travel for vast stretches and offer service to many smaller, relatively isolated communities with limited inter-metropolitan alternatives. Together, they carry about 17% of Amtrak\u2019s passengers but constitute 43.6% of its route-associated operating costs.If Congress wants to continue serving rural areas with passenger rail, it needs to recognize it as \u201cgeographic equity\u201d and not expect it to run \u201clike a business.\u201dMR. FEIGENBAUM: With three other modes (aviation, intercity bus and passenger vehicles), I don\u2019t see the wisdom in subsidizing a fourth mode when the other three are largely (although not totally) unsubsidized. I also think that Amtrak\u2019s political challenge is one of the top reasons for having a private company or public-private partnership build and operate the lines.MR. KUNZ: I hate to point out the obvious, but all transportation is subsidized. No roads make money. Airports don\u2019t make money. The FAA doesn\u2019t make money, and so on. Transportation is a public service that makes our economy work. HSR is the only mode of transportation that can deliver very high capacity (more than highways and airports combined) without delays or congestion, reliably and safely, day after day. This is a mode that can stimulate our entire economy.Consider France. The first HSR line, from Paris to Lyon, was built and paid for by the government. It made money and actually paid back a fee to the government. Then two years later, France decided to build out another region of France, and again it\u2019s paid for by the government and turns a profit. This is growing a network, not subsidizing a losing system. Huge difference.WSJ: Is there a business case for building out and repairing America\u2019s aging rail system?MR. KUNZ: The thing about HSR is that it does have a huge business case, from the actual time savings of businesspeople using the trains daily, to the massive real-estate opportunities that surround the stations, such as the Hudson Yards in New York City, and all the new development now taking shape surrounding the new Transbay station in downtown San Francisco, and others. In addition, the rail operator is a for-profit business that contributes to society, such as the new private rail operator in Italy called NTV.We agree HSR should be built where it makes sense first. These are the places with high-population centers and high movement between them already, but suffering from excessive congestion and delays. Those places are also where infill real-estate development makes the most sense clustered around the rail stations, instead of sprawling outward into farmland.MR. PUENTES: When it comes to high-speed rail, the U.S. is in kind of an emerging market. As with any infrastructure, it really matters where you put these investments and what they are designed to do. In Japan and European countries, they don\u2019t build the whole network at once. They build a trunk line, and they make that work. They build another one and then make that work.That\u2019s what\u2019s emerging here. We have the California HSR project that\u2019s very bumpy but still moving along, connecting metropolitan Los Angeles and metropolitan San Francisco\u2014two places that have a clear economic relationship and are the right distance apart\u2014and it has the potential to be very competitive. There are two other projects that are mostly private ventures: one between Dallas and Houston and one between Orlando and Miami. It\u2019s a very strong market signal that you have private investors willing to spend money to build and operate these services.WSJ:  Are there technological advances on the horizon that will affect passenger rail?MR. PUENTES: One could see a future where a ubiquitous fleet of driverless cars has a negative impact on passenger rail, but the technology for the vehicles could possibly also be applied to the trains of the future. Smart technology like positive train control [technology aimed at preventing accidents] bears a family resemblance to some of the autonomous vehicles\u2019 technologies. Automated vehicles could also be used to supplement rail service by providing so-called first-mile/last-mile connections around stations, especially in rural areas.MR. KUNZ: Many today are assuming the driverless-car system will replace a rapid-transit system, which will never work. The freeways are already full wall-to-wall now in most regions of the U.S.The driverless-car idea is trying to copy that functionality of HSR with an unreliable, vulnerable, virtual [wireless] guideway which has to be built with millions of antennas, radar units and sensors. This inherently includes thousands of reasons it will struggle to work, and be subject to constant hacking, glitches, power outages, system failures, weather, incompatible vehicles and endless other problems. Unfortunately every one of those situations will probably result in car crashes\u2014exactly what this is being sold to prevent.MR. FEIGENBAUM: Automated vehicles are going to bring about tremendous change. Vehicle ownership is likely to decrease. Connectivity could increase roadway capacity. So there is an argument that we will be able to build less transportation infrastructure period. We should think long and hard about planning for major transportation investments that we cannot fund for the next 20 years.Electric and hybrid-powered cars will become much more commonplace. If anything, this is a negative for high-speed rail, which is not particularly green regardless of whether it gets its power from coal, natural gas or renewables. This is because building a new HSR line releases so much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.MR. KUNZ: I agree with Baruch\u2019s comment about planning for the next 20 years, which is why we question a $1 trillion investment in driverless cars\u2014what the full build-out system is projected to cost. But this argument could also apply to ongoing road investment.However, his comment on greenhouse gases is pretty outlandish. Any infrastructure that gets built releases greenhouse gases. Highways require 20 times the infrastructure that an HSR line does. Once built, HSR is the cleanest form of transport, and can be 100% powered by renewables.WSJ: What have been the big failures of rail travel in the U.S.? Can they be overcome?MR. PUENTES: As with other areas of infrastructure, recommendations for passenger rail tend to devolve into calls for increased federal spending. Such a call is probably justified especially over the long term for myriad reasons, including Washington\u2019s historically outsize support of other transportation modes. But Washington and the states can operate better during this remarkably challenging time of fiscal constraint.The goal should not be to eliminate long-distance routes by \u201coffloading\u201d responsibility from the federal government to states, but strengthening the partnership and reaffirming the commitment of states to long-distance routes over time.MR. FEIGENBAUM: The biggest failure of rail transit has been poor management. With guaranteed funding, government or otherwise, there is no financial incentive to improve service.When it comes to HSR, public partnerships with the private sector can bring innovation, minimize political interference and help stretch financial resources further. But given my sentiment of not spending taxpayer dollars on HSR, the number of new lines that could be constructed is limited.MR. KUNZ:  Management does play a role, but lack of funding is the No. 1 problem. You can look all around the world and see huge transformations everywhere HSR is built. In Italy, for example, two competing HSR companies wiped out             Ryanair                   from flying to Italian cities almost overnight. Everywhere HSR is built, it almost instantly captures 50% of the market share from aviation, and 20% to 30% from autos. We recommend a public-private partnership to build these rail systems in America. The result is you get the safety and security of a government-owned piece of infrastructure and the best innovation and competitive pricing of the private-sector operator. The government builds the infrastructure and this remains owned and controlled by the federal or state government. The private sector would be the train operator, much like an airline operates today using government airports, and would also manage the track infrastructure and the stations.Ms. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.

In northern Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert, one of the world\u2019s best environments for solar generation, California-based             SunPower Corp.        SPWR 0.72%       will produce 42% of the subway system\u2019s power with a 100-megawatt solar plant using 254,000 panels covering an area the size of 370 football fields. A recently built wind farm just north of the solar project will supply 18% of the system\u2019s electricity.The subway\u2019s move to green energy comes as more transportation providers look to renewables to charge up. In Australia, the city of Adelaide uses solar-powered buses. In Belgium, 16,000 solar panels were installed on the roof of 2 miles of covered railway between Antwerp and Amsterdam to provide power for commuter trains and a station. In Canada, Calgary\u2019s light-rail transit system is powered almost entirely by wind. Solar power is also expected to be used soon for the tram network in Melbourne, Australia, and the subway in Delhi, India.As the cost of renewables declines, experts believe, more transit systems will turn to cleaner energy.\u201cMetros are seeking more environmentally friendly methods of supplying power,\u201d says       Alexander Barron,        who heads the Community of Metros and Nova Group of Metros, industry associations that include the world\u2019s biggest subways. \u201cSantiago is probably on the leading edge.\u201dChile has looked to renewables because they already are often cheaper than its alternatives and provide some energy independence for the country. Solar and wind are seen as alternatives to importing oil and gas, which the country lacks. By 2050, renewables are expected to supply 70% of the country\u2019s electricity, up from 15% as of March.\u201cThere has been a dramatic change,\u201d Energy Minister       Andr\u00e9s Rebolledo       says, referring to the increased development of renewable power in Chile over the past few years. \u201cClearly, this has an important potential.\u201dBuilding solar plants in the vast Atacama Desert\u2014a Mars-like landscape with some of the highest solar radiation levels on Earth thanks to its low humidity and high elevation\u2014has been easier in Chile than developing large hydro projects, which have faced government and social opposition because of the potential environmental disruption. Wind farms have faced some opposition for the same reasons, but less than hydro.Last year, renewable-energy firms won several contracts in Chile\u2019s largest-ever power auction to supply electricity to the country\u2019s northern and central grids, with the lowest price offered by a solar company.In the desert, some of the world\u2019s biggest copper miners have switched to solar power from diesel fuel to power their operations. Further south, wineries, agricultural businesses and water-treatment facilities use solar panels to cut energy costs by up to 30%, says       Steven Van Cauwenberge,        chief executive of Solcor, a Chilean solar company that oversees those projects. Hospitals and cultural centers have also installed panels on their roofs to lower costs.The promise of competitive prices prompted Santiago\u2019s subway system, which stretches to more than 100 stations over 64 miles of track, to try renewables after seeing its energy costs skyrocket in 2014 when it was buying electricity on the spot market. At one point, electricity prices hit $200 per megawatt-hour, says       Rodrigo Az\u00f3car,        the metro\u2019s president. The lowest price at last year\u2019s power auction to supply electricity to the grids, from the solar company, was $29 per megawatt-hour.To bring costs under control, the metro, which is Santiago\u2019s biggest energy consumer, signed a 15-year deal to get power from the two renewable projects, which will inject the electricity into the central grid that connects to Santiago. The solar project is about 370 miles north of Santiago.Chile\u2019s president,       Michelle Bachelet,        praised the initiative, saying the renewables would provide enough power for the equivalent of 100,000 homes and reduce Chile\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions by 130,000 tons a year. On top of that, it will also help the metro\u2019s bottom line, Mr. Az\u00f3car says. \u201cIt is a very good price,\u201d he says, declining to provide details. \u201cWhat the metro was looking for was stability.\u201dGreen energy companies do face challenges in Chile. Demand for electricity has eased amid a slowdown in economic growth, making it difficult to finance new projects. Layers of brown desert dust on panels can reduce solar efficiency, an issue that SunPower says it will address with custom-made cleaning robots that use little water. And the intermittence of solar power makes it unreliable for clients that need electricity 24 hours a day, but entrepreneurs are innovating. A $1.1 billion project by Valhalla, a company created by two Stanford-educated Chileans, aims to solve that problem by combining solar with hydropower.During the day, excess power from a large solar plant would pump ocean water up Chile\u2019s northern coastal cliffs to be stored in a reservoir. At night, the water would run back down the cliffs through a tunnel, passing through a turbine to create hydropower. \u201cYou are able to provide 24/7 power just like a coal plant, at a price that right now is extremely low,\u201d says       Francisco Torrealba,        a co-founder of Valhalla.Meanwhile, academics say the subway could further increase its use of renewables by installing solar panels on the roofs of its stations and beside nearly 20 miles of rail track that isn\u2019t underground, injecting the electricity straight into the metro system without using the grid.Jorge Amaya,        a researcher at the University of Chile\u2019s Center for Mathematical Modeling, says that would further cut costs and reduce emissions by about 18%. \u201cCertainly, it is the next step,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could produce very important savings.\u201dMr. Dube is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Lima, Peru.

The collapse trapped two people in the basement.Firefighters rescued those two people, who were transported to Elmhurst Hospital Center in critical condition, officials said.

It wasn\u2019t clear if there was any approval.A sustained building boom in New York has raised a forest of cranes across the New York skyline and has led to a series of accidents, some fatal.In February 2016, a crawler crane with a 561-foot-long boom fell across two city blocks in Tribeca as it was being lowered during windy conditions. The accident, which killed one man and injured three others, led to new wind-monitoring rules and other safety requirements.In July 2016, a crane being used to construct a replacement bridge for the Tappan Zee Bridge north of New York, collapsed and spilled over a lane of the older bridge roadway, injuring four people.Last November, a crane operator and a construction worker were killed at a Queens site when a cable snapped, hurling a 6,500-pound beam to the ground. At the time the building commissioner attributed the accident to \u201cmaterial failure.\u201dThe city\u2019s worst crane accident in the last decade was the 2008 crane collapse on East 51st Street that killed seven people on a high-rise construction project.\u00a0That site was later sold to another developer and is now part of a condominium with 123 apartments known as the Halcyon.A second crane collapsed that same year on East 91st Street, killing the operator and another worker.\u2014Josh Barbanel  contributed to this article.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Three Hurt In Mishap At Queens Work Site.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 21:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-people-injured-in-new-york-construction-accident-1497996793", "news_title": "Three People Injured in New York Construction Accident ", "keywords": "astoria,boom,construction accident,crane,fdny,injured,injuries,queens,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,machinery,handling equipment,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Republican Ralph Norman won a closer-than-expected special election in a U.S. House district in South Carolina, holding a safe Republican seat vacated earlier this year by       Mick Mulvaney,        who left to lead the Office of Management and Budget      \ufeff      .The Associated Press declared Mr. Norman, a former state legislator, the victor over Democrat Archie Parnell.Mr. Norman won by less than four percentage points\u2014a steep drop from the 20-point margin by which Mr. Mulvaney carried the district last November.

Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders reached an agreement Tuesday requiring the use of American-made construction materials for some state infrastructure projects.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had initially proposed a more sweeping mandate for using American supplies, but that proposal faced pushback from some Canadian officials and was dropped from legislative negotiations earlier this year.The proposal lawmakers agreed to Tuesday, during the past week of the legislative session, requires state contractors to use American steel and iron for road and bridge projects that cost over $1 million.\u201cWhen we \u2019Buy American,\u2019 we support the continued growth of our manufacturing industries here at home, preserve and create jobs and invest in our future,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.The original measure, applying to projects over $100,000, had bipartisan support but officials in Ontario, a New York trading partner, lobbied against it.On Tuesday evening, Ontario Premier,       Kathleen Wynne,        said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the state of New York has reached an agreement on new discriminatory \u2018Buy American\u2019 legislation which will have an impact on Ontario businesses. However, as a direct result of our advocacy, the provisions are of narrow application and much less punitive than those first considered by state lawmakers.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s focus on using American manufacturing materials came after President       Donald Trump       made it a theme of \u00a0his 2016 campaign.Mr. Trump, a Republican, has also inserted language requesting use of U.S. material and labor into several executive orders. But government officials have sometimes disputed what constitutes \u201cAmerican made\u201d given that manufacturing can often span continents.In the case of New York\u2019s measure, the legislation requires the whole manufacturing process of the materials occur in the U.S., according to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office, but exceptions will be made for some projects.With only 24 hours left in New York\u2019s legislative sessions, anxiety was ramping up over other legislative items.Lawmakers remained at odds over granting Mayor       Bill de Blasio       a renewal of his authority to control New York City schools instead of a school board.

The spread had hit 1.41 percentage point on the day after the U.S. presidential election, according to Tradeweb. A larger figure means a steeper yield curve, typically taken as a sign of robust economic health and strong future bank profits.A flattening yield curve often historically suggested bond prices were reflecting downbeat prospects for the economy and inflation in the years ahead. When long-term Treasurys yield less than short-term notes, which hasn\u2019t happened since before the financial crisis, it typically signaled a recession is coming shortly.But the yield curve has also been flattening in recent years for reasons having little to do with the economic outlook. Low government-bond rates around the world have driven investors to buy up U.S. Treasurys because their yields are comparatively higher than those in Europe and Japan. The flood of foreign money has in turn weighed on U.S. yields.Those additional buyers have caused some to claim that the yield curve has become distorted as an economic signal, failing to show how the bond market views the economic outlook in the years ahead.

Morgan Chase & Co.,             Starbucks Corp.      ,             Procter & Gamble Co.       and at least a dozen other major brands or government agencies haven\u2019t returned to the site, those institutions and people familiar with the situation say. They pulled their spending after news organizations in March revealed that their ads ran alongside extremist or racist videos.But some companies have resumed spending on YouTube ads\u2014including             General Motors Co.      ,             Coca-Cola Co.      , Lyft Inc. and             McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s       U.K. unit\u2014after the site improved its technology to screen videos, committed to employing more human reviewers and gave marketers more control over where their ads appeared. YouTube also issued refunds to some companies.The mixed response from advertisers shows their \u201cbrand safety\u201d concerns are serious and could linger, but also aren\u2019t insurmountable, as long as Google continues its efforts to ease marketers\u2019 fears.YouTube said in a statement: \u201cMany advertisers never left and many have decided to come back. While they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we\u2019ve taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better.\u201dGoogle on Sunday also announced a series of changes to curb extremist videos on its site, including adding more technology and human reviewers to flag them and making less extreme ones harder to find.Many of the marketers still on the sidelines say they are waiting for complete reassurance that poor ad placements won\u2019t happen again.A series of news stories about ads running alongside controversial YouTube videos sparked advertisers to pull spending in late March. In the 90 days from March 15 to June 13, digital-ad research firm Pathmatics estimated spending on ads that ran before YouTube videos or displayed on the YouTube site fell by 17% to $739 million, compared with the previous 90 days. However, when compared to the same period in 2016, such spending rose by 50%, according to the data. Pathmatics didn\u2019t capture data from YouTube\u2019s mobile app.The data show that despite deep cuts from some big brands, other companies significantly boosted spending over the period, including             Apple Inc.,Intel Corp.       and website-creation firm             Wix.com Ltd.       Intel declined comment. Apple and Wix didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Other signs also look good for YouTube. A poll of 316 marketers\u2014including 200 decision makers from the top 200 advertisers in the U.S.\u2014conducted in May by research consultancy Advertiser Perceptions found that 39% of respondents were likely to spend \u201ca good deal more\u201d with YouTube this year than last. Just 12% said they planned to spend less this year and 41% said there would be no change. Among the remainder, some weren\u2019t YouTube advertisers.The data suggest that despite advertisers\u2019 concerns, YouTube\u2019s scale and data make it irresistible for many marketers.Google parent         Alphabet Inc.       posted a 22% increase in revenue to $24.8 billion in the first quarter, mostly driven by its ad business, but those figures largely preceded the backlash. Investors are watching second-quarter results closely for any impact.Many marketers have ramped up oversight of where their ads appear. Audits run by ad agencies have sometimes showed that even YouTube channels the company brands as \u201cGoogle Preferred\u201d\u2014and charges more for\u2014can include videos advertisers don\u2019t consider premium. These could include footage of people playing the popular children\u2019s game Minecraft. Such videos aren\u2019t in bad taste, but their viewers likely include many children, who aren\u2019t a priority for most marketers.YouTube said its Google Preferred channels include many different categories of content, including material aimed at teens, and that it works with marketers to put their ads on the right videos.Many advertisers are now moving from \u201cblacklisting\u201d videos they wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with, to \u201cwhitelisting\u201d the channels they deem appropriate. Whitelisting can have the effect of narrowing a company\u2019s ad buy.Enterprise Holdings Inc., owner of Enterprise Rent-a-Car, for example, is working with its media buying agency,             Omnicom Media Group,       to test a program that scores hundreds of thousands of popular videos each day, based on their suitability for ads.Marketers have seized on the uproar to press for long-sought changes. After the backlash, Google agreed to let independent measurement firms monitor where marketers\u2019 ads appear.\u201cI think brands like giving Google a bloody nose as they have been so reliant and plowed so much money\u201d into the company, said Ryan Kangisser, founder of ad consulting firm Stack I/O.YouTube has refunded some advertisers for ads it served next to objectionable content. The amounts returned have been small. In March, Google\u2019s top executive in Europe,       Matt Brittin,        said the matter affected \u201cpennies not pounds\u201d of individual marketers\u2019 spending, because advertisers pay per view and few people actually were shown ads next to objectionable videos.London\u2019s transportation agency, Transport for London, said it was satisfied with the refund it received for ads that ran next to extremist videos, but it hasn\u2019t resumed spending on YouTube.However, one media-agency executive said the refunds didn\u2019t compensate advertisers for the damage to their brands, including from the news stories showing their ads unwittingly funding hate speech. \u201cThe level of money [Google wants] to give back as a sorry is humiliating,\u201d the executive said.Google has met with scores of advertisers and agencies since March to help them ensure their ads only appear next to quality content.\u201cThey\u2019ve worked harder than we\u2019ve ever known Google to work to communicate that to advertisers and agencies,\u201d said Jenny Biggam, co-founder of U.K. independent media agency The7Stars.Corrections & Amplifications   In the 90 days from March 15 to June 13, digital-ad research firm Pathmatics estimated spending on ads that ran before YouTube videos or displayed on the YouTube site rose by 50% to $739 million, compared with a year earlier.

If that holds through the end of June, it would be the best month for the sector since February, when investors were still betting on an economic boom fueled by President Donald Trump\u2019s plans for tax cuts and deregulation.The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is up 5.4% this month through\u00a0Tuesday, while             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       is up 6.6% and             Morgan Stanley                   is up 9%.The stocks of banks, insurers and other financial institutions typically climb when the differential between short-term rates and long-term rates is rising, a development known as a steepening yield curve. That is often thought to boost the net interest margins that banks harvest from borrowing at low short-term rates and lending at higher long-term rates.But what is remarkable is that financials have rallied while the yield curve has been moving in the opposite direction. The differential between the two-year Treasury note yield and 10-year yield was at 0.81 percentage point\u00a0on Tuesday, near its smallest since 2007. That is down from 0.92 percentage point at the end of last month.The rally in financial stocks is at the center of diverging outlooks on the economy. Major stock indexes, and sectors such as financials that are sensitive to the economic outlook, have been gaining steam in recent sessions. At the same time, bond yields have been falling, signaling a less robust outlook for growth and inflation.\u201cAs much as the bond-market vigilantes like to think they are right, it\u2019s not always the case,\u201d said       Julian Emanuel,        an equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. \u201cPrice is a very powerful signaling mechanism, and the fact that the financials have outperformed while the yield curve is flattening leads us to believe there is a distinct possibility that the yield curve will stop flattening.\u201dDuring the week that ended June 14, investors poured $1.4 billion into funds that invest in the financial sector, the largest inflow\u00a0in 14 weeks, according to             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch. Investors also put $9 billion into bond funds, the 13th straight week of inflows. Meanwhile, investors have cooled on technology stocks in the past week, but still put $100 million into funds that invest in them.Before the recent upturn, many investors had soured on financials in recent months as Mr. Trump\u2019s policy agenda stalled and economic data took a weaker turn.             Citigroup Inc.\u2019s       U.S. economic-surprise index, which measures how data compare with forecasts, was at its lowest since 2011\u00a0on Friday\u00a0after inflation and retail-sales numbers came in below economists\u2019 expectations.If the economy continues to weaken, it could put the gains in the financial sector at risk. But at the moment, some see the economic outlook as excessively negative, meaning it is poised to rebound to match what bank stocks show. Plus, even if U.S. data continue to be soft, the global economy is expected to accelerate at the fastest pace since 2010 next year, according to Fitch Ratings.\u201cThe market is making new highs here and expectations for the economy have gone straight south,\u201d said       Bruce Bittles,        chief investment strategist at Baird. \u201cThat to me suggests the potential for an upside surprise is much greater than the potential for a downside surprise.\u201dOther factors that could support financial stocks: There are signs that the new administration wants to take a lighter touch to financial regulation. And while low market volatility can pose a challenge to banks\u2019 trading businesses, some analysts say volatility is poised to tick higher.\u201cThe selloff in April/May went too far as earnings estimates have continued to move higher,\u201d said Morgan Stanley equity strategist       Michael Wilson,        in a note to clients this week.

U.S. Ambassador       Nikki Haley       has said in the past that she hopes to show Americans the value of the U.N. and that the U.S. is committed to working with the U.N.Mr. Guterres made clear that his views diverge from the U.S. on a host of issues, including the decision to leave the Paris climate deal, budget cuts for U.N. programs, and the recent escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Russia in Syrian airspace.Mr. Guterres said proposed U.S. budget cuts would create \u201can unsolvable problem to the management of the U.N.\u201dOn another issue, he called on Washington to increase its support for refugee settlement, while also praising the U.S. for its \u201cgenerous and positive\u201d resettlement policy. The       Trump       administration\u2019s budget plan calls for a 25% decrease in refugee resettlement funds.Mr. Guterres took up his post in January, coinciding with the start of the Trump administration.

The U.S. is the largest contributor to U.N.\u2019s overall budget, giving $8 billion a year.Mr. Guterres also said he has taken an active role in mediating world crises, but acknowledged that the power of the U.N. had become limited in preventing and resolving conflicts. Terrorism, with now nearly daily attacks across Europe and Middle East, is another focus for the U.N.The General Assembly last week approved the establishment of a new U.N. counterterrorism office.

F 0.68%       said production of its Focus compact for the U.S. market is now headed for China\u2014not Mexico\u2014as the car maker seeks cost savings globally even as the Trump administration works to keep automotive jobs at home.Ford said last year it would move its once-hot Focus to Mexico in 2018. Under the plan announced Tuesday, production of the car in Michigan would end next year and Ford would begin importing Focuses from China in the latter half of 2019.The company, which is already making Focuses in China, said building the next-generation Focus in that country rather than in an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, will save it $500 million. The No. 2 U.S. auto maker and its rivals are trying to trim costs amid slowing U.S. sales and rising expenses related to technology investments, both of which are pressuring profits.The auto maker said relocating the Focus won\u2019t result in any job losses at the Michigan plant, where production of the small car began earlier in the decade. Ford plans to convert the factory to production of two new models\u2014the Bronco sport-utility vehicle and Ranger pickup\u2014starting in 2019, which will sustain the current workforce.The shift to Chinese factories has broad implications for the U.S. auto industry. Although Ford won\u2019t be the first Detroit company to import cars into the U.S. from China, the Focus shipments would be by far the highest volume of vehicles to go from Chinese factories to American dealerships. In 2016, Ford sold nearly 170,000 Focuses in the U.S.Companies producing in Mexico have been under pressure as the Trump administration renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement, a decades-old pact that led several auto makers to bulk up Mexican head count and production. Ford and rivals have already signaled changes in response to President       Donald Trump\u2019s       repeated attacks on companies importing cars from Mexico to the U.S.Mr. Trump had no immediate public reaction Tuesday, though other U.S. officials reacted coolly to the auto maker\u2019s move.\u201cThe Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,\u201d Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       said in a statement. \u201cI believe that as President Trump\u2019s policies and reforms take hold, more companies will begin to locate their facilities in the U.S. as several German and Japanese auto makers already have.\u201dWhite House spokesman       Sean Spicer       linked the move to the American tax system, saying passing a tax overhaul would lead firms to move manufacturing back to the U.S.Joe Hinrichs,        Ford\u2019s global operations president, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s push to rewrite Nafta wasn\u2019t influential in Ford\u2019s decision.Rather, with small-car sales slumping in the U.S., Mr. Hinrichs said it made more sense to add production in China, where it is already retooling its Focus plant for the next model, rather than spend additional money to convert an existing factory in Mexico.\u201cThis is really about saving capital, which is cash to reinvest in the business elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Hinrichs said.Many auto makers are scrambling to adjust to a weak U.S. market for passenger cars. Sales of small cars and family sedans have taken a hit in recent years as low gasoline prices fueled a shift in consumer demand toward roomier SUVs and pickup trucks.Mr. Trump criticized Ford\u2019s decision to move Focus production to Mexico during the presidential campaign even though Ford\u2019s plans to use the Michigan plant for pickup and SUV output would preserve thousands of United Auto Workers jobs.Critics say shifting any production to Mexico is problematic. Ford counters that such moves are necessary to preserve the bottom line.Ford softened the blow in January by saying it would cancel the plant planned in Mexico and allocate $700 million in savings to create jobs at a separate plant in Michigan slated to make electric cars.The turn to China may heighten the White House\u2019s concerns because vehicles coming from Asia are typically far less dependent on U.S. parts than those coming from Mexico.General Motors Co.       last year became the first major auto maker to rely on production in China for significant volumes of vehicles to be sold in the U.S. Buick dealerships have sold more than 30,000 Envision SUVs, built in northeast China, since that model went on sale in 2016.Sourcing vehicles from China allows global auto makers to make better use of capacity in the world\u2019s largest car market amid a slowdown in sales growth there. A combination of factors, including hefty tariffs and lower logistics costs, means U.S. workers have essentially no role in the construction of those vehicles.Unlike cars built in Mexico, which often carry several components made by U.S. parts suppliers and shipped duty free, the Buick Envision relies on Chinese sources for 88% of its components, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Only 1% is provided by U.S. or Canadian companies, the NHTSA says.Mr. Hinrichs said the decision to relocate the Focus should have limited impact on North American supplier jobs because the company has a slew of new models coming that will be built in the region, including several new SUVs.The Focus built in Michigan gets about 46% of its parts from Canadian or U.S. suppliers, according to the NHTSA.GM is also signaling a reconsideration of its reliance on Mexican facilities. In its case, GM has said it wants to use more American-made parts in pickup trucks and large SUVs being introduced in coming years.Last week, for instance, the auto maker said it would open a new supplier park in Texas, expecting the creation of 600 U.S. jobs for work that would have otherwise been handled by Mexican workers.In addition to shifting economics and global demand, auto makers are grappling with political uncertainty in the U.S. as Republican lawmakers promote a border-adjusted tax that would put imports at a disadvantage.The Trump administration is preparing to renegotiate Nafta in ways that could change the rules of the game for auto makers. For example, some administration officials have backed tightening the \u201crules of origin\u201d that spell out how much of a car has to come from North America in order for the vehicle to be shipped from Mexico to the U.S. duty free.Tightening the rules of origin for a car with significant overseas components could destroy the advantage Mexico has over other countries, including China.

QCOM 0.87%       on Tuesday, arguing in a court filing that some of the chip supplier\u2019s patents were invalid and that its business model violates patent law.The filing,\u00a0to a federal court in the Southern District of California, comes about five months after Apple\u2019s opening salvo against Qualcomm, claiming the chip company demanded unfair terms for the use of its technology.Qualcomm, whose chips and patents are widely used in smartphones, has accused Apple of mischaracterizing its business and has sued four of Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers for withholding royalty payments on Qualcomm technology used in iPhones and iPads.In its response on Tuesday, Apple said that about a dozen Qualcomm patents were invalid because they conflict with already established patents, while others weren\u2019t essential for cellular communication.Qualcomm usually licenses its patents in a bundle that includes both patents deemed essential to cellular communications and others that aren\u2019t.\u201cWe have brought this [filing] to highlight the issue that they want to collect patent royalties without identifying patents and the patents we have looked at in their portfolio certainly don\u2019t justify the kind of demands they have been making,\u201d an Apple executive said.Qualcomm General Counsel       Don Rosenberg       defended the company\u2019s patents in a statement, saying its \u201cinnovations are at the heart of every iPhone and enable the most important uses and features of those devices. It simply is untrue that Qualcomm is seeking to collect royalties for Apple innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm\u2019s technology.\u201dApple updated its arguments against Qualcomm to include the Supreme Court\u2019s recent affirmation that patent holders can\u2019t keep rights over a product after it is sold. The ruling came in May after a lawsuit brought by Lexmark International Inc. against printer stores that disabled microchips in its printer cartridges and sold toner refills.Apple said the Supreme Court ruling showed a patent holder can only demand a single reward for its products and that Qualcomm is going against that principle by requiring anyone who wants to buy its chips to also pay royalties on the technology in them.Apple\u2019s latest filing also\u00a0asked the court to weigh in on the dispute with its contract manufacturers. Qualcomm has sought a court order to force the four Taiwanese companies to pay royalties on technology used in iPhones and iPads, according to their previous agreements with Qualcomm.Apple says that it pays the entirety of those royalties for the manufacturers\u2014            Compal Electronics Inc.Foxconn Technology                   Group,             Pegatron Corp.       and             Wistron Corp.      \u2014and argues that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing agreements with them aren\u2019t enforceable because the royalties includes invalid patents.

It increased to a high of $3,018, only to fall 27%. The currency then recovered somewhat and by late Tuesday was trading at $2,810.The sharp swings come amid bitter jousting by bitcoin developers and businesses over how best to expand the currency\u2019s processing capacity and could result in it being split into separate, competing coins. On one side: those who want bitcoin to act more like a digital version of gold, a commodity with a limited supply that can be held as a store of value.The opposing camp wants bitcoin to look more like a currency, a unit that can be used to settle transactions. That faction wants bitcoin to be as fast and easy to trade as a dollar.The two sides have been at a stalemate, but new proposals expected to launch this summer could provide a breakthrough\u2014either changes in the bitcoin network\u2019s processing capacity or a split between a high-speed and slow-speed bitcoin.\u201cYou watch a fine marriage that is falling apart,\u201d says       Emin Gun Sirer,        a Cornell professor who studies virtual currencies. \u201cEventually, you say, I think a divorce is the best thing.\u201dThe bickering has hindered interest in the virtual currency, sending some to a newer alternative, ethereum, that has surged more than 40-fold this year and is now valued at only about 20% less than all of the traded bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.com.\u201cA lot of my friends are selling their bitcoin and buying ethereum,\u201d says       Zachary Mallard,        who runs a men\u2019s grooming-products business in the Brooklyn borough of New York. Mr. Mallard bought some ethereum in recent months, passing up on bitcoin in part because he views the potential split in the currency as limiting the potential gains.The debate between the two sides has intensified in recent weeks as bitcoin has rallied 190% this year\u2014despite the recent swings in the currency\u2019s value. Ultimately, how the trading is structured will help determine who controls the currency, and who potentially gets rich from that control.As it was developed in 2008 by the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin has a limited supply, 21 million coins, that are released on a set schedule and awarded to businesses that confirm transactions in a process known as mining.The network it trades on was designed to be fast and cheap, operating without middlemen, with an immutable ledger recording transactions. The ledger, also known as blockchain, is simultaneously transparent to users and protective of the identity of buyers and sellers, some of whom historically used bitcoin for money laundering or other illegal purposes.Briefly, this is how bitcoin trades: Individual transactions on the network are packed into blocks by companies that specialize in processing the trades, so-called miners. Under its current structure, the size of those blocks is capped, allowing only about seven transactions per second, far below the hundreds of thousands a network like             Visa                   can process.In bitcoin\u2019s early days, the limit wasn\u2019t an issue. That has changed as bitcoin transactions have surged and the currency has piqued more widespread curiosity. The result has been bottlenecks and rising transaction fees.Many investors and processors have pushed to increase the limits in an effort to make bitcoin trade more like a modern-day currency.But purists and some developers have fought back, in part because it could hurt their financial interests, but also because it goes against their libertarian, anti-big-business bent. Raising the limits would likely make mining more expensive, shutting out some smaller players and leading to a greater centralization of mining, they say.With past efforts at compromise between the two sides failing, \u201cwe\u2019ve reached the point now where we accept that it\u2019s a possibility\u201d that the factions will go their separate ways, said       Eric Lombrozo,        one of bitcoin\u2019s leading developers.Last week, a prominent bitcoin-mining company, BitMain, released a plan to alter bitcoin\u2019s underlying software that would result in two live versions at the same time. There are other proposals as well that would have the same effect. It isn\u2019t clear which if any will be adopted by miners, developers and users.On paper, everyone seems to be in favor of raising the capacity limits. In practice, there are two sides starkly divided over how to do that. One group, led by businesses, wants to raise the size limit for all bitcoin trading. The other, led by developers, wants to create what is essentially another, subordinate network for processing transactions quickly. This option would leave the current main network unchanged.People involved in the fight say the fate of bitcoin may become clearer in the next two months as owners and miners vote on the various proposals to break the logjam.Arching over all of this is the question of who ultimately controls bitcoin. \u201cWhy is it so acrimonious?\u201d Mr. Gun Sirer asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about the parameters, it\u2019s not about the block size.

This would give Mr. Cuomo a majority of voters on the board.The board has 23 members, though not all of them have a vote.\u201cThe MTA is in a state of crisis,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cThe bureaucracy is dysfunctional.\u201dAs governor, Mr. Cuomo already holds significant power over the MTA. The Democrat already has the largest number of appointees to the agency and holds sway over its policy-making and purse strings.In recent months, the MTA has come under fire for a rash of subway delays, breakdowns and other malfunctions.Legislators were cool to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal for additional seats, which was introduced with only some 24 hours left in the legislative session. Some transit advocates said he already had the power to fix the subways.The Riders Alliance, a transit-advocacy group, said the proposal \u201cobscures the very real fact that the governor already controls the MTA\u2026The problem is not MTA board structure; the problem is the absence of leadership.\u201dOn Monday, the state Senate approved       Carl Weisbrod       to the MTA board. Mr. Weisbrod, a longtime city planner, is Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fourth and final board appointment, giving him his full measure of voting power as he vows to do more to speak up for subway riders.The mayor last week described the state of the subways as a crisis and said the city would come up with a plan to address the issue if Mr. Cuomo didn\u2019t.

Yet\u00a0on Thursday, it will be New Jersey\u2019s Senate that honors his tenure as a commissioner on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.There will be no such send-off from New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        the man who appointed him.Mr. Lipper, 76 years old, has been an irritant to Mr. Cuomo for much of the time since he joined the board in 2013 in the unpaid position. His departure\u2014as his term ended and wasn\u2019t extended by Mr. Cuomo\u2014comes at a time when other New York commissioners are exiting as the New York governor takes a tighter grip on the agency.\u201cI am proud to say that I went through four years and came out the other end, despite incredible pressure and threats from every level of government, and that I just did what I felt was the right thing for the public,\u201d Mr. Lipper said Tuesday at his home in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo,       Jon Weinstein,        said Mr. Lipper didn\u2019t face pressure on the agency board. \u201cCommissioner Lipper was frequently a minority of one on issues facing the board,\u201d he said.The Port Authority controls most of the region\u2019s major bridges, tunnels and airports, as well as the 16-acre World Trade Center site. Every year it spends billions of dollars building and maintaining infrastructure across the region.The governors of New York and New Jersey each appoint six commissioners to the board. Mr. Lipper\u2019s term, which ended this month, was notable for his outspokenness, in particular against some of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Port Authority priorities.During Mr. Lipper\u2019s first year on the board he blocked a $1.2 billion subsidy to Silverstein Properties for the building of 3 World Trade Center.Later, he joined forces with New Jersey commissioners and state senators to fight for a new Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, which Mr. Cuomo tried to stall.Mr. Lipper also called proposals to build rail links to LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International airports a $4 billion waste of public money.Mr. Cuomo has made infrastructure central to his administration, from building a new Tappan Zee Bridge to the opening of the Second Avenue subway. At the Port Authority, he has made renovations of LaGuardia and       John F. Kennedy       airports a priority.That has brought him into conflict with Mr. Lipper, who believes that in a constrained financial environment a new Manhattan bus terminal is a higher priority than elements of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s agenda, such as an AirTrain to LaGuardia.New Jersey state Sen.       Loretta Weinberg       said she and her colleagues want to recognize Mr. Lipper\u2019s approach to the agency. \u201cI think he always had the interests of the region at heart,\u201d she said.Mr. Lipper\u2019s former Port Authority colleague,       Scott Rechler,        was less effusive. The former vice chairman of the agency and an ally of Mr. Cuomo, said Mr. Lipper sometimes made life more difficult at an agency where its hard to get things done. \u201cHe added roadblocks and became less constructive, even though he may have been well intentioned,\u201d Mr. Rechler said.At Mr. Lipper\u2019s last board meeting, on June 15, the Port Authority\u2019s vice chairman,       Jeffrey Lynford,        an appointee of Mr. Cuomo, called Mr. Lipper \u201ca role model for speaking without fear or favor.\u201dAt the same meeting, Port Authority Chairman       John Degnan       bade farewell to two other New York appointees, Hamilton \u201cTony\u201d James, president of private-equity firm             Blackstone Group                   LP, and       Michael Fascitelli,        a former president of Vornado Realty Trust.Mr. Degnan rued the loss of their financial and real-estate expertise.Like Mr. Lipper, Mr. Fascitelli\u2019s term ends at the end of this month and won\u2019t be renewed. Mr. James resigned shortly after Mr. Cuomo shepherded through legislation in New York establishing a New York inspector general for the Port Authority.Mr. James, through a spokeswoman, said his resignation had nothing to do with the inspector general. \u201cHis decision was based on the time commitment required and other competing priorities for him personally and professionally,\u201d the spokeswoman said.The agency already has an inspector general\u2019s office with a budget of $34 million.Mr. Cuomo says the New York IG is necessary to root out corruption at the agency. \u201cConsidering the size, scope, and amount of taxpayer dollars invested in large-scale downstate infrastructure, subject-matter specific oversight is absolutely essential,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.Mr. Lipper contends Mr. Cuomo\u2019s IG, who would serve at the governor\u2019s pleasure, with the power to open investigations, would be a \u201ccoercive mechanism.\u201d\u201cPublic service is a wonderful thing,\u201d Mr. Lipper said. \u201cBut when you feel in peril for doing the right thing, it\u2019s a huge counterbalance.\u201dAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'N.J.

They have fallen in four of the past five sessions to a new low for the year.Prices are down 20.6% since Feb. 23, marking the sixth bear market for crude in four years and the first since August. Crude prices have lost 62% since settling at $115.06 a barrel three years ago. A bear market is typically defined as a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak, while a bull market is a gain of 20% or more from a recent trough.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this decline amid some major OPEC production restraints,\u201d said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates. \u201cThat\u2019s the huge difference\u201d compared with previous bear markets.The oil market has also been more volatile this spring. Traders have crowded into bullish positions, only to reverse suddenly when the market failed to respond to positive data or news that OPEC was extending its cuts. Tuesday\u2019s move marked oil\u2019s eighth loss of more than 2% in the past two months.Investors are starting to worry that oil\u2019s steady declines may start to drag down other markets. When the oil-price plunge gathered steam at the end of 2015, analysts blamed crude in part for sparking selloffs in other commodities, emerging markets and other risky assets.The S&P GSCI index, which broadly tracks commodity prices, fell 1.2% Tuesday. The S&P 500\u2019s energy sector, already the worst-performing group of stocks in the index, dropped an additional 1.2%. Seven out of the 10 worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year are energy stocks, according to FactSet.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a buyer\u2019s strike out there on the equities side,\u201d said       Dan Pickering,        head of the asset-management arm of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. \u201cI love the values I see, but I\u2019m scared to death to put money to work.\u201dThere are also signs that anxiety is spreading to the debt market. Bonds of oil and gas companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings, or junk bonds, have held up for most of this year, but anxiety is starting to creep in, analysts and investors say. The Bloomberg Barclays high-yield energy index has returned negative 1.6% since the beginning of June, through Monday.The deepening oil rout brought strong demand for long-term U.S. government bonds, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury debt to the lowest level this year Tuesday. Lower energy prices tend to deflate inflation expectations, making long-term Treasury debt more appealing.Falling oil prices are typically helpful to U.S. consumers and the companies that serve them. Airlines made record profits last year in part from lower oil prices and were girding for profits to fall this year if oil rose. Lower prices in the futures market are also likely to show up at gasoline pumps in the months ahead, potentially lowering costs for drivers at the end of summer driving season.But as the U.S. energy production has grown and become a bigger part of the overall economy, many companies have recently been touting the benefits of higher oil prices. They now stand to lose out.Neiman Marcus Group Ltd., for one, a week ago credited higher oil prices with improving traffic in its Texas stores. Railroad executives have been concerned about shrinking oil shipments on their lines after low prices forced drillers to cut back two years ago.

It would also mandate punishment of malicious cyber actors and curtail financing to Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors.It is intended in part to reprimand Moscow for Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, which is specifically cited in the legislation. It passed the Senate on Thursday on a 98-2 vote.Democratic lawmakers said the House can get around the constitutional issue but they fear the White House is putting pressure on House Republicans to block the bill. Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, called the issue a \u201cdelay tactic.\u201d\u201cThe public shouldn\u2019t be fooled by complex-sounding parliamentary procedure,\u201d he said in a statement.The legislation\u2014which erodes the administration\u2019s control over Russia sanctions policy and gives more power to Congress\u2014hasn\u2019t so far received backing from the White House.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to wait and see what happens in the House before we weigh in on that package,\u201d White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       said Tuesday.The sanctions were expected to have broad support in the House, both from Republicans and Democrats, with Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) and Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.) each having backed stronger Russia sanctions.The near-unanimous support for the bill in the Senate raises the possibility that Congress could override any White House veto with a two-thirds majority.Lawmakers from both parties said they supported sending the bill directly to the House floor, to avoid facing delays in committees.\u201cIf there\u2019s general agreement, which I think there is on the sanctions bill, perhaps bypassing the committee, just from a timing standpoint would be necessary,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.If the bill were to become law, it likely would block any hope in Moscow for sanctions relief in the short term and hamper any effort by President       Donald Trump       to remove the penalties until Russia displays a significant change in behavior.Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday he wasn\u2019t worried about the bill dying in the House because \u201cthere\u2019s too much publicity\u201d around the sanctions.U.S. intelligence officials earlier this year issued a report concluding Russia ordered an influence campaign to aid Mr. Trump in his battle in the 2016 election against Democratic candidate       Hillary Clinton.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 19:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-sanctions-bill-faces-delay-in-house-1498001956", "news_title": "Russia Sanctions Bill Faces Delay in House", "keywords": "russia congress bill,russia sanctions,russia senate bill,russia u.s. election,trump administration russia,trump russia,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "Last week the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced changes in its top management that raised eyebrows because of both their timing and their character.When       Thomas P. Campbell       announced in February that he was stepping down as director and CEO effective June 30, the board named the museum\u2019s president, Daniel H. Weiss, as interim CEO, and the stage was set for a director search. At the time there was every expectation that once that position was filled, the CEO title would revert back to the director, as had been the case since 1998. Under that arrangement, the president, responsible for finances and administration, reported to the director, who in turn was solely responsible for the museum\u2019s art component\u2014acquisitions, exhibitions and the like.But in a surprise move last week, the board permanently added the CEO position to Mr. Weiss\u2019s portfolio and, most striking of all, announced that the director would now report to the president.Institutions need to adapt and change, and when he was director Philippe de Montebello used to caution against the Met becoming \u201ca museum of itself.\u201d But with Mr. Weiss having spent a year or more struggling to eliminate a deficit and come up with a workable budget for future years, the announcement raised the question of whether this new arrangement means that financial concerns will henceforth take precedence over the intellectual and aesthetic values that have made the Met the great museum it is.Already there is cause for concern. For some months the museum has been in talks with the city about modifying its pay-what-you-wish admissions policy to institute a mandatory fee for out-of-towners. Aside from representing a startling departure from New York\u2019s historic \u201cGive me your\u2026\u201d attitude of unqualified welcome to outsiders, this is an idea that smacks a little too much of the green eyeshade.The admission fee is one of the most vexing issues museums have to deal with. It is where the idealistic goal of giving as many as possible access to culture\u2019s riches meets the unforgiving need for enough money to keep the place running. Museums have experimented with all sorts of solutions, but I\u2019ve always felt the Met\u2019s was the closest to perfection. It establishes the principle that nothing in life is free, while positioning the bar so low as to be an impediment to no one.Yet looking at the Met\u2019s proposal, you\u2019d think this was never an issue. Instead the aim seems to be to wring revenue and savings out of every nook and cranny, regardless. This is the mindset of the head of a commercial enterprise, not a cultural institution.Then there is the matter of the director\u2019s role. Mr. Weiss, a former college president, is also an art historian, the first such person to serve as president. But this fact, combined with the director\u2019s newly subordinate role, may make it hard for the Met to attract the top-tier talent it needs. What aspiring Philippe de Montebello would want to walk into a glorified chief curator\u2019s job\u2014the rung on the ladder just below director? And if they did, would they be caught up in a turf war with an art-historian-president determined to put his stamp on matters curatorial?Hanging over the Met\u2019s new arrangement is the specter of what happened in Los Angeles nearly a decade ago. In January 2010 Michael Brand abruptly resigned as director of the J. Paul Getty Museum. Anonymous art-world insiders quoted in news reports at the time cited friction over art and museum issues between Mr. Brand and James N. Wood, president and CEO of the Getty Trust. Mr. Wood was not only Mr. Brand\u2019s supervisor but a career museum director who had spent 25 years running the Art Institute of Chicago before coming to the Getty in 2006.The precondition for stability going forward will be establishing clear lines of responsibility and authority. So Mr. Weiss needs to publicly telegraph that he harbors no curatorial or other ambitions related to the museum\u2019s core mission\u2014that the director\u2019s job will be done by the director alone.Yet this does not mean that Mr. Weiss needs to check his art-history credentials at the door. Far from it, for they allow him to bring a more nuanced perspective to financial stewardship.Much of what a museum like the Met does is important but not necessarily \u201csexy.\u201d Therefore a president versed only in business administration might look askance at a funding request for an acquisition or exhibition of a rarefied sort, deeming it too obscure and lacking the necessary popular appeal. But were Mr. Weiss to get a proposal involving, say, Hiberno-Saxon manuscript illumination or Scandinavian Impressionism\u2014the kind of subjects familiar only to specialists\u2014he would be in a position to evaluate it on its merits. So Mr. Weiss should also declare that he will use his background as an art historian only as an \u201chonest broker\u201d between the competing imperatives of art and the bottom line.The last thing the Met needs now is more turmoil.

Along the way, the author shows why gradual reform\u2014the leitmotif for Western supporters of \u201cpragmatic\u201d Iranian president       Hassan Rouhani       and of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal\u2014is unlikely.Mr. Parsa, a professor of sociology at Dartmouth, digs deep into Persian primary material often ignored in Washington policy discussions, intelligence analysis and journalism. He also mines data from other authoritarian countries to compare and contrast those that have transformed peacefully with those that have changed more violently but still democratically (Indonesia) or erupted and returned to dictatorship (Egypt). Mr. Parsa\u2019s careful scholarship leads him to one overarching conclusion: A peaceful evolution to a more humane system in the Islamic Republic, let alone a more democratic one, isn\u2019t in the cards.Mr. Parsa argues convincingly that Iran is instead moving toward greater internal oppression and foreign wars, which will produce ever more convulsive internal dissent. As evidence, he lays out a series of ironies that highlight the dysfunction in Iran. A revolution for the common man has produced a vast empire of corruption among an all-powerful elite as society has become more stratified than under the Pahlavi dynasty. A ruling clique that saw universities in revolution against the shah is now perpetually at war with higher education\u2014which, despite Islamized curricula, keeps producing rebellious students.A theocratic regime has made Shiites less observant: Few attend the ever-shrinking supply of functioning mosques. The numbers here are striking: Mr. Parsa relates that \u201ca Revolutionary Guard commander, Zia Eddin Hozni, recently announced that about 3,000 of the country\u2019s 57,000 Shiite mosques, or only 5 percent, were fully operational during the year.\u201d As of 2012, nearly half of them \u201clacked clerics and prayer leaders.\u201d In a clerical state, fewer and fewer young men want to become clerics, Mr. Parsa\u2019s statistics show. Young women from traditional families are declining to take mullahs as mates. (Even at the end of the Soviet Union, the communist elite never lost their cachet as marriage partners.) Clerics trying to tell citizens to behave properly have been beaten severely. Their desire to serve in parliament has waned, as has the people\u2019s willingness to elect them. In 1980, 60.7% of the deputies in the Majles\u2014the Iranian parliament that rubber-stamps the theocracy\u2014were clerics. After the 2016 elections, their number had declined to 5.5%.By Misagh Parsa  Harvard, 406 pages, $45Mr. Parsa highlights how the regime is its own worst enemy: In religion, economics and culture, the state heavily intrudes, politicizing the personal and apolitical. How Iranians dress and socialize, what they read, write and watch, how they practice their faith and whom they recognize as religious authorities\u2014areas where believers could once exercise considerable individual discretion\u2014have all been subject to intolerant state oversight. Beyond oil and gas, the once mostly private economy has been increasingly divvied up among the clerics and their allies. \u201cThe relatively high level of state involvement in so many aspects of Iranian society has forced the state to rely on continuous repression to maintain power,\u201d Mr. Parsa writes. This violent politicization has diminished social cohesion, eroding any common ground that might allow Iran\u2019s opposing factions to come together in pursuit of peaceful reform. \u201cThe result in the long run,\u201d Mr. Parsa concludes, \u201cis likely to be a movement to transform the political system through a disruptive, revolutionary route.\u201dIn 1978, it took a year for opposition to the shah to radicalize and openly seek revolution. In 2009, after a bitterly contested presidential election that brought millions onto the streets in Iran\u2019s major cities, dissent radicalized within one week. Yet this pro-democracy Green Movement still failed, and one of the reasons why is that its leadership\u2014especially the presidential candidates       Mir Hossein Mousavi       and       Mehdi Karroubi      \u2014were unprepared to back an assault on the system that they had done so much to build. Mr. Parsa suggests that inevitable future eruptions will have a leadership more in sync with the people.Mr. Parsa gives credit to the prowess of the coercive institutions of the state, especially the Revolutionary Guard Corps and its lower-class thugs in the Basij, the regime\u2019s morality police-cum-Brownshirts who saved the day in 2009. But the author questions the solidity of the guards. The theocracy\u2019s indispensable praetorians have become in part a draft army and also a massive business enterprise. Even though the 2009 insurrection was put down, supreme leader       Ali Khamenei       fired several Revolutionary Guard commanders when they failed to show sufficient resoluteness against protesters.Mr. Parsa\u2019s book isn\u2019t a stylistic tour de force, though it is mercifully free of most of the jargon that now cripples so much academic writing. While anyone curious about Iran will find it illuminating, for those working in government or the foreign-affairs community, it is mandatory reading. Although Mr. Parsa barely discusses U.S. policy toward Iran, his book is easily the most important work in English on the Islamic Republic since the revolution. He sagely casts doubt on those from       Jimmy Carter       to       Barack Obama       who have been naive about the regime\u2019s potential for reform. The book is a comprehensive refutation of the Obama administration\u2019s hopes that increasing commerce with Iran would moderate the regime and that it was safe to put an expiration date on the regulation of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.Moderation and reform among Iran\u2019s ruling elite aren\u2019t coming. Another popular pro-democracy rebellion is. Those who value freedom for Iran\u2019s citizens and security for the rest of the world can only hope that Mr. Parsa\u2019s counter-revolutionary prediction is validated sooner rather than later.Mr. Gerecht is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 19:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tehrans-own-worst-enemy-1498000880", "news_title": "Tehran\u2019s Own Worst Enemy", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,reviews"}, {"content": "For a guy who supposedly likes to fire people, President       Trump       has been strangely reluctant to remove Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director       Richard Cordray.       Yet his own Treasury Department has made an excellent case for dismissal.Last week Treasury issued a report with recommendations to increase certainty, consumer choice and access to credit in the financial system. Big banks are cheering proposed changes to relax liquidity and capital standards, but reforms to the CFPB might matter to more people.Some of Treasury\u2019s recommendations would require legislation\u2014such as making the agency subject to congressional appropriations\u2014though most could be achieved through regulatory and procedural changes by the CFPB. The problem is that Mr. Cordray won\u2019t accept curbs on his power. Dodd-Frank states that the President may remove the director only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d rather than at-will like other agency heads. Yet the report enumerates a litany of ways in which Mr. Cordray has flouted the law.Treasury notes the \u201cCFPB has avoided notice-and-comment rulemaking and instead relied to an unusual degree on enforcement actions and guidance documents.\u201d The Administrative Procedure Act requires regulatory agencies to issue formal rule-makings, or at least formal guidance, to explicate law. Mr. Cordray says \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d guide the bureau\u2019s legal interpretations.The CFPB has even refused to provide guidance to Congress on behavior that may constitute \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices.\u201d Enforcement actions are its only guidance. In 2012 the agency published a compliance bulletin for credit companies in conjunction with a $210 million settlement with             Capital One Financial Corp.       for alleged deceptive marketing.The CFPB targeted auto dealers, which Congress explicitly exempted under Dodd-Frank. The bureau charged discrimination based on a dubious disparate-impact analysis that guessed the victims\u2019 race based on names and addresses. In January the CFPB accused student loan servicer Navient, which is regulated by the Education Department, of abusing borrowers by placing them in forbearance rather than loan forgiveness.The bureau has also abused its authority by issuing sweeping civil investigative demands\u2014essentially fishing expeditions\u2014that lack the legal protections of subpoenas and motions for discovery for prosecuted parties. Targets can challenge the document demands, but the CFPB shames supplicants by publishing its rejections and has never publicly agreed to narrow the scope.In April the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals squashed a civil investigative demand to the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. The court whacked CFPB for extending its authority over a nonprofit that isn\u2019t even tangentially involved in finance as well as failing to provide a description \u201cof the conduct the CFPB is interested in investigating.\u201dThe CFPB tries to avoid court rebukes by using its own administrative law judges to adjudicate cases, which occur on an expedited timeframe and lack the judiciary\u2019s due process protections. Incredibly, the bureau says its enforcement actions are also not subject to a statute of limitations, which the D.C. Circuit last year held was \u201cabsurd.\u201dTreasury argues that the CFPB\u2019s \u201clack of clear regulatory standards may lead to excessive risk-aversion among regulated parties thereby undermining innovation and consumer choice.\u201d They also undermine the U.S. constitutional system of checks and balances.The report recommends that the CFPB clearly define unfair, deceptive and abuses practices as well as issue rules subject to public comment and notice. Treasury also implores the bureau to curtail its use of administrative law judges and civil investigative demands, among other measures of self-restraint.Mr. Cordray\u2019s term doesn\u2019t end until July 2018, and implementing Treasury\u2019s reforms as well as attendant rule-makings could take more than a year. Meantime, Mr. Cordray can continue shaking down businesses with enforcement that he hopes will propel his expected campaign for Governor in Ohio. Mr. Cordray might not even mind being fired and becoming The Resistance\u2019s next martyr.

Even as China aims to attract more global capital, authorities continue to intervene in domestic stock and currency markets, and take on speculators.MSCI said the decision won broad support from international institutional investors and was primarily the result of the country\u2019s steps to improve \u201cthe accessibility of the China A market,\u201d including its decision to loosen requirements for foreign fund providers seeking approval from Chinese exchanges for products linked to its indexes.\u201cWe believe there are still material access and investor protection issues outstanding,\u201d said       Timothy Atwill,        head of investment strategy at Seattle-based Parametric Portfolio Associates, a unit of             Eaton Vance Corp.       that manages $197.8 billion, ahead of the announcement. For example, China still limits the amount of money that foreign investors can repatriate each month.The inclusion, expected to take effect in two stages roughly a year from now, means the funds that track MSCI indexes will automatically allocate money into China, a market that has historically been the domain of stock pickers who decide which shares to buy and sell.The Emerging Markets Index is tracked by money managers with $1.6 trillion in assets, according to MSCI. About one-third of emerging-market stocks are invested through passive vehicles such as exchange-traded funds, which aim to match the returns from an index, according to Franklin Templeton Investments.Jorge Mariscal,        emerging-markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, which oversees $1 trillion in assets, said ahead of the announcement that such a move would be a catalyst for investors like him to start looking at the A-shares, in which he doesn\u2019t invest.\u201cA lot of our clients use benchmarks such as the MSCI index,\u201d he said.At present, foreign investors hold just 1.5% of the Chinese stock market.Meanwhile, MSCI decided not to add Argentina shares to the emerging-markets index this year, citing investor concerns over market accessibility.MSCI indexes already include Chinese companies\u2019 shares listed in cities like Hong Kong and New York, but not those in mainland China. The combined market capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges is $7.5 trillion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, making it the second-biggest stock market in the world after the U.S.MSCI said 222 companies would be eligible for inclusion, increasing China\u2019s weighting in the emerging-market index by 0.73 percentage point from its current 28%. The change will also be reflected in other indexes, including the MSCI All Country World Index.MSCI had previously said it expected to increase China\u2019s weight over time to as much as 45% of the emerging-market index. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts estimated that a total of $210 billion of index money could flow into China in the next five years, as MSCI increases China\u2019s weighting.Concerns about China\u2019s restrictions on foreign investors had contributed to the proposals\u2019 rejection in previous years. The index provider\u2019s decision to delay adding A-shares in 2015 triggered a steep selloff in China\u2019s stock market, leading authorities to intervene to stop the rout by banning investors from selling stocks and allowing companies to suspend trading of shares, among other measures. These moves further deterred some foreign investors from entering the market.In the 2017 proposal, MSCI reduced the number of stocks eligible for inclusion by roughly two-thirds from its previous proposals, eliminating securities suspended for more than 50 days and companies that are also listed in Hong Kong.During the past year, Chinese regulators have opened up the Shenzhen market through a new program in order to lure back foreign investors, allowing them to access thousands of mainland-listed stocks without applying for a quota\u2014the maximum amount that a foreign investor can put in the Chinese markets\u2014or subjecting them to capital restrictions.

Opposition challenger       Martin Schulz       on Monday offered a tax plan that may force Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to respond.Mr. Schulz\u2019s proposals are mostly in character for his center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). He\u2019d increase the top personal income-tax rate to 48% from 45% on incomes above \u20ac250,000 (about $280,000), and the second-highest rate to 45% from 42%. Capital-gains and dividend taxes would rise by applying the regular personal-income rates to capital income, rather than the current 25% rate. He\u2019d use most of the money to pay for roads and schools.These plans never work as advertised because the higher rates don\u2019t produce the promised increase in revenue. Taxpayers respond to higher rates by changing their behavior, especially as capital and labor become more mobile. But Mrs. Merkel can\u2019t ignore Mr. Schulz\u2019s plan because he tackles a problem she should have fixed years ago.The best part of the SPD plan would increase the income threshold at which the second-highest rate kicks in, to \u20ac76,000 from \u20ac54,000. Mr. Schulz also wants to flatten what\u2019s known as the \u201cmiddle class belly.\u201d Germany\u2019s income tax is calculated via an equation that applies a different marginal rate to each additional euro of income up to that threshold.Now that rate increases rapidly at the lower end of the income scale before leveling off toward the top\u2014it\u2019s supposed to look like a protruding stomach when you graph it. Mr. Schulz is right to want to flatten it so that the marginal disincentive to work for another euro of income isn\u2019t so bad.This throws down a challenge to Mrs. Merkel and her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Mrs. Merkel has grudgingly heeded demands from her party for tax cuts. Her finance minister,       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,        promises a package worth \u20ac15 billion a year in the next Parliament, though it isn\u2019t clear which taxes Mrs. Merkel would cut.She\u2019d be smart to rise to Mr. Schulz\u2019s challenge by offering her own tax plan soon, flattening that middle-class belly without raising rates on capital and Germany\u2019s most productive\u2014and mobile\u2014workers. With a record fiscal surplus of \u20ac54 billion a year and counting, she doesn\u2019t need to follow Mr. Schulz down the fiscal rabbit hole of trying to replace the revenue that is supposedly lost by allowing citizens to keep more of their own money.The wild card is corporate-tax reform, which Mr. Schulz left out of his plan. Some CDU members believe this should be a cornerstone of their proposal. There\u2019s plenty of scope to cut rates that rise to 33%. Germany might have no choice if President Trump pushes through a major corporate-tax reform in America, or if Britain lowers its rate to 15% or less post-Brexit.One irony of Mrs. Merkel\u2019s long Chancellorship is that on economics she has largely lived off the pro-growth reforms made by her center-left predecessor,       Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.       Mrs. Merkel has done little for reform while adding enormous economic costs with her green-energy schemes. A supply-side tax reform would offer a contrast to Mr. Schulz and a reason beyond inertia to elect her for another term.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 19:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-tax-debate-1498000349", "news_title": "Germany\u2019s Tax Debate", "keywords": " angela merkel,germany, income tax, martin schulz, middle class belly, tax reform, wolfgang schauble,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Bruce Rauner       spent a chunk of his personal fortune running for Governor in 2014 to save Illinois from its tax-and-spend political class. More than two years later it looks like the former private equity star has made better investments.On Tuesday evening the Governor with the worst job in America explained why he and his fellow Republicans have offered to raise taxes for the sake of ending a multiyear budget impasse with Democrats. He said he\u2019ll accept a four-year increase in the flat state income tax to 4.95% from the current 3.75%, expand the sales tax and implement a cable and satellite TV tax.This is a political defeat by any definition since Mr. Rauner campaigned on lowering the income tax to 3%, not on restoring the rate close to what it was under the last Democratic Governor. The \u201ctemporary\u201d 5% rate partially sunset in December 2014. Democrats who run the legislature refused to negotiate over a budget unless Mr. Rauner agreed to a tax increase, and now they\u2019re refusing to make notable spending or economic reforms in return.Mr. Rauner is also proposing to freeze property taxes and says the deal will reduce the state\u2019s backlog of unpaid bills by at least $4 billion. The property-tax freeze could provide some election contrast with Democrats. But a freeze isn\u2019t a reduction from already sky-high property levies, and the current backlog of unpaid state bills is $15.1 billion.The bigger problem is that his proposed deal includes almost none of the reforms Illinois desperately needs to compete with neighboring states and repair its fisc. It includes nothing on right-to-work and little workers\u2019 compensation reform. It doesn\u2019t give local governments the collective-bargaining reforms they need and it fails to solve the state\u2019s $130 billion or so in unfunded pension liabilities.The Governor\u2019s capitulation may have been triggered by the latest downgrade by             Moody\u2019s                   and Standard & Poor\u2019s in the state bond rating to near junk status, with a warning that another downgrade could come this summer. Mr. Rauner doesn\u2019t want to run for re-election next year as Governor Junk.But the rating agencies have never met a tax increase they didn\u2019t like. They merely want to see more revenue coming in so they can judge if bondholders will get repaid. The real threat to long-term bondholders is an unrestrained tax-and-spend political culture that drives more people out of the state and pension liabilities ever upward.The political tragedy is that Mr. Rauner didn\u2019t make this mess; he was elected to clean it up. Former Governors Rod Blagojevich and       Pat Quinn,        a crook and a schnook, borrowed some $17 billion through pension obligation bonds. Since 2009 the state bond rating has been downgraded 21 times. The biggest culprit is state House Speaker       Michael Madigan,        who fronts for the government unions.Mr. Madigan hasn\u2019t said if he\u2019ll accept Mr. Rauner\u2019s offer, and perhaps he\u2019s holding out for even more concessions.

The Supreme Court rose to the occasion on Monday, ruling 8-0 that the First Amendment protects the right of even sex offenders to use social media.Lester Packingham       was 21 years old when he was convicted of statutory rape for having sex with a 13-year-old. In 2010 he posted a remark about a traffic ticket on             Facebook                   and ran afoul of a North Carolina law that made it illegal for a sex offender \u201cto access a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become members or to create or maintain personal Web pages.\u201dPackingham challenged the law as an infringement on his First Amendment right to use social media. The Justices agreed. Even if well intentioned, Justice       Anthony Kennedy       wrote for the majority, \u201cthe Government \u2018may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.\u2019\u201d Barring sex offenders from all social media would block them from a source of current events, potential employment and \u201cspeaking and listening in the modern public square\u201d (Packingham v. North Carolina).In a concurrence, joined by Chief Justice       John Roberts       and Justice       Clarence Thomas,        Justice       Samuel Alito       agreed that the law was overbroad but cautioned that the majority\u2019s opinion may go too far and discourage states from enacting more narrowly tailored laws protecting minors. Justice Alito mentioned teenage dating sites or sites \u201cwhere minors communicate with each other about personal problems\u201d as possible examples. But states must not \u201cburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\u2019s legitimate interests,\u201d he added.Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion also notes that the decision \u201cshould not be interpreted as barring a State from enacting more specific laws than the one at issue.

It was the latest indication that American efforts to discourage Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       and his Iranian allies from challenging the U.S. have fallen short.The new challenges to American power in Syria come as the U.S. seeks to deliver dual blows to Islamic State by forcing the extremist group, also known as ISIS, from its last two major urban strongholds, Raqqa, in Syria, and Mosul, in Iraq.\u201cWe want to be focused on ISIS,\u201d said Col.       Ryan Dillon,        a Baghdad-based spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition. \u201cAnything that distracts us, or takes our attention, or takes resources away from fighting ISIS is not helpful. We are doing a lot of things to get that back on track.\u201dThe shooting down of the drone on Tuesday came two days after a U.S. jet shot down a Syrian plane that had targeted American-backed forces on the ground, the first such incident in the six-year Syrian war.On Monday, in response to the downing of the Syrian plane, Russia threatened to track American warplanes west of the Euphrates River in Syria.The threat was followed by an immediate drop-off in U.S. airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State, as the U.S. military took time to assess the risks. After weeks of launching airstrikes that numbered in the double digits on a daily basis in Syria, the U.S. military said it carried out eight on Monday\u2014all of them near Raqqa.The decrease in airstrikes was accompanied by a decision by Australia, a member of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, to temporarily suspend its flights in Syria. There are 60 countries in the coalition.The U.S.-led coalition also began using more advanced aircraft with better air defenses to fly missions in Syria, U.S. officials said.In Tuesday\u2019s incident, the American military spotted the armed, Iranian-made Shahed 129 drone flying toward a small outpost in southeastern Syria used by coalition troops working with forces fighting Islamic State, the military said.The U.S. pilot quickly shot down the Predator-sized drone, which was the same type as one downed two weeks ago after it dropped a dud munition near the same outpost. U.S. officials said they didn\u2019t know who was operating the drones, but said primary suspicion falls on Syria or Iran.U.S. forces have also launched three airstrikes in recent weeks on Iranian-backed fighters supporting the Assad regime who the U.S. military said were threatening coalition forces.The encounters have ratcheted up tensions with the Syrian regime\u2019s two most important military backers, Russia and Iran.U.S. officials said Tuesday that they were seeing no serious steps by Moscow to target American coalition pilots.\u201cPublic statements aside, we have not seen the Russians do any actions that cause us concern,\u201d said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. \u00a0\u201cWe have no reason to think that the Russians seek conflict with us.\u201dWhile Moscow also said it would shut down a special military channel used to ensure that Russian and American planes operate safely in crowded airspace over Syria, U.S. officials said the lines of communication were still working on Tuesday.Syria isn\u2019t the only place Moscow is testing the U.S. military.

I left a bit wiser about the influence of 2005 on contemporary Israeli politics.On Aug. 15, 2005, after more than a year of parliamentary maneuvering and debate, then-Prime Minister       Ariel Sharon       initiated the removal of 21 Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip. As Israeli citizens looked on, their own security forces forcibly uprooted the settlers who did not leave voluntarily, and razed nearly everything they had built. \u201cI hope that the departure of our forces from the Gaza Strip symbolizes the beginning of a period of tranquility,\u201d said Maj. Gen.       Dan Harel,        the head of Israel\u2019s Southern Command, as the Israeli Army withdrew completely.Events betrayed this hope. In January 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian parliamentary elections. The following year, it forcibly seized control of the Gaza Strip. Not long after, Hamas intensified its rocket attacks on Israel\u2019s southern cities. Right-wing Israeli leaders, who had opposed Mr. Sharon\u2019s plan from the beginning, claimed vindication. They included       Benjamin Netanyahu,        who had resigned in protest from the cabinet a week before the withdrawal began, pleading with his colleagues in a Knesset speech not to give the Palestinians \u201ca huge base for terror.\u201dIn retrospect, not even the center-left defended the Army\u2019s withdrawal. Opposition leader       Isaac Herzog,        of the Labor Party, called it a mistake because of its consequences for Israel\u2019s security. He added that it should not have been undertaken unilaterally. The right\u2019s conclusion was hard to gainsay: The Jewish state had given up territory and had gotten rockets in return.The political effects of this narrative extended far beyond Gaza. Many left-leaning supporters of withdrawal from the West Bank and       East Jerusalem       lost confidence that such a withdrawal would be met with peace. At the other end of the spectrum, religious Zionists felt betrayed by their secular allies, and many decided to take matters into their own hands.The product of this sad history is today\u2019s three-way division of the Israeli public. An increasingly fervent right rejects a two-state solution in theory (as a violation of God\u2019s plan for Judea and Samaria) and in practice (as a mortal threat to Israel\u2019s security). An enlarged, more skeptical center accepts it in theory but not in practice. A much-diminished left continues to believe in the two-state solution, in theory and in practice.In the eyes of most Israelis, events have discredited the left\u2019s noble dreams. If centrist politicians offer no alternative\u2014and most have been reluctant\u2014the right will retain the initiative. The question is what the right\u2019s leaders will do with it.As I was packing to return to the U.S., news broke that Prime Minister Netanyahu had offered veteran politician and current opposition leader Tzipi       Livni       the Foreign Affairs Ministry to broaden his government in the face of possible new peace negotiations. An associate of Ms. Livni told the Jerusalem Post she had rejected the offer because the prime minister had no intention of doing what it would take to pursue a serious diplomatic process: \u201cShe got the impression that what Netanyahu is doing is nothing but hot air.\u201d Given his record, the burden is on Mr. Netanyahu to show that Ms. Livni is mistaken.The American-brokered bilateral talks between Israel and the Palestinians appear perpetually destined to fail. Yet if Mr. Netanyahu is serious\u2014and not just playing rope-a-dope until the Trump administration exhausts itself in the Middle East\u2014he will do his utmost to broaden the talks by bringing the Saudis, and the Sunni coalition they lead, into the process.Forty years ago, Egyptian President       Anwar Sadat       flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset, setting in motion the negotiations that led to the Camp David accord. If Mr. Netanyahu is skillful and determined, he will seize on the newly strengthened ties between Washington and Riyadh to engineer a similar invitation from the Saudis to meet face-to-face. To make this happen, the Israeli prime minister would have to utter some encouraging words about the Arab Peace Plan, a 15-year-old Saudi initiative, which he did as recently as 2015.Two parties in the current coalition\u2014      Naftali Bennett\u2019s       Jewish Home and       Avigdor Liberman\u2019s       Yisrael Beiteinu\u2014would leave.

There is a potential majority coalition for new and broadened negotiations, which only Mr. Netanyahu has the hard-line credibility to lead.This would be the moment of truth for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s leadership.

Such \u201cavailability cascades\u201d drive government policy in good ways and bad, but usually bad. An example the authors analyze in detail is 1989\u2019s fake \u201cAlar\u201d cancer scare that devastated U.S. apple growers.Which brings us to today\u2019s question: How did it become widely believed in the first half of 2017 that a U.S. president committed treason with Russia?Consider what has passed for proof in the media. Tens of thousands of Americans have done business with Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, not to mention before.In 2009 President       Obama       made the first of his two trips to Russia with a gaggle of U.S. business leaders in tow.Of these many thousands, four were associated with the       Trump       campaign, and now became evidence of Trump collusion with Russia.Every president for 75 years has sought improved relations with Russia. That\u2019s what those endless summits were about. Mr. Trump, in his typically bombastic way, also promoted improved relations with Russia. Now this was evidence of collusion.Russian diplomats live in the U.S. and rub shoulders with countless Americans. Such shoulder-rubbing, if Trump associates were involved, now is proof of crime.The Alar pesticide scare only took off when activists whom Messrs. Kuran and Sunstein label \u201cavailability entrepreneurs\u201d peddled deceptive claims to a credulous \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d We would probably not be having this Russia discussion today if not for the so-called Trump dossier alleging improbable, lurid connections between Donald Trump and the Kremlin.It had no provenance that anyone was bound to respect or rely upon. Its alleged author, a retired British agent named       Christopher Steele,        supposedly had Russian intelligence sources, but why would Russian intelligence blow the cover of their blackmail agent Mr. Trump whom they presumably so carefully and expensively cultivated? They wouldn\u2019t.Yet recall the litany of Rep.       Adam Schiff,        who declared in a House Intelligence Committee hearing: \u201cIs it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence?\u201dHis litany actually consisted of innocuous, incidental and routine Trump associations interspersed with claims from the Trump dossier to make the innocuous, incidental and routine seem nefarious.Maybe Mr. Schiff is a cynic, or maybe Harvard Law sent him back into the world with the same skull full of mush with which he arrived. But ever since, every faulty or incomplete recollection of a meeting with a Russian has been promoted in the media as proof of treason by Trump associates.The president\u2019s obvious irritation with being called a traitor is proof that he is a traitor.Whether the Russia incubus did more harm to Mr. Trump\u2019s vote or Hillary\u2019s vote during the election is impossible to know. But Mr. Trump won, so under the hindsight fallacy his victory is now proof that he conspired with Russia.The term \u201cavailability bias\u201d originated in the work of       Amos Tversky       and Daniel Kahneman, whose Nobel Prize-winning research gave birth to the field of behavioral economics.Mr. Kahneman went on to write 2011\u2019s indispensable \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow,\u201d and I\u2019m here to tell you that journalists especially pride themselves on their fast thinking\u2014the kind that mistakes randomness for pattern, confuses correlation with causation, and gives excessive rein to emotional and cognitive biases.Notice I don\u2019t say reporters and editors are so dumb they can\u2019t free themselves from such errors. I say that such errors are their stock in trade.The original allegory of fast thinking, of course, is the old folklore tale, \u201cthe emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d In his 1922 book \u201cPublic Opinion,\u201d       Walter Lippmann       explained how journalists reduce complex, novel realities to off-the-shelf \u201cstereotypes.\u201dOr as a colleague once said of       Stalin,        \u201c[He] tries to force life into a ready-made framework. The more life resists .\u00a0.\u00a0. the more forcefully he mangles and breaks it.\u201dCome to think of it, that\u2019s not a bad way of describing how the D.C. anthill has reacted to the unexpected, exotic, high-risk, possibly providential experiment of the Trump presidency.We mean every descriptor. His very unsuitability, the mood of the American public that elected him, the obscure impasse of American politics that brought him to power\u2014all these signs deserve more respect than they\u2019re getting.His Torquemadas don\u2019t and can\u2019t know whether our democracy, in the improbable Mr. Trump, found a lever to move us forward, and there\u2019s something repugnant in their desire not to find out.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anatomy-of-a-witch-hunt-1497999116", "news_title": "Anatomy of a Witch Hunt", "keywords": "2016 election,adam schiff,obama,russia,russia investigation,trump,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,health,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "It\u2019s summer! Time to dig in the sand, gulp from the hose, play at the park, and leap with joy.Unless you\u2019re a kid\u2014in which case, find yourself a comfy sofa in a dark, quiet room and settle in. This is the season your parents are bombarded with the kind of warnings previously associated with incoming torpedoes. The basic message: Don\u2019t have fun, it\u2019s too dangerous.Yes, that would be the same kind of summer fun your parents endlessly reminisce about. \u201cRemember when digging in the sand at the beach was a fun activity for young children,\u201d says the website KidsTravelDoc. \u201cSorry. No more. Based on recent findings, only with lots of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts is frolicking in the sand a healthy activity, says the U.S. Environmental Protective [sic] Agency.\u201dI was unable to find the EPA\u2019s granular list of caveats. But the blog\u2019s author,       Karl Neumann       of the American Academy of Pediatrics, lays out his own don\u2019ts: \u201cStudies show that children playing in the sand are more likely to become ill than children merely walking on it. And the risk of illness increases with digging in the sand, being \u2018buried\u2019 in it, and digging in wet sand.\u201dGot it. Keep your kids on dry sand. No, wait: \u201cDry sand presents problems, too.\u201d So, Dr. Neumann warns: \u201cDiscourage children from lying directly on the sand.\u201dWhile you\u2019re at it: \u201cWalking barefooted is another \u2018don\u2019t.\u2019 Have children wear lightweight, ventilated, hard-soled footwear that covers the toes. This helps prevent stubbed toes, lacerations, puncture wounds, and burns from hot sand. Ideally, footwear should be worn for wading in the water.\u201dWhy take them to the beach at all? Keep them at home on a hard, nonporous surface, free of dirt and obstacles, checking frequently for venomous spiders, disease-bearing insects, and sewage. Children should be in steel-toed work boots at all times, as well as oven mitts and chain mail.But even that isn\u2019t enough. Simply keeping the kids at home doesn\u2019t ensure they\u2019re safe, especially if they make it into the backyard. Parents magazine warns that \u201cbees are attracted to flowers, so don\u2019t put fragrances or floral-patterned clothing on kids.\u201d Surely you\u2019ve seen swarms of bees chasing children in floral prints, convinced they are flowering shrubs in work boots?The American Academy of Pediatrics, meanwhile, suggests that if your moppets still insist on playing outside, the little daredevils at least \u201climit sun exposure during the peak intensity hours\u2014between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t put a crimp in anyone\u2019s day, should it?The academy is afraid that kids will get too much sun. It\u2019s also afraid they\u2019ll get too little sun and end up with rickets. A related fear is that kids won\u2019t get enough water because\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. well, everyone is obsessed with \u201chydration\u201d these days.It\u2019s always seemed to me that drinking when thirsty does the trick. No. Now there\u2019s a new product on the market called Gululu, which is a water bottle with a Wi-Fi connection. The Gululu app allows parents to monitor how much water their child is drinking. The cagey gadget even knows if the kids are secretly not drinking\u2014pouring out water to stop their parents from texting them to drink more.To make the sipping less onerous\u2014it really does get tiring if you\u2019re not thirsty\u2014an animated character on the bottle\u2019s built-in screen grows happier and healthier the more the child drinks. Let\u2019s hear it for more screen time!Gululu\u2019s other advantage is it keeps the little ones from drinking the wrong sort of water. Google \u201chose water\u201d and you will be deluged with stories linking the stuff to just about every illness except gout. Some study, endlessly reported, found that hose water contained \u201cPVC plastic additives, which can cause birth defects, liver toxicity, and cancer.\u201d Naturally, in these stories there is no mention of how many cisterns of water a child would have to guzzle for any of these issues to ever develop.Being a kid these days is no walk in the park. But that\u2019s just as well. Yet another Parents magazine masterpiece warns that to keep children safe at the playground, you should \u201cwalk away if you see cement, asphalt, dirt, or grass: These surfaces are linked to head injuries.\u201dSo are walls, if you bang your head against them. My summer advice to parents is therefore short and sweet. Tell your kids they can\u2019t swim alone, get into a stranger\u2019s car, or let their parents buy them a high-tech water bottle.And then stop reading other safety tips.Ms. Skenazy is founder of Free-Range Kids and a contributor to Reason.com.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-youre-a-kid-the-experts-want-you-to-have-a-fun-free-summer-1497998988", "news_title": "If You\u2019re a Kid, the Experts Want You to Have a Fun-Free Summer", "keywords": "children,free range kids,helicopter parenting,raising children,safety,summer ,vacation,American Academy of Pediatrics,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "North Korea is making alarming progress in its ballistic-missile and nuclear-weapons programs. Russia and China are developing and fielding advanced weapons against which the U.S. may not be able to defend. Al Qaeda operates in more countries than ever. Islamic State is targeting the West and launching attacks throughout Europe and the Middle East. Iran is supporting terrorist organizations across the globe, modernizing its ballistic-missile and other capabilities and likely continuing to pursue nuclear weapons.Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       told the House Armed Services Committee last week that the U.S. is losing the military edge on which our security has long relied: \u201cToday, every operating domain\u2014including outer space, air, sea, undersea, land and cyberspace\u2014is contested.\u201dGen.       Joseph Dunford,        chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, seconded that worry in written testimony for the same hearing: \u201cWithout sustained, sufficient and predictable funding,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI assess that within five years we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we defend the homeland, advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance commitments.\u201dIn short, the situation President       Trump       inherited is dire. America today faces an array of threats more serious and complex than at any time in the past 75 years.President       Obama       and his policies are largely to blame. The 2011 Budget Control Act, which mandated across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, at a time when threats were growing, has also done serious damage. \u201cNo enemy in the field,\u201d Mr. Mattis told lawmakers, \u201chas done more to harm the combat readiness of our military than sequestration.\u201dWhat have eight years of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, and six years of the Budget Control Act, wrought? The military superiority America relied on after the end of the Cold War has been seriously eroded, our capabilities diminished. In the past three months alone, military leaders have testified that:\u2022 The Army is \u201coutranged, outgunned, outdated,\u201d with only three of 58 brigade combat teams ready to \u201cfight tonight.\u201d\u2022 The Navy is the smallest and least ready it has been in modern times. Fewer than half the Navy\u2019s aircraft can fly because so many are grounded for maintenance or because they lack spare parts.\u2022 The Air Force is the oldest and smallest it has ever been, and less than half of its combat forces are sufficiently ready to fight tonight.\u2022 The Marine Corps is insufficiently manned, trained and equipped across the depth of the force.Rebuilding America\u2019s defenses will require a massive, concerted and long-term effort that must begin today. Mr. Trump rightly promised to do this during last year\u2019s presidential election. Unfortunately, the White House budget submitted to Congress earlier this month fails to provide the necessary resources.The White House has requested only 3% more funding for defense than Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed 2018 budget, meaning the Pentagon would essentially tread water for at least a year\u2014time the U.S. cannot spare in this threat environment. Instead of leading the effort to repeal the Budget Control Act, the White House budget envisions extending it by six years, to 2027. The president\u2019s budget also cuts funding in absolutely essential areas, including $300 million from missile defense and $1 billion from Navy shipbuilding. In sum, the 2018 White House defense budget differs little from what Mr. Obama would have requested were he still president.If Congress is serious about providing the resources necessary to defend the nation, lawmakers must do two things: pass a base defense budget for fiscal 2018 of at least $640 billion, instead of the $603 billion the White House requested; and repeal the Budget Control Act to eliminate the arbitrary spending caps and devastating sequestration.The figure of $640 billion comes from the House and Senate Armed Services committees, which over the past year have conducted in-depth analyses and concluded this is the amount necessary in 2018 to begin rebuilding the military. This figure is a floor, not a ceiling.For context, compare it with the projections from the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2012 budget. Because this was the last budget prepared prior to the Budget Control Act, it was also the last one based on assessing the threats America faces and what would be needed to meet them. It projected a base defense budget of $661 billion for 2018. That assessment was made before Islamic State arose in the Middle East, before North Korea\u2019s recent progress on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before China\u2019s aggression in the South China Sea, and before Mr. Obama\u2019s indefensible nuclear agreement with Iran.Rebuilding the military is not a one-year project. To undo the damage of the Obama era and provide for America\u2019s security in a world of increasingly threatening adversaries, Congress must dedicate itself to providing significant resources for many years to come.Providing for the defense of America is the most sacred constitutional obligation of the U.S. Congress. If Congress fails in this, no balanced budget, no health-care reform, no tax reform, no entitlement reform will matter. If lawmakers fail to provide the resources necessary for the defense of the nation, nothing else they do will matter.Mr. Cheney was vice president, 2001-09.

I started advocating cervicomedullary decompression for achondroplasia,\u201d said Dr. Carson, before shooting me a sly grin and switching to English. Achondroplasia, he explained, is the most common form of dwarfism, and 40 years ago about 7% of people born with the condition died in infancy. \u201cIt\u2019s because they had tight, abnormal bone formation at the base of their skull, and that was squeezing the brain stem. And they would just stop breathing. Surgeons would try to go in sometimes and fix it, but it was so tight that they frequently made it worse or killed the patient.\u201dWhen he first talked about using a different surgical procedure on children with achondroplasia, at a medical conference in Rome in the mid-1980s, many objected: \u201cThe geneticists said, \u2018You surgeons. If you would just leave these people alone, only 7% of them would die. But you guys think you can do anything.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBack home at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, colleagues complained to the hospital president that \u201cCarson\u2019s a wild man. You\u2019ve got to stop him.\u201d But Dr. Carson didn\u2019t stop. \u201cFinally, I had done enough cases where I was able to reveal the data. None of [the patients] had died, and they were doing well. And even though I\u2019d gotten all that pushback, now it\u2019s a standard procedure.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get upset when people say horrible things,\u201d the secretary told me. \u201cI understand human nature. People don\u2019t like change.\u201d A disposition that serves him well these days, when taking cheap shots at Ben Carson is something of a sport among reporters and cable-news sages. Never mind that he grew up poor in inner-city Detroit, raised by a single mother with mental-health problems who worked as a housekeeper. Or that he blasted through racial barriers in his medical career. Or that he has used his fame and fortune to expand the educational opportunities of low-income minorities. After all, what could a person from that background possibly know about helping people in difficult circumstances?In the press, however, the secretary is most often portrayed as a doctrinaire conservative who is out of his depth running an agency tasked with assisting the poor. After he told a town-hall audience in May that poverty is \u201cin part a mindset\u201d and \u201cto a large extent also a state of mind,\u201d commentators couldn\u2019t stop snickering. But Mr. Carson stands by his words. \u201cI don\u2019t say that without evidence. I think of my own life. I think of the way I used to think when I was at the bottom of my class and going nowhere fast,\u201d he told me. \u201cA lot of it is .\u00a0.\u00a0. being told the system is against you or that you\u2019re a victim.\u201d Some individuals and organizations \u201cwant to convince people that somebody else is in charge of them, and that\u2019s why they get angry at people like me who say it\u2019s partly the way you think.\u201dMedia portrayals notwithstanding, Secretary Carson told me he is not opposed to government assistance and safety nets. \u201cWe have an obligation to take care of people who can\u2019t care for themselves\u2014the elderly, the disabled, the mentally ill\u2014and certainly at HUD we\u2019re going to take care of those people.\u201d A case in point, he added, is dealing more effectively with the homeless population. We\u2019re doing a better job at sheltering them but not at diagnosing why they became homeless in the first place and then treating it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do two and three, then you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201dThe housing secretary observed that we have \u201cabout three to four times as many people in need of affordable housing than we\u2019re able to provide\u201d and that the problem is getting worse. \u201cOver the last decade or so, incomes have not risen in response to the rise in housing costs,\u201d he said. Reviving the economy will help, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want to just sit back and wait.\u201d In the meantime, he\u2019d like to see more public-private partnerships that help people acquire the education and skills \u201cthat will make them able to provide for themselves.\u201dOver and again, Dr. Carson reiterated his belief that the best way to help people is to help them do for themselves. He envisions an agency that\u2019s much more focused on enhancing human capital. The objective isn\u2019t to make people on government assistance as comfortable as possible. The objective is fewer people on government assistance. It\u2019s an approach that may not be outside the box, but it\u2019s certainly outside the Beltway.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fighting-poverty-isnt-brain-surgery-but-ben-carson-can-do-both-1497998963", "news_title": "Fighting Poverty Isn\u2019t Brain Surgery, but Ben Carson Can Do Both", "keywords": "african american,ben carson,housing and urban development,poverty,racism,political,general news,society,community,social issues,welfare,social services,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The Hudson Institute\u2019s       Michael Doran,        testifying before the U.N.

A revisionist school of historiography claims that he never wanted war in 1967. His best military units were bogged down in Yemen, his economy was a shambles, and his relations with Jordan and Syria, his putative allies, were abysmal. Why would a leader in such a precarious position behave so recklessly?The revisionists have much of the story right but they miss a crucial factor. Nasser was applying lessons that he learned a decade earlier, during the Suez Crisis. Then, as in 1967, he had precipitated a war that he could not possibly win militarily, but which he believed he could win politically, because, he gambled, the superpowers and the United Nations would intercede on his behalf. In 1956, that proved a very smart bet. In 1967, however, it utterly failed\u2014with disastrous consequences for Egypt\u2014to say nothing of the Palestinians. How much better would it have been for all parties if, back in 1956, the United Nations had insisted that, in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, Nasser must grant Israel meaningful security guarantees?The key lesson of 1967 war is that peace is best achieved not by United Nations intercession but by facilitating direct negotiations between the parties.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-a-lesson-of-the-1967-war-1497998869", "news_title": "Notable & Quotable: A Lesson of the 1967 War", "keywords": "1967,egypt,israel,middle east,The Hudson Institute,U.N.

But another interesting acquisition of sorts was announced the same day:             Apple\u2019s       poaching of two executives from             Sony                   Pictures,       Jamie Erlicht       and       Zack Van Amburg,        to oversee its push into original video content\u2014and ultimately to realize its aspiration of becoming the singularity for entertainment and digital media.Apple\u2019s hires, however, appear to be another in a series of plodding steps. It\u2019s been a wildly successful slough, but there\u2019s a palpable sense that the company is losing momentum with its testudine gait\u2014that it\u2019s been taken over by bean counters and no longer has the nerve or verve to \u201cthink different.\u201dApple could change that impression and supercharge its video play by doing something that would make the Whole Foods deal look like small potatoes: buy             Netflix.It would cost several times the Whole Foods deal to buy Netflix, but with almost $260 billion in cash reserves, Apple can afford it. (Full disclosure: my firm was an early investor in Netflix but no longer holds any shares in the company.)Purchasing Netflix would give Apple three critical things it needs to succeed.\u2022 Content creation. As Apple learned from \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d its failed reality TV series about iPhone app developers (really), producing original programming is difficult. With all due respect to Messrs. Erlicht and Van Amburg, simply adding a couple of studio execs probably won\u2019t be enough. In acquiring Netflix\u2014which has produced an endless string of award-winning hits, from \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d to \u201cStranger Things\u201d\u2014the iPhone company would gain instant credibility and proven expertise in creating premium content at scale.\u2022 Vertical integration. Apple is the most successful walled garden in history. Taking video creation and distribution in-house would satisfy that longstanding business model. The approach makes strategic sense given how the digital revolution has restructured the TV and movie industry. The value of celebrities has declined and the distribution model has been upended; middlemen like traditional studios are increasingly cut out.\u2022 International expansion. Content providers now have to think and act globally. Audiences outside the U.S. are growing in size, accessibility and importance. Netflix is available in more than 190 countries. Buy it, and Apple owns the world\u2019s first truly global TV network.One more thing, to quote the man in the black turtleneck. In addition to content, another enormous asset Apple would get from buying Netflix is its CEO,       Reed Hastings.

The office said it has also reviewed medical records from the air-ambulance service and hospital that treated Mr. Warmbier and has held extensive conversations with his doctors.\u201cNo conclusions about the cause and manner of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death have been drawn at this time,\u201d the office of county coroner       Lakshmi Sammarco       said, adding that \u201cthere are additional medical records and imaging to review and people to interview.\u201dA full autopsy typically involves an external examination plus removal and dissection of organs and the collection of samples for testing.Mr. Warmbier died\u00a0Monday afternoon, according to a statement from his family released by the Cincinnati hospital that treated him. He came home with a severe brain injury, the cause of which remains unclear, after he was held captive in North Korea for more than a year.A funeral service for Mr. Warmbier is planned for 9 a.m. Thursday at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio, where he graduated in 2013, according to the school district. The event will be open to the public.Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family have said he suffered a serious and debilitating brain injury. He was unable to speak, see or respond to verbal commands, his family said.His physicians said the injury appeared to occur at least 14 months ago, based on some of the limited medical information provided by the North Koreans, but they don\u2019t know the cause.The former University of Virginia student suffered extensive loss of brain tissue, his doctors said, and the damage was consistent with a cardiopulmonary arrest.In someone his age, intoxication or trauma might cause cardiopulmonary arrest, the doctors said.North Korea detained Mr. Warmbier in January 2016 when he was preparing to leave the country following a tour there. The North Koreans sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly defacing a political poster, and later said through state media that they released him early on humanitarian grounds.His death has amplified pressure for more strenuous action against Pyongyang. Three other Americans are still being held in North Korea, according to the State Department.\u201cUnfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today,\u201d Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family said in Monday\u2019s statement.Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ohio-coroner-investigating-otto-warmbiers-death-1497979350", "news_title": "Ohio Coroner Investigating Otto Warmbier\u2019s Death ", "keywords": "autopsy,brain injury,cause of death,examination,funeral,inestigation,north korea, ohio,otto warmbier,wyoming,wyoming high school,Otto Warmbier"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans\u2019 quest for the 50 votes needed to pass their health-care bill has put them in hot pursuit of one duck-hunting, occasionally defiant GOP senator:       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) confirmed Tuesday that the bill\u2019s text would be released Thursday and a vote held likely next week, triggering an intensified effort to secure the votes of senators like Ms. Murkowski. An assessment of the bill\u2019s impact by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected by early next week.Mr. McConnell\u2019s schedule gives him limited time to nail down support for a bill whose emerging shape has raised alarms among conservatives and centrists alike. The majority leader can lose no more than two of his 52 GOP senators, prompting an urgent outreach to senators like Ms. Murkowski who face complicated pressures at home.It won\u2019t be easy to secure the support of Ms. Murkowski, who has been willing to break with party leaders in the past. As recently as February, she was one of two Senate Republicans to oppose confirmation of Education Secretary       Betsy DeVos.       And the Senate GOP health bill could pose specific problems for Alaskans, causing some of the state\u2019s other elected officials to hesitate.Ms. Murkowski has raised concerns over the bill\u2019s expected cuts to Medicaid, as well as a provision effectively cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\u201cWhat they provide for women is an important level of access to care, and I don\u2019t think we ought to be rolling back anything that effectively limits access,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said Tuesday. She declined to say whether that could cost Mr. McConnell her support, noting that senators haven\u2019t yet seen the bill\u2019s text.\u2018I can\u2019t tell you where my vote is going to be.\u2019\u201cI can\u2019t tell you where my vote is going to be,\u201d she said.Mr. McConnell declined on Tuesday to predict the bill\u2019s passage, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to make every effort to pass a bill\u201d that overhauls the health-care system.The majority leader has signaled that whatever the outcome, he wants to act on the bill quickly. Republican leaders have said they are eager to tackle the next big item on the GOP agenda, an overhaul of the tax system.Democrats are stepping up their criticism of Republicans for writing the bill behind closed doors and leaving little time for the public to review it before the vote. \u201cThis is much more akin to a reality TV show reveal than the legislative process,\u201d said Sen.       Chris Coons       (D., Del.).Mr. McConnell faces challenges on both ends of the GOP spectrum. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, leaving the majority leader to rely solely on Republicans. Vice President       Mike Pence       would break a tie if Mr. McConnell can hold together 50 Republicans, but any drop in support below that would doom its passage.Conservatives say they are worried the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to lower health-care premiums.\u201cIf it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums,\u201d Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas) said recently, adding that the bill had \u201cnot yet\u201d reach that goal.Meanwhile, centrists who balked at the House\u2019s bill cutting $834 billion from Medicaid over 10 years have been crafting a more gradual wind-down, but it isn\u2019t clear if their demands can be reconciled with those of conservatives.Finally, Mr. McConnell is contending with lawmakers, including Ms. Murkowski, worried about the bill\u2019s impact on specific conditions in their states. That raises the possibility that GOP leaders could tweak the bill to address those issues, such as beefing up tax credits or directing more Medicaid funding to states with expensive health care.Alaska is unique in facing both high health-care costs and high premiums; because of its small population, its sickest residents have driven costs up sharply. Republican plans to provide people who don\u2019t get insurance on the job with tax credits or subsidies would be especially problematic in Alaska if those credits aren\u2019t structured to take into account areas with high health-care costs.\u201cWe\u2019re certainly looking at that issue, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Alaska\u2019s other GOP senator,       Dan Sullivan,        said Tuesday.The Senate bill could ease some of Ms. Murkowski\u2019s concerns, with sources saying it will raise the amount of credits for people in expensive geographic regions.In some parts of Alaska, a 40-year-old who earns $30,000 a year now gets subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that reduce annual premiums to $1,190, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the House-passed health bill such a person would pay more than $10,000, and older residents even more.Ms. Murkowski could balk at the Senate bill if she feels the new tax credits aren\u2019t robust enough. About 19,000 residents in the state have signed up for a plan on the ACA\u2019s exchanges this year, and more than 90% of them receive subsidies to offset premium costs.Alaska\u2019s other elected officials have also raised concerns about the GOP effort to dismantle and replace the 2010 health-care law. Gov.       Bill Walker,        an independent, has criticized the bill passed by the House last month and voiced concerns about the Senate bill curbing federal Medicaid funding.\u201cOur biggest concern is there will be changes that will disproportionately shift the costs onto the states,\u201d Mr. Walker told NPR on Monday. \u201cIf we attempt it that way, Alaska will be sorely damaged in the process.\u201dThe sole House lawmaker from Alaska, GOP Rep.       Don Young,        raised similar concerns in the House but ultimately voted for the bill last month.Alaska is among the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Ms. Murkowski has said she would like to retain the expanded program, which the GOP legislation would roll back. Alaska\u2019s expansion went into effect Sept. 1, 2015, and about 14,400 residents gained coverage as a result.Appeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Health Bill Is Hard Sell for Alaska Senator.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alaska-senator-lisa-murkowski-faces-hard-sell-on-health-bill-1497997477", "news_title": "Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski Faces Hard Sell on Health Bill ", "keywords": " alaska, medicaid, planned parenthood,senate health-care law,Lisa Murkowski,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       travel ban remains on hold due to court rulings, but his administration is resuming a global review of nations that may lead to far more sweeping travel restrictions.The travel ban aims to stop people from six Muslim-majority countries from coming to the U.S., based on what the White House says are security concerns. The global review will examine every other country to determine whether any should be added to the list. The goal is to compel nations to cooperate more fully with U.S. efforts to vet their citizens, officials say.The global review was ordered along with the travel ban, and for months, both had been kept on hold by a federal judge in Hawaii. But last week, an appeals court said the administration should be allowed to resume the study, and on Monday night, the court put its ruling into effect.Now the Department of Homeland Security says it is moving forward.\u201cThe ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals finally allows DHS to resume the important work of reviewing the information provided by all countries on their citizens who desire to travel to the United States, to ensure the applicant doesn\u2019t present a security or public safety threat to the U.S.,\u201d said DHS spokesman Dave Lapan. \u201cDHS will undertake a full review of the vetting requirements worldwide in the expectation of raising the global security bar to better protect our nation.\u201dCritics have said that trying to force cooperation could be counterproductive since the U.S. needs cooperation from other countries to advance other goals.They point to the Obama administration approach, which offered incentives for increased help, such as visa-free travel to the U.S., rather than threats. And they say some countries will never be able to meet all of U.S. demands, but that doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. should ban every one of those citizens from coming here.A provision in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on visas and refugees gave DHS 20 days to report back to the president on the results of the review, including a determination of what information is needed from each country and \u201ca list of countries that do not provide adequate information.\u201dA DHS official said the agency is consulting with attorneys on the timing, but it appears that the 20-day clock began on Monday, when the appeals court put its ruling into effect. The goal, the official said, was to move \u201cas expeditiously as possible following the court\u2019s order.\u201dOne senior U.S. official said it isn\u2019t clear what countries might be asked for more information, but it is possible it will be a long list in order to maximize \u201cleverage\u201d over them. The risk for countries is that if they don\u2019t comply, their citizens could be banned from coming to the U.S.Earlier this year, DHS Secretary John Kelly told CNN that there were \u201cprobably 13 or 14 countries\u201d with \u201cvery questionable vetting procedures.\u201dIt also isn\u2019t clear whether the administration would be legally free to impose a travel ban on other countries while the order affecting the original six remains on hold. The Supreme Court could say as soon as this week whether it will intervene in the legal battle over Mr. Trump\u2019s current executive order.In assessing visa applications, U.S. officials routinely check names against a range of watch lists. Those databases rely on information collected from other countries, including names of people suspected of terrorism and convicted of crimes. DHS also depends on other countries to report lost and stolen passports to Interpol, an international policing organization.Administration officials have said the global review will consider whether countries are routinely sharing this sort of information. The administration also wants foreign governments to upgrade their passports with electronic chips to prevent forgeries, and hopes to pressure recalcitrant countries to take their citizens back if they are deported from the U.S.Some experts say that none of the six countries singled out in the executive order will be able to meet those tests, so their citizens could wind up being banned from travel to the U.S. beyond the temporary period laid out in the order.\u2014Shane Harris and Brent Kendall contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 18:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-resuming-global-vetting-review-after-courts-green-light-1497996819", "news_title": "Trump Administration Resuming Global Vetting Review After Court\u2019s Green Light", "keywords": "donald trump, extreme vetting, global vetting review, homeland security, muslim ban, national security, travel ban,Department of Homeland Security,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch"}, {"content": "A decision about whether to return Argentina to emerging market status has been delayed until 2018, index provider MSCI said Tuesday.The moved surprised investors who\u2019d expected the country to return to the widely used benchmark 8 years after it was shunned to frontier status amid rampant currency controls.The MSCI announcement comes one day after the country sold the first ever 100-year bond for a junk-rated sovereign in a deal that was three times oversubscribed.The company said the decision was based on investor concerns that recently implemented market accessibility improvements, including the removal of capital controls and foreign exchange restrictions, needed to remain in place for a longer time period to be deemed irreversible.In its review last year, MSCI had cited the government\u2019s move to abolish foreign-exchange restrictions and relax capital controls as a significant improvement for investors.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is one of the most widely used indexes to gauge the performance of emerging market equities, with $1.6 trillion benchmarked to the index.At its height, Argentina represented 5% of the MSCI EM index and 14% of the MSCI LatAm Index.

Thank goodness those days are long gone, but like the dominant broadcasters of yore, Scott Pelley of             CBS News                   has a voice that could make a wolverine purr. Still, it\u2019s not clear that anyone could make sense of the words that Mr. Pelley was speaking on Thursday.In a commentary for the \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d Mr. Pelley began:Some of the gunshot wounds might have been self-inflicted? If CBS had discovered evidence that those attending the congressional baseball practice had actually been wounded by their own bullets, rather than shots fired by James Hodgkinson, this surely would have been the scoop of the year. But Mr. Pelley quickly made clear that he and his colleagues had no such evidence. Instead, he was suggesting that the victims of the attempted assassinations might bear some blame for motivating Hodgkinson to attack:Blaming anyone other than the shooter for attempted assassination is generally a mistake. And the timing could hardly have been worse. Mr. Pelley was intoning his commentary on the same day that victim Rep. Steve Scalise (R., La.) was undergoing one of the series of surgeries he has required since the Wednesday attack. Last weekend his condition was upgraded to serious from critical. On Thursday, the day of the Pelley commentary, shooting victim Matt Mika was also in critical condition. Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner was also still in the hospital on Thursday, according to CNN.Given the timing and the circumstances that Mr. Pelley chose to make his case, one might have expected him to cite some truly damning rhetoric that had been uttered by the victims, if not direct evidence that they had incited Hodgkinson to carry out his bloody attack. One would have been wrong. The CBS voice offered not a shred of evidence that any of the shooting victims had done anything to create an \u201cabyss of violent rhetoric,\u201d or to inspire the actions of the man who tried to assassinate them. Instead, the anchorman mentioned a politician who was not targeted:Mr. Pelley offered no evidence that Hodgkinson suffered from mental illness, nor did he explain how comments by Mr. Sanders could possibly raise the question of whether the victims\u2019 wounds might be \u201cself-inflicted.\u201dBelieve it or not, the segment went downhill from there. The CBS newsman concluded by citing President Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric about his network and other media outlets, as if Mr. Pelley and his colleagues were the real victims of last week\u2019s violence.Coincidentally on Friday Mr. Pelley left the CBS nightly anchor chair to focus on his reports for the CBS program, \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The move had been announced in May and in media terms, Mr Pelley remains kind of a big deal.***Bottom Stories of the DayYes We(ed) Can  \u201cRand Paul And Al Franken Come Together For Weed,\u201d Daily Caller, June 15Extra Shot of Condemnation with Your Covfefe?  \u201c            Starbucks                   customer says she was bullied for supporting Trump,\u201d Fox46 Charlotte, June 15Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

Mayor       Steven Fulop       has threatened to fire the officers involved in the incident.The incident occurred on the night of June 4, when police said they tried to stop a vehicle driven by       Leo C. Pinkston,        48 years old, of Jersey City.Mr. Pinkston fled and led police on a chase that lasted more than six minutes, at times driving in between two lanes of traffic, according to authorities. At one point, police opened fire on Mr. Pinkston\u2019s vehicle, they said. The chase ended when Mr. Pinkston crashed into a utility pole, causing another vehicle carrying 28-year-old       Miguel Feliz-Rodriguez       to erupt into flames.A video taken by a witness purportedly shows Mr. Feliz-Rodriguez emerging from the car on fire before officers approach him. In the video, one officer, who appears to have his gun drawn, began kicking Mr. Feliz-Rodriguez before he is dragged onto the street by the officers. Mr. Disbrow previously said the video showed \u201cofficers acted quickly to extinguish the flames.\u201dMr. Feliz-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital in critical condition.

But those fees have already been negotiated between the FDA and the industries at much lower levels, and Republican legislators have made clear they have no intention of insisting the FDA reopen talks to try to raise them.On Tuesday, Dr. Gottlieb testified before the subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees the FDA\u2019s budget.At the outset of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, subcommittee chairman Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) said the administration\u2019s estimate of new user fees is \u201cnot feasible.\u201d Sen.       Patrick Leahy       (D., Vt.) called Mr. Trump\u2019s plan \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201dDr. Gottlieb\u2019s prepared testimony focused on his plans at the FDA to speed up the approval of medicines for rare diseases, known as orphan drugs. Dr. Gottlieb disclosed that the agency has had a backlog of requests for orphan status, a designation that offers benefits to the drug\u2019s sponsor, such as tax credits.He said the FDA hasn\u2019t yet responded to about 200 applications from companies seeking orphan status. During the next 90 days, the agency plans to \u201ccompletely eliminate this backlog of requests and provide an answer back to the sponsors,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said.\u201cMoreover, we won\u2019t ever again develop a backlog,\u201d he said.The new commissioner has previously spoken about working toward speeding certain generic drugs to market in an effort to rein in drug prices. In Tuesday\u2019s testimony, he spoke of updating guidance that the agency issues \u201cso that we can make clinical trials more efficient.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t specific as to how that would work, and many Democrats have expressed skepticism, suggesting such efficiency would lower safety standards.In one instance, Dr. Gottlieb said the agency is considering broad approvals for cancer drugs that hit the same genetic or molecular targets in a variety of cancers, instead of insisting on approvals for one cancer at a time.Write to Thomas M.

EVANS:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s very important that, you know, the Federal Reserve support the economy and support inflation rising to our 2% objective.\u00a0 We have said that we\u2019ve got a 2% objective going back to 2012 January, our Policy Strategy Statement, and everybody sort of understood 2% for a longer period of time is our objective.\u00a0 We have not hit it in that time period.\u00a0 There have been a lot of reasons why:\u00a0 aftermath of the great financial crisis and disinflationary tendencies.\u00a0 But more recently, inflation has been moving up from, you know, below 1% at one point, core inflation started moving up, and, you know, we\u2019ve increased the funds rate by 100 basis points.\u00a0 And so we\u2019ve, you know, come off the zero floor and, you know, moved up to, you know, 1 1/8 average.So that\u2019s good, but that\u2019s all premised on an outlook where the economy is doing well.\u00a0 Unemployment\u2019s 4.3%.\u00a0 Looking for growth in the 2 \u00bc% range, which is above trend \u2013 trend is more like 1 \u00be, and that\u2019s been enough to drive unemployment down.\u00a0 But inflation\u2014which had been moving up off of its 1 \u00bc, 1.4 year over year\u2014was moving up.And now, most recently, the last three months have been quite disappointing.\u00a0 There\u2019s no other way to describe that, I would say.\u00a0 Some of it looks like it\u2019s seemingly one-off effects from cellphone company data plans and things like that.\u00a0 So maybe it\u2019s explainable, and maybe next month and the month after that we\u2019ll revert back to better inflation.\u00a0 I think that means\u2014for me, I know it means\u2014you know, it\u2019s time to assess, you know, what the state of inflation is and whether or not we\u2019re really going to move up to 2%.So the premise of your question was does this mean that we can continue raising rates.\u00a0 You know, the median of the (Summary of Economic Projections) is for three rate increases this year.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done two.\u00a0 I think that, you know, we\u2019re now at a point where, you know, we can\u2014we can afford\u2014having raised the rate twice, we can afford to sort of wait a little bit and see how the data play out.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot going on with uncertainty, the economy\u2014global economy\u2019s doing better\u2014but to see if inflation\u2019s going to move up.I think we could wait until the end of the year.\u00a0 December is another SEP round, press conference, and that would be the time where we could decide three rate increases, two rate increases.\u00a0 To get to four, we\u2019d have to do something before that, obviously.\u00a0 And for me, I think, boy, you know, if we saw better inflation and the unemployment rate, you know, continuing to move down, yeah, OK, I could see that.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not in my outlook at the moment.Q:\u00a0 OK.\u00a0 So, I mean, you\u2019re willing to wait awhile to see if the inflation data do perk back up?\u00a0 I mean, I guess what you\u2019re saying is the Fed definitely has time to make a call on its next rate move.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 And that\u2019s also\u2014you know, that\u2019s also in the median SEP projection.\u00a0 You know, the median is for three rate increases.\u00a0 We don\u2019t say when they\u2019re going to take place.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the nature of the exercise.\u00a0 And if we got that in in December, that would be three.\u00a0 But it also affords the optionality of, in December, kind of seeing, gee, you know, unemployment\u2014inflation\u2019s not picking up, there\u2019s something else going on.\u00a0 If unemployment continues to move down, there\u2019s this tension between a very strong labor market, history with inflation likely around the corner, maybe it\u2019s going to come.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve had a bit too many experiences of forecasting an upturn in inflation, having a good reason for forecasting that, and it hasn\u2019t taken place.Q:\u00a0 If you did wait until the end of the year\u2014if conditions cause you to wait until the end of the year, would that affect the balance-sheet plan?\u00a0 Because that\u2014you know, in the new agenda, it\u2019s hopefully this year you\u2019re going to do that.\u00a0 But if you wait until December to raise rates because that\u2019s what the economy calls for, would that push the balance-sheet plan into 2018?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t have to.\u00a0 So the chair has spoken well on this at her press conference.\u00a0 We\u2019ve released, you know, an addendum to our normalization guidelines, you know, on this.\u00a0 And so now we\u2019ve indicated that, you know, we\u2019ve looked at this, you know, quite carefully, and the current expectation is we put together\u2014we have this plan, and when we decide it\u2019s time to start reducing our balance sheet that we\u2019ll begin taking $10 billion of assets off our balance sheet each month\u2014basically, that\u2019s what the cap means:\u00a0 6 Treasury, 4 MBS\u2014for the first quarter, and then that would increase by 10 billion each quarter until we get to 50 billion.\u00a0 That\u2019s enough to start reducing the balance sheet in a meaningful, noticeable way, but not too quickly.\u00a0 And, you know, we can do that at any point.I personally think, and I think most people think, that once this starts it can be running in the background.\u00a0 Markets will understand.\u00a0 They understand the plan now.\u00a0 Most of the action on the term premia, I think, comes from understanding the plan.\u00a0 It\u2019s all priced in, and you can see it run off.One way to do it, you know, (New York Fed President William) Dudley\u2026has said, you know, maybe we make an action on the balance sheet at a meeting where we don\u2019t have to change the funds rate.\u00a0 That would be a way to take the balance sheet, get that started, and position ourselves for a December rate increase.\u00a0 That\u2019s one possibility.\u00a0 There are others.\u00a0 But this is one that allows that optionality that, at the moment, I prefer.Q:\u00a0 And when officials say that \u2014 (the process of shrinking the balance sheet will)\u2014start when interest rate normalization is \u201cwell under way,\u201d what is implied by \u201cwell under way?\u201d\u00a0 Are we there now with this latest rate increase?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 \u201cWell under way,\u201d obviously, came to be a heavily laden term.\u00a0 Whenever you do qualitative guidance, it sort of takes that on.\u00a0 I know a number of people have thought about what\u2019s the level of the funds rate at which it must obviously be well under way, and you can go through a number of thought exercises on that.\u00a0 And they might be somewhat north of where we are.\u00a0 But I think, in general, we\u2019ve increased the funds rate by 100 basis points.\u00a0 The first time we did it, events didn\u2019t work out; that is, uncertainty internationally in 2016.\u00a0 An awful lot of things happened:\u00a0 Brexit, China volatility, and all of that.\u00a0 So, you know, we delayed until last December.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ve done three in a row.I mean, you know, things are pretty in train at the moment.\u00a0 I recognize that\u2019s not the same term.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019re at the point where we can make a decision to start adjusting the balance sheet at any time at this point.Q:\u00a0 And in September it seems like there\u2019s a prospect, again, for\u2026fiscal collisions in Washington, debt-limit high jinks.\u00a0 Would that affect your timing at all if you got into September and, you know, there was uncertainty over what\u2019s going to happen there?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 That\u2019s a good question.\u00a0 I\u2019m not an expert on the exact interactions of what we do with the Treasury markets.\u00a0 Obviously, we care about well-functioning Treasury markets, and so, you know, if there are concerns we\u2019d have to think about that.\u00a0 But, you know, at the moment, I\u2019m, you know, not really that aware of exactly how that would play out.\u00a0 At some point, once\u2014you know, once Congress and the president get talking about the debt ceiling, sometimes this goes on for quite some period of time, sometimes it\u2019s resolved more quickly.\u00a0 So, you know, it\u2019s just difficult to\u2014you know, if you let that, you know, stop you, then you almost stop planning or whatnot.\u00a0 So I think we can continue to plan along these lines.I think, as it turns out, rolling off $10 billion \u2014 $6 billion of Treasurys, those are actually assets that markets would like to have available to them during, you know, times where they value safe assets.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think it presents too many problems.\u00a0 But, again, I\u2019m not expert, and I do know that people are concerned about that.Q:\u00a0 You mentioned one-off factors sort of dragging down inflation over the last few months.\u00a0 Do you expect all those one-off factors to sort of go away altogether?\u00a0 Or is there ever a circumstance in which there are not one-off factors that are weighing on inflation or otherwise?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 It\u2019s a good\u2014yeah.\u00a0 So once you start picking apart pieces of the price index\u2014you know, I think it was (former Cleveland Fed President) Jerry Jordan who way back in the \u201990s had some comment like, you know, once you start diving into the elements of the price index, you begin to convince yourself that the price report creates its own inflation or whatnot.\u00a0 I mean, you can just, you know, pick out what you like.\u00a0 Back when tobacco prices were going up a lot due to the legal settlement, there used to be, you know, core, eggs, food, energy and tobacco prices.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s easy to do this.I think there\u2019s a good case that these are one-off.\u00a0 How many times are the, you know, phone companies going to change the data plans and things like that?\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s a once and for all type of change.\u00a0 I\u2019m a little more\u2014you know, I\u2019d like to reflect on this a little bit more because, you know, the same technology, you know, at the moment is changing all the time.\u00a0 It\u2019s changing in ways that are not easy to understand.\u00a0 It\u2019s not exactly the late \u201990s, when durable goods manufacturing technology was roaring along, and, you know, digital technology was finding its way on the factory work floor and offices in a big, big way in a very positive, broad fashion.Now, it\u2019s more disruptive.\u00a0 More corporations are choosing to merge, ones that you wouldn\u2019t have thought of necessarily.\u00a0 You could have been farsighted and seen that, but others, you know, not so much.\u00a0 And it makes you wonder if competition is beginning to take place along lines that haven\u2019t been contemplated.\u00a0 Competition, you know, in many forms would adjust price margins.\u00a0 Price margin adjustment would lead to lower price levels for\u2014relative prices.\u00a0 But you get enough of these relative prices and it finds its way into the price index, unless the stance of monetary policy is sufficiently accommodative to overcome that.And so that would be the what if it\u2019s not exactly one-off.\u00a0 Well, globally inflation has been low.\u00a0 One of the commonalities across the globe\u2014now, we\u2019ve all suffered from the great financial crisis, OK.\u00a0 Governments haven\u2019t responded full force with fiscal actions in many cases, OK.\u00a0 I mean, there are common approaches that have been taken that could account for it.\u00a0 But technology is affecting the global economy as well, and demographics.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a very challenging time to say with certainty, yeah, I know it\u2019s one-off.Rather, it\u2019s really more\u2014I mean, in fairness to the other viewpoint, I think it\u2019s that labor markets are doing quite well.\u00a0 Unemployment rate\u2019s 4.3%.\u00a0 Labor force has been\u2014participation rate has been declining.\u00a0 And there are a lot of demographic reasons for that.\u00a0 Maybe we\u2019d all prefer more people in the workforce so that we could grow faster, but people are voluntarily making these choices and people are getting older, and a whole host of demographic reasons.\u00a0 So I mean, I think that\u2019s kind of what we face.\u00a0 The unemployment rate\u2019s falling.And, you know, historically vibrant labor markets, accommodative Fed, go back to the \u201970s and you kind of recoil with fear over that.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a very different world.\u00a0 I think the state of inflation expectations are very different now.\u00a0 But, you know, you\u2019d have to be not really thinking very carefully to be oblivious to that possibility.\u00a0 So I think there are risks on both sides.Q:\u00a0 What do you view as banks\u2019 role right now in the economy?\u00a0 Are they lending enough?\u00a0 Are they overregulated?\u00a0 Would you advise any tweaking there to get better economic performance?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Well, I mean, I\u2014you know, I think bank lending is taking place, you know, reasonably well.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2014you know, so at the moment, you know, banks have had a chance to rebuild their capital.\u00a0 The demands on them to have capital in place are stronger, higher than they were before the financial crisis.\u00a0 You know, you can argue over exactly how limiting that is for bank lending.\u00a0 You know, there is some research that indicates that banks that have more capital end up being more profitable and do more lending.\u00a0 That\u2019s not your first reaction, I think, to the fact that more leverage usually ends up with more lending.\u00a0 But I think the current circumstances are, you know, pretty good for the financial sector.Regulatory burden, yeah, I mean, it\u2019s definitely higher than it was before the crisis.\u00a0 It was probably, you know, given the fact that we got ourselves into a financial crisis, it was probably too low.\u00a0 It could easily be, you know, higher now, and then part of the question would be what type of adjustments.\u00a0 I think community bankers have always feared that Dodd-Frank, even with certain carve-outs, you know, the attitude of regulators and supervisors would be to just, you know, wash all of that across the spectrum of the size of banks, and that they would end up being more regulated than even their expectations, you know, from the law.I was always, you know, a little, frankly, skeptical of that.\u00a0 But, you know, in fact, I\u2019ve heard more and more and, you know, I think that that is sort of an issue.\u00a0 So, you know, the Fed has started, you know, tailoring some of these requirements so that the community banks aren\u2019t affected to the same degree.\u00a0 But, you know, it\u2019s a judgment call and certainly some things, you know, could be done.\u00a0 But I do think that for the largest financial institutions that, you know, are systemically important more and better capital serves everybody better.\u00a0 You know, having the appropriate liquidity on hand in the face of difficult liquidity times, I think, is important.And I think that the stress tests have served us all pretty well.\u00a0 Part of the stress test involves doing horizontal reviews, and then sort of sharing the outcomes of that, having feedback with the supervisors.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s painful, but at some point a little more gets shared about, you know, I think ways to have some capital in place or some liquidity in place against certain alternatives that help people think about that.\u00a0 But you can certainly go further than his ideal.Q:\u00a0 Your banks that you supervise, do any go through the stress test?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Yeah, they\u2019re not part of the highest (Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee) banks.\u00a0 But they\u2019re the large financial banking organizations, the next tier down. And over 50 billion. And also with a global presence, custody banks, Northern Trust.\u00a0 We supervise HSBC as well. And Allied Bank.Q:\u00a0 You seemed to hint at the question of productivity just a little bit earlier.\u00a0 Where do you come out on the productivity paradox?\u00a0 Any new evidence that says, so, it\u2019s there we just can\u2019t see it, or the opposite side of the question?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Productivity\u2019s always difficult to measure.\u00a0 So it\u2019s definitely possible that there\u2019s stronger productivity likely to emerge in certain areas more narrowly than broadly, you know, everywhere.\u00a0 I think that, you know, the 10-year period from \u201995 to 2005 was just an extraordinary period for productivity.\u00a0 We had a productivity slow down before that.\u00a0 There are two different five-year periods in that 10-year period.\u00a0 The \u201995 to 2000 period was one where capital embodied technology really improved a lot.\u00a0 It\u2019s that durable goods manufacturing, computers, you know, finally finding its way into offices.\u00a0 The computer had been around for quite some time before that.\u00a0 And you saw noticeable acceleration of productivity.And then after Y2K, you didn\u2019t see that same type of productivity, but you saw what economists refer to as total factor productivity, which is the residual, after accounting for capital and labor input, growth.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just business process and improvement.\u00a0 Businesses that\u2014things had done so well in the previous five years, they left a lot of things, inefficiencies dangling because they were too busy doing other things.\u00a0 And so they cleaned that up and we saw that, you know, really improve for five years.\u00a0 For 10 years, that was a great productivity period.Then, you know, somewhere, and the financial crisis gets\u2014you know, confuses things as to when the real slowdown was.\u00a0 So now we\u2019re stepping back down to something probably a little higher than the productivity slowdown in the areas of 73 to 95, but not nearly like the previous 10 years.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s better.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s improving.\u00a0 But at the moment it\u2019s disruptive.\u00a0 So in the places where you see a lot of productivity increase, you see other capital investments just depreciate, because they\u2019re not profitable in the same way.Q:\u00a0 Do you guys talk about driverless cars?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Us guys who?\u00a0 I mean, you know, at the (Federal Open Market Committee) level? Yeah, you know, somebody might make a comment, but not very much at the\u2014at my board-of-directors level, a little bit more; at a business advisory group, a lot more.\u00a0 And in Chicago, we\u2019ve had a couple of gatherings with people engaged in startups, the technology incubation centers in Chicago and what not.\u00a0 They\u2019ll talk a lot about driverless cars.Q:\u00a0 Detroit\u2019s in your region.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Oh, sure.\u00a0 Yeah, Detroit\u2019s in our region.\u00a0 You know, everybody\u2019s thinking about driverless cars; insurance companies.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be so safe. Who\u2019s going to have an insurance policy?\u00a0 There are just a whole bunch of things I don\u2019t understand; just the mere fact that you\u2019ve got some driverless cars on the same road with people who are driving, who like driving.Q:\u00a0 Yeah, but one day\u2014if you take that, one day it will be illegal to drive a car as a person.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 This \u2013 this is a country of freedom and liberty.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I don\u2019t really understand that.\u00a0 But OK.Q:\u00a0 No, one day, however many decades out from here.\u00a0 You\u2019re too much of a danger.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 In Oklahoma is that going to be the case?\u00a0 I mean, there\u2019s an awful lot\u2014I mean, in a city, I understand this.Q:\u00a0 So, just given where you think productivity is, where do you think trend (gross domestic product growth) is going to be?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 A nice round number I usually say is 1 \u00be.\u00a0 Some people are now at 1 \u00bd, which is a very politically fraught discussion.\u00a0 I mean, I\u2014you know, I gave a speech\u2014beginning of last year?\u00a0 No, I think it was two years ago\u2014a bankers\u2019 group in Wisconsin.\u00a0 And I started rolling out the, you know, have you heard about the demographics in the labor force?\u00a0 And, you know, this is meaning\u2014this means that labor input\u2019s just not going to grow as much as it did before.\u00a0 And then productivity isn\u2019t so good.\u00a0 So, you know, we\u2019re kind of thinking that growth is likely to be 1 \u00be.And then in the audience afterwards there was somebody from the state government, not at the highest levels, and, you know, the person said afterwards, you know, you know, I heard what you said, and it made a lot of sense.\u00a0 I just wish, instead of 1 \u00be, you could have said 4%, to which I said me too, because, you know, growth solves an awful lot of problems.\u00a0 And it would be good if we could get 4%.\u00a0 But where does it come from?\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about two very difficult areas.\u00a0 One is productivity.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry\u2014I think last night we were talking about our poor state of inflation forecasting or things that we don\u2019t know so well; you know, inflation dynamics.You know, economists\u2014you know, you could stump\u2014you could get them to admit under oath that\u2014not even under oath; in a conversation\u2014that we don\u2019t understand a lot of things in productivity, where it comes from.\u00a0 You know, (economist Robert) Solow said that Solow residual was the measure of our ignorance about productivity, after accounting for capital and labor growth.Research and development helps, OK, but the relationship is, you know, probably about up there with the Phillips curve and things like that.\u00a0 So we\u2019d all like to see stronger productivity growth.\u00a0 And I think if you let people innovate, you know, don\u2019t get in their way too much, that you get better results.\u00a0 But, I mean, you\u2019re probably only going to get so much.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really the labor input that is the most limiting of all of this.Go back to the \u201980s, when we saw very strong trend growth, over 3% probably, and there were a lot of people coming into the workforce, continuing to come in.\u00a0 And that just added to the growth numbers.\u00a0 Now that\u2019s not likely to continue, and especially as you adjust immigration policies and things like that.\u00a0 That only makes it more difficult.So you put those two things together, and 1 \u00be, you know, is a very realistic estimate.\u00a0 Could it be 2 \u00bc?\u00a0 Could be, but it probably requires an awful lot of lift.Q:\u00a0 How worried are you about restrictive immigration and trade policies even creating further headwinds to getting a better GDP number?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah, I think\u2014I think\u2014yeah, I\u2019m nervous about that.\u00a0 I mean, I think that we need\u2014we need a vibrant labor market.\u00a0 We need an economy where we\u2019re adding to labor-force growth, however we get there.\u00a0 But, you know, we need to get that.\u00a0 I think that most of the people who\u2019ve left the labor force for demographic reasons\u2014you know, men, as they get older, have less of an attachment to the labor force.\u00a0 You know, every five-year bucket as they get older, they, you know, sort of choose randomly or however not to participate, you know, quite as much.\u00a0 And, you know, you go through all of that.\u00a0 You\u2019re just not likely to see the strong growth rates that we saw in the \u201980s, and even the \u201990s, unless some other spark is introduced.Q:\u00a0 What are you hearing from businesses in your district about immigration?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 We don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t really hear a lot of comments about immigration, not per se.Q:\u00a0 So you\u2019re not hearing anything about sort of, you know, restrictions and a lot of the stuff that\u2019s happening?\u00a0 Particularly in the Chicago area, it seems like there\u2019s been some activity.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah, that topic just doesn\u2019t come up very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that pharmaceutical companies, others\u2014they\u2019re probably H-1B visas or, you know, probably resource-constrained.\u00a0 But people don\u2019t really talk about that.You do\u2014you do always hear that it\u2019s just hard to find skilled workers, high-skilled workers, that type of thing.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for a long time; continues to go on.\u00a0 And some of it\u2019s probably forecastable; I mean, people who say that we\u2019ve known for a long time that welders were going to be retiring and nobody really beefed up the pipeline of training welders.\u00a0 Nobody was interested in the details of that.\u00a0 But the higher-skilled digital technology, I think it\u2019s very challenging.\u00a0 And the interaction with immigration, visas, is not helpful.Q:\u00a0 Just on the unknowns side of things, just to come back to the balance sheet, how much time do you think you need to give the market between some kind of reveal that things are going to get, you know, started, versus we are now starting?\u00a0 I think this\u2014I don\u2019t think Chair Yellen answered the question about whether the announcement and something forthcoming would be a month apart or maybe three months apart.\u00a0 And I know there\u2019s been some discussion of the phasing in of that.\u00a0 I just wondered how much time you feel you need to give the market between point A and point B, particularly the mortgage market, which may need a little bit more time than the Treasury market.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I read her transcript.\u00a0 I guess I didn\u2019t take strong note of the issue that you\u2019re pointing to.For me, I think that we\u2019ve laid out as much detail on this as anybody needs to sort of understand what they would be facing in terms of additional supply coming on the market from us, not reinvesting fully everything that matures.\u00a0 We\u2019ve announced that it\u2019s going to be a very slow start.\u00a0 Treasurys, I think, are the easiest.\u00a0 The (mortgage-backed securities) is more complicated. There\u2019s a lot of (inaudible) action and things like that.But I think that, you know, the New York desk will have additional commentary looking at the, you know, maturity structure of Treasurys.\u00a0 I, you know, had to even ask my staff sort of like, when we talk about reinvesting or rolling over, and how does that get distributed?\u00a0 And one of the answers I got back was, oh, it\u2019s the same way we\u2019re doing now, it\u2019s just a little bit less of it.\u00a0 Which kind of reminded me I hadn\u2019t be paying attention to all of the details of three- to five-year, you know, notes maturity and things like that.\u00a0 So I think the markets probably, you know\u2014I can\u2019t imagine why the markets don\u2019t understand on the basis of what we\u2019ve already laid out.Q:\u00a0 They do, but I think there\u2019s, like, another\u2014there\u2019s another widening that might come when you actually get started, so.Q:\u00a0 I mean, like, let\u2019s say you start\u2014let\u2019s say you decide you\u2019re going to start on November 1st.\u00a0 When do you say\u2014when do you tell folks, hey, we\u2019re going to start this on November 1st?\u00a0 Is that sort of what you\u2019re trying to get at?Q:\u00a0 It\u2019s sort of the\u2014whether it\u2019s flush, in the same meeting, or whether there\u2019s like a month\u2019s gap or even two months of a gap, bearing in mind there\u2019s, you know, a potential rate increase in December and you might not want to do two things overlapping in the same meeting.MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Oh, you know, some things are\u2014some things, in my mind, are a little bit more of a detail orientation, and I trust the New York Desk, you know, to keep people\u2014to be, you know, advertising and consulting with, you know, big\u2014you know, a whole bunch of people who are affected by this.\u00a0 I think that a lot of work has already been done.\u00a0 Speeches have been given.I think that it could be done just by we go into a meeting and then we say we\u2019ve just decided that we\u2019re going to do this, and, you know, perhaps it begins, you know, whatever the 1st of the next month is, something like that.\u00a0 Or it could be that it\u2019s decided and then we say, you know, a couple of months.\u00a0 I guess if we found ourselves in\u2014unsure about the Treasury discussions over the debt ceiling, it could be that we make an announcement and then it\u2019s, you know, got a little bit of a delay.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not quite sure why that would have to be very long.Q:\u00a0 There\u2019s a high bar to not continuing the rate rising campaign, but is there as much of a high bar to not continuing the balance-sheet actions?\u00a0 I mean, what would make you hold off this year\u2014from this year?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah, I think of it this way.\u00a0 I\u2019m not really expecting\u2014oh, people involved in the markets, it\u2019s definitely going to be a change from what they\u2019ve been doing.\u00a0 But in terms of the overall financial situation and the way the economy and pricing is going to be, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very big effect quickly.\u00a0 And the fact that it\u2019s going to take place over more than three years I think people can understand, and how it\u2019s going to build.According to our estimates of term premia, which have gone down due to the size of our balance sheet, we\u2019ve got some estimates\u2014the balance sheet is only going to change slowly.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to be in a surprise fashion.\u00a0 So, you know, one would think the taper tantrums that happened back in the spring and summer of 2013, nobody should be wrong-footed, you know, because they didn\u2019t expect this.\u00a0 I mean, if they weren\u2019t paying attention, somebody\u2014you know, people have to be accountable for things like that.\u00a0 But I think that there\u2019s been enough talking and planning over this that it should go smoothly.\u00a0 And I think that it\u2019s the kind of thing that can run in the background and not have a tremendous effect on adjusting the stance of financial restrictiveness.\u00a0 So I think that it could take place.The hurdle for not doing that, I think, could be quite high, given that we\u2019ve said, you know, we expect to do this this year.\u00a0 The hurdle for not making a funds rate adjustment, that I think is actually the live option if you think that something is happening with the economy or inflation that you weren\u2019t expecting.\u00a0 Having said that, I think everybody\u2019s forecast expectation for the economy is strong fundamentals, continued growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and, you know, two, three, maybe four rate hikes this year.Q:\u00a0 So when the balance-sheet action does start happening, you\u2019re not necessarily expecting to see, say, yields start to just push up higher?\u00a0 That\u2019s not something you necessarily expect to see happen?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 I would not expect that.\u00a0 I do not expect that.\u00a0 Can\u2019t rule anything out, of course.And, you know, I mean, the challenges with financial markets and yields\u2014you know, last night there was the question about the 10-year Treasury rate\u2019s come down a lot and, you know, what do you think about that.\u00a0 And you have to stop and remember that the Treasury\u201410-year Treasury rate was, you know, quite low until the election, and then the election, and then optimism from the business community about, you know, tax plans and regulatory relief and things like that, and, you know, 10-year rates shot up by a considerable amount, and they continue to build for a while.\u00a0 You know, then you have, you know, more British discussions about Brexit, elections, things like that; U.S. is a safe haven; people have slightly different expectations of legislative activity in Washington; and, you know, 10-year rates move down.Now, how much of that is because of our actions?\u00a0 Probably not much, if any.\u00a0 How much of it is everything else going on?\u00a0 I\u2019m in the everything else going on camp.\u00a0 But that\u2019s a big bucket, so.Q:\u00a0 It seems like there\u2019s an effort to\u2014you know, once this thing is put into motion, to have it go sort of automatically in the background.\u00a0 Is there sort of\u2014what would have to happen to kind of take the balance-sheet reduction off this automated path?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 Yeah, so once we get started\u2014you know, and we expect that it can take place in the background\u2014as we, you know, find ourselves confronting different expectations for the economic growth, the labor market, or inflation, our first tool, I would say, is adjusting the funds rate.\u00a0 So, if we see more inflation and we can go a little\u2014need to go faster, unemployment rate goes down lower, we can, you know, adjust upwards the funds rate path.\u00a0 If we\u2019re not seeing progress on inflation, we don\u2019t go as fast.You know, if something more unexpected and negative happened and we needed to provide more accommodation, you could\u2014you could first think about reducing the funds rate.\u00a0 Now, this is not my expectation at all; you know, not the most likely event.\u00a0 But you could still adjust the interest rate and not necessarily make any adjustments to the balance sheet.\u00a0 But if you think that you\u2019re at risk of something much deeper than that and you expect that you might hit the zero lower bound\u2014because we\u2019re only at 1 1/8 right now\u2014then, yeah, you could easily stop the balance sheet, and you could even choose to add assets if you were in very unfortunate circumstances.\u00a0 But, of course, that\u2019s the full toolkit on display, not what I\u2019m expecting.Q:\u00a0 Do you reckon whenever the next recession comes around that there\u2019s going to be the balance sheet\u2014adjusting the balance sheet is going to be part of the reaction?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 So I spend most of my time speaking in public about how difficult the risks of the zero lower bound are for monetary policy.\u00a0 I think that when we get down to zero, it\u2019s a very challenging environment.\u00a0 I think that when other government actors don\u2019t choose to take actions which help provide additional aggregate demand through fiscal policy or through other actions, that makes our job that much more difficult.\u00a0 And, you know, unless we\u2019re willing to just sort of stop and say it\u2019s not our responsibility\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way the Federal Reserve Act reads\u2014then we have to do more, and then I think that that means more asset purchases.Now, in Europe and Japan, they\u2019ve looked at negative interest rates.\u00a0 And we didn\u2019t ever\u2014I do not recall us ever meaningfully talking about negative interest rates back in 2009, you know, at that time.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option that many people would like.\u00a0 And so, if we end up having an inflation objective of 2%, if we find ourselves without enough headroom in order to reduce the funds rate enough in order to get the economy, you know, bottomed and growing again, then more stimulus comes from asset purchases.\u00a0 I\u2019d prefer not to have to do that.Q:\u00a0 Do you think Chair Yellen deserves to be reappointed as chair at the end of her term?MR. EVANS:\u00a0 I think Chair Yellen is terrific.\u00a0 Yes, I do think she\u2019s, you know, definitely worthy of that.\u00a0 I think she\u2019s done a great job in the transition from Ben Bernanke as chair.\u00a0 She\u2019s guided us through, you know, the wind-down of those policies and gotten us to the point where we\u2019ve begun renormalization.\u00a0 She understands the current situation extremely well.Now, I\u2019ve said some things where I say, you know, I\u2019m not so sure about the effect of the labor market for inflation, and the Phillips curve is very flat, and Chair Yellen understands all of these issues very well.\u00a0 I think at some point you have to, you know, place your bets.\u00a0 I think she\u2019s guided the committee extremely well.\u00a0 You know, she\u2019d be terrific.\u00a0 But, you know, it\u2019s a presidential appointment.\u00a0 One can never know how those things play out.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 17:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-feds-evans-discusses-inflation-interest-rates-balance-sheet-1497986583", "news_title": "Transcript: Fed\u2019s Evans Discusses Inflation, Interest Rates, Balance Sheet ", "keywords": "chicago fed,evans,fed's evans,interview,transcript,wsj interview,Federal Reserve,Charles Evans,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "New Orleans real-estate developer and entrepreneur       Sidney Torres IV       has won accolades for his success in cleaning up the French Quarter after Hurricane Katrina and for fighting crime in the storied historic district, sometimes spending his own money.But the achievements have done little to damp the outrage some preservationists have expressed over Mr. Torres\u2019s renovation of the 4,600-square-foot house and stable building he purchased in the district four years ago.Some of the work didn\u2019t get the proper permits from the city\u2019s Vieux Carre Commission, which oversees the French Quarter, and preservationists say he should be forced to undo it.Mr. Torres, a host of the new CNBC home improvement show \u201cThe Deed\u201d and a possible candidate for New Orleans mayor this year, acknowledges mistakes were made by his contractor but says the house has remained well within the character of the neighborhood.\u201cThese are things that would have been approved anyway,\u201d he said in an interview.Earlier this month, Mr. Torres reached a tentative compromise with the commission that requires him to report back in one month on modifying a few of the changes he had made. But preservationists remain unhappy and say he should be required to undo many more.\u201cWhat we have before us is a prime example of the adage that it\u2019s easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission,\u201d said Meg Lousteau, executive director of Vieux Carre Property Owners, Residents and Associates, at a June 7 commission meeting. She added that Mr. Torres\u2019s reputation for doing good in the district shouldn\u2019t make a difference.\u201cI would be saying this if the applicant were Pope Francis himself,\u201d she said.The donnybrook highlights the hazards developers face when working in some of the country\u2019s most loved historic districts. The rules in the French Quarter are particularly strict. Any change to a property\u2019s exterior, including roofs, interior courtyards and driveways, needs to be approved by the Vieux Carre Commission, named after the old French term for the French Quarter.Mr. Torres said he originally purchased the brick house, built just before the Civil War at 730 Esplanade Ave., thinking he would upgrade it and sell. But it was in \u201cdeplorable condition\u201d and he said he soon realized it wouldn\u2019t work as an investment. He estimated his cost of buying the property, carrying costs and other expenses at about $3 million.So he decided to make it his home. For the next few years he worked on extensive plans to add air conditioning and a swimming pool, add skylights, replace doors and windows and renovate its architectural features.As work proceeded, Mr. Torres obtained the necessary permits from the city\u2019s Department of Safety and Permits. The Vieux Carre Commission approved some of the upgrades, such as painting and adding the swimming pool.But according to a staff report made at the recent commission meeting, the panel didn\u2019t review and approve such work as the installation of new rooftop mechanical equipment, the addition of 14 skylights, the addition of a new second-floor window, the alteration of an arched transom and the construction of a new courtyard enclosure wall.Mr. Torres\u2019s lawyer,       Justin Schmidt,        said at the meeting the project \u201chighlighted some flaws\u201d in a new approval process the city had put in place. Permits were issued by Department of Safety and Permits \u201cwithout the VCC certificate of appropriateness being issued at the same time,\u201d he said.\u201cThe fact that Safety and Permits at the end of the day issued permits that had not been reviewed by the VCC is now being placed on the contractor and/or applicant and/or owner,\u201d he said.Nicholas Musso,        the commission chairman, responded by saying, \u201cThe onus is on the contractor and/or applicant and/or owner.\u201dAs part of the tentative compromise reached with the commission, Mr. Torres\u2019s legal and architectural team agreed to study some changes, including restoring the arched transom that was removed. Mr. Torres\u2019s team agreed to remove the second-floor window that was added unless they can find a photo proving that the window had been there originally but was subsequently covered up. But most of the other changes will be allowed to remain.If the commission had taken a harder line, Mr. Torres could have appealed to the city council. Mr. Musso, the commission chairman, said at the meeting he wanted to avoid such a scenario.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to see a confrontation with the city council, who I consider not particularly well-informed about the nature of place or the nature of the Vieux Carre in particular,\u201d he said.Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 17:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tv-show-host-sidney-torres-in-hot-water-over-french-quarter-upgrades-1497994162", "news_title": "TV Show Host Sidney Torres in Hot Water Over French Quarter Upgrades ", "keywords": " french quarter, the deed,vieux carre,Department of Safety and Permits,Vieux Carre Commission,Sidney Torres IV,political,general news,home improvements,living,lifestyle,real estate,property,construction"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON -- President       Donald Trump,        under pressure to respond to the death of an American student after his detention by North Korea, said Tuesday that China has been unable to crack down on North Korea, pointing to a new direction for U.S. policies.\u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a             Twitter                   message. \u201cAt least I know China tried.\u201dChinese President       Xi Jinping       visited Mr. Trump at his Florida resort in April, and the two agreed to work together to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs. In the weeks since, Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Xi. But his Twitter message Tuesday indicated that the effort has ended in failure.Only moments earlier, White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       said in a news briefing that Washington and Beijing have made progress on pressuring North Korea and are looking to do more.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work with them and others to put the appropriate pressure on North Korea,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.White House officials didn\u2019t immediately explain the disparate messages.Senior Chinese officials are due in Washington on Wednesday to huddle with Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis.Until Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday, administration officials had been saying he is seeking to cooperate with China to pressure North Korea to alter its drive for nuclear missiles. By abandoning that option, Mr. Trump faces a short list of alternatives that all are considered problematic. One is to impose so-called secondary sanctions that would penalize companies that do business with North Korea. China is bitterly opposed to such sanctions because the bulk of outside firms and banks doing business with Pyongyang are Chinese.The Trump administration recently asked China to act against around 10 Chinese companies and individuals trading with North Korea, saying that doing so would disrupt key networks that support North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.The U.S. hadn\u2019t set a deadline but has indicated the Treasury Department could impose unilateral sanctions on some of the entities before the end of the summer if Beijing doesn\u2019t act.Another option is an outright ban on U.S. tourism. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tuesday that Mr. Tillerson is considering whether to halt all travel by Americans to North Korea.The Trump administration also could attempt diplomacy with North Korea, as Mr. Trump previously has suggested, although Mr. Spicer played down prospects Tuesday. \u201cClearly, we\u2019re moving further away, not closer to, those conditions being intact,\u201d he said.American diplomats had been holding secret talks in Pyongyang and European cities with North Korea\u2019s top nuclear negotiator for more than a year, hoping to free U.S. prisoners and possibly establish a diplomatic channel to constrain North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.Officials with the Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday, 22-year-old       Otto Warmbier,        a University of Virginia student, died in a Cincinnati hospital. He had been released from North Korea after 17 months in captivity and was in a coma after apparently falling ill months earlier without the knowledge of U.S. officials or his family.His family said he came home unable to speak, see or respond to voice commands.After the disclosure on Monday of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death, U.S. lawmakers demanded that North Korea be held to account for his treatment.Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       \u201crepressive murderous regime\u201d deserves blame for Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death.\u201cThey must be held accountable for their continued barbaric behavior,\u201d he said in a statement.Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. \u201ccannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers.\u201dA county coroner in Mr. Warmbier\u2019s home state of Ohio announced an investigation into his death. Physicians said he had a severe brain injury, the cause of which remains unclear.Mr. Trump earlier Tuesday said that what happened to Mr. Warmbier is \u201ca total disgrace.\u201d\u201cThat should never, ever be allowed to happen,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, when asked about Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death. \u201cFrankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different.\u201dMr. Trump didn\u2019t spell out say how he would respond to Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death. His Twitter message came several hours later.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release from North Korean detention had been discussed by U.S. and North Korean officials through the secret diplomatic channel set up earlier. The State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea, Joseph Yun, met North Korean officials for talks in Oslo last month but wasn\u2019t told about Mr. Warmbier\u2019s deteriorating health, U.S. officials said.It was only on June 6, when Mr. Yun talked to Pyongyang\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations in another meeting in New York that the U.S. was told of the American\u2019s condition.Mr. Yun went to Pyongyang last week with a team of doctors to bring Mr. Warmbier home. He also met with three other Americans detained in North Korea. Ms. Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that she couldn\u2019t comment on their condition.South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-In is set to visit Washington and meet with Mr. Trump later this month.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-china-failed-to-help-u-s-with-north-korea-problems-1497987702", "news_title": "Trump Says China Failed to Help U.S. With North Korea Problems ", "keywords": " north korea, north korea nuclear program,u.s.-china relations, u.s. policy,Donald Trump,Xi Jinping,trade,external payments,capital movements,invisible trade,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,nuclear weapons programs,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,state department,weapons programs"}, {"content": "The New York City official whose agency oversees much of the contracts for the superstorm Sandy recovery program is stepping down, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.Feniosky Pe\u00f1a-Mora is the commissioner of the\u00a0New York City Department of Design and Construction, which helps oversee capital projects in the city from the building of libraries and police precincts to water-main construction, sewers and other infrastructure.

Now, in the age of sound files and streaming music, any kind of physical medium seems like a fetish object, and the package in which it is contained even more so. Clearly, size matters, and the past few years have seen huge boxed sets covering the complete catalogs of such legacy artists as       Elvis Presley       (60 CDs),       Johnny Cash       (62),       Miles Davis       (72) and       Tony Bennett       (76).But these pop, country and jazz packages pale besides those collecting the works of classical superstars, such as instrumentalists       Yo Yo Ma       (90 CDs) and       Arthur Rubinstein       (94). And even they are dwarfed by packages representing composers, such as \u201c      Mozart       225: The New Complete Edition\u201d (200 CDs) released last fall.

Here are the numbers: 230 DVDs containing that many concerts from the Bern Jazz Festival from 1983 to 2002, a total of roughly 400 hours of music, as well as 96 interviews with the artists (included on the DVDs as bonus material), 20 booklets (one for each year), and, as the press release puts it, one 344-page \u201clarge format\u201d book, all housed in a \u201ctasteful cabinet.\u201d Only 5,000 copies are being produced. More than ever before, you\u2019re not just buying music (and video). You\u2019re buying furniture\u2014even real estate. The list price is $8,400; no, it\u2019s not exactly an impulse purchase. (You\u2019ll also need a home theater; watching this on a standard-size computer monitor or TV set just won\u2019t do.)Excerpts shown in a teaser trailer on YouTube and at a launch event at the New School earlier this month are enough to make this jazz fan\u2019s mouth water:       Joe Williams       challenging       Dizzy Gillespie       to a blues/scat battle with the full Count Basie Orchestra as backdrop;       Art Blakey       appearing with an all-star version of his Jazz Messengers including       Freddie Hubbard       and       Benny Golson      ;       Sarah Vaughan       reacting to the presence of trumpet great       Clark Terry       in her audience. While the earlier concerts showcase already established greats, like       Benny Carter       and       Woody Herman,        gradually more younger stars become visible, like Bill Charlap playing piano with       Gerry Mulligan\u2019s       last great quartet and       Wynton Marsalis       leading his 1990 sextet with       Wycliffe Gordon.The interviews are also priceless, such as Mulligan explaining the origin of his famous \u201cpianoless\u201d quartet, and Art Blakey recalling how he was originally forced to switch from piano to drums by a gangster at gunpoint. (When the lights came back on at the New School after an excerpt from this interview, Mr. Marsalis, who was also present at the launch event, told the house, \u201cYeah, Art liked to make up stories like that.\u201d)Still, this boxed set raises the question of whether some of these packages have now grown so large as to be parodies of themselves. I personally don\u2019t know any jazz fan who has the means to purchase such a package. Then there\u2019s the time factor: Only younger jazz fans are likely to have the time left in their lives to watch, listen to, and enjoy all this amazing music. (As of this writing, 156 of the sets have been sold.)Seeing as they\u2019ve released remarkable performances in a package that\u2019s so enormous and overwhelmingly expensive that virtually no one can afford it, one has to wonder what purpose it actually serves.Whatever the motivation, unless the producers start to release some of the music in smaller sets or find some other way of distributing the music, like through streaming or subscription services\u2014which Mr. Zurbr\u00fcgg has said that they do not intend to do\u2014the best that dedicated listeners can do is hope our local libraries invest in a set and pray that no other jazz fan gets there before we do.\u2014Mr. Friedwald writes about music and popular culture for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 17:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boxed-sets-are-bigger-than-everbut-who-buys-them-1497992774", "news_title": "Boxed Sets Are Bigger Than Ever\u2014But Who Buys Them?", "keywords": "arts in review, blues,boxed set, jazz, jazz & plues art box, music,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,reviews"}, {"content": "U.S. stock indexes retreated Tuesday as oil prices slipped to their lowest levels since September, pressuring the shares of energy companies.Stock losses were broad, pulling nine of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors lower.

They are hungry for a victory in Georgia, because they have lost in two other proxy battles, in House special elections in Kansas and Montana.Republicans fear that losing a seat their party has held for almost four decades could suggest that the Trump presidency will take a political toll on the party in the midterms, especially in suburban battleground districts.With polls showing the Ossoff-Handel campaign ending in a dead heat and with few voters undecided, both candidates agreed this week on one thing: The only thing left to do in the final days was make sure that their supporters got to the polls.\u201cLet\u2019s summon everything we\u2019ve got to out-work, out-hustle, out-fight,\u201d Mr. Ossoff told his supporters on Tuesday via             Twitter.Ms. Handel continued to prod Republicans by portraying Mr.Ossoff as an ally of liberal Democratic leaders such as House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       of California, even though he has run on a centrist campaign message.\u201cRepublicans are motivated,\u201d Ms. Handel said in a CNN interview. \u201cThey surely don\u2019t want Nancy Pelosi\u2019s guy coming in.\u201dElection Day brought torrential rains and flash flood warnings to the district. More than 140,308 people had already voted in early\u00a0balloting, according to the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. That was almost three times the 56,830 people who voted early in the first round of balloting in April, during the special-election primary that winnowed an 18-candidate field.\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s run-off was needed because no candidate in April won more than 50% of the vote, although Mr. Ossoff came close, with 48%.The race is seen as potential bellwether for the 2018 midterm elections, because key battlegrounds in the fight for control of the House are likely to be suburban, affluent GOP districts like Georgia\u2019s 6th. Mr. Trump struggled in many of these districts in 2016.White House spokesman       Sean Spicer       played down the race\u2019s broader significance. \u201cIf you look historically, special elections generally don\u2019t foretell the outcome of races multiple years down the road,\u201d he said.The race could affect the president\u2019s ability to move legislation through Congress.\u00a0 A GOP defeat could spook Republican incumbents about the political risks of sticking with Mr. Trump on policy and perhaps make them more fearful of supporting a major overhaul of health care, which was a big issue in the Georgia race.The special election outcome also could shape the candidate field for the 2018 midterm elections, making it easier for the prevailing party to recruit candidates for the House. Republicans are already facing a tough political environment, because the party holding the White House typically loses seats in a midterm election.Democrats hoped a victory in Georgia would move them one seat closer to the House majority they aim to win in 2018. A loss would leave them having to defeat an incumbent to win back the seat, and certainly with less money than was available in the special election. In the midterms, the Democratic Party will be mounting challenges to dozens of GOP incumbents at once, though some will be in districts not tilted as heavily to the GOP as the seat in Georgia.The district has been held by the Republican Party since       Newt Gingrich       won it in 1978. Democrats have made it a test of their political strength, because Mr. Trump barely won the district in 2016. The seat came open this year when Mr. Trump chose Rep.       Tom Price       to be secretary of health and human services.The president, who attended a fundraiser for Ms. Handel in April, put more of his own political capital on the line in series of tweets Monday and Tuesday supporting her and attacking Mr. Ossoff.Urging his followers to vote for Ms. Handel, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cShe will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up!\u201dThe record $60 million poured into the race has included $31.4 by Mr. Ossoff and his supporters and $23.4 by Ms. Handel and her allies, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings by Issue One, a bipartisan campaign finance group.The result has been a campaign that has saturated the district with fliers, television and digital ads\u2014most of them negative\u2014and door-to-door canvassing so intense that it has left many voters feeling beleaguered and eager to see the campaign end.\u201cI\u2019m voting! I\u2019ve heard so much about the campaign! I\u2019m voting!\u2019\u2019 said one Marietta resident who slammed the door on a canvasser for a conservative group, the Faith and Freedom Coalition.Cobb County voter Dianne Poland, who supported Ms. Handel in the race, has kept a growing pile of political mail under her living room table. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have a bonfire!\u201d she said of her post-election plans.Voters in both camps expressed a desire for change, even if they found hope in different candidates.\u201cI would worry we would just get back to the same old, same old\u201d if Ms. Handel won, said Carla Edwards, an Ossoff supporter from Dunwoody, who said she voted for Mr. Price in the past.Jack Williams, a Handel supporter in Dunwoody, worried about the big influx of money from Democratic donors outside the district that helped Mr. Ossoff compete.\u201cI hope like the Dickens Karen wins so it might stop all of this nonsense from the Democrats, though it probably won\u2019t,\u201d he said.\u2014Shelby Holliday contributed to this article.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Both Parties Fear Georgia Defeat.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/both-parties-fear-a-defeat-in-vote-for-georgia-house-seat-1497991804", "news_title": "Both Parties Fear a Defeat in Vote for Georgia House Seat ", "keywords": "2018 election,democrats,donald trump,georgia house race,georgia race,handel,midterms,ossoff,republicans,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "U.S. oil prices tumbled into a bear market on Tuesday as the oversupply concerns that have roiled markets over the past few weeks put further pressure on investors.Bets that global exporters could ease a supply glut through a historic agreement to cut output have been undermined as production has increased in the U.S., Libya and Nigeria. Global inventories of crude oil and oil products have remained high, compounding on worries that rebalancing the global oil market will be harder than previously thought.Light, sweet crude for July delivery settled down 97 cents, or 2.2%, at $43.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than 20% below this year\u2019s high of $54.45 on Feb. 23. Brent, the global benchmark, settled down 89 cents, or 1.9%, to $46.02 a barrel.Tuesday\u2019s close put oil in a bear market for the first time since August 2016, before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil-producing nations agreed to limit output by about 1.8 million barrels a day at the end of last year. In May, the group renewed the deal through March 2018.The extended drop in oil prices is another worrying sign for OPEC, analysts said, which has struggled to put a dent in global inventories and keep oil prices supported.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this decline amid some major OPEC production restraints,\u201d said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates. \u201cThat\u2019s the huge difference\u201d compared with previous bear markets.U.S. companies have also ramped up shale production in response to higher prices this year, helping to offset impacts made by the OPEC cut, analysts said.Traders have been watching U.S. inventory levels, which have added to the bearish sentiment in recent weeks. With momentum pushing the market lower, even traders who believe output cuts are putting the market closer to a supply shortage aren\u2019t willing to place bets on that until after the U.S. government\u2019s influential weekly report on storage levels, due Wednesday morning, said Scott Shelton, broker at             ICAP                   PLC.\u201cMost of the bulls are waiting on statistics, and they\u2019re not going to stand in front of this thing until then,\u201d he said.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect crude stockpiles to fall by 2 million barrels, on average, in the week ended June 16.Even amid falling crude stockpiles in the U.S., oil prices have dropped as tepid stock draws have failed to impress investors. Tuesday\u2019s move marked oil\u2019s eighth loss of more than 2% in just the past two months.\u201cBarring a major draw that surprises people that\u2019s well over expectations, it\u2019s probably not going to provide much in the way of support,\u201d said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. \u201cThe market\u2019s definitely been very receptive to bearish news.\u201dThe American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that its own data for the week showed a 2.7-million-barrel decrease in crude supplies, a 346,000-barrel rise in gasoline stocks and a 1.8-million-barrel increase in distillate inventories, according to a market participant.Gasoline futures fell 1.8% to $1.4240 a gallon and diesel futures lost 1.1% to $1.3949 a gallon.Write to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-fall-to-new-2017-lows-1497956961", "news_title": "U.S. Oil Falls Into Bear Market Amid Worries Over Supply Glut ", "keywords": "bear market,brent crude,oil glut,oil markets,oil production,opec oil deal,wti,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,economic performance,indicators,inventories,economic news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,motor fuel markets,routine market,financial news,energy,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,crude petroleum extraction,heavy construction,oil production platform construction,construction,real estate,natural gas,oil extraction,oil sands,shale"}, {"content": "The dollar headed for its highest closing level in a month Tuesday as investors grew more optimistic that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this year.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, rose 0.3% to 88.98, which would mark its highest closing level since May 18.The dollar was supported by comments made Monday by New York Fed President       William Dudley,        expressing confidence in the U.S. economy and the prospect for higher inflation.\u201cInflation\u2019s a little bit lower than what we would like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we think if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that we\u2019ll see inflation get back to 2%.\u201dThe comments indicate that the Fed remains on track to raise rates again this year.

Senate GOP leaders intend to vote next week on legislation to repeal portions of the act.Republicans say the payments are legally tenuous, and a federal court has backed their argument that Democrats failed to make an explicit appropriation for them in passing their health care law in 2010. Democrats counter that Republicans are trying to remove the payments to sabotage the already fragile insurance markets and make a case for their own bill.President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has made the payments, which are sent monthly to health insurers, since taking office. But Mr. Trump also has openly mulled stopping them as a way to force Democrats to bargain with him over spending deals or health care, and Democrats and insurers had grown increasingly concerned that he would do so over the summer.As late as last week, the White House declined to say whether it would make the payments for the month of June. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Senate GOP leaders have set a timeline to vote on legislation repealing large chunks of the 2010 health law and that the White House planned to continue to highlight insurance market woes to push for 50 votes.Two industry officials said Tuesday that insurers had received their payments. A White House spokesman confirmed the June payment had been made, adding: \u201cWe are weighing our options and still evaluating the issues.\u201dThe spokesman also said that passing the GOP health bill, currently known as the American Health Care Act, would address the future of the payments permanently. \u201cCongress could resolve any uncertainty about the payments by passing the AHCA and reforming Obamacare\u2019s failed funding structure.\u201dThat bill is expected to include an appropriation for $10 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 for the payments.In the fight over the last spending deal, Democrats backed down from an insistence that the payments be written into the law, and the White House offered no public guarantees it would continue to make them in the meantime.Congressional Republicans have signaled that they are willing to see the payments continue to avoid triggering an immediate crisis in the insurance markets. They also hope to keep alive the issue at the heart of their lawsuit against the payments, which was brought by the GOP-controlled House in 2014.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-makes-aca-payments-to-health-insurers-for-june-1497974424", "news_title": "Trump Administration Makes ACA Payments to Health Insurers for June", "keywords": "affordable care act,ahca,american health care act,donald trump,funding,health care exchanges,health care reform,health insurance exchanges,obamacare,white house,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The European Union is in discussions with South Korea and China about taking a potential role as a broker for negotiations with North Korea on ending its nuclear program, according to EU officials involved in the effort.The discussions reflect concern in Brussels, Seoul and Beijing that sanctions alone won\u2019t persuade Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program and that negotiations are needed to avoid military conflict.The death this week of Otto Warmbier, the American college student imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year before returning home with a severe brain injury, has added to pressure in Washington for more strenuous action against Pyongyang.President       Donald Trump       said Tuesday that China has been unable to crack down on North Korea, pointing to a new direction for U.S. policies. \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a             Twitter                   message.A series of meetings in recent weeks in Brussels and Beijing have focused on ways that participants believe the EU could facilitate negotiations with North Korea, drawing on its members\u2019 diplomatic ties with Pyongyang and on its experience in helping to negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the officials said.EU officials have discussed the matter with Chinese Premier       Li Keqiang       during his visit to Brussels this month, and with South Korea\u2019s special envoy, Cho Yoon-je, in May.Any role for Brussels would need backing from Washington and EU member states, neither of which is assured.The Trump administration doesn\u2019t see Brussels as having the necessary leverage to help extract real concessions from Pyongyang on its nuclear program, a senior U.S. official said. There would be a concern, the official said, that the process would be used to water down Washington\u2019s call for a full dismantling of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cWould the process be used to manage us or manage the North Koreans?\u201d said the official.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the U.S. has held secret talks with North Korea for more than a year, hoping to free U.S. prisoners and establish a diplomatic channel for efforts to constrain Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.EU officials said they wouldn\u2019t do anything to undermine U.S. moves to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang.Officials from the 28 EU member states were set to meet Wednesday to begin discussing an overhaul of the bloc\u2019s North Korea policy guidelines, which were written in 2011.EU countries with embassies in North KoreaThat process is likely to take weeks but a draft text to be discussed at the meeting says the bloc is ready to \u201cactively cooperate\u201d in multilateral negotiations\u2014a line that could meet with some resistance among member nations.Also on Wednesday, senior U.S. and Chinese officials are set to meet in Washington to discuss security matters.EU officials said they were worried by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent remarks suggesting he was considering military action against Pyongyang, which has conducted nine missile tests since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.EU foreign-policy chief       Federica Mogherini       has called on all sides to reduce tensions and said any risk of military intervention should be avoided.The North Korea crisis also comes at a time of strain in U.S.-European relations. Senior EU officials have acknowledged growing differences with Washington across various foreign-policy issues.\u201cIt\u2019s our view that at some point you need a credible diplomatic process,\u201d said a senior EU official.The official noted that European companies have billions of dollars of trade and investment at stake in east Asia. \u201cIn that context, Europe is ready to be more engaged and is sharing the good experience and results achieved in the Iran nuclear negotiations.\u201dEU officials stressed that talks were at an early stage and said they wouldn\u2019t take any initiatives without Seoul\u2019s request. South Korea has a new appetite for engagement with Pyongyang following the election in May of President Moon Jae-in, an advocate of closer ties to Pyongyang.The Chinese and South Korean foreign ministries didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Many of the EU\u2019s 28 member states are cautious about the idea of putting the bloc at the center of North Korea negotiations.Some are wary of involvement in such a diplomatic minefield in the midst of Brexit negotiations. Others want to avoid any steps that could be seen as undermining U.S. policy and are focused more on raising economic pressure on Pyongyang. The bloc has continued to tighten sanctions on Pyongyang, going beyond those imposed by the U.N.U.S. officials have so far been skeptical of a potential EU role on North Korea, since Pyongyang has long indicated that it wants to deal directly with Washington. Mr. Trump, as well, has been fiercely critical of the Iran deal.Formal talks would likely need to involve other countries, U.S. officials said, and there is little appetite in Washington for resuming the \u201cSix Party Talks\u201d\u2014among North and South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia\u2014that began in 2003 and collapsed shortly before Pyongyang\u2019s second nuclear test in 2009.China, which hosted those talks, has long called for their resumption, but the U.S. sees them as being too tightly controlled by Beijing. Although China continues to provide economic support to North Korea for strategic reasons, relations have deteriorated in recent years, Chinese officials say, making it less likely that Pyongyang would tolerate a lead role for Beijing.EU officials said Brussels may be seen as a more neutral party by all sides, as 26 of its member states have formal diplomatic relations with Pyongyang and seven maintain embassies there.One champion of the idea in Brussels is Ms. Mogherini, who chaired the final rounds of negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2015. The EU has invited Wu Dawei, China\u2019s special representative for Korean affairs, to visit Brussels, and he has responded positively, without confirming a date, according to EU officials.\u2014Jonathan Cheng in Seoul and Jay Solomon in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'EU Seeks Role in Pyongyang Talks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-discussing-role-as-broker-on-north-korea-1497991275", "news_title": "EU Discussing Role as Broker on North Korea", "keywords": "north korea carousel,north korea nuclear,nuclear talks,otto warmbier,European Union,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,nuclear weapons programs,politics,weapons programs"}, {"content": "The Southwest\u2019s summer heat isn\u2019t just a punchline\u2014it is grounding flights, straining power grids and sending skiers down mountains in beachwear.Nevada, Arizona and parts of Southern California are experiencing record-breaking heat and an unusually long heat wave that is expected to last through the week.In Las Vegas, the temperature on Tuesday was 117 degrees, breaking last year\u2019s record of 115. The heat in Fresno, Calif. reached 110 degrees for the first time since 1920, according to the National Weather Service.American Airlines Group Inc.,       one of the biggest carriers in the region, delayed and canceled 50 flights\u00a0to and from Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor airport Tuesday as temperatures there hit 118 degrees, breaking last year\u2019s record of 116.American Airlines said the heat reached maximum operating temperature for its planes. The Bombardier CJR, used by American for regional flights to and from Phoenix, has a maximum operating temperature of 118 degrees, which is the maximum figure allowed by the manufacturer of the jet.Even when the temperature is below the maximums, engines don\u2019t perform as well in the less-dense hot air and the heat can damage brakes and tires, according to Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and aviation blogger.Because the hotter air is less dense, wings produce less lift, requiring higher takeoff and landing speeds as well as increased runway space, Mr. Smith said.Southwest Airlines Co.       is continuing flights without cancellations in the area, a spokesman said. The airline doesn\u2019t typically cancel flights due to heat since temperatures fluctuate, and that the crew can take steps to accommodate for the weather, such as reducing weight on the aircraft, the spokesman said.The National Weather Service said high temperatures will persist at least through\u00a0Saturday, possibly longer.Temperatures hit triple digits across parts of inland California from Sacramento, to Palmdale, Calif. in the desert east of Los Angeles.The California Independent System, which supplies 80 % of the state\u2019s power consumers, issued a \u201cflex alert\u201d, calling on consumers to cut back on electricity use.In Mammoth Lakes, Calif., close to the Nevada border, deep snowpack and elevated temperatures were a boon for skiers, who wore bikini tops and shorts in weather expected to hit a high of 72 on Tuesday.A spokeswoman said the resort is seeing \u201cwell above average\u201d attendance for June.

On Sunday, the U.S. shot down a Syrian regime warplane, and on Tuesday, an American fighter downed a regime-backed drone. The series of confrontations are posing questions about the perils of a broader conflict for all of the military components involved in Syria.In Monday\u2019s incident, the Russian warplane came within about 30 feet of the American jet, according to a senior defense official.The risky intercept maneuver, which was between an American RC-135 reconnaissance jet and an armed Russian Su-27 Flanker, occurred when the Russian jet approached at a \u201chigh rate of closure speed and poor control of aircraft,\u201d according to U.S. defense officials.The Russian military said in a statement to the news agency Interfax Tuesday the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft carried out a \u201cprovocative maneuver\u201d in the direction of the Russian fighter.\u201cDuring the escort, the RC-135 crew attempted to draw closer to the Russian fighter by carrying out a provocative turn toward the Su-27,\u201d the Russian Defense Ministry said, according to Interfax.The Russian statement added that the Russian pilot reacted to the U.S. plane\u2019s maneuver, and continued escorting it away from Russian airspace, Interfax said.Capt.

John Carney       agreed to increase starting salaries for the state\u2019s correctional officers by 22%, a move that followed a deadly February prison siege in which a veteran officer was killed.An independent review of the uprising, released earlier this month, found that the prison was critically understaffed and pointed to low pay as a reason for high turnover and chronic personnel shortages.Gov. Carney, a Democrat, pledged to boost pay after the release of the sharply critical outside report.\u201cThis agreement represents a significant step forward in addressing our staffing challenges at the Department of Correction,\u201d he said in a statement.The pay increase will boost starting pay to $40,000 for the fiscal year that starts July 1 and to $43,000 a year later from $35,200, according to an agreement between the state and the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware.

Lower energy prices tend to deflate inflation expectations, making long-term Treasury debt more appealing. Inflation chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power from their bond investments and is seen by them as a big threat to the value of long-term Treasurys.The 30-year Treasury debt was the best performer. The yield settled at 2.735% Tuesday, compared with 2.787% Monday. It marked the yield\u2019s lowest close since Nov. 8, 2016, when       Donald Trump       won the U.S. presidential race.Yields fall as bond prices rise.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.153%, compared with 2.188% Monday and near its 2017 close low of 2.138% set Wednesday.The oil move further fires up the debate among investors on the inflation outlook. The U.S. consumer-price index in May fell below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target again; commodities including energy have been weakening; and a gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the U.S. fell Tuesday to the lowest level since October.Yet after raising short-term interest rates for a second time this year, Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       signaled Wednesday that slowing inflation reports over the past few months could be noisy. Ms. Yellen and some of her colleagues believe a robust labor market would eventually push up inflation, supporting the central bank\u2019s plan in normalizing interest-rate policy.\u201cThe bond market doesn\u2019t believe that the Fed would carry through its plan in raising rates four times by the end of 2018,\u2019\u2019 said       Jim Leaviss,        fund manager at M&G Investments.The 10-year break-even rate, or the yield premium investors demanded to hold the 10-year Treasury note relative to the 10-year Treasury inflation protected security, was 1.66 percentage points Tuesday. That was the lowest level since October, a sign of diminished inflation expectations.At this level, it suggests investors expect U.S. inflation to run at an annualized rate of 1.66% on average within the next 10 years. The break-even rate traded above 2% in January.Falling inflation expectations may push consumers and businesses to delay spending, which would be negative for the economic growth.Michael Collins,        senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said the higher growth, higher inflation narrative following the U.S. presidential election has been reversing.\u201cDisinflation, not higher inflation, may be a bigger risk,\u2019\u2019 a scenario that could send long-term Treasury yields down further still, he said.Some investors are worried the Fed could make a policy error especially if they misjudge inflation.The yield premium investors demanded to hold the 30-year bond relative to the five-year note on Tuesday was 0.977 percentage point. That marked the lowest level since 2007, according to Tradeweb.A shrinking premium is known as a flattening yield curve, which is typically interpreted by investors as a sign that the U.S. economy may be losing momentum. Investors who subscribe to this view are selling shorter-term debt and migrating cash into longer-term bonds, adding to the flattening curve momentum.New York Federal Reserve President       William Dudley       said Monday he is confident on the growth outlook, and the flattening yield curve isn\u2019t sending a negative signal for the economy. He believes it has been driven by global flows into the Treasury bond market because of its more attractive yields compared with many other developed government bond markets.Some analysts side with this notion and caution investors should refrain from overinterpreting the bond market\u2019s signal.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-bonds-gain-strength-1497973134", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Rise ", "keywords": "bond market,debt,government bonds,inflation,investors,markets,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,economic performance,indicators,prices,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,bond markets,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary,energy"}, {"content": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc.        AMD 0.52%       began selling a new generation of chips for the servers that drive computing in data centers, challenging             Intel Corp.        INTC 0.09%       in that high-margin market for the first time in years.AMD on Tuesday introduced the first four of nine chips dubbed Epyc that it claims offer higher performance at lower prices than comparable Intel chips currently on the market. Intel has said it will refresh its server processors over the summer.The Epyc line reintroduces competition to a high-margin arena that Intel lately has had to itself. Intel holds nearly 100% share of the $16.5 billion market for server chips of the most popular type known as x86, according to Mercury Research. That dominance helped the chip giant keep prices high and achieve a gross margin\u2014a key measure of profitability\u2014of 61% in 2016, compared with 23% for AMD.Other chip makers also are challenging Intel in servers.

This spring AMD debuted its Ryzen chips for personal computers, which scored well in independent tests. That boosted anticipation of Epyc, which is based on the same core design.AMD in the past has introduced competitive products but failed to follow through with ongoing releases to sustain its momentum. The company at a recent meeting with analysts assured them that it has a long-term road map for products this time.Ms. Su said in an interview that, despite substantial investments in PC processors and graphics chips, \u201cthe single largest bet for the company is in the data center.\u201d Her goal is to lift AMD\u2019s server-chip market share to double digits \u201cin a couple of years,\u201d she said.Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with market-research firm Moor Insights & Strategy, said hitting that goal would require AMD to execute its plan flawlessly. Moreover, \u201cIntel will be relentless in clawing back any lost territory,\u201d he said, and he expects any damage to Intel to be limited because it has diversified into areas like server storage, memory, and networking.Lisa Spelman, general manager of Intel\u2019s Xeon server-chip line, expressed confidence its products, including its forthcoming server chips, but said that \u201cIntel takes all competitors seriously.\u201dAMD at its Tuesday launch event in Austin, Texas, showed Epyc-based systems from several major server vendors including             Dell Technologies Inc.,Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.      , and             Lenovo Group Ltd.      , and announced that the chips were being used by major cloud-computing providers.AMD touted the line\u2019s performance and pricing, but also features intended to make it more economical in data-center systems. Each chip can interact more readily with memory and ancillary equipment like graphics processors, AMD said, allowing a single Epyc to do work that would require two Intel server chips. Slimming servers from two to one chip could produce a 20% saving in total cost, AMD said.\u201cI think this is AMD\u2019s strongest suit\u2014and harder for Intel to defend against because it would require an architectural shift,\u201d Mr. Moorhead said.Write to Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amd-launches-fight-against-intel-in-lucrative-server-chip-market-1497988801", "news_title": "AMD Launches Fight Against Intel in Lucrative Server-Chip Market ", "keywords": "Advanced Micro Devices,AMD,Cavium,CAVM,Intel,INTC,Qualcomm,QCOM,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,semiconductors,computing,computer hardware,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "Uber Technologies Inc., trying to reshape its image after a series of scandals this year, said Tuesday it will let drivers collect tips through its app for the first time as part of new driver-friendly features.Allowing tips via the app removes a longstanding source of contention between the ride-hailing company and its drivers. Uber\u2019s U.S. rival, Lyft Inc., has long offered a tipping option through its app, giving it an advantage in recruiting drivers. Uber has allowed drivers to accept cash tips.Uber\u2019s new tipping option is now available in Seattle, Houston and Minneapolis and will expand to other U.S. cities in the coming weeks. It is part of several new features Uber announced as it aims to improve earnings and keep drivers from defecting.In recent months, the San Francisco-based company has been buffeted by charges of rampant sexual harassment and sexism, an exodus of high-level executives and an admission that it erroneously withheld tens of millions of dollars from New York City drivers over more than two years. Uber is also fighting a lawsuit by Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       over alleged trade-secret theft and faces a federal probe into its business operations.Over the years, Uber has had a contentious relationship with its 1.5 million contract drivers, who have bemoaned the lack of benefits and the sudden fare changes, among other complaints. New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission in April announced proposed rules to require tipping as an option there, under pressure from a group of contract drivers known as the Independent Drivers Guild.Lyft on Monday said its drivers had collected $250 million in tips over time, including $50 million in the past 2\u00bd months.Uber has argued tips would add a step to the checkout process, make some passengers feel like they must pay another obligatory charge, and incentivize drivers to work only in neighborhoods where tips may be highest. \u201cIt would be better for riders and drivers to know for sure what they would pay or earn on each trip, without the uncertainty of tipping,\u201d Uber had said in a 2016 blog post.On Tuesday, Uber told drivers in an email that it was time give them \u201cthe experience you deserve.\u201dThe Drivers Guild praised Uber\u2019s decision, calling it \u201can important first step toward a more fair ride-hail industry.\u201d Uber has had no prohibition on customers paying tips in cash and some drivers have put tip jars in their vehicles.Drivers in other cities have been pushing Uber to allow app tipping, including Philadelphia, where some workers have affiliated with a union, and Seattle, where the Teamsters hope to represent Uber and Lyft drivers.Uber will roll out tipping as an option outside the U.S. in the coming months, though the timeline isn\u2019t yet clear, according to a spokesman.Among other changes, Uber said it will charge customers a fee if they cancel a ride request after two minutes, down from a prior five minutes, and will begin charging per-minute rates for waits exceeding two minutes.Uber said it will also tack on a $2 fee to the base fare for trips involving teenager accounts. The company said it is raising the fee because teens require drivers to call parents to confirm pickups and because they are more likely to require costly customer support when requesting a ride.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 15:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-app-to-allow-tipping-for-first-time-1497981329", "news_title": "Uber\u2019s App Will Now Accept Tips", "keywords": "ride hailing,tips, uber drivers, uber tipping,Uber Technologies,Lyft,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,general labor issues,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       for the first time sketched out the outlines of a bargain with France on fixing the governance of Europe\u2019s single currency, in the clearest sign yet that the two biggest eurozone countries are inching toward reconciling sharply different views on the matter.Germany could support two central French demands\u2014the appointment of a eurozone finance minister and the creation of a common budget\u2014if some conditions were met, Ms. Merkel told business leaders in Berlin on Tuesday.\u201cWe can of course think about a eurozone budget as long as it\u2019s clear that this is really strengthening structures and achieving sensible results,\u201d she said.In a striking softening of previous language opposing broader financial burden-sharing among member states, Ms. Merkel said \u201cwe could think about a common finance minister\u2026if we aren\u2019t pooling liabilities in the wrong place.\u201dAs qualified as it is, Ms. Merkel\u2019s surprise overture on an approach long taboo in Germany suggests the stalled process of reforming the eurozone could kick back into life sooner than most experts had expected. It comes a month after pro-European       Emmanuel Macron       was elected French president, a win many see as evidence that the continent\u2019s political mood is growing more supportive of the European Union\u2014and a moment advocates of further eurozone reforms say should be seized.An adviser to Mr. Macron said Ms. Merkel\u2019s apparent openness to reforms was \u201cvery positive,\u201d calling it \u201cpart of this new Franco-German climate of confidence.\u201dThe chancellor\u2019s comments took even some German officials by surprise, coming ahead of a national general election in September. Berlin had refused to engage in detailed talks about the eurozone\u2019s future before the vote, insisting Mr. Macron had to prove his mettle first by enacting domestic economic measures over the summer.Speaking before Ms. Merkel in Berlin, the head of the German Federation of Industry, Dieter Kempf, endorsed the idea of a common eurozone budget and finance minister \u201cif these steps are correctly conceived.\u201d With such an approach, he said, \u201cweak periods and imbalances could be countered early and the possibility of real crises further reduced.\u201dThe crisis that engulfed the eurozone in 2010 and is only beginning to dissipate laid bare deep defects in the currency union\u2019s design, including weak central control on public spending and the absence of incentives for countries to harmonize disparate economies. The eurozone also lacks the ability to raise and spend money in ways that could help buffer downturns.The severity of the cash crunch forced several member states to seek emergency assistance from their peers and from the International Monetary Fund. It also nearly caused the bloc\u2019s weakest member, Greece, which remains under financial tutelage to this day, to drop out of the bloc.The region has since equipped itself with a banking authority and a rescue fund for states facing liquidity shortages, but most experts agree much is left to be done to make the eurozone a sustainable construction.Germany has long focused on tougher central controls on public spending and rejected jointly issued bonds, which Berlin thinks would encourage overspending by economically fragile members.Under Mr. Macron, France has floated the idea of a joint eurozone budget to finance specific areas, such as unemployment insurance and infrastructure investment, across the region\u2014a notion anathema to Berlin until now.Both countries have at different times suggested the appointment of a finance minister for the eurozone, though France sees that role as overseeing a common budget while Germany envisages a fiscal policeman.Ms. Merkel\u2019s comments, however, suggest these two visions might be reconciled into a common arrangement combining tougher fiscal policing and some fiscal transfers between budget-surplus and deficit countries.\u201cThis looks significant, especially about what it says about the state of mind,\u201d said       Nicolas V\u00e9ron,        a eurozone expert at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, of Ms. Merkel\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal there is a will to find a constructive solution.\u201dGerman officials say they have been reluctant to engage with Mr. Macron on eurozone reform ahead of Germany\u2019s general election because fiscal transfers are unpopular among the country\u2019s voters. And they say they are still skeptical about the novice president\u2019s ability to execute the tough domestic labor market reforms and spending cuts he campaigned on.\u201cWe still need to see the evidence,\u201d one official said.French officials say rather than directly confronting Ms. Merkel on recasting the eurozone, they are concentrating in talks with their German counterparts on shorter-term goals more understandable for voters, such as tightening regulations on temporary workers moving between EU countries. Progress on such issues would give momentum to meeting longer-term objectives for the eurozone, the adviser to Mr. Macron said, which is expected to be a central theme of a joint Franco-German cabinet meeting mid-July.After last weekend\u2019s parliamentary election in France gave Mr. Macron\u2019s party a solid majority, recognition is growing in a skeptical Berlin that he may have the seats\u2014and political clout\u2014to deliver on his promises. Mr. Macron says he will move quickly to legislate changes to labor laws by the end of September.German officials also see the appointment of       Bruno Le Maire,        an expert on Germany and a fiscal conservative, as France\u2019s economy minister as a sign that Paris is serious about engaging constructively on eurozone reform.Since France and Germany have long sat on opposite sides of the spectrum of ideas about how to fix the eurozone, a Franco-German agreement could go a long way toward mapping out reforms acceptable to others.German officials say one question will be the scope of a possible agreement, which could range from tweaks to the existing structure to the creation of a fully fledged finance minister\u2019s office and even a separate eurozone parliament.The minimalist option could involve turning the region\u2019s rescue fund into a European Monetary Fund with stronger budget-oversight powers.The more ambitious version would require an amendment to European Union treaties and therefore unanimous agreement among all 28 EU members\u2014an option German Finance Minister       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble       has deemed \u201cnot realistic.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that a political window for eurozone reform will open after the German election,\u201d the German official said. \u201cWhen it does, do we go for the more realistic, small-step approach or for the big vision?\u201d\u2014William Horobin in Paris contributed to this article.Write to Bertrand Benoit at bertrand.benoit@wsj.com and Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Merkel Open to Eurozone Reform.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 15:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/merkel-signals-openness-to-eurozone-reforms-1497978811", "news_title": "Merkel Signals Openness to Eurozone Reforms ", "keywords": " eurozone budget,eurozone governance, eurozone reforms, german-france relations,German finance ministry,Angela Merkel,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,treasury department"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Democrats have begun escalating their parliamentary and messaging tactics against the Republican health bill as a Senate vote approaches, hoping their opposition resonates with voters while risking accusations of obstructionism from President       Donald Trump.Without the votes to halt Republicans from passing their bill, Democratic lawmakers have instead opted this week to begin slow-walking other Senate business in protest. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Tuesday invoked a rare parliamentary rule effectively canceling committee hearings for the day, and the party plans to object to parliamentary moves that require unanimous consent.\u201cWhat more could we do\u2014hold Republican Senators by the arms to stop them from getting to the chamber?\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) \u201cI think we\u2019ll use every tool at our disposal.\u201dDemocrats hope to emphasize the potential impact of the GOP health bill, which they say would endanger health coverage for millions of Americans. But they also want to draw attention to what they say has been a rushed and secretive legislative process, with no public hearings and Senate leaders planning to unveil the bill\u2019s text days before a vote slated for Thursday of next week.Their grievances echo complaints lodged by Republicans in 2010, as Democrats pushed through the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) disputes the notion that the process has been overly secretive, saying lawmakers will have ample opportunity to read the bill and amend it next week.\u00a0He also points to \u201cgazillions\u201d of past hearings on health care and the ACA.Mr. Trump, for his part, has accused the Democrats of obstructionism when it comes to health care and other matters, and he and other Republicans have said the ACA is collapsing of its own weight, an assertion denied by Democrats.\u201cThe Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P[remium]s,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Monday.Still, Democrats aren\u2019t alone in their complaints. Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) Tuesday criticized GOP leaders\u2019 decision to write most of the health-care bill behind closed doors without Democrats\u2019 input. \u201cIf you do it on one side only, what you\u2019re setting yourself up for is failure,\u201d said Mr. Paul, who has suggested he will oppose the bill. \u201cThe public\u2019s not going to accept it if only one side does it. If you at least have open committee hearings and hear from both sides, I think that\u2019s better.\u201dDemocrats are also intensifying their public messaging on health care.The Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm launched a new series of digital ads on Monday against Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the GOP lawmakers seen as the most vulnerable in the 2018 cycle. The ads are meant to reach young voters on Google and Youtube and feature a woman hawking her wedding ring to pay for a child\u2019s medical costs.In ramping up their opposition, Democrats run the risk of casting their actions as meaningless or impotent, critics warn.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate the process from the politics in this instance,\u201d said Josh Huder, a Congress expert at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \u201cThis will in no way, shape or form stop the health-care bill.\u201dThat could risk alienating some voters who supported Mr. Trump and want him to succeed, but might also be open to a Democratic congressional candidate. More than half of Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018, 10 of them in states that President Trump won.Polls suggest the GOP bill is broadly unpopular. But the Democrats\u2019 strategy is likely to appeal most to the party\u2019s left flank, which party leaders hope will turn out in large numbers for the midterm election.Indivisible, an anti-Trump group that cropped up in the wake of the 2016 election, urged members to call Democratic senators and demand they delay the process and offer \u201cthousands\u201d of amendments to slow it down.\u201cThis is a do-or-die moment on the ACA and your Democratic Senator should be doing everything they can to stop this bill from getting through the Senate,\u201d organizers wrote.Until recently, Democratic lawmakers have largely avoided tampering with day-to-day business in the Senate, other than a brief protest against some of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees. Instead, they have looked to affect the process in other ways, notably through a series of oversight requests aimed at the Trump administration.In one letter earlier this month, the top Democrats on four Senate and House committees objected to social media posts made by official Department of Health and Human Services social media accounts promoting the Republican health bill and using the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d hashtag.Those posts, they argued, likely violated a ban on using federal funding to lobby for legislation.

The contract has dropped 17% so far this year, leading coffee roasters to buy and hold coffee beans because they are able to benefit more from their positions in the market than from the coffee.ED&F Man\u2019s Volcafe said supplies of beans in the U.S. remain voluminous, with the latest figures from the Green Coffee Association pegging U.S. stockpiles of beans at 7.1 million bags, the highest since 1994.It is also created a situation in which producers in Brazil and Colombia are on the sidelines.\u201cWhere the price is currently, it isn\u2019t advantageous for these producing nations to hedge their crops so you\u2019re not seeing them chasing this crop lower.

AMZN 0.24%       is giving shoppers another reason not to visit stores. The online giant is rolling out a free service to let its Prime members try on clothes at home, its latest attempt to crack into the fashion world.The new service, dubbed Prime Wardrobe, is a threat to traditional sellers of apparel, especially department stores, that are struggling to get shoppers to visit stores. It also challenges online players, such as             Nordstrom Inc.\u2019s       Trunk Club and startups like Stitch Fix, which ship boxes of clothes for people to try on at home. Shares of several retailers, including Nordstrom and             Gap Inc.,       fell about 3% Tuesday afternoon.The service announced Tuesday would allow Amazon Prime members to fill a box with three or more eligible apparel items from its website, try them on at home for seven days and ship back what they don\u2019t want free. Customers aren\u2019t charged for the purchase during the trial period and they are offered a discount of up to 20% on what they keep.\u201cThe reason this program is such a wake-up call for traditional retailers is the fitting room was the one place where an offline retailer could differentiate itself from an online pure play,\u201d said       Joel Bines,        the co-head of AlixPartners LLP\u2019s retail practice. \u201cA good sales associate [in a store] can make all the difference.\u201dApparel is a notoriously difficult and costly segment for online retailers, where return rates can approach 40% for some items. Amazon is now the second-largest apparel seller behind             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       after taking market share from             Target Corp.       and several department stores, according to a research note published by             Morgan Stanley                   in April.For all its success in other areas, \u201cAmazon still hasn\u2019t cracked the apparel code,\u201d Mr. Bines said. \u201cIt\u2019s philosophy of being the everything store is a disadvantage in apparel.\u201d Traditional retailers have relied on the instincts of their merchants to create a curated selection for shoppers. By contrast, Amazon wants to make every choice available to customers, which can be overwhelming for some.The online retailer has made inroads by convincing such name brands as Calvin Klein, Kate Spade and Levi Strauss to sell on its website. It has also been adding its own brands in several categories, including athletic clothes, lingerie and workwear. It recently named former Victoria\u2019s Secret executive Christine Beauchamp to replace Catherine Beaudoin as head of its fashion division.An Amazon spokeswoman said more than a million items are eligible for the Wardrobe service, including brands like Calvin Klein, Levi\u2019s, Lacoste and Adidas. \u201cIt makes it easier for customers to touch or see items in-person when buying clothing, shoes and accessories online,\u201d she said.Amazon\u2019s new program resembles online shopping service Stitch Fix, but shoppers choose their own items. Stitch Fix, which recorded sales of $730 million in its last fiscal year, uses personal survey data and stylists to pick a set of five items for each shopper. Customers receive a 25% discount when they buy everything in the box.Stitch Fix didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a game-changer,\u201d said Sam Romanoff, a research associate at L2, a digital benchmarking firm. \u201cIt seems like they are trying to enter the box business, but they are not providing additional services, such as stylists.\u201dSome traditional retailers noted that Amazon\u2019s latest offering is no different from the free shipping and free returns they provide their customers. They say they already allow customers to buy items online but pick them up in stores, so shoppers can try them on before they take them home. They also contend that shoppers aren\u2019t willing to completely abandon physical stores.\u201cOur customer moves very easily between online and offline,\u201d Macy\u2019s Chief Executive       Jeff Gennette       told shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting earlier this month.A Nordstrom Inc. spokeswoman said Tuesday the company has launched several initiatives aimed at making the online and in-store experience more seamless, including a service that allows sales associates to create digital boards filled with personalized style recommendations that customers can view on their mobile phones or computer.Traditional apparel chains have struggled to turn a profit online because of higher shipping and return costs, but Amazon\u2019s logistics know-how could help. \u201cBuying clothes online is dicey just because of the returns factor,\u201d said John Haber, founder of supply-chain consultancy Spend Management Experts. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying a bathing suit, a very high percentage of those are returned.\u201d\u2014Khadeeja Safdar and Laura Stevens contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 15:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-new-wardrobe-service-is-latest-threat-for-apparel-stores-1497978320", "news_title": "Amazon\u2019s New Wardrobe Service Is Latest Threat for Apparel Stores", "keywords": "Amazon.com,AMZN,Gap,GPS,GAP,Nordstrom,JWN,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,fashion,living,lifestyle,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Nestl\u00e9 SA        NSRGY 0.52%       has bought a stake in startup Freshly\u2014a small investment in home-delivered food that comes as the Swiss food-and-drinks giant struggles with slow-growing demand.Nestl\u00e9 said Tuesday it had bought a minority interest in the subscription-meals company as the lead investor in a $77 million funding round.

It sells to customers through a weekly online service offering a rotating menu that includes gluten-free, high-protein, low-carbohydrate and vegetarian options.As well as broadening Nestl\u00e9\u2019s menu of products, the stake in Freshly provides direct access to customer data\u2014a sought-after asset for consumer goods giants because it may allow them to sell in a more targeted fashion.\u201cWhile most food choices are still made in supermarkets, it is clear that consumers are responding to a growing universe of direct-to-consumer options,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 U.S. chief executive       Paul Grimwood       said.\u201cNestl\u00e9 will gain visibility into Freshly\u2019s advanced analytics and its highly effective distribution network, and Freshly will benefit from our R&D, nutrition and sourcing expertise,\u201d he added.Nestl\u00e9 rival             Unilever                   PLC spent $1 billion in 2016 buying Dollar Shave Club, a subscription-based razor business that sells to 3.2 million members, saying the move would help it gain access to customer data.

Last week, Amazon said it was buying Whole Foods Market Inc. for $13.7 billion.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s latest investment gives it a stake in the online prepared-meals market that is valued at $10 billion in the U.S. alone. The move comes as Nestl\u00e9 CEO       Mark Schneider,        who took the top job in January, faces investor pressure to find new avenues for growth.Last week, Nestl\u00e9 put its U.S. confectionery business up for sale. The company has invested significantly in recent years to try to turn around sales of Lean Cuisine, its frozen ready meals brand, as well as of brands like       Stouffer\u2019s      .In 2015, Nestl\u00e9 opened a $50 million research and development center in Ohio focused on finding growth in the frozen and chilled foods market.Overall sales of ready meals grew by 1.5% in the U.S. between 2011 to 2016, according to Euromonitor, but sales of frozen meals declined by 11%. By contrast, sales of prepared salads jumped by 29%.Freshly\u2019s weekly menu gives people 30 different meal options, which the company says are made with natural ingredients and are contained in eco-friendly packaging. It also offers free shipping.Freshly is currently available in 28 states. The new round of funding will help the startup construct an East Coast kitchen and distribution center in 2018, as it looks to expand nationwide. Unlike rival startups Blue Apron Holdings Inc. and HelloFresh, it sells fully prepared meals, rather than specified ingredients.\u201cAlthough North America represents 20% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s global sales in packaged food, which makes it its largest single market, it continues to lose share in this important market,\u201d said Euromonitor food analyst       Lianne van den       Bos.Nestl\u00e9 U.S.\u2019s food division president,       Jeff Hamilton,        will join Freshly\u2019s board.Freshly is \u201cdirectly aligned with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s strategic focus on finding new avenues to deliver delicious, nutritious meals to consumers in a way that fits their busy lives,\u201d he said.Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Nestl\u00e9 Buys Into Delivered Meals.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 15:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-buys-stake-in-freshly-putting-healthy-food-deliveries-top-of-the-menu-1497948113", "news_title": "Nestl\u00e9 Buys Stake in Freshly, Putting Healthy Food Deliveries Top of the Menu ", "keywords": " freshly health foods, freshly meals, freshly startup,nestle buys freshly, nestle buys startup, nestle unilever,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,Mark Schneider,corporate changes,plans,strategy,corporate funding,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,small business start-up capital,senior level management,small,medium businesses,food,drink,nutrition,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,ready made meals,food products"}, {"content": "BAGHDAD\u2014Iraqi forces are using small, off-the-shelf drones to target Islamic State in the crowded and twisting streets of Mosul\u2019s Old City, where the militants are making a last stand.Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism forces on Tuesday said they pushed to within a few hundred yards of the al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi officially announced the creation of the Islamic State caliphate in 2014, and has been a symbol of the militants\u2019 power.The Old City likely has some 100,000 civilians and a dwindling number of extremist fighters packed into about 1\u00bd square miles.Mosul is Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, and Islamic State\u2019s last major stronghold in the country.Iraqi forces worry that this stretch of fighting could be the bloodiest of the battle for Mosul, which began in October, and that it could last for weeks longer.Iraqi and American forces are looking for any advantage to loosen Islamic State\u2019s hold in the Old City, where militants use civilians as human shields and deploy booby traps.Though troops can see the mosque, they also see civilians fleeing the fighting and that has slowed their advance, counterterrorism officials said.The latest advance in Mosul was aided in part by the drones, quadcopters that are small enough to carry in a backpack, sell for about $1,500 commercially and are rigged with cameras on the underside.Iraqi counterterrorism forces have said they used quadcopters to supply aircraft with the U.S.-led coalition with some of their first targets in the Old City.Iraq\u2019s federal police say they do the same.Islamic State terrorized Iraqi forces earlier in the battle for the city by using their own drones rigged to drop grenades.Now, Iraq\u2019s security forces have turned the technology against the militants.At a command post near the front lines, American combat advisers huddled days ago around stacks of high-tech communications equipment and screens with feeds from multimillion-dollar aircraft while they waited patiently for an Iraqi quadcopter to give them the battlefield intelligence needed for an airstrike.\u201cUsing the Iraqi drones is something new,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Walid Khalifa, deputy commander of the Iraqi Army\u2019s 9th Division. \u201cWe see the enemy and we decide its location and we give the coordinates of targets. It\u2019s faster than before.\u201dLt. Col. James Browning, a battalion commander with the U.S. Army\u2019s 82d Airborne Division, said it can be time-consuming to have Iraqi forces spot a potential target and then pass along the coordinates for an airstrike verbally.By the time he got the requests translated from Arabic, double-checked the target and approved the strike, the opportunity had sometimes passed in the quick-moving urban warfare.Weeks ago he realized the Iraqis already had the technology available to cut through such problems.When Iraqi drone pilots fly a quadcopter over a target\u2014and bring that target up on screen, showing militants fighting Iraqi troops in high definition\u2014Col. Browning said he gets what he needs to authorize a strike in seconds.\u201cWe\u2019re able to deliver joint fires essentially at their command,\u201d he said, referring to airstrikes, artillery and other weapons.Iraqi troops have been tinkering with quadcopters to make it possible for them to fly further and still provide real-time video feeds in dense parts of Mosul.Col. Browning said Iraqi drone technicians had fitted drones with bigger batteries, giving them extended range.If one falls from the sky or gets shot down, they launch another at little cost, he said.And if there is no Iraqi drone available, the U.S. is still able to call on its ample arsenal of high-tech drones and aircraft, which are often already in the sky, can fly longer and further and can be equipped with infrared cameras, powerful weapons and other advanced gear.The U.S. can use those to coordinate strikes, though it may take a few minutes longer, Col. Browning said. \u201cWe can still go old-school.\u201dWrite to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 14:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqis-deploy-drones-to-target-isis-in-mosul-battle-1497951006", "news_title": "Iraqis Deploy Drones to Target ISIS in Mosul Battle", "keywords": "political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "One of the many ironies of the       Theresa May       leadership is that the Tories selected her for the top job because of her perceived experience and skill to see the nation through its most complicated ever peacetime negotiation. Yet her decision to call the June 8 \u201cBrexit election\u201d was one of the U.K.\u2019s biggest political blunders in years.The election has transformed the context for the Brexit battles to come. Mrs. May had previously hoped a big election victory would allow her to deliver her vision of a complete exit from the European Union while securing a comprehensive new trade agreement with Brussels. Now her reputation is in shreds.Her weakness could see the nation crashing out of the EU with the hardest and potentially most disorderly of all exits, and without any deal on a future U.K.-EU relationship. Her minority government may not survive the course of negotiations. Or it may be unable to take the tough decisions needed to get an agreement.The stakes at play are huge and historic. The EU could likewise be damaged by a disorderly, hard Brexit. Delivering a smoother departure now needs clear, coherent and careful strategy and thinking.One indicator of the U.K.\u2019s weakened hand is the capitulation by Brexit Secretary       David Davis       to the EU\u2019s negotiation timetable. Mrs. May had previously insisted that exit-deal negotiations, including over the so-called financial-divorce bill, must parallel discussions over the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. On Tuesday Mr. Davis agreed with the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiatior,       Michel Barnier,        that talks on how much money the U.K. will have to pay to leave will happen first, thus increasing Brussels\u2019 leverage.Such is the potential weakness of Mrs. May\u2019s government that there is now concern that proper negotiations may no longer be possible. Since extending the two-year talks would only reduce the EU\u2019s negotiating power, Brussels is ratcheting up pressure on Mrs. May to proceed, whether her team is ready or not.The problem is that Mrs. May\u2019s domestic position has also weakened. She may not survive as prime minister for the full two years it may take to conclude negotiations. She also faces what may now be a majority in the House of Commons that supports a softer Brexit, including the overwhelming majority of members of Parliament from the opposition parties plus between 20 and 30 Tories. One could sense the new post-election assertiveness of the former Remainers within the Tory Party when Scottish leader       Ruth Davidson       said the electorate \u201cdid not vote for a Brexit which makes us poorer or less secure . . . so let\u2019s commit to an \u2018Open Brexit.\u2019 \u201dThis could threaten, among other things, Mrs. May\u2019s past commitment to casting aside the U.K.\u2019s membership in the European Customs Union. Such a stance could be a red line for the Democratic Unionist Party, whose contingent of 10 members of Parliament from Northern Ireland are being wooed to reach a parliamentary cooperation pact by Mrs. May\u2019s government. Casting aside customs-union membership would create a harder border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the only land crossing between the EU and U.K. after Brexit.With cross-border trade between the two countries worth more than \u20ac3 billion ($3.36 billion) a year, few want to see this disrupted. Yet if the U.K. fails to stay in the customs union or strike a trade deal with the EU, U.K. exports will be hit by the common EU external tariff, which would necessitate border checks.There is also the question of whether the U.K. might be able to retain membership in the European Single Market, especially if the EU was willing to accept new U.K. immigration restrictions. While that remains uncertain, a sign of the shifting mood in U.K. politics is that even arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage has highlighted the possibility now of the U.K. moving toward a Norway-style European Free Trade Association relationship, which would still see the U.K. leave the EU while retaining full access to the single market.Political support in the U.K. for a softer Brexit is growing. The big question is whether Mrs. May\u2019s government can be resilient enough to survive the course of negotiations or have sufficient political capital to make the tough decisions needed to reach such an agreement. Without strong, constructive leadership from all sides, the odds are growing that the U.K. could crash out the EU with the hardest of hard Brexits.Mr. Hammond is an associate at LSE Ideas at the London School of Economics.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 14:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-begins-brexit-talks-on-the-back-foot-1497984517", "news_title": "Britain Begins Brexit Talks on the Back Foot", "keywords": "brexit, britain, david davis, european union, financial divorce, michel barnier, theresa may,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014House Speaker       Paul Ryan       expressed confidence Tuesday that Republicans can \u201cfix this nation\u2019s tax code, once and for all\u201d this year despite a long row of hurdles in front of them.Mr. Ryan, in a speech to manufacturers in Washington, echoed the major themes of the plan he released a year ago and didn\u2019t delve into the details that divide Republicans or the negotiations between President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration and members of Congress.\u201cThe defenders of the status quo\u2014and there are many of them\u2014they\u2019re counting on us to lose our nerve, to fall back, or to put this off altogether,\u201d Mr. Ryan (R., Wis.) said. \u201cBut we will not wait for a path free of obstacles. Guess what? It does not exist.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, sandwiched between cable news appearances, was intended to build momentum and public support for the party\u2019s aims. Republicans see a tax overhaul as an economic and political necessity that would deliver on one of their core campaign promises.For now, taxes are secondary to health care and other policy issues. But the GOP is planning a busy fall, and Mr. Ryan said he hoped the tax bill could be done before Thanksgiving so taxpayers would have a clear sense of the new system going into 2018.So far, however, Republicans haven\u2019t resolved most of the major issues that divide them and they haven\u2019t settled core questions about whether they want tax cuts or a tax overhaul, whether they want a temporary bill or a permanent change and exactly who would win and lose from the inevitable trade-offs.Gary Cohn,        director of the White House National Economic Council, said Tuesday Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are aiming for a unified plan among congressional lawmakers and the administration by September. He spoke at a \u201clistening session\u201d with technology company executives. Mr. Cohn said the president checks in daily on the issue.Tax policy could gain momentum if Republicans can pass a health law that repeals parts of former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       Affordable Care Act and cuts hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes that wouldn\u2019t have to be addressed as part of a tax plan. Failure on health care would create complications for a tax bill, but it might also create pressure on Republicans to bank a major accomplishment.Among the current challenges facing Republicans:\u2022 The biggest is internal opposition\u2014particularly in the Senate\u2014to Mr. Ryan\u2019s plan to add a border adjustment to the corporate tax, which would tax imports and exempt exports. Mr. Ryan sidestepped that issue on Tuesday and is forging ahead in the absence of an alternative.Some Republicans have urged Mr. Ryan to drop border adjustment, contending that his insistence on it is holding up progress toward a deal.\u2022 Republicans also have to decide whether they want a tax cut or a revamp of the system that would lower rates for individuals and companies while leaving federal tax collections nearly unchanged. Conservatives and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides favor a tax cut.\u201cWe will get tax cuts done and we will get them done this year,\u201d Vice President       Mike Pence       said in a speech immediately preceding Mr. Ryan\u2019s.Mr. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have said they favor a so-called revenue-neutral approach\u2014meaning that total taxes wouldn\u2019t change much while rates get lowered and some breaks vanish\u2014after counting revenue generated by the tax plan\u2019s economic effects.\u2022 Mr. Ryan said Tuesday that a permanent tax law is important to achieve Republicans\u2019 economic goals.\u201cEvery expert agrees that temporary reforms will only have a negligible impact on wages and economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses need to have confidence that we won\u2019t pull the rug out from under them.\u201dBut without Democrats\u2019 cooperation, a permanent bill will likely need to avoid increasing budget deficits beyond a 10-year period. That is a condition of using the procedures known as reconciliation, which allow a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes typically needed for passage.As a result, the GOP tax cuts would either need to expire or be small enough to have their deficit effects peter out by the end of a decade.\u2022 To address tax policy, Republicans would have to pass a budget that allows them to use the reconciliation procedure. That will require bridging gaps between Republicans who emphasize spending cuts and those who want to spend more on the military.Few, if any, Democrats are expected to join Mr. Ryan. They argue that the GOP offers certain rate cuts to corporations and high-income households with little clear benefit to the population at large.\u201cPaul Ryan is not serious about tax reform. He\u2019s serious about tax giveaways\u2014for millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations,\u201d Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a liberal group, said in a statement.The result may not be the tax plan Mr. Ryan first laid out a year ago.

Bob Casey (D., Pa.) released a report arguing Republican-proposed cuts to Medicaid funding would worsen the country\u2019s growing opioid problem because many people use their Medicaid insurance to cover addiction treatment. He was joined at a news conference Tuesday by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.).The law known as Obamacare greatly expanded Medicaid coverage in states that chose to accept it, making millions of low-income Americans newly eligible for the health program. But the health-care bill passed by the House would phase out that expansion.A spokesman for the Senate majority leader declined to comment. GOP senators said Tuesday they expected to see text of the bill later this week, ahead of a vote likely next week on its passage.Mr. Manchin and Mr. Casey come from states hit hard by opioid-related overdose deaths\u2014West Virginia had the highest rate of such deaths in 2015 while Pennsylvania had the sixth highest.\u201cIt\u2019s a critical time for the opioid epidemic and Medicaid because of the connection between the two,\u201d Mr. Casey said.Senate Republicans have considered adding extra funding for opioid treatment to their bill to assuage concerns from other GOP lawmakers from states dealing with higher rates of opioid overdoses.But Democrats, including Mr. Casey and Mr. Manchin, are dissatisfied by the prospect of opioid addiction treatment coming from a grant, rather than health care coverage itself.\u201cYou have to have treatment. We still have people in denial, people believing that drug abuse is not an illness,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cOne time grant isn\u2019t going to be able to fight this long-term addiction.\u201dMr. Casey and Mr. Manchin represents states that voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election, and both are up for re-election in 2018.

Mr. Trump called Ukraine a place that \u201ceverybody\u2019s been reading about,\u201d and said \u201cwe\u2019ve had some very good discussions.\u201dMr. Poroshenko told Mr. Trump that it was a \u201cgreat honor and great pleasure\u201d to visit the White House, calling the two countries \u201cstrategic partners.\u201dHe was also scheduled to meet Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       and Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       later in the day.Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s visit presented challenges for Mr. Trump, who has said he wants to improve relations with Russia, but is under pressure to distance himself from the Kremlin amid burgeoning investigations into the aftermath of alleged hacking by the Kremlin into U.S. elections. Russia denies the interference.Tuesday\u2019s meeting came just weeks before Mr. Trump attends the Group of 20 summit in Germany, where he\u2019s expected to speak in person with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       for the first time. For months, Mr. Poroshenko has been angling for a meeting so he could push for more U.S. pressure on Moscow to stop its support of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Before now, the presidents had only spoken by phone.The visit Tuesday was a low-profile event, compared to how Mr. Trump has hosted other world leaders. Mr. Trump met briefly with the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office, in what White House officials said described as a \u201cdrop by\u201d that took place while Mr. Poroshenko met separately with Vice President       Michael Pence.On Monday, Mr. Trump personally welcomed the visiting president of Panam\u00e1, hosted him for an Oval Office meeting that included a photo-op with their wives, and treated him to a luncheon.Last month, Mr. Trump hosted Russia\u2019s foreign minister and U.S. ambassador in the Oval Office, and officials in Kiev had feared the U.S. leader would meet Mr. Putin before Mr. Poroshenko.In the brief Oval Office appearance Tuesday, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t publicly mention pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. A White House statement after the meeting said the two leaders discussed \u201csupport for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and President Poroshenko\u2019s reform agenda and anti-corruption efforts.\u201dMr. Poroshenko, who made a fortune in a chocolate-making business before going into politics, has hoped his background as an entrepreneur may give him a means to forge ties with Mr. Trump, officials close to the Ukrainian president said.\u201cThis is a good thing that this meeting is taking place before a Trump-Putin meeting,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, DC. \u201cIt\u2019s important that there be a real exchange between the two presidents.\u201dThe Trump administration has voiced support for Ukraine, saying the U.S. would maintain sanctions on Russia until it reversed its annexation of Crimea. But Ukrainian officials have been unsettled by some other signals. During the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Trump suggested sanctions against Moscow should be eased, and earlier this year Mr. Trump met briefly with a domestic political rival to the Ukrainian president, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.Both U.S. and European officials have expressed frustration over a lack of progress in implementing a peace plan for eastern Ukraine that had been brokered in 2014 and 2015 in the Belarus capital of Minsk with the help of European mediators.Tenets of the so-called Minsk agreement included holding local elections in Ukraine\u2019s breakaway Donbas region and returning the border with Russia to Ukrainian control.Last week, Mr. Tillerson suggested the U.S. would back an entirely new peace deal, saying it would support efforts of Ukraine and Russia to resolve the conflict outside of the Minsk accord.\u2014Michael C.

Wayne Johnson,        a former executive in the financial-services industry, to run the $1.3 trillion federal student loan portfolio.The position of chief operating officer of federal student aid has been vacant since May when James W. Runcie resigned, saying he couldn\u2019t in \u201cgood conscience\u201d lead the agency while it was facing rising scrutiny from the Trump administration about its management of the lending programs.Dr. Johnson, who went back to earn his Ph.D. in educational leadership in his 60s, appears to have done his homework for the job. He wrote his dissertation on the weaknesses of the decision-making process students go through before they borrow tens of thousands of dollars to pay for college.\u201cThere is more federal protection in place when you buy a car than there is when you sign up to take on student debt,\u201d Dr. Johnson said in an interview\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cIt comes down to basic consumer protection.\u201dDr. Johnson, 65 years old, worked in senior management at             Visa                   and Deloitte before starting his own company, which captures credit-card transactions in real time and alerts card holders to better manage their accounts.He said he was approached by the search committees of a couple of colleges that were looking for presidents but his lack of a Ph.D. worked against him so he began a program in academic leadership form Mercer University. He already held an M.B.A. from Emory University. His dissertation was titled: \u201cEyes Wide Shut: Understanding Private Student Loan Indebtedness.\u201dDr. Johnson said a school\u2019s responsibility is to first \u201cdo no harm,\u201d by not loading students up with debt. Dr. Johnson said both for-profit and not-for-profit schools have room to improve.\u201cPrivate university financial officers were perceived (by students and their parents) as being willfully negligent in informing students about the characteristics of their student loans,\u201d Dr. Johnson wrote in his dissertation. He found those loans \u201charmed\u201d some of the students he studied.Don Shafer, a professional colleague of Dr. Johnson, said Dr. Johnson has spoken of simple fixes in the student debt program using technology to limit what students can spend their student loan money on to reduce fraud and waste. So, for instance, they might have a credit card that couldn't be used at a liquor store and which would send them the balance on their account every time they used it to buy books or some other legitimate purpose.\u201cWayne is the right person to modernize FSA for the 21st\u00a0Century,\u201d Secretary DeVos said in a statement. \u201cHe actually wrote the book on student loan debt and will bring a unique combination of CEO-level operating skills and an in-depth understanding of the needs and issues associated with student loan borrowers and their families.\u201dThe term is for five years and was left vacant when Mr. Runcie,\u00a0the former\u00a0chief operating officer of the Education Department\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid, resigned in May. In a two-page letter he said he wouldn\u2019t comply with Ms. DeVos\u2019s\u00a0insistence that he testify at a House hearing last month.The hearing was supposed to focus on potential mismanagement of student-aid programs, including errant payments to students and schools, building off a recent report from the department\u2019s inspector general highlighting high rates of payment errors.Mr. Runcie, first appointed by the Obama administration in 2011, said in a statement that \u201csuccessfully leading and managing a large, complex organization in the public sector requires alignment on governance and mission between operational leaders and political ones.\u201d He said he submitted his resignation \u201cbecause that alignment no longer exists,\u201d and that Ms. DeVos \u201cshould have the opportunity to appoint a chief operating officer of her choice.\u201dWrite to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 14:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/devos-appointee-to-head-student-loan-program-has-done-his-homework-1497981601", "news_title": "DeVos Appointee to Head Student-Loan Program Has Done His Homework ", "keywords": "a. wayne johnson,betsy devos,education department,office of federal student aid,student aid,A.

CSCO 1.24%       is placing a major bet on security to revive sluggish sales of networking switches, its biggest business, as part of a multiyear effort to fend off competitors and turn around the struggling company.The networking giant on Tuesday revealed a new security service it says can identify and stamp out malicious software cloaked by encryption on computer networks. Today, more than 40% of cyberattacks may be hidden in encoded internet traffic, according to security researchers, so detection is crucial to stopping fast-moving attacks.Cisco is counting on this new service to help drive sales of its switches, hardware that links together computers on corporate networks. The service, called Encrypted Traffic Analytics, will be available as a subscription in September with its new line of Catalyst 9000 switches. The company wants to show how its new hardware, which can be programmed, will run a variety of new services that can bring in recurring revenue.Cisco\u2019s switching business, which made up roughly 30% of its overall revenue in the latest quarter, is in need of a makeover as a raft of competitors have stolen some of its leading market share over the years. The company\u2019s revenue has fallen for six straight quarters because of declines in the switching and router businesses that once made Cisco the world\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization.While the market for switching hardware has risen about 16% to $24.4 billion between 2010 and 2016, Cisco\u2019s annual sales in that department remained relatively flat, at about $13.9 billion.Chief Executive       Chuck Robbins       has sought to move beyond Cisco\u2019s hardware legacy and into software and services since he took the helm in July 2015. The company spent $6.3 billion on research and development in the ensuing year, up from $5.9 billion in the previous period, as it began to expand its reach in security, analytics and automation.As corporations and governments grapple with increasing cyberattacks, Mr. Robbins sees advanced security as one way to reinvigorate switching sales. The company in recent years has made a number of high-profile security acquisitions including Sourcefire and OpenDNS. In the nine months of the fiscal year through April 30, the security division\u2019s sales have risen about 12% to about $1.6 billion.The need for security will only increase as networked sensors in everything from retail stores to self-driving cars significantly boost network traffic. In an earnings call with analysts in May, Mr. Robbins said customers will need security software embedded in the network to stop threats as soon as they arrive.By analyzing encrypted traffic, the company is solving a network security challenge it previously thought unsolvable, Cisco executives said. The software can analyze metadata\u2014the secondary information such as an email time stamp or the address of the sender\u2014in encrypted communications to find behavior that is indicative of known threats. Since the service doesn\u2019t need to decode messages such as the content of an email message, privacy is preserved.Organizations including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are testing the new Cisco Catalyst 9000 switch and its security offerings, Cisco said.Cisco isn\u2019t the only company doing work in behavioral pattern recognition around network traffic, but it may be the furthest along, particularly with encrypted traffic. Arbor Networks, for example, offers products that look at network traffic behavior to disrupt so-called denial-of-service attacks. In February,             Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.       acquired startup Niara, which uses advanced analytics including machine learning to determine anomalies in network traffic.\u2014Robert McMillan contributed to this article.Write to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 14:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-bets-on-security-to-drive-switch-sales-1497981600", "news_title": "Cisco Bets on Security to Drive Switch Sales ", "keywords": "cisco,encryption,malicious software,security service,service,Cisco Systems,CSCO,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,computers,consumer electronics,networking,lan,wan hardware,computing,technology"}, {"content": "Among the biggest winners from President       Donald Trump\u2019s       deregulatory agenda could be a handful of banks that don\u2019t often garner much attention.So-called custody or trust banks, including             Bank of New York Mellon        BK -0.88%       and             State Street,        STT -1.60%       specialize in safekeeping the securities and other assets of institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurers. They stand to benefit more than other banks from potential changes to how regulators calculate lenders\u2019 total leverage.Custody banks take some cash deposits from their investor clients, but their business models aren\u2019t focused on making loans. Instead, they tend to invest in safe, highly liquid assets like Treasury bonds, or else just hold cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve.These are among the assets that the U.S. Treasury Department now wants to exclude from calculating total leverage, according to the department\u2019s report on banking regulation last week. If the change goes through, it would be a windfall to the custody banks. The step would require cooperation from other regulatory agencies, notably the Federal Reserve. But, crucially, it wouldn\u2019t require congressional legislation, making it easier to achieve than many other deregulatory steps.If these assets were excluded from leverage calculations, BNY Mellon, State Street, and their smaller competitor             Northern Trust Corp.       could have between 33% and 38% of their total assets freed up, according to analysts at             Goldman Sachs.J.P. Morgan Chase,       which also has a sizable custody business, would see around 21% of assets exempted. At other large banks the ratio ranges from 12% to 17%, according to Goldman\u2019s analysis.Since around 2014, BNY Mellon and State Street have shrunk their balance sheets and issued billions of dollars of preferred shares to bring down their leverage ratios. Preferred shares are interest-bearing securities that stand between equity and debt in a company\u2019s capital structure. If leverage calculations are loosened, it would allow them to call back the preferred shares, lever up again, or both. Earnings would rise as a result.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimate the regulatory shift could boost 2018 earnings per share by 19% at BNY Mellon and 26% at State Street. This assumes the banks make large, instantaneous adjustments to their balance sheets, which isn\u2019t realistic. But it still illustrates the potential power of changes in leverage calculations.Since the U.S. Treasury report was released, shares of BNY Mellon and State Street have risen 2.4% and 2.8% respectively, compared with a 0.8% rise in the KBW Nasdaq Bank index. These moves seem minor compared with the potential earnings upside.

Josh Hart was a finalist, a season after leading Villanova to a national championship. For their comprehensive accomplishments and years of stellar performance, their reward during Thursday\u2019s NBA Draft will likely be hearing their names called...in the second round.There isn\u2019t much missing from this year\u2019s draft. In the days leading up, the Celtics traded the No. 1 pick to the 76ers. More shuffling could ensue with a bevy of stars potentially on the move in exchange for one or more of the top selections.But don\u2019t expect Mason and Hart to be a big part of the draft-night conversation. They are afflicted with professional basketball\u2019s equivalent of a scarlet letter: They\u2019re both entering the draft after their senior years in college. And they\u2019re part of a class that may get completely ignored during the entire first round.Even in the \u201cone-and-done\u201d era when freshmen have routinely dominated the top picks, this year\u2019s forecast is unprecedented. In each of the prior 11 drafts, since high-school players were excluded from making the immediate leap to the NBA, at least three seniors have gone in the first round every year. The average is more than five.This year, just one, Colorado guard Derrick White projects to land in the first round, according to DraftExpress.com. And that\u2019s not even a sure thing\u2014that mock draft has him barely making it in at pick No. 26.\u201cThere\u2019s maybe a little bit of a misconception that the older you are the less value you have,\u201d said Tad Boyle, White\u2019s coach at Colorado. \u201cThere are outliers there. There are undervalued assets.\u201dInstead, DraftExpress projects every one of the top-10 picks being used on freshmen, which if that actually happens would be the first time ever. The appeal to these younger players is simple. Their bodies can develop even more. Teams see more potential. With the older guys, by contrast, the perception is that what you see is what you get and that their ceilings are therefore lower.What makes this so confounding is that it ignores one of the biggest lessons from recent drafts. In past seasons, seniors have routinely made general managers who ignored them earlier in the draft feel stupid for just doing that.This happened with Malcolm Brogdon just last year. At Virginia, Brogdon was a first-team All-American, ACC Player of the Year and two-time conference defensive player of the year. On draft day, he went with the sixth pick of the second round to Milwaukee Bucks. Now he will finish higher in the Rookie of the Year voting than anybody else from his draft class\u2014the other two finalists, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid, were taken in prior years.There is a Malcolm Brogdon in almost every draft. Jimmy Butler lasted until pick No. 30 in 2011, with Draymond Green waiting five picks longer than that in 2012. Others such as Jeremy Lin or Robert Covington went completely undrafted and turned out better than most players in their classes.\u201cEach year, we see examples,\u201d said Seth Greenberg, an ESPN analyst and former college coach. \u201cYou\u2019d think the more examples we see, people would say, \u2018Wait a second.\u2019 But we don\u2019t see it a lot because people get so caught up in potential.\u201dBoyle, Colorado\u2019s coach, speculates that it\u2019s not just being a few years older that hurts these prospects\u2019 stocks. It\u2019s also that they have played so much that while that makes their abilities apparent, it gives more time to reveal their flaws too. That also could explain why White is expected to be the first senior off the board: He has been on the national radar for just one year, after beginning his career at a Division II school.The players at their pre-draft workouts acknowledge the reality of their circumstance. Hart feigned shock when a reporter noted he wouldn\u2019t be the No. 1 overall pick. Guard Sindarius Thornwell, who led South Carolina\u2019s stunning charge to the Final Four, says he knows teams may just see him as a role player and defensive stopper\u2014and he accepts that it\u2019s how he has to sell himself.Mason put it bluntly: \u201dIt\u2019s just how the NBA is.\u201dWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'The NBA Draft Isn\u2019t Kind to Seniors.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nba-draft-will-have-few-senior-moments-1497980514", "news_title": "The NBA Draft Will Have Few Senior Moments ", "keywords": "basketball,political,general news,college sports,education,sports,recreation,university,college,routine general news"}, {"content": "TORONTO\u2014Embattled Canadian mortgage lender             Home Capital Group Inc.        HCG 0.14%      \u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0agreed to sell about half\u00a0of its commercial mortgages for 1.16 billion Canadian dollars ($873.1 million) to a unit of KingSett Capital, a private-equity investor.Home Capital said the mortgage sale, aimed at boosting liquidity, is at a slight discount to the mortgages\u2019 principal value and is less a portion of future losses on the loans.Home Capital said it expects to record a pretax loss of about C$15 million on the deal. The deal follows another agreement last month to sell or transfer about C$1 billion of Home Capital\u2019s residential home loans to a mortgage investment company.Home Capital\u00a0held C$25. 7 billion of mortgages as of\u00a0last year, of which about\u00a0C$2.2 billion were commercial. The company is Canada\u2019s leading mortgage lender to residential homeowners with less-than-stellar credit ratings.The company\u00a0said in a statement that proceeds from the sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter, will be used to pay down a high-cost, C$2 billion emergency loan the lender arranged in April in the wake of a sudden exodus of deposits. As of this week, the company said it has borrowed C$1.65 billion under the loan.The expensive loan was struck with a Toronto pension fund, which is charging 10.2% in interest and fees for the one-year loan.Home Capital\u2019s deposit flight was triggered by allegations from Canada\u2019s leading securities regulator that the company and three top executives failed to properly disclose the full extent of mortgage-application fraud that the lender uncovered in 2014. The company and executives struck settlements last week to pay C$29.5 million to the regulator and shareholders belonging to a class-action lawsuit.Home Capital\u2019s woes have attracted widespread investor interest because of the dramatic increase in prices in the Toronto-area housing market in the past several years, where most of Home Capital\u2019s mortgages are based. Recently, the pace of home sales in the region has slowed in the wake of Ontario government initiatives to temper real-estate speculation.A spokeswoman for Canadian Finance Minister       Bill Morneau       said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the government was \u201cencouraged by market developments\u201d related to Home Capital. She added Mr. Morneau and government officials continue to closely monitor developments at Home Capital.Earlier this month, Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       tried to quell concerns that Home Capital\u2019s woes reflected an underlying malaise in Canada\u2019s mortgage-finance system. He said the situation at Home Capital was due to \u201cfirm-specific factors,\u201d and there were no signs of broader stress in the financial system.Home Capital has replaced a number of directors on its board, which last month initiated a strategic review. According to people familiar with the review the company is in discussions with a variety of suitors who are seeking to buy some or most of the company\u2019s assets.One bidder that has entered talks for a potential purchase of mortgages is the private-equity arm of             Brookfield Asset Management Inc.,       according to a person familiar with the talks. Brookfield CEO       Bruce Flatt       said at the company\u2019s annual meeting last week that the company would consider a transaction with Home Capital if the terms are attractive.A spokesman for Home Capital declined to comment.Write to Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com and Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-capital-group-to-sell-about-halfof-its-commercial-mortgages-1497979904", "news_title": "Home Capital Group to sell About Half\u00a0of Its Commercial Mortgages    ", "keywords": "canada home mortgages,canada mortgage businesses,commercial mortgages business,KingSett Capital,Home Capital Group,HCG.T,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,credit types,services,mortgages,real estate credit,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "YOU DON\u2019T WEIGH too much, do you?\u201d Those were the words of a woman behind me as our group of five nervously stepped onto an Inca suspension bridge swaying high over a gorge in the Peruvian Andes, hoping it wouldn\u2019t snap. Earlier that day, I had arrived in this remote region, along with a few dozen other visitors, to watch an ancient tradition that continues to amaze Western engineers. Every year, Quechua-speaking Indians tear down a 100-foot-long suspension bridge and rebuild it from nothing but Andean grass, a custom that is virtually unchanged since their Inca ancestors followed it centuries ago.The bridge, called Q\u2019eswachaka, is the last of its kind, a throwback to a pre-colonial period when spans like this made transportation and trade possible in one of the world\u2019s most rugged terrains. The bridges furthered the expansion of the Inca Empire by allowing armies to cross canyons and fast-moving rivers. Early Spanish conquistadors were so spooked by the structures that they crawled over them on their hands and knees. The Incas, at their peak, are believed to have built about 200 overpasses, connecting a 20,000-mile-long road network. In 2013, Unesco added the Q\u2019eswachaka bridge to its list of intangible cultural heritage sites, while in 2015 a replica was exhibited on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.Despite the recognition, few people make their way to the isolated bridge, located some 12,000 feet above sea level in rural Quehue, where the altitude hinders the growth of many plants; two exceptions are potatoes and ichu, the gold-colored grass used to make the span. Quehue is only four hours from the former Inca capital of Cusco, but Machu Picchu lies in the opposite direction, leading many tourists to skip the bridge. Those who do visit witness more than this ancient Andean technology; they also get a taste for life in rural Peru. While the local farmers say they still use the grass bridge for transportation, bypassing a steel one erected nearby, the annual ritual is also performed to strengthen community bonds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on [the bridge] since the Incas,\u201d Victoriano Arizapana, the primary engineer of the grass structure and a descendant of bridge masters, told me. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget. We can\u2019t disregard the bridge.\u201dMy trip began on a Saturday morning in June, when four communities gather over three days to rebuild the Q\u2019eswachaka, hanging 60 feet over the Apurimac River; a day-long festival of dance and drink ensues. At 4 a.m., shivering in the cold mountain air, I left Cusco for Quehue with my driver and Quechua translator, Hern\u00e1n. Just after sunrise, we stopped for breakfast at a village market, where I gulped down a bowl of hot, rejuvenating potato soup. Before continuing, we bought coca leaves to chew in an effort to ward off dizziness from the altitude.Back on the winding road, we passed adobe homes with stone fences, thin cows and a white church under an emphatically blue sky. Hern\u00e1n said we\u2019d arrived when we reached a makeshift toll booth. Around the corner, dozens of women in colorful embroidered skirts and bowler hats sat on the edge of the road overlooking the river. They were softening strands of ichu by pounding the grass with stones, then weaving the strains to create ropes that were braided into six long, sturdy cables: four for the bridge\u2019s floor and two for the handrails. Before the trip, I phoned John Ochsendorf, an engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the leading experts on the bridge, who told me that he found the cables can support about two tons before failing. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of Inca ingenuity,\u201d he said.I followed the men down a steep stone path to a clearing on the edge of the old bridge. Work hadn\u2019t started yet. They were waiting for an Andean priest to give the green light. Before doing so, the priest prepared an offering with coca leaves and a llama fetus to the mountain gods and mother earth to prevent accidents. Women were barred from the area until the construction was completed. The men brought the cables down to the clearing themselves, fearing the women\u2019s presence could bring bad luck, possibly sending the workers tumbling into the river below. The grunt work began with a few dozen men stretching the cables across the canyon, amid shouts of \u201cpull, pull\u201d and \u201cstronger\u201d in a mix of Quechua and Spanish. With the six main cables in place, smaller ropes were tied from the handrails to the floor. When finished, the bridge looked like a long reed basket.The local men dashed across, with the rest of us looking on with unease, wondering how our legs would react on the structure. Carlos Neuhaus, the director of Peruvian bank BanBif, which sponsors the bridge making, was the first across, saying later that he thought it best not to look down. I followed a similar strategy. With both hands on the rails, I descended slowly and steadily to the midpoint with four other people behind me, hoping such a pace would minimize the swaying. I quickened my step up the other half, thrilled when I reached the other side. In 12-months time, the elements will have frayed the bridge and the people will gather again to build it anew.Getting There: The Q\u2019eswachaka bridge is a four-hour drive from Cusco. The fastest and easiest way to get there is to organize the trip with a tour agency or hire a reputable driver who knows the route for about $125 a day.Staying There: In recent years, local communities have started offering lodging in their homes for visitors, with the help of nonprofits and other sponsors. The cost is only about $16 a night, and provides the opportunity to dive further into the culture. Local nonprofit Patronato de Cultura de Machu Picchu can reserve lodging, along with meals and transportation (patronatomachupicchu.org). Other visitors who spend the night prefer to camp. Fertur Per\u00fa Travel, a travel operator with offices in Lima and Cusco, can organize a camping trip, including a private chef and guide (fertur-travel.com). If you\u2019d prefer to make a day trip of it, Cusco is home to several hotels, including luxury options at the JW Marriott El Convento (from $279 a night, jwmarriott.com) and the Belmond Hotel Monasterio (from $345 a night, belmond.com).Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Bridge Club.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-awesome-incan-ritual-that-still-spooks-travelers-1497979126", "news_title": "The Awesome Incan Ritual That Still Spooks Travelers", "keywords": "adventure travel peru,andes tourist attractions,cultural attractions in the peruvian andes,inca cultuer and traditions,inca ruins peru,off the beaten path peru,peru adventure,peru hidden gems,things to do in the andes,unusual tourist attractions in peru,where to go in peru,where to go in the peruvian andes,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel"}, {"content": "MARIETTA, Ga.\u2014A record $60 million has poured into Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District special election, and voters here can\u2019t wait for the political feeding frenzy to come to an end.\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d said Cobb County voter       Tim Grandy       outside of his polling place. \u201cIt\u2019s one 435th of one-half of one-third of our government, and this is how much money we spend on it with a lot of other problems in this world?\u201d he added, referring to the number of representatives in the House.

Ms. Handel and outside groups supporting her have spent $23.4 million. Other candidates\u2019 spending from the April vote pushed the total to $60 million.While the money symbolizes the high-profile nature of the House race\u2014which each party sees as a referendum on Mr. Trump\u2014it has many voters in the district dreaming of ways to change the system and its barrage of spending and arm-twisting.\u201cI think there should be a cap on it to make it a logical election,\u201d said Handel supporter       Carolyn Comer,        who recently moved to the district.\u201cI\u2019m like, hey, I early voted, is there any way I can block all of this now?\u201d said Ossoff supporter       Ben Andrews.       \u201cOne day in the future, ads are going to be so targeted that if you vote, you won\u2019t see it, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll make people vote\u2014vote and you won\u2019t get ads!\u201dWrite to Shelby Holliday at shelby.holliday@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-georgia-voters-are-excited-for-house-raceto-end-1497978333", "news_title": "Some Georgia Voters Are Excited for House Race\u2014to End", "keywords": "congressional race,georgia election,georgia house seat,handel,ossoff,trump,Jon Ossoff,Karen Handel,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Barbie is getting a chubbier boyfriend.A year after             Mattel Inc.        MAT 2.16%added new body types of its iconic Barbie doll, her longtime male companion Ken is getting his own makeover. Her beau will now come in slim and \u201cbroad\u201d body types, as well as his normally chiseled physique. The doll will also come in seven skin tones, nine hairstyles, including man buns and corn rows, and modern looks, from hip hoodie to preppy check.\u201cWe are redefining what a Barbie or Ken doll looks like to this generation,\u201d       Lisa McKnight,        who oversees Mattel\u2019s Barbie brand, said on Tuesday.Mattel will try to recreate some positive buzz that translated into a sales boost for its struggling Barbie doll after it introduced slim, tall and curvy versions a year ago. Retailers placed big orders for the revamped Fashionista line of Barbie, with double-digit sales increases in the quarters following the release.Barbie accounted for 16% of Mattel\u2019s roughly $6 billion in gross sales last year and has become increasingly important since the company lost the rights to produce             Walt Disney Co.\u2019s       Princess dolls.The doll\u2019s sales have remained strong at retail, even as Mattel\u2019s performance tumbled in the holiday quarter and beyond as retailers paused orders to work through an inventory glut. Mattel shortly thereafter replaced its chief executive with       Margo Georgiadis,        a former Google executive who became the second female CEO in the company\u2019s history.Ken Carson       has long been part of Barbie\u2019s life. He was released in 1961, two years after       Ruth Handler       introduced Barbie to the world at the New York Toy Fair. The male doll shares his name with Ms. Handler\u2019s son.Mattel will now have 15 new Ken dolls available. It is also adding another 25 diverse Barbie dolls to its line up.Mattel doesn\u2019t break out sales of Ken dolls, but says that on average girls have one Ken for every seven Barbies they own.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Mattel\u2019s Ken Evolves Into Modern Man.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattels-ken-doll-follows-barbie-with-a-full-makeover-1497972289", "news_title": "Mattel\u2019s Ken Doll Follows Barbie With a Full Makeover   ", "keywords": "barbie sales,doll sales,ken doll makeover,mattel dolls,Mattel,MAT,Walt Disney,DIS,Google,GOOGL,Margo Georgiadis,Ken Carson,Lisa McKnight,Ruth Handler,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,dolls,toys,games,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"}, {"content": "The curtain is falling on a generation of Asia\u2019s tycoons who forged vast fortunes in the fires of the region\u2019s political and economic upheaval of the past half-century.Hong Kong billionaire       Li Ka-shing,        for decades one of the world\u2019s richest people, has told associates that he plans to step down as chairman of his flagship conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., by next year, when he turns 90, according to people briefed by       Mr. Li.A Chinese-born, Hong Kong-made billionaire,       Mr. Li       built a plastic-flower manufacturer into a global empire spanning property, energy, ports, telecoms and retail.Passing the baton to his previously anointed successor, his eldest son,       Victor Li,        would represent the most significant corporate abdication yet among an elite of aging billionaires in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. These tycoons combined business savvy and carefully cultivated political connections\u2014often with authoritarian governments\u2014to prosper in Asia\u2019s postcolonial economies and, more recently, from China\u2019s economic opening.With an average age of 80, the current 10 wealthiest tycoons in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia are collectively the world\u2019s oldest, according to an analysis of data from Forbes\u2019 2017 billionaires list.They include sugar-to-palm-oil and hotel baron       Robert Kuok,        93, of Malaysia; Thailand\u2019s chicken-and-pork king,       Dhanin Chearavanont,        78; and Philippines shoe seller-turned mall developer       Henry Sy,        92. All are from Chinese emigrant families and became the richest men in their countries.Mr. Kuok hasn\u2019t announced succession plans, but his eldest son is now chairman of the family\u2019s main private company. Mr. Chearavanont handed the reins earlier this year to his sons, appointing his eldest as chairman. Mr. Sy has made his six children heirs to his company.As these men face succession, some investors question whether their privileged, mostly Western-educated heirs can steer their corporate juggernauts as effectively as their self-made fathers did. Many lack the political ties and hardscrabble upbringing of the patriarchs. They also have less access to easy opportunities.These 10 families remain a formidable force, with a combined wealth of almost $160 billion, according to an analysis of Forbes data. They wield huge power at home and increasingly seek foreign acquisitions. Between them, they have spent almost $200 billion on acquisitions over the past decade, according to Dealogic.Mr. Li,        known for his horn-rimmed glasses and iron grip on his companies, rode China\u2019s economic boom, and extended his reach into U.K. mobile networks, Australian utilities and Canadian air-conditioning firms. A spokesman for CK Hutchison said the chairman \u201chas from time to time talked about his retirement and his confidence in Victor to lead the company.\u201d       Mr. Li,        through a company spokesman, declined to be interviewed.Even so, the stepping back of       Mr. Li      \u2014who is worth $33 billion, according to the latest data from Forbes\u2014may create uncertainty among shareholders over CK Hutchison\u2019s direction. The company has recently failed with separate bids of more than $10 billion for mobile phone and energy assets in the U.K. and Australia, while homegrown Chinese billionaires are challenging its real-estate and ports businesses.While the elder       Mr. Li       is known as a charismatic, politically savvy deal maker, his Stanford-educated son Victor is viewed as a more dour, details-oriented businessman who has spent more than three decades shadowing his father. Victor Li, through a company spokesman, declined to comment.Companies the world over struggle with how best to preserve a founder\u2019s legacy. In much of Asia, the issue is acute because tycoons have outsize influence on their domestic economies, and tend to be intensely insular decision makers.When successions go poorly, the cost to stakeholders can be enormous. A study of around 200 family-run companies in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan by       Joseph Fan,        a finance professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, found that they lost 60% of their value on average during the years around the transfer of power.Meanwhile, Asia\u2019s economic landscape is shifting rapidly. Families that built their fortunes on property, power and commodities have seen their status eroded as Chinese entrepreneurs and tech titans have supplanted them as the world\u2019s wealthiest citizens.As recently as 1996, tycoons from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia made up eight of the 25 richest people on Forbes\u2019 global rich list. Mr. Li is the only one who remains: He has lately been vying for the title of Asia\u2019s richest man with internet titan       Jack Ma       of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.39%       and property magnate       Wang Jianlin       of Dalian Wanda Group.Of all the scions, Victor Li, 52, appears among the best prepared. He joined his father\u2019s company in 1985 after studying in the U.S.Still, many parts of Mr. Li\u2019s empire are run by lieutenants who hold considerable power. Victor Li, as well, doesn\u2019t have his father\u2019s history of relations with China\u2019s leaders and experience navigating the factional and complex politics and bureaucracy of China.\u201cLi Ka-shing\u2019s key asset is his outstanding relationships and those relationships aren\u2019t easily transferred,\u201d said Mr. Fan, who has studied Mr. Li\u2019s career. \u201cHis son may not inherit this from his father and be able to make friends with Chinese politicians.\u201dThe elder Mr. Li\u2019s ties to Beijing have waned under President       Xi Jinping.       Chinese ports are sucking up business from Mr. Li\u2019s Hong Kong terminals, while homegrown property developers are increasingly moving in on his home turf. Victor is likely to inherit the business empire at a challenging time.People familiar with the family say Mr. Li\u2019s younger son, 50-year-old Richard, has more of Mr. Li\u2019s deal-making skills and charismatic traits. However, Richard early on chose to branch out on his own, using family money to buy and run media and telecoms companies, with varying success.Victor Li still lives in the shadow of his celebrity father. A few years ago, when the elder Mr. Li and Victor attended the Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s birthday party at the British consulate in Hong Kong, diplomats lined up in droves to take selfies with the tycoon while Victor stood to the side unnoticed, according to a person at the event.Protocol dictates that Mr. Li speaks first during business meetings, attendees say. The elder Mr. Li will first hold court, sharing his \u201cbig-picture\u201d views on world affairs and the future of China and his concerns and deep affection for Hong Kong, attendees have said. Victor, on the other hand, tends to speak at length about ideas as if he were brainstorming out loud, people familiar with the family say.Mr. Li relies on his personal touch to charm associates. At CK Hutchison\u2019s high-rise headquarters, he takes an elevator down to the basement to greet important guests as their cars pull up. In meetings, he asks personal questions about visitors\u2019 families and hobbies.Friends of the Li family say Victor leads an insular life in Hong Kong. He has resided for years in the same mansion with his father, and his wife and children, and limits his socializing mostly to when he goes to Canada, where he has citizenship. Part of Victor\u2019s reticence stems from a traumatizing ordeal in 1996, when he was kidnapped by an armed Chinese gang and held overnight. He was gagged and badly treated, people familiar with the matter say.Mr. Li paid 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($134 million) to secure Victor\u2019s release. The gang leader was later convicted and executed in mainland China.\u2014Trefor Moss in Shanghai contributed to this article.Write to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com and Jake Maxwell Watts at jake.watts@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Asian Tycoons Look to Heirs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 13:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/retirement-plan-of-hong-kongs-li-ka-shing-marks-end-of-era-for-asias-tycoons-1497973786", "news_title": "Li Ka-shing\u2019s Exit Plan Marks End of Era for Asia\u2019s Tycoons", "keywords": "CK Hutchison Holdings,0001.HK,HK:0001,Alibaba Group,BABA,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd,Li Ka-shing,Henry Sy,Mr. Chearavanont,Robert Kuok,Dhanin Chearavanont,Victor Li,plans,strategy,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Probes into the Trump administration\u2019s alleged dealings with Russia are creating a vacuum in U.S. foreign policy and preventing relations from thawing between the two countries, the head of Russia\u2019s second-largest bank said Tuesday.Andrey Kostin,        president and chairman of the management board at             VTB Bank,       in an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, criticized sanctions by the U.S. against Russia, and said President Donald Trump can\u2019t improve the situation because of the storms in Washington.\u201cHe is just incapable of doing anything vis-\u00e0-vis Russia because of all these accusations of having some kind of, I don\u2019t know what, relationship with Russia, which is complete nonsense,\u201d Mr. Kostin said. \u201cIt seems that\u2019s just a lack of any power in Washington, and in international affairs, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d he said.Mr. Kostin was in London for a conference sponsored by his bank to encourage more investment in Russia and Russian companies. He said VTB has been able to find ways to keep doing business with U.S. and European banks and investors despite being among a set of Russian companies and individuals under U.S. and European Union sanctions. The political repercussions of sanctions are a greater concern, Mr. Kostin said.VTB is majority owned by the Russian government. Mr. Kostin, its Moscow-born chairman, is a close colleague of Russian President       Vladimir Putin.       He is himself a former Russian diplomat who was stationed in the U.K. in the 1980s.\u201cWe don\u2019t put sanctions as a key question, as a key problem, for us. Even for me personally, I\u2019m more concerned about political repercussions ... a possible arms race, possible Cold War,\u201d Mr. Kostin said. \u201cI think it will be too dangerous for the world.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The U.S. instituted sanctions against Russia during the crisis over the Crimean peninsula in 2014, mostly aimed at crippling Russia\u2019s energy sector. Then-President       Barack Obama       shortly before leaving office also levied additional sanctions in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Last week, the U.S. Senate voted to expand sanctions on Moscow and overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill that requires the Trump administration receive congressional approval to lift existing sanctions.Mr. Kostin laid the blame for the chilled political climate squarely on \u201cthe elite in America,\u201d saying it \u201cis trying, I personally think, to impeach Mr. Trump at the end of the day, and they don\u2019t allow him to work.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very wrong path,\u201d he said. Any worsening in the relationship between Russia and the U.S. \u201cwould be very dangerous.\u201cI think it\u2019s a great missed opportunity for the world. And I think completely the American side is responsible for this,\u201d he said.The U.S. and Russia diverge on a range of foreign-policy issues, including the war in Syria and the future of its president,       Bashar al-Assad.       Tensions rose this year after U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies concluded that Russia engaged in cyberhacking in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in an attempt to help Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Probes are also being conducted into whether associates of Mr. Trump colluded with the Russian government, and into Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of FBI director       James Comey.Russia has denied any meddling in U.S. elections. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.Mr. Kostin said VTB has gotten big support from American and European banks, which he called \u201cgood partners,\u201d to keep business and financing channels open between the regions.\u201cThey are not supporting sanctions very much, but of course they are obliged to follow it,\u201d he said. American banks \u201cwant to work with us,\u201d after checking with authorities on what they can and cannot do, Mr. Kostin said.He said the bank is also keeping in touch with American investors, and that they were among the participants in new multibillion-dollar bond deals for Russia this week. Russia is selling 10-year and 30-year Eurobonds.Mr. Kostin said he isn\u2019t planning to repeat a visit he made a year ago to Washington to discuss sanctions with U.S. officials, in part because it might attract unwanted scrutiny.\u201cAny meetings now are considered to be some clandestine operation,\u201d he said.Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com and Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 12:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-russian-banker-says-trump-powerless-to-mend-relations-1497977764", "news_title": "Top Russian Banker Says Trump Powerless to Mend Relations   ", "keywords": "trump administration russia,trump congress probes,trump probes,trump russia collusion,trump russia relationship,u.s. russia sanctions,VTB Bank,VTBR.MZ,Andrey Kostin,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Chinese conglomerate Cosco Group is in advanced discussions to acquire smaller shipping rival Orient Overseas Container Line Co. for at least $4 billion in a deal that could be reached as early as July, people familiar with the matter said.\u201cOOCL\u2019s owning family is warming up to the idea of a sale,\u201d one of those people said. \u201cIt is down to the price and we may get an announcement as early as next month.\u201dState-owned Cosco Group\u2019s Cosco Shipping unit is the world\u2019s fourth largest container operator with an 8.5% market share.

In the process both men and women have been degraded and dehumanized. We have believed the unbelievable lie that men and women are the same; the simple truth is that they are of equal value but are not the same. The sexual revolution has turned many men into a detestable combination of sexual predator and emasculated weakling. In our cultural drift from the elevated Genesis vision of human dignity, human sexuality and complementary roles for men and women, we have exchanged the truth for a lie.Over more than 35 years as a pediatrician, I have witnessed the bitter harvest we have reaped from seeds planted during the sexual revolution.Jerry A. Miller Jr., M.D.Augusta, Ga.I caution my family to wear sunblock during the summer, bring an umbrella when it\u2019s raining and lock the doors at night for protection. Each of these limits their vulnerability to harm. I also caution young men and women not to drink to excess because, as Mr. McGurn aptly indicates, it places them in a potentially defenseless position. There is nothing sexist about that.Kathleen ReillyBriarcliff Manor, N.Y.My children are amazed that nobody who attended the Bristol, Tenn., schools during my stint there (1950-1963) had a baby out of wedlock. Two couples \u201chad to\u201d get married. It was also rumored that a certain girl had an abortion, which at that time was not legal.The only boy in my dating career who wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer was stopped by the college campus curfew. He had the nerve to ask me out again.Carol CoxHigh Point, N.C.While I appreciate Mr. McGurn\u2019s desire to help prevent sexual assaults, I would strongly suggest that he advise fathers to talk to their sons to encourage them to play an active part in their universities, workplaces and community groups advocating for a culture that vigorously condemns assault and outs perpetrators.Ashley UlrichBostonAs a 29-year-old father to a 13-month-old, I find Mr. McGurn\u2019s advice to be refreshing. The sexual revolution may have had the intended consequences of empowering women in some respects, but it also did away with all cultural norms. In such an environment there is no standard, and deviant behavior slips in under the radar and becomes normalized too.Perhaps the next generation is discovering that on their own. Here in the Bay Area there was a local story about youngsters being taught about sexual consent. Since the teachers couldn\u2019t give the children any real guidance, as that would obviously be too patronizing, it left the children confused, causing one young boy to lament that maybe it\u2019d be better to wait to have sex.

The company has been exploring adding digital payments in India, which would be its first such offering globally, and could give it a chance to take advantage of a growing trend in the world\u2019s last great untapped internet economy. A WhatsApp spokesman declined to comment on a potential time frame for when such a feature, if incorporated, could launch.Hike\u2014which last year raised $175 million in a fundraising round led by Chinese internet company             Tencent Holdings Ltd.      \u2014is the latest startup to tap into surging demand for cashless payments in India.This year millions of Indian consumers, who historically have made most of their purchases in cash, have been leapfrogging credit cards and transacting on their smartphones for the first time. New Delhi in November moved to crack down on tax evasion and corruption by nullifying its largest-denominated notes, triggering a crash crunch and the rapid adoption of digital wallets.The sector has caught the attention of global investors.

Hike is likely to face a big battle for new users given WhatsApp\u2019s larger base and popular intuitive interface, said Neha Dharia, an analyst who studies messaging trends at telecommunications research firm Ovum.\u201cThe biggest challenge that Hike faces is that their service is so much more complicated than WhatsApp,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be an educated digital user to use Hike.\u201dThe company may also be feeling pressure to monetize its offerings, Ms. Dharia said. It is unclear, however, how Hike\u2019s users might adopt its new payment features given competition from Paytm and other mobile-payment providers.Hike says its service is meant to appeal to India\u2019s younger users with its stickers and a function to improve selfies, saying 90% of those on its platform are between the ages of 15 and 24.Write to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 12:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-hike-brings-mobile-payments-to-its-messaging-app-1497958368", "news_title": "India\u2019s Hike Brings Mobile Payments to Its Messaging App ", "keywords": "hike, india, messaging app, mobile payments,vc industry news, whatsapp,SoftBank Group,9984.TO,JP:9984,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Facebook,FB,Hike,Paytm,Kavin Bharti Mittal,Neha Dharia,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,communications software,computing,instant messaging programs,internet,online,media,entertainment,mobile applications software,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Dr. Hal Scherz hits the nail on certificate of need laws (CON), a continuing bad problem, but it goes way beyond this (\u201cA Regulation That Protects Big-Hospital Monopolies,\u201d op-ed, June 14). An ER doctor friend of mine had his practice bought out by a large company. As a result, fees have tripled, and if the patients have no insurance, they must pay list price. An ambulance ride from a large company costs $1,400-$2,000. A house call will earn a doctor $150, but if a visiting nurse is sent by a company, the fee is $400. If a physician\u2019s practice is bought by a hospital, fees are doubled, as are procedures, and the insurers pay.In order not to get sued, doctors practice defensively, adding to costs by as much as $600-$850 billion a year. Everyone is paying for these add-ons and not for care. The malpractice and overhead costs are fixable but not by going to a government-pay model. These costs should be reversed, and private practice should be allowed to flourish.Sidney J. Goldfarb, M.D.Princeton, N.J.I have seen the destructive power of the CON. The powerful hospital corporations have used the CON to keep out any competition. With their monopoly over their community, they can dictate whatever prices they want to charge for medical care. Time after time I have seen the immensely wealthy hospital corporate lawyers fight any application to build a new emergency room or a new hospital in our area. The cost to fight the legal battles is astounding. That money paid to lawyers could be much better used for funding patient care. Market competition will lower health-care costs overnight.William V. Choisser, M.D., J.D.Orange Park, Fla.Dr. Scherz\u2019s analysis is 100% correct. Free markets, innovation and increased competition almost always lower cost. Conversely, monopolistic and oligopolistic practices stifle innovation, disincentivize productivity and increase cost to the consumer. We see this played out in rural America where even though both real estate as well as labor costs are significantly lower than major metropolitan inner cities, hospital charges and insurance costs are much higher.Howard C.

These bureaucrats then, as Mr. Tierney says, interpret and enforce the law, by way of a vast web of rules that legislatures give them the authority to enact.Anyone who thinks term limits are a good idea should consider who would then be in charge.

The men face jail time if convicted, and Barclays could be fined.Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has spent five years probing how Barclays wooed Qatari investors to prop up the bank during the 2008 financial market meltdown. In total, Barclays raised \u00a311.8 billion ($15 billion) from investors through two emergency cash calls, in June and October 2008.To seal the latter of those transactions, Barclays said in filings it paid \u00a3322 million in \u201cadvisory services\u201d to Qatari investors\u2014an agreement that wasn\u2019t initially disclosed to shareholders, Barclays has acknowledged in filings. In November 2008, the bank provided a $3 billion loan facility to the State of Qatar, according to the Serious Fraud Office. The charges filed on Tuesday relate to the payment and the loan, the fraud office said.The Serious Fraud Office charged the bank, the former chief executive John Varley, former senior investment-bank executive       Roger Jenkins       and two other former executives with conspiracy to commit fraud. Messrs. Varley and Jenkins, along with the bank, were charged with providing unlawful financial assistance in connection with the $3 billion loan. English law forbids a company from giving someone money to buy its shares.Barclays said in a statement it is \u201cconsidering its position in relation to these developments.\u201d It has previously denied that the $3 billion loan was for the purpose of buying shares and previously said the advisory-services payments were for legitimate business purposes.Unlike its peers             Royal Bank of Scotland Group                   PLC and             Lloyds Banking Group                   PLC, Barclays was able to avoid a bailout by British taxpayers as a result of the Qatari equity injections.VIEW GraphicThe case involves a cadre of top executives at Barclays who steered the bank at the time, including Mr. Varley, the CEO, and Mr. Jenkins, who had a central role in orchestrating the raising of capital. The two others charged with fraud are       Thomas Kalaris,        who used to run the bank\u2019s wealth division, and       Richard Boath,        who headed the bank\u2019s European financial institutions group.A law firm representing Mr. Varley said it couldn\u2019t immediately comment. Mr. Jenkins intends to vigorously defend against the charges, his lawyer, Brad Kaufman at Greenberg Traurig said, adding Mr. Jenkins had received internal and external legal advice on all the matters covered in the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s case. A spokesman for Mr. Boath said he would vigorously contest the charges. Separately, Mr. Boath has filed a lawsuit against Barclays contending that he was wrongfully fired because he blew the whistle on the Qatar deal.Mr. Kalaris\u2019s lawyer said he couldn\u2019t comment.Under U.K. law, when the men appear at the magistrate\u2019s court, they will have the option to enter a plea. Any bail conditions will be set and prosecutors will give a brief synopsis of their case. Magistrates then decide which court will hear it. They are set to appear before a court in London on July 3.The Barclays case is a major test for the Serious Fraud Office, which has in recent years failed to successfully prosecute a number of high profile bribery and corruption cases. U.K. Prime Minister       Theresa May       recently pledged to fold it into another crime-fighting agency.Barclays is facing other legal problems linked to the Qatar capital raisings. In a separate probe, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority imposed a \u00a350 million ($63 million) fine over the disclosure failures. The authority said earlier this year it was reviewing the case after being handed new evidence. Barclays is contesting the fine.The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the payments made to Middle Eastern officials, according to Barclays filings. Barclays disclosed the U.S. investigations without comment. \u200bSeparately, PCP Capital Partners, a private-equity group, is suing Barclays for $1 billion alleging the bank made \u201csham payments\u201d to the Qataris and disadvantaged PCP\u2019s client, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, which also participated in the 2008 fundraising. Barclays is defending itself against the claim, according to a filing.\u200bThe Serious Fraud Office case is another distraction for Barclays\u2019s current chief executive,       Jes Staley.       Mr. Staley is himself currently under investigation by U.K. regulators for trying to identify a whistleblower at the bank, according to Barclays.

The costs of the build-outs were higher than anticipated, and WithMe said it would be better for Macerich to run the program by itself.\u2018We realize that we\u2019ve made too big of an investment into one company. \u2019\u201cThey really billed themselves as being the bridge between clicks and bricks, which, had it turned out to be that, it would have been a wonderful business,\u201d said       Art Coppola,        chief executive officer of Macerich, during an April earnings call. \u201cWe realize that we\u2019ve made too big of an investment into one company. But the other takeaway was that we are going to be best served to have us the facilitator for clicks coming to bricks and not think about third parties being the ones to get in the middle of that,\u201d Mr. Coppola said.Macerich\u2019s decision to pull out \u201cdefinitely hurt,\u201d said       Jonathan Jenkins,        the founder of WithMe. The split enabled the startup to focus on other opportunities, such as prioritizing building experiences for the brands first, then finding the best location for that, he said.Macerich, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based real-estate investment trust, has invested an additional $8 million in other ventures and retailers that have been more successful, such as b8ta, which sells tech gadgets, and clothes retailer Ministry of Supply.As changing consumer habits and e-commerce squeeze mall tenants, landlords face growing pressure to remain relevant, and are investing more resources to understand the industry\u2019s disrupters. Larger landlords with stronger balance sheets, such as         Simon Property Group               and         Westfield Corp.      , have been setting aside millions of dollars for incubators to take on risks similar to venture capitalists.Doing nothing could prove just as risky at a time when retail property companies face growing threats to their viability from         Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       growth and from competing neighboring shopping centers that are innovating.But getting the technology right has proven to be a challenge.Consider beacons, which are wireless devices that can be placed anywhere and emit a signal that is picked up by smartphones. Beacons placed in stores can activate apps on smartphones that offer shoppers personalized coupons or promotions.Mall landlord         CBL & Associates Properties               ran a pilot program with beacons at three of its malls in the fourth quarter of 2015 and learned that, while the technology is viable, the pilot showed there are challenges in asking consumers to download the app. The Chattanooga, Tenn.-based REIT said it is now focusing on creating an excellent mobile web experience rather than developing apps that provide the same information and utility.\u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re not jumping onto a bandwagon on technology that\u2019s going to be obsolete in 18 months,\u201d said       Jim Ward,        vice president of marketing, brand development and digital strategies at CBL.Other landlords say they get numerous pitches by a range of startups peddling similar services and software that purport to make their jobs easier, and sometimes only belatedly figure out how to separate the wheat from the chaff.\u201cThe real-estate technology industry is heating up, bringing along with it quite a bit of noise,\u201d said       Hongwei Liu,        CEO of MappedIn, a six-year-old Canada-based firm that provides indoor mapping and search software for property owners.The firm has developed digital maps for more than 300 U.S. malls, including for the top mall REITs.

We have been America\u2019s most reliable friend, the only country to have fought at its side in every major conflict of the 20th and 21st centuries. Now new polling suggests       Donald Trump       may be tarnishing that relationship.The first contact between President Trump and Australia\u2019s Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull       didn\u2019t go well. In January the president reportedly cut short a \u201chostile and charged\u201d phone call, which he later described as \u201cthe worst call so far.\u201dThe damage was repaired somewhat when the two leaders met in New York in early May. Then last week video emerged from an off-the-record charity dinner showing Mr. Turnbull poking fun at Mr. Trump. As Mr. Trump isn\u2019t known for his self-deprecating sense of humor, the next phone call between the two leaders will no doubt be awkward.Many Australians will have seen the humor in Mr. Turnbull\u2019s performance. Lowy Institute polling conducted in the lead up to the 2016 election found that 77% of Australians would have preferred it if       Hillary Clinton       had won. Only 11% preferred Donald Trump.Now that Mr. Trump has become president, the 2017 Lowy Institute Poll finds that 60% of Australians say Mr. Trump causes them to have an unfavorable opinion of the U.S. He\u2019s particularly unpopular among young adults\u2014with 70% saying he is a negative factor in their opinion of the U.S.\u2014and women, 68% of whom disapprove of the U.S. leader.There has also been a steep drop in Australians\u2019 trust of the U.S.: the number who trust America \u201ca great deal\u201d to act responsibly in the world has halved, to 20% from 40%, since the Lowy Institute last polled this question in 2011. The 61% of Australians who trust the U.S. overall contrasts with the 90% who trust the U.K., 86% who trust Germany and 86% who trust Japan.The number of Australians who see the U.S. as Australia\u2019s \u201cbest friend in the world\u201d has also halved, to 17%, from 35% in 2014. Whereas three years ago America shared the top slot on the \u201cbest friend\u201d list alongside New Zealand, it has now dropped to second place, far behind New Zealand and tied with the U.K.There were strong indications before the 2016 U.S. election that Australians might shun the U.S. alliance under a Trump presidency. Nearly half the Australian population, 45%, said in 2016 Lowy Institute polling that \u201cAustralia should distance itself from the United States if it elects a president like Donald Trump.\u201dThe good news out of the 2017 poll is that Australians are able to separate the Australia-U.S. alliance from the person of Mr. Trump. For the moment, support for the alliance is holding up, and in fact has rebounded after a significant nine-point drop recorded in March 2016 polling during the U.S. presidential primary season.More than three-quarters of Australians, 77%, still say the alliance is either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d important for Australia\u2019s security. Their overall warmth toward the U.S., as measured on the poll\u2019s \u201cthermometer of feelings\u201d toward nations, has stabilized after its record five-point drop last year. Only 29% of Australians now think \u201cAustralia should distance itself from the United States under President Donald Trump.\u201dThese results probably reflect the pragmatism for which Australians are famous. But it\u2019s an open question how long the relationship can prosper under the weight of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior.Mr. Trump has professed his skepticism about alliances, hostility to free trade and partiality to strongmen. Since taking office he has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, undermining perceptions of American reliability and undercutting America\u2019s position in Asia.Mr. Trump has also refused to endorse the principle of collective defense, which is enshrined in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and forms the basis of all U.S. alliances. He has been careless with intelligence provided by allies. His most recent move\u2014withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement\u2014will likely further spook Australians, whose concern about climate change has risen in the last few years and who supported a strong commitment to the Paris accord in 2015.No one likes being taken for granted, not even the oldest and easiest of friends. The 2017 Lowy Institute Poll reveals that fewer Australians than ever see the U.S. as our \u201cbest friend.\u201d That should be a warning for all of us who support this alliance.Mr. Fullilove is the executive director of the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAYMs. Handel\u2019s face-off with Democrat       Jon Ossoff       has been widely seen as a referendum on the Trump presidency, and a record amount of money has poured into the race from around the country. But for most of the campaign, Ms. Handel has rejected that view and tried to cast the election purely as a local decision about who would best represent Georgia\u2019s 6th District.The district has been held by the Republican Party since       Newt Gingrich       won it in 1978, but Democrats have seen an opportunity and made it a test of their political strength because Mr. Trump barely won the district in 2016. The seat came open this year when Mr. Trump appointed Rep.       Tom Price       as secretary of health and human services.The president, who attended a fundraiser for Ms. Handel in April, put more of his own political capital on the line in series of tweets Monday and Tuesday supporting her and attacking Mr. Ossoff.Mr. Ossoff grew up in the district but now lives a few miles outside of it so that, he says, his fianc\u00e9e can be closer to her medical-school classes at Emory University.

New York\u2019s governor has declared this the \u201csummer of hell\u201d for commuters. San Francisco\u2019s rapid-transit system has been plagued by overcrowding and equipment breakdowns and Chicago\u2019s commuter-rail system was stalled earlier this year by computer problems.And the Federal Transit Administration says $90 billion in mass-transit repairs are overdue nationwide.The big question for workers with no alternatives: How to make peace with your commute?Some New Yorkers recently were stuck on a crowded subway car that stalled between stations without light or air conditioning. Dread of being trapped like that haunts accounting manager       Matt Hopkins.       He battles claustrophobia while commuting to his job in Manhattan by reading books on his e-reader\u2014if he can find a seat. If not, he dons earbuds, closes his eyes and immerses himself in podcasts or a meditation app on his phone.He tries not to take it personally when other commuters slam into him while rushing through the subway doors as they close. And the moment he emerges onto the street, Mr. Hopkins says he practices \u201cwiping the entire experience from my mind.\u201dBrad Westley of Silver Spring, Md., builds a buffer into his daily schedule to allow for commuter-train delays en route to his Washington consulting job. Breakdowns on the city\u2019s mass-transit system have risen steadily in the past five years, federal data show. Mr. Westley can\u2019t predict whether his commute will take the usual 25 minutes or twice that long, so he avoids scheduling any meetings until more than 90 minutes after he expects to arrive.When a brake fire broke out on his train, he had to wait for the next one on a platform so crowded that he could barely move. \u201cPeople are literally pushing you onto the train so they can squeeze in behind you,\u201d he says.Having to exercise so much restraint and self-control before you arrive at work can hurt productivity later in the day, says       Kathleen Vohs,        a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota and author of 180 studies on self-control and related topics.Employees whose self-control has been depleted by mental strain are less likely to take initiative on the job, she says. Rather than trying new ideas or wrestling with tough choices, they tend to punt and think, \u201cI can\u2019t deal with that right now.\u201d\u201cIf choosing the status quo is an option, people who are mentally fatigued are likely to choose that,\u201d Dr. Vohs says.Commuters can stay productive by modifying their expectations: Prepare to be delayed, says       Cali Yost,        a Madison, N.J., consultant who advises employers on flexible workplace strategies.Fully charge your phone, tablet or laptop, carry backup batteries if needed, and download work, podcasts, books or projects you can focus on during the trip, says Ms. Yost, author of \u201cTweak It,\u201d a book on making small changes to feel happier.Not everyone has the patience to dive into work in crowded conditions. But some commuters use travel time to focus on an absorbing project, such as writing a presentation, which helps distract them from the frustrations, says New York stress coach       Jordan Friedman.Another approach is to think of your commute as a buffer period when you can prepare mentally for the workday, then retreat into your thoughts, says       Jon M. Jachimowicz,        a doctoral candidate at Columbia Business School. Commuters who were assigned to ask themselves, \u201cWhat steps can I take to accomplish my career and work goals?\u201d and to plan those steps en route to work, handled commuting hassles better, according to a four-week study under review of 443 U.S. commuters led by Mr. Jachimowicz.Mindfulness training, which includes stopping your mind from wandering and directing your attention to what\u2019s happening in the moment, can build resilience and help people get through periods of heavy stress with their cognitive resources intact, according to a 2016 study.And trying to act compassionately toward others in day-to-day settings can help you feel closer and more relaxed around them, a 2017 study shows.Susan Arons       actively resists lapsing into a dark mood during her daily bus ride from New Jersey to Manhattan, which has been stretching to two hours from the usual 40 minutes. \u201cI do conscious things to get out of that head space,\u201d she says. A managing director at a New York public-relations firm, she swipes her transit fare card for fellow commuters whose cards have expired.And when she walks the final leg of her commute, she smiles and greets shopkeepers out sweeping or hosing down the sidewalk. \u201cPeople sometimes think I\u2019m crazy, or a tourist,\u201d she says, but she takes comfort in fostering a sense of community. Amid all the stress, \u201cyou\u2019re still part of a neighborhood.\u201dHow to shake off a disastrous commute when you finally arrive? Consider taking a walk around the block before hitting the office to calm your nerves, Ms. Yost says.A comforting ritual can help.       Rick Gould\u2019s       usual one-hour commute from Long Island to his office near Penn Station is taking up to 2\u00bd hours. Then he\u2019s frozen for several more minutes on the steps of his train car by human gridlock on the platform at \u201cPain Station,\u201d as he calls the terminal. \u201cIt\u2019s so jammed and you\u2019re sweating already,\u201d says Mr. Gould, managing partner of a Manhattan M&A firm.He regains energy by downing a large coffee with an espresso shot and humming \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d Mr. Gould says, with irony. \u201cIt reminds me of the freedoms I have,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m not sitting on the Long Island Rail Road.\u201dTo Stay ProductiveTo Lower Tensions in CrowdsTo Shake Off a Bad CommuteQ: I usually delve quickly into asking personal questions of someone I\u2019ve just met, such as, \u201cHave you worked there long?\u201d or, \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d Is there a boundary one should keep in mind?\u2014L.L.A: If you press too aggressively for such specific personal details, you risk making your conversation partner feel as if he or she is being interrogated. The kind of probing, thought-provoking questions that spark a deeper connection don\u2019t press so hard for details, and reflect genuine curiosity about the other person\u2019s deeper interests, passions, needs or goals.People\u2019s personal boundaries differ: One may welcome a question that another regards as intrusive. Watch body language. You may have gone too far if the other person stops making eye contact, steps or leans away from you, crosses her arms or turns or points her feet away as if to leave. Another signal to back off: The other person has been mirroring your posture, gestures, tone of voice and facial expressions and suddenly stops doing so.Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Rise Above Your Awful Commute MANAGING A STRESSFUL TRIP TO WORK.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 12:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rise-above-your-awful-commute-1497975204", "news_title": "Rise Above Your Awful Commute", "keywords": "commute,crowds,delays,mass transit,mindfulness,productive,public transportation,schedule,stress,subways,work-life balance,political,general news,general labor issues,living,lifestyle,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Investors had hoped the U.S. presidential election would usher in a new bout of market volatility. Instead, calm not only has persisted, but has spread.Based on one commonly used measure, Asian equities are near their least volatile this century. In Europe, large price swings in eurozone stocks have largely subsided. And in the U.S., Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d known as the VIX, has been trading near historic lows for much of the year.\u201cA very supportive       Trump       trade is gone,\u201d said       Dwyfor Evans,        head of macro-strategy for Asia Pacific at             State Street Global Markets                   in Hong Kong. \u201cNobody talks about it anymore. Instead, people are getting concerned that this has been a very extended period without any adverse reactions in markets. They don\u2019t want to get caught when things turn.\u201dThe phenomenon\u2014which analysts attribute to a confluence of ongoing central bank support for markets, improving corporate earnings and, some say, misguided investor complacency\u2014marks a turnabout from what investors expected last year after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election.Then, investors hoped Mr. Trump\u2019s growth plan, combined with his unconventional approach, would generate outsize swings and restore the potential of individual stock picking, as investors could wager on which companies and sectors would benefit or suffer most.While the U.S. stock market has risen since then, volatility hasn\u2019t. That is because without the significant policy changes that were expected by investors from Mr. Trump, easy central bank policies have continued to be a dominating influence on markets, buoying asset classes.The calm, analysts say, is one reason investors are intrigued with markets like that for bitcoin. That virtual currency has moved this year by as much as 14% in a day. It topped $3,000 last week and then promptly fell 27% before rebounding a bit.Bitcoin is creating much more opportunity for investors to secure returns\u2014or lose money\u2014in a short period, which strategists say is another byproduct of central-bank intervention in financial markets and its impact on investor risk tolerance.\u201cInvestors are reaching for opportunities in speculative assets and you\u2019re seeing it in things like art and wine and even bitcoin,\u201d said       Sean Darby,        chief global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \u201cCall it an unintended consequence of central bankers creating an awful lot of excess liquidity in the system.\u201dMeanwhile, many expect the tranquility in equity markets to continue. The phenomenon is due in large part, investors say, to the unprecedented support for markets from global central banks that came after the financial crisis. Nearly 10 years later, those efforts are nothing new. But around the world they have continued even as the Federal Reserve in the U.S. has been raising interest rates and is in the process of starting to unwind its balance sheet\u2014the growth of which has helped stabilize markets.The balance sheets of the Fed, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and People\u2019s Bank of China increased by $1.7 trillion last year, one of the fastest rates since the financial crisis. The pace has continued, as they have already gained another $1.4 trillion nearly halfway through the year, according to Peter Cecchini, the New York-based head of equity derivatives and cross-asset strategy at Cantor Fitzgerald.In addition, corporate earnings have improved, not only in the U.S. but also in Europe, which lately is finally showing signs of improved economic fundamentals. Volatility there has largely subsided after elections in France and the U.K. reduced the risk of a breakup in the euro currency union, prompting investors to pour money into the region\u2019s assets.\u201cAll of these potential shocks and fears haven\u2019t come to fruition,\u201d said       Steven Wieting,        managing director and global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re in calm seas.\u201dAnd with interest rates low, corporate profit growth strong and economic growth stable, \u201cwhat sort of stock market do you expect when that happens,\u201d Mr. Wieting said Tuesday at a conference in Hong Kong, while adding that improving fundamentals have \u201ccalmed our concerns of a looming correction.\u201dIn China, signs of healthier consumer demand and strengthening industrial profits in particular have helped bolster equities, according to       Michael Parker,        head of strategy, Asia-Pacific at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. He says investors haven\u2019t had to contend with as many \u201cbinary events,\u201d such as China\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan in August 2015.\u201cAs long as global central banks can continue to stimulate in this environment and in the absence of some systemic disaster, low volatility can persist,\u201d said Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Mr. Cecchini.In Asia, Mr. Parker cited the MSCI Asia ex-Japan stock index, a broad measure of regional performance\u2014weighted most heavily to China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India\u2014which has risen 19% this year.The index\u2019s 90-day realized volatility, a measure of historical moves over that period, has fallen to 8.2%, near its lowest since at least 2000 and down by nearly half from a year ago, according to Mr. Parker. Only in summer 2014 has this metric been lower.Another sign of calm is the lack of major daily declines: Since January 2016, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan stock index has fallen more than 3% in one day just once. By comparison, in the prior two bull markets\u2014September 2001-October 2007 and March 2009-May 2011\u2014there were 3% daily declines on average every two to three months.Meanwhile, low volatility carries its own risks. \u201cWe know the party is going to end. The question I keep getting now from clients is \u2018how do I protect what I\u2019ve accumulated,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Evans of State Street Global Markets.Others are taking a more optimistic approach. The collapse in volatility signals confidence in global economic growth and the durability of what is already a lengthy U.S. expansion, according to       Jim Strugger,        managing director and derivatives strategist at MKM Partners.\u201cThe fixation on U.S. equity volatility hovering near its historical floor has obscured the fact that global cross-asset volatility collapsed in April and continues to trend lower,\u201d Mr. Strugger wrote to clients. \u201cThis is not a U.S. equity-only phenomenon.\u201dWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 12:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-trump-generated-volatility-the-world-is-awash-in-calm-1497974566", "news_title": "Forget Trump-Generated Volatility.

Shocks that held back the economy in 2016\u2014a poor harvest, weak exports and a tourist season disrupted by terror attacks\u2014should no longer do so in 2017, the statistics agency said.Unemployment will continue declining and reach 9.4% by the end of the year, compared with 10% at the end of 2016, the forecasts show.The French growth rate will therefore be closer to that of the eurozone as a whole, after lagging behind its neighbors for the past three years, the statistics agency said.Recent signs of a firming economy are a boon for Mr. Macron, less than two months after he came to power promising an overhaul of the economic policies of his predecessor and mentor       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Mr. Macron says Mr. Hollande\u2019s pro-business overhauls didn\u2019t go far enough and France needs to further loosen the restrictions of its complex labor code to encourage hiring and catch up with more buoyant European economies.To meet his goals, the French president will seek parliamentary approval next month to change labor laws by decree, a move that raises the possibility of a showdown with labor unions.Stronger growth could help the 39-year-old leader smooth the introduction of potentially disruptive changes to labor laws that could give companies greater latitude to work around national rules, such as the 35-hour workweek. Stronger French growth could also help Mr. Macron deliver on promises to contain France\u2019s budget deficit while cutting taxes for businesses and households.Economists have raised their growth estimates for the French economy in recent weeks. The Bank of France earlier this month raised its growth forecasts slightly to 1.4% this year and 1.6% in 2018.In its report Tuesday, Insee said business confidence has risen since the end of 2016, especially in industry, where managers are bullish about activity as their order books fill up and foreign demand improves.\u00a0Corporate investment will increase sharply again in 2017, although Insee expects a jolt in the second quarter when a tax-incentive program comes to an end.In agriculture, cereal and wine harvests should recover in 2017 after poor weather conditions sank output last summer, Insee said. And the construction sector should accelerate sharply after stagnating last year following two years of decline.French consumer-spending growth will recover after a standstill in the first quarter, although it is unlikely to expand as much as in 2016 due to higher inflation, Insee said.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 12:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-growth-picking-up-as-macron-pursues-change-1497974400", "news_title": "French Growth Picking Up as Macron Pursues Change ", "keywords": " eurozone, eurozone economies,france, french economy, french gdp, french growth, french labor laws, macron,statistics agency Insee,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "The PGA Tour will begin blood testing next season as part of a tighter and more transparent anti-doping program announced Tuesday.The revised program will expand the Tour\u2019s list of banned substances to match that of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

The new policy will take effect in October, when the 2017-18 season begins.Blood testing, which is already used by other pro sports organizations such as the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, will allow the Tour to detect the use of human growth hormone, which cannot be revealed through urine testing.\u201cWe believe that these changes to our program are prudent in that they further our objectives of protecting the well-being of our members and better substantiate the integrity of golf as a clean sport,\u201d PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement.The Tour first introduced its anti-doping program in 2008.

Total reached a preliminary agreement late last year with China National Petroleum Corp. and an Iranian company to invest $4.8 billion to develop parts of a giant gas field in the Persian Gulf, but the deal is still being completed.In May, Iran\u2019s oil minister       Bijan Zanganeh       told The Wall Street Journal he was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d about reaching an agreement with Total \u201cvery soon.\u201d CNPC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, and its investment commitment wasn\u2019t disclosed Tuesday.A Total spokeswoman said the $1 billion represented Total\u2019s 50.1% share of the joint venture\u2019s costs in the $2 billion first phase of development. Total is the project\u2019s operator, with CNPC taking a 30% stake and Iranian firm Petropars a 19.9% stake.The imminent investment decision was first reported by Reuters. A spokeswoman for Mr. Zanganeh didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The completion of the deal would mark a step forward for Iran\u2019s oil industry, which the country\u2019s oil ministry says needs tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment. Until now, companies including Total have signed preliminary agreements in Iran and penned memorandums expressing interest but haven\u2019t committed because of uncertainty over U.S. sanctions still looming, weak oil prices and uncertain financial terms.\u201cYou can see it as a sign that things are slowly beginning to progress in Iran\u2019s upstream, but you can also see it as a sign of just how cautious western companies are being,\u201d said       Richard Mallinson,        an analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, of Total\u2019s investment figure.U.S. companies like             Exxon Mobil Corp.       are essentially prohibited from working in Iran by remaining U.S. sanctions over terrorism, human rights and weapons proliferation concerns. European companies are allowed to work with Iran, but energy firms have moved cautiously.Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC agreed to explore future projects with Iran\u2019s state oil company last December but hasn\u2019t moved forward yet. \u201cShell is exploring potential business opportunities in Iran in line with our long-term strategy,\u201d a company spokesman said.Italian oil company             Eni                   SpA said Tuesday it has signed an agreement to study two Iranian oil and gas fields as part of a wider deal to recoup $280 million still owed to the company for previous investments. Eni said the agreement didn\u2019t include a commitment to invest.Iran\u2019s oil sector has endured a turbulent history marked by waves of nationalization and successive sanctions. The country holds the world\u2019s fourth-largest crude oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves, but production growth has been stymied by the political turmoil and uncertainty.Remaining U.S. sanctions forbid American banks from dealing directly with Iran and prevent all business with the Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps., a hard-line security service that is deeply involved in the country\u2019s oil and gas sector. Companies are leery of the financial terms they may have to accept to invest in the country. Depressed oil prices remain a general obstacle to big ticket investments.Pushing forward with its Iranian investment would give Total a foothold in one of the world\u2019s largest gas basins, known as South Pars. The field, which Iran shares with Qatar, contains almost 40% of Iran\u2019s total proved natural gas reserves, according to the Energy Information Administration.Total was long one of the most active Western oil companies in Iran and kept an office open in the country throughout the sanctions period. It was the first European oil company to buy Iranian oil and ship it to the continent after restrictions were lifted in early 2016. It has previously touted the benefits of being a first mover in returning to the country.\u2014Benoit Faucon  contributed to this article.Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 11:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/total-pledges-1-billion-investment-in-iran-gas-field-1497968780", "news_title": "Total Pledges $1 Billion Investment in Iran Gas Field", "keywords": " investment, iran energy, iran gas,iran oil, iran sanctions, total sa,China National Petroleum,Total,TOT,FP.FR,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,capital movements,invisible trade,economic news,foreign direct investment,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014A Russian law that bans gay \u201cpropaganda\u201d is discriminatory and encourages antigay views, the European Court of Human Rights said Tuesday, in a ruling that provoked an angry rebuke from Moscow.The court, based in Strasbourg, France, ruled in favor of three Russian activists who brought the case over a 2013 law and other legislation that banned the promotion of homosexuality. At the time, lawmakers said the law would protect minors from \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations,\u201d but in practice makes it a crime to hold gay pride events or to say that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual ones.The court said the legislation violated articles of the European Convention on Human Rights that guarantee freedom of expression and prohibit discrimination.\u201cThe Court found that the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values\u2014of equality, pluralism and tolerance\u2014of a democratic society,\u201d the court said in a statement.The Russian Ministry of Justice said it would appeal the ruling within three months, adding that the court\u2019s judgment \u201chas not entered into legal force.\u201dThe ministry denied the laws were discriminatory.\u201cThe Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees the equality of human and civil rights and freedoms regardless of various circumstances and prohibits any form of restriction of the rights of citizens on grounds of social, racial, national, linguistic or religious affiliation,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cIn this regard, the legislative provisions being challenged cannot be regarded as disproportionately restricting freedom of speech.\u201dPresident       Vladimir Putin       has cast himself as a defender of traditional Russian values and has forged a strong alliance with the conservative Russian Orthodox Church. But Russia has come under criticism from European governments over reports that dozens of gay men have been targeted for arbitrary detention in the southern republic of Chechnya. A Russian investigative newspaper claimed that the men have been tortured in secret prisons and at least three had been killed.Russian officials say the government is investigating the incidents, but the roundup has caused major friction with European leaders. Both French President       Emmanuel Macron       and German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       have raised the issue with Mr. Putin.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies he had not seen the text of the court\u2019s ruling but added that it would be considered.Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and the court\u2019s judgments are binding on member states. But Russia has resisted implementation of some judgments: Earlier this year, the country\u2019s constitutional court ruled that the Russian government wouldn\u2019t be compelled to pay damages awarded by the court to shareholders of Yukos, once Russia\u2019s largest oil company.Write to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 11:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-clashes-with-european-court-over-gay-propaganda-ruling-1497965339", "news_title": "Russia Clashes With European Court Over \u2018Gay Propaganda\u2019 Ruling", "keywords": " european court of justice, gay propoganda, lgbt rights, pussy riot, putin,russia,russia discrimination,russia rights,European Court of Human Rights,Russian Ministry of Justice,European Convention on Human Rights,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,discrimination,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sex discrimination,social issues,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald J.

JBS\u2019s parent company, J&F Investimentos, has agreed to pay a fine of 10.3 billion reais to settle Brazilian authorities\u2019 investigations.On the block are JBS\u2019s 19.2% stake in Vigor Alimentos SA, its ownership interest in European poultry brand Moy Park and its U.S.-based Five Rivers Cattle Feeding business, the company said.Not included in the sales target is the 1 billion reais JBS already raised by selling its operations in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.Shares of JBS, which grew into the world\u2019s biggest animal-protein producer through a series of acquisitions that were partly funded with financing from state-controlled banks. were down 2.2% Tuesday morning at 6.21 reais ($1.88).JBS was expected to sell assets to help maintain liquidity, and faces more problems, including efforts to boycott its products in Brazil and possible fines from U.S. authorities, according to Pedro Galdi, a S\u00e3o Paulo-based analyst at research firm Upside Investor.\u201cThey might be forced to sell other assets,\u201d Mr. Galdi said, adding that JBS\u2019s parent company also has assets that could be sold, including lender Banco Original and pulp company Eldorado.JBS said Tuesday it believes the plan announced is adequate and sufficient to reduce indebtedness and strengthen its financial position.JBS also said that its products aren\u2019t being boycotted.This month S&P Global lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Moy Park to B+ and kept it on CreditWatch with negative implications following a similar rating action on its parent.According to S&P, the recent corruption investigations and leniency agreement by its holding company are \u201cclear indication of weak governance standards.\u201dWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 11:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-jbs-to-sell-1-8-billion-in-assets-following-corruption-settlement-1497963023", "news_title": "Brazil\u2019s JBS to Sell $1.8 Billion in Assets Following Corruption Settlement ", "keywords": " assets,brazil,brazil president,bribes, corruption case,corruption investigation,five rivers cattle feeding ,jbs,jbs shares, meatpacker,michel temer, moy park, settlement, stakes, vigor alimentos,JBS SA ,JBSS3.BR,J&F Investimentos,Moy Park,Vigor Alimentos S/A,JBS S/A Ord,BR:JBSS3,Pedro Galdi,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,poultry processing,dairy products,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "ROME\u2014Italy is set to cut its public services spending by around \u20ac30 billion ($33 billion) in 2017, as a review aimed at improving the country\u2019s finances and sclerotic bureaucracy appears to gather steam.The reduction is equal to nearly one-fifth of the government\u2019s primary costs, excluding personnel expenditure, and a further \u20ac31.5 billion of cuts is set for 2018,       Yoram Gutgeld,        Italy\u2019s ruling Democratic Party\u2019s spending chief, said Tuesday.\u201cIt is like with someone who wants to get back in shape,\u201d Mr. Gutgeld said. \u201cYou need to be on a diet, but you also need to change lifestyle.\u201dMr. Gutgeld said the review, which started in 2014, had helped Italy cut its deficit to 2.4% of gross domestic product in 2016 from 3% in 2013 and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while offering additional public services and improving the efficiency of existing ones.Nonetheless, Italy\u2019s public expenditure, which is equal to roughly half of its gross domestic product, remains higher than the eurozone average, mainly due to the costs of servicing its huge debt and of paying pensions.\u00a0Interest payments on government debt are equal to 4% of the country\u2019s GDP, while pensions paid by the state amount to 17%\u2014both among the highest in Europe.Mr. Gutgeld said his 1,000-person review team had focused on the \u20ac328 billion in public costs\u2014around 40% of the total\u2014that primarily involve the health sector, local administration and national security.One of the main changes introduced was to centralize public sector procurement processes, cutting the number of purchasing centers to 35 from around 36,000.In 2016, 82% of health sector purchases in cost terms were made through the centralized procurement process, compared with 27% the year before.\u201cThe figures are considerable and will create large room to reduce current expenditure,\u201d Italy\u2019s Economy Minister       Pier Carlo Padoan       said.This spending review follows earlier attempts at steadying Italy\u2019s financial tiller, after it teetered on the edge of financial collapse toward the end of 2011. These efforts often clashed with individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 vested interests and didn\u2019t reduce Italy\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio of 133%\u2014one of the largest in the world.Write to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 11:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-moves-to-slim-down-bloated-public-sector-and-save-billions-1497972040", "news_title": "Italy Moves to Slim Down Bloated Public Sector and Save Billions   ", "keywords": "italy budget cuts, italy deficits,Pier Carlo Padoan,Yoram Gutgeld,government finance,government budget,taxation,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,domestic politics"}, {"content": "THOUGH THE influence of the 1970s in shaping fashion has simmered down slightly, it\u2019s still going strong (and boiling over when it comes to Gucci).If you want to partake in the neo-\u201970s trend without parting ways with your own, not especially retro style, consider Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, as pictured here, on vacation in Capri, in June, 1971: Her button-front midi-skirt\u2014of its era but not cartoonishly so\u2014was echoed this season by a number of designers such as Lisa Marie Fernandez and Rebecca Taylor.The photo was snapped by a paparazzo as she was spending the day on the idyllic Italian island with her sister, Lee Radziwill, and Ms. Radziwill\u2019s children, Anthony and Anna Christina. Ms. Onassis was 41 at the time, about two years into her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, and, judging by her garb, perhaps feeling more comfortable in her own skin than she had several years prior as first lady of the United States. Her hair was tied in a low chignon, her feet clad in the flat sandals now synonymous with Capri style, and she paired the silk-tie-print skirt with a simple, scoop-neck top and wide metallic belt.Her look rather seamlessly and chicly translates to 2017. \u201cIn the \u201970s there was a lot of craziness going on in fashion, and [Jackie and Lee] just ignored it,\u201d said Jennifer Alfano, founder and editor of fashion website the Flair Index. \u201cThey were really true to being elegant and understated.\u201d Emma McClendon, assistant curator of costume at the Museum at FIT, at New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology, concurred: \u201cWhile [Jackie] was fashionable, she wasn\u2019t dressing in extremely directional clothing. Images of her have a feeling of the era but aren\u2019t so tied to that moment in time.\u201dThe skirt has other bona fides. New York designer Rebecca Taylor, who\u2019s offering four versions this season, praised its ability to leave you practically covered up but not dowdy. \u201cI\u2018m a mom of three, and my legs have seen better days,\u201d said Ms. Taylor, \u201cbut it gives you the feeling of being slightly sexy without wearing a mini.\u201d Another fan of the silhouette, Monica Paolini, co-designer of label Sea New York, appreciates its flattery: \u201cYou can show more leg, it accentuates your waist and hides hips well.\u201dFlat, strappy sandals are inarguably the ideal footwear for this skirt. But what to wear on top? Avoid anything too billowy, which can skew overly retro. Opt for a fitted, simple tops, like a T-shirt, camisole or even a bodysuit. The Flair Index\u2019s Ms. Alfano warned in particular against the now ubiquitous tops that are both off-the-shoulder and ruffled. \u201cYou could do an off-the-shoulder, or one ruffle, but be careful. You don\u2019t want to look like a wedding cake.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   This image of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lee Radziwill was shot in June 1971 by an unknown paparazzo.

He said it is possible \u201cwe could wait until the end of the year\u201d and next move interest rates higher at the December meeting, if that is what the economy\u2019s performance calls for.\u201cWe\u2019ve had too many experiences\u201d of forecasting higher inflation only to see it fall short of expectations, Mr. Evans said as part of his argument that the Fed has time to decide on its next interest rate action.And even if the Fed holds steady for a while, he observed the central bank\u2019s official forecasts \u201cdon\u2019t say when [increases] are going to take place.\u201d A year-end move would still conform to what is the current Fed outlook, he said.The official was interviewed in the wake of last week\u2019s pivotal Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At that gathering, officials boosted their short-term interest rate target range for the second time this year, to 1% and 1.25%, and laid out a plan for reducing their $4.5 trillion balance sheet, most likely later this year. Mr. Evans is currently an FOMC voting member.The Fed also signaled that most officials are looking to around one more rate increase in 2017, maintaining a view policy makers have held for a while now. But that outlook is increasingly being called into question in light of a spate of recent economic data that shows inflation trends cooling rather than rising back to the central bank\u2019s official 2% rise target.That has caused some to question whether the Fed should hold off on raising rates again until there is firmer evidence inflation is indeed moving back to desired levels. Last Friday, Minneapolis Fed chief       Neel Kashkari      explained his vote opposing the rate rise by saying it was a mistake to boost the cost of borrowing with inflation so short of the official target.Meanwhile, Dallas Fed leader       Robert Kaplan,        who is also an FOMC voter, said Friday what happens with rates does indeed depend on price pressures. \u201cWe should be very careful about raising rates, and we should do it patiently and carefully,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to need to see improvement\u201d in inflation before getting on board with another rate rise.Still, officials such as Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       and New York Fed President       William Dudley       seem confident inflation setbacks should be temporary. Mr. Dudley said in an appearance Monday \u201cinflation\u2019s a little bit lower than what we would like. But we think if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that we\u2019ll see inflation get back to 2%.\u201dMr. Evans also said in the interview that even if the Fed does hold off on rate rises until very late in the year, that needn\u2019t stop the institution from pressing forward with its plans to allow its balance sheet to start shrinking at some point this year.Last week, the Fed offered key details on how it would allow its holdings of cash and bonds, which grew rapidly due to financial crisis stimulus efforts, to start moving lower. The central bank plans to allow its holdings to shrink slowly and passively by allowing increasing amounts of Treasury and mortgage bonds to be matured and not replaced.\u201cI think we are the point where we can make a decision to start reducing the balance sheet at any time,\u201d Mr. Evans said. The plans are well explained and because of that, he expects there should be little market reaction once the effort starts.Mr. Evans added he fully expects the process to run in the background with changes in short-term rates the more important factor for the direction of the economy.The policy maker also praised Chairwoman Yellen and said he would be happy to see her reappointed to the job in 2018. \u201cI do think she\u2019s worthy of that,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Write to Michael S.

For those trying to sell equipment, Europe, where defense spending languished for years, was typically only a stopover place to somewhere else.That is now starting to change. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its military operations along European borders is driving countries such as Germany, France and Sweden to boost defense spending. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s public haranguing of European NATO members to contribute more to collective defense has reinforced the sense in European capitals that they should bolster military spending.\u201cThe downward trend in defense budgets we have seen in Europe has been stopped,\u201d             Airbus                   Chief Executive Officer       Tom Enders       said.Maj. Gen. Mats Helgesson, the head of the Swedish air force, on Sunday said an ongoing spending review in Sweden could lead to a further boost in the defense budget. That could help the service buy more             Saab                   AB-made Gripen combat jets and other equipment, he said. The spending review should be completed next year.For defense companies in Europe and the U.S., the new reality promises that big-ticket purchases that had been talked about for years may actually come to fruition as well as new opportunities. \u201cI am encouraged by what I see,\u201d said       Marillyn Hewson,        chief executive of             Lockheed Martin Corp.      , the Pentagon\u2019s biggest arms maker by sales.The company last year won a deal to provide C-130J military transport planes to France and is in talks with Germany about a similar purchase.Ms. Hewson said there are new opportunities for exports of its F-35 radar-evading combat jet, the Pentagon\u2019s biggest weapons program already. Lockheed\u2019s European buyers of the plane include the U.K., Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark. Finland and Belgium, which are considering new combat jet purchases in coming years are potential buyers, Ms. Hewson said. Germany has even asked for information on the Lockheed Martin plane, she said. One of Airbus\u2019s combat jet production sites is in Germany.Poland is in talks with Lockheed Martin over the purchase of armed helicopters, Ms. Hewson said. Germany may buy a antimissile system Lockheed Martin coproduces with European partners which, Ms. Hewson said, could spur more sales among the region\u2019s NATO members.Boeing                   is trying to sell large attack helicopters in Poland and transport helicopters in Germany, where Lockheed Martin offers the rival chopper. Boeing also is eyeing combat jet sales opportunities in Switzerland and has its eye on the Finnish program.Many of those opportunities have been on the horizon for some time, though. Companies are still waiting for a surge of new programs. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give the governments time to figure out what they are going to do,\u201d Gene Cunningham, sales chief for Boeing\u2019s defense business, said at the Paris Air Show.For European companies, the uplift in spending is welcome because the region has been starved of money to birth new military programs that could lead to exports. The European Union this month announced it would spend \u20ac500 million ($557 million) on a new program to unify its fractured defense market and jointly develop new weapons.Mr. Enders, who has been skeptical about previous European initiatives to bolster military spending, embraced the initiative. \u201cThis is a positive that serves to strengthen European defense postures and hopefully also defense industry of which there is not that much left in Europe.\u201dBritish arms makers want to be part of the program, even though Britons last year voted to leave the European Union, said Jeegar Kakkad, policy director at the U.K.\u2019s aerospace and defense lobby group. Without the U.K., which has one of the largest defense budgets, the program\u2019s ambitions would have to be scaled down, he said,With strong competition for arms sales in Europe coming from U.S. manufacturers, European arms makers are renewing a push to band together to hold off their larger American rivals who enjoy a far larger domestic market.Airbus has begun talks with Germany about development of a new combat plane, to replace its Tornado combat jets that entered service in the late 1970s. Spain also has begun exploring replacement for its aging Boeing F/A-18 planes. Airbus wants France to join, too, to give the project more heft.\u201cThere is no place to do two or three different systems in Europe as we have done in the past,\u201d said       Fernando Alonso,        head of military aircraft at Airbus. \u201cIt is clearly in our common interest in Europe to define one single system that would be available for all,\u201d Mr. Alonso said.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 11:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-companies-finding-more-business-in-europe-1497971053", "news_title": "Defense Companies Finding More Business in Europe   ", "keywords": "defense companies,defesne contractors,europe defense spending,europe military spending,military spending,paris air show,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,weapons programs,aerospace products,parts,military aircraft,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Anne Hillerman,        67, is the author of three mystery novels, including her latest, \u201cSong of the Lion\u201d (Harper), which features characters made famous by her father, novelist       Tony Hillerman.

By senior year, he had quit his job at the bowling alley his father manages. \u201cI told him that my time was worth more than $7.50 an hour,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was proud that I was making more money on my own.\u201dDebbie Anderson, 60, says she has known Mr. Kokenge through her daughter since they were in elementary school and has twice turned to him with a cracked screen.\u201cYouth isn\u2019t always an asset when you\u2019re hiring someone,\u201d she says, but \u201cI had all the confidence in his ability.\u201dTeens interviewed for this article say they fix mostly             Apple Inc.       iPhones, though some work on Android devices. They typically bill something less than adult competitors, though not always.Mr. Kokenge charges $50 to fix an iPhone 5 screen and $200 for an iPhone 7 Plus. He usually does repairs at a coffee shop.For those models, iCracked, an online network that pairs technicians with customers, charges $74.99 and $189.99, while Apple charges $129 and $149 for phones not under warranty.An Apple spokesman says the company has long respected customers\u2019 rights to get iPhones fixed by technicians of their choice but says it is best they turn to Apple-authorized channels, which use Apple-authorized parts, to ensure \u201cthat their Apple product continues to perform the way it did when they first purchased it.\u201dAJ Forsythe,        iCracked\u2019s CEO, attributes young iPhone entrepreneurs\u2019 success to availability of training materials and tools, and to their customer base. \u201cYou have this ecosystem of your peers that all have smartphones,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of them are out and active and breaking them.\u201dOf the 79,901 people applying to be technicians with iCracked last year, 12% were under 18. Its policy is that technicians must be at least 18.Fixing phones has presented tough lessons for Jack Hancock, 18, of Mason, Ohio, who says he has repaired them since age 15.He once drove 45 minutes to Dayton to tackle four phones for a client, working at a         Panera Bread               restaurant table until getting ejected at closing time. He finished outside, but not before breaking one phone. He footed the cost to replace it.Another time, he accidentally clipped a cable in an iPhone, killing the fingerprint sensor. He paid the customer $400 for a new phone. \u201cIt was very costly to me.\u201dHe looks forward to college this fall, where students \u201ctend to be less careful with their phones,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of partying, obviously.\u201dEthan Damm, a phone fixer in Wichita, Kan., says he faced             Facebook                   attacks from an adult competitor. \u201cHe would throw out, \u2018He\u2019s only 17,\u2019\u00a0\u201d says Mr. Damm, now 18, and claim he used low-quality screens.Mr. Damm responded by linking to the website of his wholesaler, Mobile Defenders, to show his legitimacy. Derek Becker, who manages Mr. Damm\u2019s account there, says \u201ceverything from his follow-through and how he carries himself and communicates, he\u2019s top-notch.\u201dOne set of parents was so pleased with Mr. Damm\u2019s service, \u201cthey said you should come to the bar with us some time,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I can\u2019t really go in the bar.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOn Nantucket, Mr. Shaw is the \u201cgo-to guy,\u201d says Peter Bordes, executive chairman of a software company, oneQube, who got his phone fixed by Mr. Shaw last summer after a tip from a friend\u2019s teenage daughter.\u201cShe said go to this place, and you\u2019ll find him in this store,\u201d Mr. Bordes says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a mafia; they know who to go to.\u201d The repair, he says, was \u201cflawless.\u201dMr. Shaw, a high-school sophomore this fall, learned from YouTube videos. This summer, he\u2019ll get backup from his understudy, Smith Mohler, 15, whom he trained last summer. Picking the right partner was crucial, he says. \u201cIt would be hard to hire a kid and trust him to fix an iPhone under your name.\u201dMr. Mohler says he has repaired more than 40 phones from students at high schools near his Washington, D.C., school.He learned a lesson on pressing clients for devices\u2019 histories after a neighbor brought him a faulty phone. He installed a new screen, but it wouldn\u2019t turn on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why,\u201d Mr. Mohler says, \u201cuntil she told me she dropped it in the toilet.\u201dWrite to Katherine Bindley at katie.bindley@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The name of software company oneQube was misstated in an earlier version of this article as OneCube Technologies.

You want to stay as far removed from politics as possible,\u201d said       Mark Penn,        an ad industry and market research veteran who is president of private equity fund The Stagwell Group.Mr. Penn suggested advertisers should be \u201ccombative\u201d to get consumers\u2019 attention without being overtly political.Various advertisers in the U.S. have faced backlash in recent months over ads that consumers have perceived to be distasteful.Budweiser\u2019s Super Bowl ad depicting its co-founder\u2019s journey from Germany to the U.S. prompted calls to boycott the beer at a time when President       Donald Trump       was attempting to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. for people from several Muslim-majority countries, for example.Similarly, Pepsi was forced to pull an ad in April in which Kendall Jenner offers a soda to a police officer at a protest site.Harris Diamond, chairman and chief executive at McCann Worldgroup, said brands shouldn\u2019t try to force themselves into discussions if some consumers might be surprised to see them doing so.After all, most brands want to sell their products to as many people as possible, regardless of their political views.\u201cWe don\u2019t want Pepsi to get involved in that conversation, we want Pepsi to be a refreshing drink,\u201d Mr. Diamond said.Dawn Hudson,        chief marketing officer for the National Football League, echoed those sentiments. Brands should be transparent about their point of view if they have one, but shouldn\u2019t attempt to force it.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to politicize. Unless it\u2019s in the DNA of the brand, stick to what your brand is about,\u201d Ms. Hudson said.Write to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 10:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketing-experts-to-advertisers-steer-clear-of-politics-1497969745", "news_title": "Marketing Experts to Advertisers: Steer Clear of Politics", "keywords": "advertising,cannescmo,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,market research,consumer trends"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump       tapped attorney Marvin Kaplan to fill a vacant seat on the National Labor Relations Board, taking a first step toward securing Republican control of the agency refereeing disputes between unions and business for the first time in nearly a decade.The president announced his intent to nominate Mr. Kaplan, counsel at the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to one of the five seats on the board\u00a0on Monday\u00a0evening. If he wins Senate confirmation, Mr. Kaplan would be the second Republican on the panel. A fifth position remains vacant, but it is expected the White House will name another Republican for that spot.Democrats control two of the three occupied seats on the board, but Mr. Trump has elevated the sole Republican,       Philip Miscimarra,        to chairman. That move slowed issuance of agency decisions, since Mr. Miscimarra can control which cases are decided but lacks the votes to win rulings.Republicans haven\u2019t controlled the board since December 2007, after vacancies late in President       George W. Bush\u2019s       second term went unfilled. When Republicans regain control of the board, it is expected they will look to undo decisions made during President       Barack Obama\u2019s       tenure that resulted in some big victories for labor, including an easier path for employees at franchise businesses and contractors to organize.Unions have used those victories to push for organization in the restaurant industry, among other sectors.Three important cases decided in recent years by the National Labor Relations Board and one case the board could hear in the near future:National Restaurant Association Executive Vice President       Cicely Simpson       said the trade group \u201cis very pleased\u201d with Mr. Kaplan\u2019s selection. The board \u201cwill be deciding a number of important issues, including the joint employer standard and micro-unions, that directly impact small businesses,\u201d she said.The board to could also revisit issues around the timing of union elections, the appropriate size of a bargaining unit, and whether graduate-student instructors can form unions.Mr. Kaplan has worked for the safety commission since 2015. Previously, he worked as counsel for House Republicans on the Education and the Workforce Committee. Republicans on that committee have held hearings to take a critical look at decisions made by the board in recent years. He also served as counsel for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.In those positions, he was responsible for labor and employment oversight and policy, including the National Labor Relations Act, Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, and Labor Management Relations Act, the White House said in an announcement.Filling out the board has been politically fraught in the past, and many of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointments elsewhere in his administration have faced a difficult pathway. A board nominee only needs to gain approval from a majority of the Republican-controlled Senate to win confirmation. However, unions and Democrats could raise a protest, as they did to Mr. Trump\u2019s initial labor secretary nominee       Andy Puzder,        and draw out the process.Mr. Puzder withdrew his nomination amid deepening personal controversies.Mr. Kaplan\u2019s political background is likely to raise questions, said William Gould, a Democrat who served as board chairmen during President       Bill Clinton\u2019s       administration.\u201cWe need less politicization of the agency, and the Kaplan pick moves us in the wrong direction,\u201d said Mr. Gould, a former Stanford Law School professor. The board, created in the 1930s, was intended to be a panel of experts appointed to adjudicate a complex law, the National Labor Relations Act. Placing political partisans from either side on it weakens that mission, he said.The White House is considering William Emanuel, an attorney representing employers at the Littler Mendelson law firm, for the remaining opening on the board, according to people familiar with the vetting process. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Emanuel.Mr. Gould said a longtime practicing labor-law attorney like Mr. Emanuel would be a less contentious pick. Mr. Emanuel is \u201cvery far to the right, but he\u2019s well qualified,\u201d Mr. Gould said.Also Monday, Mr. Trump tapped Patrick Pizzella of Virginia to be the Labor Department\u2019s deputy secretary. Like Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, Mr. Pizzella appears to have a relatively smooth path to confirmation. He has won approval from Republicans and Democrats in the past.Mr. Pizzella, acting chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, was nominated to the authority in 2013 by Mr. Obama. During the George W. Bush administration, he was the department\u2019s assistant secretary for administration and management.Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Labor Pick Begins Power Shift.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 10:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-nominates-marvin-kaplan-for-national-labor-relations-board-seat-1497957209", "news_title": "Trump Moves to End Democrats\u2019 Control of National Labor Relations Board ", "keywords": " education and workforce committee, marvin kaplan,national labor relations board, nlrb, occupational safety and health review commission, trump nominees, unions,National Labor Relations Board,Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission,Donald Trump,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Kirk Douglas, 100, has starred in more than 90 films, including \u201cSpartacus,\u201d and has won an Oscar and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is the author of 12 books, including \u201cKirk and Anne,\u201d a joint memoir (Running Press). He spoke with Marc Myers.We were the poorest family on a street of poor families. My father, Harry, had emigrated from Russia and settled in Amsterdam, N.Y. Then he sent for my mother, Bryna. But he couldn\u2019t do much to make money. So he bought a horse and became a ragman.We were seven kids, and my father was an indifferent provider. My mother always pleaded with him for money. He\u2019d say, \u201cHaven\u2019t got it,\u201d in Yiddish. Growing up, we never had enough food.When I was hungry, I stole food\u2014an egg from under a neighbor\u2019s hen or a tomato from a garden. I also swiped fruit and vegetables from a stand. For years, I felt guilty about those little sins.Anti-Semitism was common in Amsterdam. I suppose my personality and charm developed as a way to survive. It also helped that I loved to act and won awards in school.I also was a hard worker. I\u2019d invent jobs, like selling soda and candy to workers at the mill at the end of our street. Amsterdam was one of the largest mill towns in the country. There were dozens of factories, but no jobs for Jews.Our house was a rundown, two-story gray clapboard next to the factories, the railroad tracks and the river. It didn\u2019t have heating. Before the winter, my father and I would take dried manure from his horse, Bill, and spread it around the foundation for insulation. It didn\u2019t help.By the time the family was complete\u2014six girls and me, fourth in line\u2014I slept on a shabby living-room sofa. The girls were in two bedrooms, and my parents in another. I hated sleeping on my own.I loved my father, but I wondered if he loved me. I wanted to win his praise and affection. But he was distant.My mother worked hard to feed and clothe us. There wasn\u2019t much money. She took care of the house with no hot running water, washing machine or decent stove.She was ingenious. The girls would buy a pound of the cheapest meat at the kosher butcher and beg for free bones. The soup my mother made fed us for days.After high school in 1934, I didn\u2019t have enough for college tuition. So I hitchhiked 200 miles to St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., with a friend who was a sophomore there. I took all my high-school acting awards, transcript, essays and poems. I also took a letter of recommendation from my English teacher and champion, Mrs. Livingston.I met with Dean Hewlitt, head of faculty, and delivered my pitch. It worked. He helped me get a college loan, and the following semester I won a scholarship.During the summer after my freshman year, I took a job wrestling in the circus. I was a shill. When the wrestler asked if anyone in the crowd cared to challenge him, I stepped forward. I was head of the varsity team at college and an undefeated champ, so we made a show of it.It was hard for a Jewish kid to find work at any of the hotels and resorts up there and my name was Izzy Demsky.Future summers were spent acting at the Tamarack Playhouse on Lake Pleasant. One day, a few of my friends insisted I needed a more American name. Someone suggested Douglas. My new first name took longer. Someone finally said Kirk. My new name sounded masculine and strong.\u2018Our house was a rundown, two-story gray clapboard next to the factories, the railroad tracks and the river. It didn\u2019t have heating.\u2019The big turning point for me was meeting Betty Perske. By then she was Betty Bacall and would soon become Lauren Bacall. We met at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.Betty was 17 and I was 25. One winter I only had a lightweight coat. Betty talked her uncle into giving me one of his warmer coats. I loved her from that moment on.Betty became a huge star with her first film, and she urged film producer Hal Wallis to see me on Broadway. That\u2019s how I came to Hollywood. I co-starred in \u201cThe Strange Love of Martha Ivers\u201d (1946).Today, my wife, Anne, and I live in Beverly Hills. We decided about 30 years ago to downsize from the large house we owned to a cozy one-story house.I fell for Anne in 1953. I still see her as an elegant and sexy Parisienne, but it\u2019s her character and wit and how her eyes light up when she sees me that delight me.I never expected to live to be 100. A stroke in 1996 affected my speech, but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from laughing. You live a long life if you enjoy the things that make you happy and don\u2019t worry too much.

BA 1.27%       has raised its 20-year industry forecast for plane deliveries to 41,030 jetliners, with their value at list prices topping $6 trillion for the first time.Boeing, the world\u2019s No. 1 plane maker, said Tuesday that passenger traffic is poised to grow 4.7% a year on average over the next two decades. The outlook is more bullish than one that European rival Airbus SE delivered this month, which projected 4.4% growth.Airbus and Boeing underscored the continued demand strength, principally in the large single-aisle plane sector, with several billion dollars of deals on Tuesday, the second day of the Paris Air Show.More than half the planes Boeing expects the industry to deliver are intended to help airlines expand. The plane maker said the rest, about 43%, will be used to replace less-efficient planes being phased out. Almost 40% of the planes will go to customers in Asia, driven heavily by booming air traffic in China.Growth is expected to be strongest in the hotly contested single-aisle segment, where Boeing offers the 737 family of planes and Airbus the A320 variants.Chicago-based Boeing\u2019s 20-year forecast calls for 29,530 new narrowbody planes to make it into customer hands. On Monday it launched its largest new single-aisle plane, called the 737 Max 10, and said it had more than 10 customers committed to buying it.At the air show, United Continental Holdings Inc. committed to taking 100 of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max 10 planes, which are a conversion from an earlier model. United also bought four 777-300ER long-range jets for delivery in the coming two years.Lessor Avolon said it signed an agreement to buy 75 single-aisle planes from the U.S. manufacturer.         China Aircraft Leasing Group               is buying 50 of the U.S. narrowbodies, while         Ryanair Holdings               PLC, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passengers, added 10 commitments for 737s. Boeing also announced commitments for more than 30 additional single-aisle and widebody planes.Airbus signed an agreement with             Delta Air Lines Inc.       for 10 more A321 narrowbodies, while Latin American discount carrier Viva Air committed to take 50 single-aisle jets. CBD Aviation, which on Monday bought planes from Boeing, signed for 45 Airbus narrowbodies on Tuesday. Ethiopian Airlines also agreed to take 10 more A350-900 long-range planes in a deal valued at over $3 billion at list price.Boeing expects demand for widebody planes, where the company offers the 787 Dreamliner and 777 models, to reach 9,130 airplanes during the 20-year forecast period.Order bookings have slowed for big twin-aisle planes over recent months, but Boeing said there is \u201ca large wave of potential replacement demand beginning early in the next decade.\u201dRandy Tinseth,        vice president of marketing for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplanes unit, said orders for big planes are likely to start picking up next year or in 2019 to meet the need for widebodies from 2021.The Boeing and Airbus outlooks are broadly similar, though the U.S. manufacturer counts smaller planes not in its rival\u2019s forecast.One segment where the two plane makers differ is in their demand forecast for the biggest passenger planes, where Boeing offers the 747-8 and Airbus its flagship A380 superjumbo.Boeing said demand for that size plane will be principally in the cargo segment and that fewer than 100 passenger models of that type will be delivered during the coming 20 years. Airbus says that more than 1,400 such planes will be delivered, including cargo models.Both Airbus and Boeing have been forced to cut production rates of their biggest planes because of demand softness.Boeing has shifted its focus to big twin-engine planes that can seat more than 400 passengers. By contrast, Airbus officials insist the market for its big, four-engine plane will recover. It used this week\u2019s Paris Air Show to unveil plans for enhancements to the plane\u2019s sizable wing to help boost fuel efficiency 4%, in the latest in a series of design tweaks to help lure customers. So far, those efforts have yielded no tangible results.Airbus plane head       Fabrice Br\u00e9gier       said the plane maker was in active talks for further A380 deals, though the timing of when they would be completed remained uncertain.He expressed confidence the A380 would secure further orders once demand for big planes recovers.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 10:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-sees-more-than-6-trillion-in-plane-deliveries-1497944400", "news_title": "Boeing Sees More Than $6 Trillion in Plane Deliveries", "keywords": "deliveries, demand, forecast,jetliners, planes,Boeing,BA,Airbus,EADSY,Ethiopian Airlines,United Continental Holdings Inc,China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings,HK:1848,Delta Air Lines,DAL,Ryanair Holdings,IE:RY4C,Fabrice Br\u00e9gier,Randy Tinseth,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,supply chain,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,rental,leasing services,aerospace,defense,air transport,business,consumer services,industrial goods,packaging,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Singer and actor       Harry Connick Jr.       is selling the Connecticut home where he\u2019s lived with his family for nearly 20 years, asking $7.5 million for the former dairy farm.Mr. Connick and his wife Jill, a former Victoria\u2019s Secret model, said they raised their three daughters at the New Canaan property, located about 50 miles outside New York City. The couple said they are selling because they love design and architecture and are ready for a new project, although they declined to say where that will be. \u201cWe wanted to try something new,\u201d Mr. Connick said.The 4.61-acre estate was once part of a large dairy farm, said the Connicks.

The Connicks spent about two years renovating the house after buying it, using chestnut from the original structure to build doors and countertops.

Since the start of the bull market on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 has risen nearly 260%. The current S&P 500 operating price-to-earnings ratio\u2014a commonly used measure of value\u2014is 21.89 versus 18.56 on March 31, 2009, based on trailing 12-month operating earnings, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. External forces that could weigh on stocks are also gathering, such as geopolitical uncertainties and Federal Reserve interest-rate increases.Investors are largely positioned for continued low volatility, and that\u2019s a risky proposition, says       Michael Arone,        chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, the asset-management business of State Street Corp. \u201cRather than wait for volatility to strike, seize the opportunity to put volatility to work while it\u2019s cheap,\u201d he says.While experts differ on the value of hedging strategies for individual investors, some say options and stop-loss orders are two strategies that can benefit some investors.Put options\u2014contracts that give their owner the right but not the obligation to sell an investment at a set price until the contract expires\u2014 offer one way for investors to stay in the market without risking all of their gains.Put options essentially allow a stock owner to hold a stock he expects to appreciate, while protecting him in case it declines.The cost of the contract will reduce an investor\u2019s profit if the stock rises in value, but limit losses should the shares decline below the strike price, the price at which the put option can be executed.For example, an investor may purchase 100 shares of a stock at $40, and when the shares are trading at $55, buy an options contract to sell them at $52. If he pays $4 per contract, the total cost to cover the 100 shares would be $400.If the stock rises in value, the put option will expire worthless. If the investor sold the stock at $60, his pretax profit would be $1,600\u2014$2,000 minus the $400 paid for the contracts.But if the stock declines to $45, the investor may sell it at $52 because he has the put in place. If he does so, his pretax profit would be $800\u2014$5,200 minus his initial outlay of $4,000 for the shares and $400 for the puts options. Without the protection, his pretax profit would be just $500\u2014$4,500 minus his initial outlay of $4,000.A typical individual investor would likely want help from an adviser to use put options, says Mr. Arone. The strategy doesn\u2019t require a big outlay; some investors use the options to protect just 5% to 10% of their portfolio, Mr. Arone says.A bonus, he says: Buying put options is inexpensive today because volatility is so low.Stop-loss orders are also meant to limit an investor\u2019s downside on a specific holding. Made with a broker, such orders trigger the sale of an investment if its price falls by a specified level.Because stop-loss orders execute automatically once set, they can take the emotion out of selling a holding, says       Terri Spath,        chief investment officer at Santa Monica, Calif.-based Sierra Investment Management. The orders are free except for the cost of any trade that gets triggered and any tax consequences.Sierra, which manages $2.4 billion, has trailing stop-loss orders on all of its 150 mutual-fund and ETF investments. Such orders set a percentage below the current price of an investment or a dollar price at which to trigger a sale. If the investment rises in value, the trigger price will rise with it. If a trailing stop order was set to sell a mutual fund at 10% below its price, for example, and the fund\u2019s price rose to $300, the order would be triggered when the price falls to $270.The orders permit the firm to cut off any \u201chuge, unrecoverable loss,\u201d says Ms. SpathOne risk with this strategy is that if a stock is being sold off quickly, its price could fall further after the stop-loss order is triggered but before it can be sold, says       Dan Moisand,        principal and financial adviser at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC in Melbourne, Fla.When a stock or fund hits the trigger price, the order becomes a market order, and the investor doesn\u2019t know how quickly after that the order will be executed, he says. A market order is an order to buy or sell to be executed immediately at the current market price, but how quickly such orders can be executed depends on having a willing buyer or seller.To avoid selling at a price that\u2019s too low, investors can use a stop-limit order, which will prevent their order from being executed if a holding drops below a certain price, says Ms. Spath. For example, if a stock is trading at $30, and an investor has a stop-limit sell order in place specifying a stop price of $20, the stock will be sold when it hits $20 for $20 or more if there are willing buyers. But if the stock falls to $20 and continues to decline before a willing buyer is found, then it wouldn\u2019t be sold.Write to Daisy Maxey at daisy.maxey@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-individual-investors-can-lock-in-stock-gains-1497967201", "news_title": "How Individual Investors Can Lock In Stock Gains", "keywords": "financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014A French journalist and his Iraqi colleague died in a mine blast in Mosul, where they were covering Iraqi counterterrorism operations against Islamic State for state-owned France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, the network said Tuesday.Stephan Villeneuve,        48, and       Bakhtiar Haddad,        were accompanying Iraqi army forces in areas held by Islamic State in the city\u2019s historical center, on the West Bank of the River Tigris, said Reporters Without Borders, a nonprofit media group.Two other reporters were injured in the blast.

Baime.Years ago, the word supercar came into vogue. A supercar is a rare, expensive performance automobile, like a Ferrari or a Lamborghini. Later, car fans started using the word hypercar. These vehicles are even more exclusive\u2014so rare in fact, you are not likely to ever even catch a glimpse of one. They can cost well over a million dollars, and they pack so much power, they defy the whole idea of what a car is supposed to be.In my opinion, there are only two real independent hypercar builders today: Koenigsegg of Sweden and Pagani of Italy.I was lucky enough to see a Koenigsegg at a gas station in 2009. I was already a Ferrari collector, and I knew of this car and its ingenious creator, Christian von Koenigsegg. I was transfixed. The vehicle looked like nothing I had ever seen.A few years later, I got a call from a specialty car dealer in Seattle saying he had a Koenigsegg CCX for sale. Within 24 hours, I was at his dealership handing him a check. With a car this rare, I feared that I would never have another shot at one.Koenigsegg was founded in Sweden in 1994 by then-22-year-old Christian von Koenigsegg, and to this day, only 134 cars have been completed. The CCX was the first Koenigsegg imported into the U.S. The experience of driving it is hard to put into words. The engine puts out 806 horsepower. The vehicle is very lightweight and full of suspension technology, so this power is delivered in a smooth, refined manner. Top speed is over 245 mph.At the time I bought my CCX, there was no place to service my car, so a Koenigsegg technician flew in to do the work in my garage.Last summer I drove the CCX to Monterey Car Week, a huge gathering of enthusiasts. A mob crowded around. It was as if a spaceship had landed.Koenigsegg is building a new car called Agera RS. A very few are slated for the U.S. I ordered one and it is scheduled to arrive in July. This new car will put well over 1,000 horsepower to the pavement. I cannot wait to get behind the wheel.Contact A.J.

The complex talks are on a tight timetable: They must be done in time for Britain to leave in March 2019.In an early concession, 11 days after U.K. elections in which Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, British negotiators agreed to focus early talks on the EU\u2019s key priorities: settling the future rights of EU citizens in the U.K., discussing past spending pledges the EU wants Britain to fulfill and avoiding a hard border in Ireland.The EU has said only once there is \u201csufficient progress\u201d on these issues can talks begin on the future trade relationship between the two sides. The bloc\u2019s chief negotiator,       Michel Barnier,        said he hopes the two sides can reach that point by October.In a sign of the tensions that lie ahead, EU officials said U.K. Brexit Secretary       David Davis       didn\u2019t accept the EU\u2019s legal case for a British divorce bill\u2014financial commitments made by the U.K. that it hasn\u2019t yet fulfilled\u2014saying there were different legal views on the issue. EU officials have said Britain has made spending pledges of at least \u20ac60 billion ($67 billion) that it must fulfill.At a news conference after the first day of talks, Mr. Davis and Mr. Barnier categorized the talks as positive.\u201cThe first session was useful indeed to start off on the right foot and the clock is ticking,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.Mr. Davis said he was encouraged by Monday\u2019s seven hours of talks. \u201cThere is a long way to go but we are off to a promising start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken the first critical steps together.\u201dMr. Davis said he hoped for quick progress on agreeing the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. and British citizens in the EU.He said Mrs. May would brief her counterparts at a Brussels summit this week on what British officials have called a generous British proposal on the rights of the three million EU citizens in the U.K. and the one million U.K. citizens in the EU. The details of that plan will be published next Monday.The two sides agreed they would meet for one week a month to conduct the negotiations, with the next talks beginning on July 17. They set up three working groups on citizens\u2019 rights issues, on the EU\u2019s financial settlement demands and other divorce issues.They also established a separate dialogue, at a higher political level, to discuss the politically sensitive and technically complex issue of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr. Davis acknowledged that solutions for Ireland would take longer.Mr. Barnier has said he wants to conclude the talks by October 2018 to give enough time to ratify a divorce deal after more than four decades of British membership in the bloc. The two sides are also supposed to shape a future partnership between Britain and its neighbors.Mrs. May has said she wants a close economic and security partnership with the EU but has acknowledged that any future deal can only be secured once Britain exits the EU. Some European officials have warned that could take years to achieve.Britain started Monday\u2019s negotiations at a time of huge political volatility at home, with Mrs. May struggling to rebuild her authority after calling early elections that ended with a disastrous result for her party. Since the vote, there have been calls from senior Conservative politicians for Mrs. May to soften Britain\u2019s Brexit goals.After Monday\u2019s negotiations, Mr. Davis said there would be no change in the government\u2019s intention to leave the EU\u2019s single market of goods and services and exit the EU\u2019s customs union. \u201cThe position hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said.Mr. Barnier said the EU side also was negotiating on that basis. He warned that while his team were determined to try to reach a deal with the U.K., leaving the bloc without a deal would have real consequences for the country. \u201cA fair deal is possible and far better than no deal,\u201d he said.While the U.K. government insists it won\u2019t change its negotiating position, senior officials have said they aren\u2019t closing off options for a possible transitional agreement that could cushion the economy for the first few years after Britain leaves the bloc.However, any decision to stay temporarily in the single market after March 2019 would mean accepting continued EU rules and the oversight of EU courts. Staying in the customs union for a few years would prevent Britain completing bilateral trade agreements with other countries during the transition.On Monday, top trade officials from the U.S. and U.K. said they are eager to explore a bilateral free-trade agreement\u2014but any possible deal is likely at least two years away from taking shape.\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to conclude any negotiations as long as we\u2019re still part of the European Union,\u201d       Liam Fox,        the U.K.\u2019s international trade secretary told a U.S. government-run investment conference just outside Washington, in a joint appearance with Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross.Mr. Fox, though, showed he was eager to begin exploring the prospects, pointing to a working group the two sides had established.\u201cFrom the U.S. side,\u201d Mr. Ross told the group, \u201cwe\u2019ve made clear we\u2019re prepared to begin as soon as the U.K. is ready.\u201dWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Divisions Emerge as U.K. Exit Talks Begin.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 09:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-barnier-hopes-to-remove-brexit-uncertainties-as-talks-begin-1497867241", "news_title": "Brexit Talks Begin With Tight Schedule Set and Divorce-Bill Disagreement", "keywords": "brexit,brexitinset,brexit talks, brexit timetable,british government,david davis,divorce bill,eu divorce,hard brexit,michel barnier,theresa may,European Union,British government,David Davis,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,domestic politics,regional politics,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014Wholesale transactions in Canada surged in April for a seventh consecutive monthly gain, likely stoking expectations of an interest-rate increase from the Bank of Canada\u2014perhaps as early as next month.Wholesale transactions increased 1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in April to 61.01 billion Canadian dollars ($46.15 billion), Statistics Canada said Tuesday. Market expectations were for a 0.5% rise, according to economists at Royal Bank of Canada.In volume terms, April wholesale transactions rose 0.7% from the previous month.March\u2019s wholesale-trade figures were also revised upward, and now indicate sales climbed 1.2% versus the earlier estimate of a 0.9% rise.On a 12-month basis, wholesale trade rose 10.3%.The April report, coupled with solid factory-shipments data and a robust labor market, further builds expectations of a sooner-than-expected rate increase from the Bank of Canada. Canada\u2019s central bank surprised markets last week when its two top officials struck a more bullish tone on the economy, and signaled they were setting the groundwork to increase the policy rate\u2014which sits at a near record low of 0.50%.\u00a0Central-bank officials said last week the two rate cuts it delivered in 2015 at the height of the commodity-price shock \u201chave done their work\u201d in helping the economy adjust to lower oil prices.\u201cAnother day, another positive for the Canadian outlook,\u201d said Nick Exarhos, economist at CIBC World Markets.Given April\u2019s wholesale trade report, Canadian output is on track to expand roughly 2.5% annualized in the second quarter after a 3.7% advance in the first quarter, Mr. Exarhos said. Spare industrial and labor capacity, or slack, in the Canadian economy will be largely absorbed by the end of 2017, \u201ca reason for the Bank of Canada to be eyeing some tightening within the same time frame,\u201d Mr. Exarhos said.Traders are pricing in a rate increase in October, according to the overnight index-swap market, with some analysts contending an upward move in July can\u2019t be ruled out given the central bank\u2019s about-face in messaging and its history of surprising markets. The OIS market indicates a 45% probability of a rate rise in July. The better-than-anticipated wholesale trade report will likely reinforce those expectations.Wholesale trade is the largest component of Canada\u2019s services sector\u2014 which in turn accounts for two-thirds of the country\u2019s economic output. Wholesalers tend to move merchandise in large quantities to institutional, industrial and retail clients. Markets tend to overlook the wholesale-trade data, even though it has a bigger weight in gross domestic product than the more closely watched retail sales, according to economists at BMO Capital Markets.Sales of machinery and equipment posted the biggest gain in dollar terms, up 7.3% in April to C$12.44 billion. Food products rose 1.4% to C$10.73 billion. Weighing on the results was the auto component, as motor vehicle and parts declined 1.7% to C$11.35 billion.

The workers scan bar codes on coupons shipped from American retailers to ensure the products have been accurately counted and categorized by the supplier and seller. The job involves employees manually processing hundreds of coupons each day with little variation.Researchers interviewed the women about their motivation on the job and also tracked how many coupons each woman processed. The women also filled out surveys about their stress and energy levels over a period of two weeks.The study found that workers who reported the most energy and processed the largest number coupons, despite disliking the work itself, were those who felt strong commitment to family, which could include spouses, children, parents, cousins or other kin. Those women processed about 10% more coupons a week than employees who reported less family-driven motivation.The increased motivation wasn\u2019t a matter of merely collecting a paycheck. In the research paper, which appeared in the April edition of the Academy of Management Journal, the authors note that \u201cfrom an identity perspective, when employees perform well, they reinforce their self-concepts as responsible breadwinners and good role models.\u201dMr. Grant, a father of three, said the study\u2019s results square with his own experience.\u201cA lot of people mistakenly believe that thinking about family at work is a distraction, when it\u2019s becoming clear that much of a person\u2019s most intense commitment to their job can come from their desire to support their loved ones,\u201d said Mr. Grant.Write to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-it-through-a-boring-day-job-1497963602", "news_title": "How to Make It Through a Boring Day Job", "keywords": "coupon scanning,employee motivation,employee retention,employee turnover,management research,maquiladora,work-life balance,University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,marketing,markets,pricing,sales promotions,management,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,career planning,general labor issues"}, {"content": "Many landlords have learned the hard way how technology upstarts like WeWork Cos. and Airbnb Inc. can disrupt traditional office-building and hotel businesses.Now the tech sector is turning its sights on the self-storage sector and its estimated $30 billion in annual revenue.A handful of startups such as Clutter Inc. and MakeSpace Labs Inc. are using the latest in logistics and web technology to offer what they claim is a more efficient and user-friendly way for people to store furniture, keepsakes, sports equipment and other stuff that has been clogging up their basements and attics.They work differently from the 40,000 or so traditional self-storage facilities that basically offer garages or sheds for customers to fill up as they please. The new competitors pick up and deliver items instead of forcing customers to schlep items to their facilities like the incumbent firms do. The upstarts also photograph what they store, and customers can view their items online and ask for some or all of them back with a click.\u201cImagine Amazon logistics meets Dropbox software,\u201d said Ari Mir, co-founder of Clutter, which is two years old and just added Chicago to the eight other markets it serves.Executives at the big self-storage companies, like             Public Storage,CubeSmart                   and             Extra Space Storage Inc.,       say they aren\u2019t worried. They say the startups\u2019 costs of transportation and handling will be so high they won\u2019t be able to price their service competitively.Public Storage, the world\u2019s largest self-storage business, with a stock-market capitalization of more than $37 billion, lost about $200 million in the early 2000s trying a similar service named Pick-up and Delivery.\u201cIt sounds like a great product on paper,\u201d said Clem Teng, a Public Storage vice president for investor relations. \u201cBut given all the touching involved, it\u2019s difficult to price it at a point that consumers are willing to pay so you can make a profit.\u201dStill, the self-storage startups are beginning to get traction with customers and financiers. Last week, Culver City, Ca.-based Clutter announced it had raised $64 million in its latest funding round from its existing investor, Sequoia Capital, as well as new investors Atomico, Fifth Wall Ventures and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       GV.MakeSpace, which has 300 employees in four cities, raised $30 million in March for a total of about $60 million to date, with the venture-capital firm 8vc taking the lead. Founder Sam Rosen envisions the firm being in 30 to 50 markets five years from now.Investors in the big storage companies are taking notice. \u201cThey will create major headwinds,\u201d said Laurel Durkay, associate portfolio manager of Cohen & Steers, a fund manager with roughly $60 billion in assets that is a big investor in the self-storage sector. \u201cBut I do believe it will be more important in dense urban markets than the broader domestic landscape.\u201dMs. Durkay predicted that the big companies will respond if the startups become more competitive. \u201cTo the extent that we have a\u2026revolution in the way people are using storage facilities, the management teams may be able to pivot and modify their strategies.\u201dMr. Rosen, of MakeSpace, said he isn\u2019t surprised Public Storage failed at what he and others are trying to do. \u201cThey\u2019re a real-estate business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do they know about logistics?\u201dCustomers of the new firms include people like Jassim Latif, a 34-year-old employee at a San Francisco software firm, who wanted something more than traditional storage. He became a Clutter customer after a bad experience trying to get his snowboard out of a locker he rented after his twin daughters were born two years ago.\u201cI had to move everything out to get my stuff, then move it all back in,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThen I thought: \u2018Great. In a few days I have to come back here and do the same thing all over again.\u2019\u201dThe new competition comes a time when Wall Street has been losing enthusiasm for the big self-storage companies. They were a darling of the real-estate investment trust sector between 2013 and 2015, strongly outperforming other REITs.But last year, while the broad REIT sector was up about 8.5%, storage was down about 8%, according to Steve Sakwa, head of real-estate research at Evercore ISI. So far this year, the sector is up 3.8%, but storage REITs are down 2.4%, he said.Rents are still rising but at a slower pace in part because of a glut of new supply, Mr. Sakwa said. Consumers also might be showing resistance to the rapid rent increases of previous years.Executives at the startups say they can keep prices low partly by locating facilities in cheaper spaces far away from customers. Traditional facilities generally are just a few miles away from customers\u2019 homes, and this can drive up costs in high-price real-estate markets like New York and San Francisco.Moving and handling items clearly drives up prices. For example, Clutter charges about $100 to $110 a month in New York to store a closet worth of stuff, roughly in the range of local self-storage facilities. But Clutter also charges $35 an hour per mover for on-site labor in the packing and moving process in pickups and deliveries.

Srsly.Claiming that prospective hires are too slow to pick up the phone or respond to emails, employers are trying out apps that allow them to screen candidates and conduct early-stage interviews with texts.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to have that ten-minute [phone] conversation any more if they could just reply with a quick text,\u201d said       Kirby Cuniffe,        chief executive of staffing firm Aegis Worldwide LLC. After Aegis recruiters reported that fewer potential hires were answering their phones, the firm decided to try texting. Since March, Indianapolis-based Aegis and             Priceline Group\u2019s       restaurant-booking service OpenTable have been using Canvas, a messaging app from Canvas Talent Inc. for text-based job interviews.The app suggests interview questions employers can use, such as: \u201cWhat motivates you?\u201dIts software analyzes candidates\u2019 responses. Interviewers can rate answers with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down visible only to the employer and share transcripts of those text exchanges with co-workers.Canvas charges employers around $300 per recruiter, and competes with similar apps such as Monster Worldwide Inc.\u2019s Jobr.The use of smartphone-based tools for job interviews shows how employers are trying to adapt to young workers\u2019 communication habits. Some 12% of millennials\u2014defined as those born between 1980 and the early 2000s\u2014prefer the phone for business communication, according to a 2016 report on internet trends from venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. By contrast, 45% prefer chatting online or exchanging messages by email or text.At Aegis, recruiters who used to schedule back-to-back phone calls with 30 or more potential hires every day can now juggle many more conversations via texts, which take less time. Mr. Cuniffe says each of his 10 recruiters who use the Canvas app can now handle conversations with 90 to 120 candidates at a time.The firm specializes in recruiting employees of all ages to work in the manufacturing sector. The app is useful for interacting with workers who have narrow windows of free time at odd hours, he said.Mr. Cuniffe, 48 years old, said millennial employees were far less skeptical than he was about adopting the new technology.\u201cTo them, it was like \u2018Duh, why wouldn\u2019t we use this, since that\u2019s how we communicate now,\u2019 \u201d he said.San Francisco-based OpenTable\u2019s text-based interviews with engineers and programmers are intended to show prospective hires the 1,100-person company isn\u2019t just another boring software firm\u2014important because the firm competes for talent with             Facebook Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, said       Scott Day,        a human-resources executive.Etiquette for job-interview texting is a work in progress.

Nine years later, U.K. fraud investigators finally allege they were partly criminal, too. Whether Barclays fights the charges or pleads guilty will be a complex gamble for current management.The Serious Fraud Office on Tuesday charged Barclays and some former top executives with conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance. Large fines and jail time could result.This is an unwanted first for the industry. The chief executive at the time,       John Varley,        is charged on all counts, the first bank CEO to face a crisis-era criminal prosecution.       Roger Jenkins,        a former investment banker who played a key role in the deals, is also charged on all counts.Barclays turned to Qatar and other investors in June and October 2008 to raise capital and avoid having to take taxpayer funds directly or pay for a government-backed loss-insurance program that cost rivals Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u00a32.5 billion each in fees.Barclays\u2019s fundraising was controversial because it diluted existing shareholders without allowing them normal pre-emption rights. A complicated structure made it costly, too, but then so was the alternative.The fraud charges relate to side deals with the Qatari investors, including two advisory-services agreements that cost Barclays \u00a3322 million in fees, which Barclays didn\u2019t initially disclose. The charge of unlawful financial assistance says that Barclays in effect lent the Qataris $3 billion of the money they invested in Barclays. That would mean the bank bailed itself out, playing games with the rules and ultimately undermining its improved capital.Barclays will wait for further details of the charges before responding. Lawyers for Mr. Jenkins said he would contest the charges; a law firm representing Mr. Varley said it couldn\u2019t immediately comment. If guilty, they could face significant jail terms and fines, while the bank could face significant fines.             Rolls-Royce,       the U.K. aerospace company, paid \u00a3670 million in fines and penalties in the U.K., U.S. and Brazil this year after a deferred prosecution agreement related to bribery and corruption charges.In U.K. courts, judges calculate fines based on the harm done to the victims, the behavior of the company in the investigation and things such as its contribution to the economy.

However, a plea could strengthen related civil cases, such as the \u00a31 billion suit bought by a private-equity group, PCP Capital Partners, linked to the deals.Barclays has shown the will to fight cases it thinks are unfair, such as its continuing battle with the U.S. Justice Department over mortgage bonds. In that case, the proposed settlement was $5 billion.The ultimate costs of a plea deal in the Qatar case and any related suits are hard to gauge and likely to take years to emerge. Barclays isn\u2019t making fresh provisions and investors barely reacted.

Accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Mr. Warmbier died Monday, six days after being flown back to the U.S. in a coma.His death sparked outrage in Washington and appeared to strengthen efforts to bar U.S. citizens from traveling to the reclusive state.\u201cThe way his detention was handled was appalling, and a tragedy like this must never be repeated,\u201d Young Pioneer Tours said in a statement posted on its website Tuesday. \u201cConsidering these facts and this tragic outcome, we will no longer be organizing tours for U.S. citizens to North Korea.\u201dYoung Pioneer arranges \u201cbudget travel to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from,\u201d according to its website, which promotes tours to Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea and Turkmenistan, among other places.Koryo Tours, a U.K.-registered travel agency based in Beijing that is the largest and longest-running Western operator of North Korea tours, said it was reviewing the issue of U.S. citizens traveling to the country.In a statement, the company said it was discussing the matter with its Korean travel partners and foreign organizations in Pyongyang. Simon Cockerell, Koryo\u2019s general manager, declined to comment further.Uri Tours, which bills itself as the largest U.S. provider of North Korea travel, organized a tour for Matthew Miller, an American who was sentenced to six years of forced labor in 2014 before being freed later that year. The tour operator said Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case was a \u201cheart-wrenching tragedy that should have been avoided.\u201dThe company, based in Kearny, N.J., said it was reviewing its position on travel to North Korea for U.S. citizens, but declined to elaborate.Some 5,000 Westerners visit North Korea as tourists each year, including about 1,000 Americans, according to Mr. Cockerell.Among North Korea tour operators, Young Pioneer stood out for its freewheeling style that emphasized what it called its \u201cfun way of doing things\u201d in forbidding places.Tourists who have joined Young Pioneer\u2019s tours to North Korea describe a heavy emphasis on drinking and carousing that stretched into the early hours.For several years, Young Pioneer has promoted \u201cultra-budget\u201d St. Patrick\u2019s Day tours to Pyongyang that include a pub-crawl.\u201cTo help celebrate this festive Irish day we will be performing Pyongyang\u2019s annual international pub crawl!\u201d read one promotional pitch. \u201cSo put on your greens and come join us as we challenge the [North] Koreans to a bunch of friendly drinking games!\u201dAdam Pitt, \u200ba British national who joined a Young Pioneer tour to North Korea in 2013, described the tour agency as being complacent about the risks. He said that while he doesn\u2019t drink, the late-night revelry often bled into the next day\u2019s activities.\u200bTroy Collings, a director of Young Pioneer, said that while \u201ceveryone has different perceptions on things like drinking,\u201d the company works \u201cextremely hard to brief our customers and to ensure their safety during their tours.\u201dAt least three Americans are known to be currently detained in the reclusive nation, though none of them entered as tourists.Tensions between the U.S. and North Korea have risen dramatically in recent years as Pyongyang has sought to advance its nuclear-weapons and missile programs, prompting ramped-up international sanctions against the regime.The State Department strongly advises U.S. citizens not to travel to North Korea and warns that those there are at serious risk of arrest and long-term detention.In Washington, anger at Mr. Warmbier\u2019s treatment appeared to stiffen resolve to enact a ban on travel to North Korea.Rep. Joe Wilson (R., S.C.), a co-sponsor of proposed legislation to ban U.S. citizens\u2019 travel to North Korea, said in an interview Tuesday that Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case underscored the urgency. A travel ban would prevent future incidents and deprive Pyongyang of a modest but relatively reliable flow of funds, he said.\u201cEvery penny is used to subjugate the people of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.While the bill hasn\u2019t made progress in the House since its introduction last month, Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he strongly supported the legislation.\u201cWe will be moving as quickly as we can,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       told lawmakers last week that the State Department was considering a ban but hadn\u2019t yet made a final decision.Corrections & Amplifications   Adam Pitt, who joined a Young Pioneer Tours group trip to Pyongyang in 2013, is British.

YAL -11.25%       made in January, in part because it expects to complete the deal faster than one with Glencore.The British-Australian mining giant is trying to shed much of its coal operations, especially thermal coal, the type burned to make electricity.The sale includes Rio\u2019s giant coal operation in Australia\u2019s Hunter Valley, Coal & Allied Industries Ltd., which Rio has been trying to unload for years. Glencore\u2019s surprise counteroffer two weeks ago, set to expire next Monday, briefly threw Rio\u2019s plans into turmoil. Glencore Chief Executive       Ivan Glasenberg       has long coveted the Australian coal assets, which sit aside large Glencore coal operations.A Glencore spokesman said the company is reviewing the announcement and \u201cwill respond in due course.\u201dFollowing Glencore\u2019s bid, Yancoal revised its offer to make its $2.45 billion payment upfront, rather than in a series of installments. The company is a subsidiary of Chinese coal giant,             Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.\u201cWe believe Yancoal\u2019s offer to purchase our thermal coal assets...offers the best value and greater transaction certainty for shareholders,\u201d Rio Tinto Chief Executive       Jean-Sebastien Jacques       said.The bidding contest highlights renewed interest in thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity. Thermal coal prices plunged in 2015 followed by a sharp rally last year amid signs of solid demand in China. Thermal coal prices have softened this year, and analysts expect demand to remain subdued as countries switch to cleaner burning fuels.Glencore, the world\u2019s biggest trader of thermal coal, expects demand for the fossil fuel to remain solid in Southeast Asia, since thermal coal is one of the cheapest fuels for electricity generation.Mr. Jacques said Yancoal\u2019s revised offer also is more attractive because it can meet the timeline set for the transaction and is more likely to get regulatory approval, including from the Chinese government. Although the Rio Tinto assets are in Australia, China is a major coal consuming country and its regulators often insert themselves into mining deals.Under U.K. and Australian listing rules, the transaction with Yancoal requires the approval of Rio Tinto shareholders. London-listed Rio Tinto PLC has called a general meeting for June 27 to vote on the deal and Rio Tinto Ltd. in Australia for June 29.The transaction with Yancoal is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.Write to Razak Musah Baba at Razak.Baba@wsj.com and Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 08:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rio-tinto-rejects-glencores-2-5-billion-offer-in-favor-of-yancoal-1497960371", "news_title": "Rio Tinto Rejects Glencore\u2019s $2.5 Billion Offer in Favor of Yancoal", "keywords": " australian coal, coal industry,rio tinto glencore deal, thermal coal,Rio Tinto,Glencore,GLEN.LN,GLEN.U.K.,RIO,Yancoal Australia,YAL.AU,AU:YAL,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,coal mining,coal mining support activities,metal ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "Deadly attacks on confidential informants are prompting the federal courts to consider injecting more secrecy into the judicial system, drawing the concern of defense lawyers about due-process rights.Across the country, close to 700 witnesses and informants believed to have cooperated with the government have been threatened, wounded or killed over a recent three-year period, including 61 murdered, according to estimates from a recent survey by the federal judiciary\u2019s research arm. Some judges suspect those numbers may be low.The justice system has long been dependent upon tips, recordings and other information from suspected criminals to catch bigger fish in investigations into gangs and drug traffickers. Those who offer substantial assistance to an investigation or prosecution can get more than a third of their prison sentences cut.But inmates determined to unmask a \u201csnitch\u201d are getting more sophisticated, diving deep into court dockets and decoding sentencing motions filed by prosecutors for clues to who is talking. A proliferation of court records online on PACER\u2014the pay-per-page portal run by the courts-\u2014and smartphones have made it easier for criminal gangs to find files that could expose cooperators, according to judges and lawyers.\u201cAnonymous remote public access to PACER is a source of much of the information that gets into prisons about who is cooperating,\u201d U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of Manhattan told the Judicial Conference\u2019s criminal rules committee in April, citing anecdotal and other evidence.Federal inmates are restricted from accessing PACER themselves, but it is easy for them to ask people outside the prison to search the online system and report the information back into the prison by phone, according to judges.Inmates also can ask courts for copies of their own sentencing files, and they often are pressured by other inmates to request the documents\u2014known as paperwork\u2014to prove they kept quiet, the judiciary survey found.In some prisons, according to judges, inmates are forcing other inmates to post the paperwork in their cells so others can come by and read them. At the moment, only the most confidential case files are treated as prison contraband, but inmates have been permitted to possess copies of other types of sensitive documents, such as sentencing minutes and plea agreements.A recent New York federal prosecution of two members of the Eight Trey Crips gang accused of murdering an informant show gang members using social media to enforce silence.One of the men convicted last fall, Maliek \u201cSquinge\u201d Ramsey, had tweeted that he was a \u201ccertified rat killer\u201d several years after he allegedly ordered the killing of a fellow gang member who supplied information that helped convict a gang leader of a gun charge.Gang members grew suspicious about the victim after a prison guard shared paperwork with an inmate suggesting he was cooperating with law enforcement, according to court documents. He was shot a day after a sentencing hearing for gang leader Larry Pagett who \u201cstated the full name of the cooperator\u2014\u201dNash Johnson\u201d\u2014in open court and later that night in a telephone call made sure that his sister had also heard the name,\u201d prosecutors stated in a filing.The security fears have prompted the federal judiciary to come up with new rules for sealing and sharing evidence.One approach is to mask cooperation by changing how dockets are publicly displayed, aiming to make the two types of dockets\u2014ones in which a defendant is a cooperator and ones in which he is not\u2014less distinguishable to outside eyes. The courts also are considering whether to conceal whether a defendant got a reduced sentenced by sealing certain motions filed by prosecutors making formal requests for sentence reductions.The reliability of informants has long been a point of contention between prosecutors and defense teams. Some lawyers say new layers of secrecy could make it harder to exonerate their clients.\u201cIt hamstrings the defense not being able to understand who the witnesses are against the defendant and what their motivations are,\u201d said defense lawyer Barry Pollack, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\u00a0He said to make effective sentencing recommendations for convicted clients, lawyers need to be able to compare their case to similarly charged defendants. Concealing cooperation from case files hinders such comparisons, he said.Judges say they are mindful that a sweeping sealing policy risks running into the First Amendment and its presumption of open courts. They also acknowledge that there is only so much that can be done through stricter court policies. Prosecutors often must reveal the identity of informants and give a defendant an opportunity to cross-examine them in court when the information or testimony could be important to the defense.The court system is alarmed enough to consider preventing the general public from accessing criminal court dockets remotely online.At the criminal rules committee in April, a judge said he was stunned by the estimates of the level of violence against cooperating defendants, according to the minutes. \u201cWhile this is not Colombia, it is really, really, bad,\u201d the judge said.Prison policies may need to change too, say judges who are urging federal prison officials to do more to segregate vulnerable cooperators from other inmates. \u201cThe problem is not cooperators hurting each other, it is housing them together with noncooperators,\u201d stated the minutes of the meeting.The Federal Bureau of Prisons is \u201cstarting to create some institutions where there is a higher level of protection, not exclusively cooperators, but for people who need more protection from whatever reason,\u201d according to the minutes.A bureau spokeswoman said the agency is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that all BOP facilities are safe and secure for both staff and inmates.\u201dThe challenge of getting a grip on security was underscored in a continuing federal murder racketeering case last year against a powerful prison gang in New Mexico. Under orders to share some evidence with incarcerated defendants, federal prosecutors suggested uploading documents to password protected Samsung tablets that the accused could scroll through in their cells.

It\u2019s too early for official numbers yet, but adland folk have remarked to me that La Croisette feels less crowded and it\u2019s been easier to get tables at hotels that usually leave you fighting for air. This year, the Cannes Lions organizers introduced a rule that requires you to have an official badge or a \u201chotel access pass\u201d to gain entry to the most popular destinations, which could have put some people off visiting the usual hangouts. Still, anyone seeing the snaking queue after turning up (fashionably!) late, like I did, to Oath\u2019s party last night featuring a guest performance from Stevie Nicks, would probably feel it\u2019s the same as it ever was.Google-owned YouTube has now seen many advertisers return to advertise on the site after its brand safety debacle, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jack Nicas and I reported. Some big-name advertisers still remain on the sidelines, however, having pulled their spend after their ads were found next to unsavory content. Some of those marketers want more assurances that there won\u2019t be more mistakes, and others are pushing YouTube for compensation for the public-relations damage caused by having their brands linked with funding extremism (albeit inadvertently) in news articles. Google did issue some small refunds, reflecting that few people were actually shown the ads next to unsuitable content. And there was another group of advertisers that never left at all.--Was this grandstanding?--A key data point from the piece, courtesy of research firm Advertiser Perceptions: Despite the blip, 38.5% of 316 marketers polled in the U.S. in May said they plan to spend \u201ca good deal more\u201d with YouTube this year than last and 41.2% said there would be no change in their spending. Then again, some data reported in our piece shows that spending on YouTube pre-roll and display ads is down. We\u2019ll wait for the quarterly report to see what\u2019s real. One thing\u2019s certain: a lot of marketers are paying more attention to where their ads appear on YouTube and the wider web.Shane Smith landed in Cannes with a bang. Vice Media, the digital media darling he helms, scored a $450 million investment from private equity firm TPG, valuing the company at a whopping $5.7 billion, WSJ\u2019s Lukas Alpert and Shalini Ramachandran first reported. What\u2019s just as notable as that eye-watering valuation is that Disney, which has injected $400 million into Vice and owns an 18% stake, isn\u2019t participating in the round. Disney remains committed to Vice, sources told our reporters, but it also has plenty to deal with over at cord-cutting-nicked ESPN. Among other things, Vice will be using the money to invest in scripted programming for its Viceland cable channel, which is averaging just 96,000 viewers in U.S. prime-time since September.State Street\u2019s \u201cFearless Girl\u201d campaign, in which the investment fund erected a statue of a defiant girl staring down Wall Street\u2019s famous bull, bagged three Grand Prix awards last night in Cannes for the Public Relations, Outdoor and Glass Lion categories. As Suzanne Vranica reported for the Journal\u2019s \u201cAd Maze\u201d special section, that simple statue, which surreptitiously appeared on the eve of International Women\u2019s Day, was a viral sensation that people \u201cquickly embraced as a symbol of female empowerment and gender equality.\u201d But brand purpose is often a slither of a tightrope for marketers to walk and consumers are quick to air their disappointment when campaigns fail to hit the mark. CMO Today\u2019s Jack Marshall explored how the backlash against missteps by advertisers is intensifying.Snap\u2019s executives will have more to chat about with marketers at Cannes this year than that whopping ferris wheel. Snapchat\u2019s parent company has scored a two-year, $100 million deal with Time Warner, which will see its Turner cable channels and the Warner Bros. studio create up to 10 original shows per year for the app, WSJ reports. Snap is going to keep half of the ad revenue from the forthcoming shows -- as it will with other media companies running exclusive content on the app. Time Warner has also made an advertising commitment, presumably to promote its TV shows and movies on Snapchat as part of the deal. The tie-up offers Snap more of the TV-like content it needs to attract TV-like ad dollars and it should provide Wall Street with some assurances its ad business has long-term growth prospects. Snap\u2019s share price closed up about 2% on Monday.From CMO Today\u2019s Alex Bruell: \u201cMonday #cannes\u201dThe WSJ\u2019s \u201cAd Maze\u201d special package is out in print today and is being distributed around Cannes (if you\u2019re not here, it\u2019s in the global paper too.)

The government has declined to comment on the status of Mr. Wu, who can\u2019t be reached. According to people familiar with the matter, he has been detained.Last week, Beijing-based Anbang said Mr. Wu was temporarily unable to perform his duties. The company has said it is operating smoothly; a spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Huang\u2019s remarks Tuesday.Anbang epitomized a recent rapid expansion by a group of private Chinese insurers, which have marketed newfangled products to younger customers through smartphone apps and become investment powerhouses. Anbang made takeover plays on local stock exchanges and splurged on overseas real estate like the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York.This year, some of China\u2019s more aggressive insurance companies including Anbang have faced major setbacks, including new regulatory crimps on their business amid worry that the fast growth, instead of mitigating risk, was adding peril to the financial business.In the months before Mr. Wu\u2019s vanishing, Mr. Huang\u2019s former boss at the Insurance Regulatory Commission was detained by antigraft investigators and the head of one firm was banned from the industry.Mr. Huang said that since authorities permitted insurers to explore new sales channels, some firms have \u201crushed for profits\u201d and lied about capital sources, launched poorly designed products and failed to balance assets and liabilities. He named no culprits.He was speaking at Lujiazui Forum, Shanghai\u2019s premier financial conference where the cautious theme this year was \u201cFinancial Reform and Steady Development from a Global Perspective.\u201d Insurers appeared ascendant at the event last year with a special discussion on new risk-management techniques and a keynote from the since-fired regulator, Xiang Junbo.This year, concerns about the industry direction were palpable. On one panel, Zhang Yuanhan, chief actuary of government-controlled China Pacific Insurance Group, criticized the \u201cmanagement model\u201d of insurers he didn\u2019t name, saying some of their products have \u201cundermined the interests and rights of people.\u201dShort of a firm failure, a risk for the sector is that recent trends could sour China\u2019s public on insurance.       Scott Russell,        an insurance analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong who is critical of Anbang\u2019s business model, described that potential reputation risk as \u201ccontagion from the irrational space to the rational space.\u201dMr. Huang described the industry as critical to a well-functioning economy. He said that given the broad needs for insurance in society, China\u2019s industry remains too small\u20146% of financial-sector assets, compared with 90% for banks. But he said expansion has to be paired with risk control. \u201cChina needs a more robust insurance sector,\u201d he said.Since an insurer opened in Guangzhou in 1805, he said, the industry has set a direction for the Chinese economy and will continue to fill increasingly complex needs like mitigating risk in agriculture, health, pensions and President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       go-global investment initiative One Belt, One Road.\u201cThe history of the insurance sector is a history of problem solving,\u201d Mr. Huang said.Write to James T.

PRXL 0.05%       for $4.6 billion, the latest in a series of mergers among drug-research firms.Pamplona is set to pay $88.10 a share in cash as part of the deal, the companies said Tuesday in a statement, confirming an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal. Parexel shares closed at $83.92 Monday, giving the company a market value of more than $4.2 billion.Stock in Parexel has risen sharply since the Journal reported in early May that the Waltham, Mass., company was exploring a sale. The price represents a 27.9% premium to where Parexel closed on May 5, the last trading day prior to the Journal report.Shares in Parexel, which helps drug companies conduct clinical research, rose 3.7% to $87.06 in recent premarket trading.Pamplona beat out rivals including             Laboratory Corp. of America        LH 1.11%       and             Icon        ICLR 1.46%       PLC with a late surge in what turned out to be a spirited auction with multiple bidding rounds, the people said. Pamplona\u2019s offer was higher than Icon\u2019s and LabCorp\u2019s, which both included cash and stock, some of the people said.Parexel\u2019s advisers initially only invited private-equity firms to make offers, but they later opened the bidding to industry players as well, some of the people said. There were at least four bidders for the company throughout the process, the people said.Parexel has offices in 51 countries and recently had some 19,400 employees. It notched $605 million in revenue in the March quarter.Pamplona is a private-equity firm with headquarters in London and New York. Since its inception in 2005, it has raised five funds with over \u20ac7 billion ($7.8 billion) of capital commitments, according to its website, and has been an active acquirer of health-care-services companies.There has been a flurry of merger activity in that area.Drug-research firm Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC was recapitalized by its private-equity owners, Hellman & Friedman LLC and             Carlyle Group                   LP, who also brought new investors into the company\u2014a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and an affiliate of GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund. In May, private-equity firm New Mountain Capital LLC agreed to buy laboratory-supply distributor             VWR Corp.       for nearly $5 billion.Icon came close to winning the auction, the people said.The acquisitive company is based in Dublin\u2014where it was founded in 1990\u2014and specializes in product development for drug and medical-device clients. It operates in 87 locations in 38 countries and has about 12,300 employees.

Others have claimed that they had to shut in wells due to the damage.\u00a0A few cases have ended up in court.While newer wells damaging older ones is a longstanding problem, the issue is gaining attention as shale companies employ new technologies to drill wells horizontally.Almont Energy LLC\u00a0and TLS Oil & Gas Inc.,\u00a0vertical-well\u00a0operators\u00a0in Oklahoma, sued Newfield last year, claiming that fracking jobs performed by Newfield caused an Almont well to flood with water, \u201cnegatively impacting the further development potential\u201d of the well.A lawyer for Almont\u00a0and TLS\u00a0declined to discuss the case, which was filed in federal court.\u00a0Newfield also declined to discuss the case, but spokeswoman Cindy Hassler said the company tries to be proactive when it learns of possible frack hits and works to negotiate compensation with anyone affected if an inspection shows damage.\u201cNewfield owns thousands of vertical wells ourselves, so we understand the challenges,\u201d Ms. Hassler said.Chesapeake and Devon,\u00a0who have also been blamed for frack hits in reports to state regulators, declined\u00a0to\u00a0comment.James West, an analyst with Evercore ISI who has been following frack hits, said they are of special concern in places like Oklahoma and Texas, where those drilling new wells must navigate around older wells drilled over decades.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a pretty sizable issue,\u201d\u00a0Mr. West said,\u00a0noting that Colorado in 2013 enacted regulations after state engineers had identified frack hits as a potential problem. \u201cI suspect every basin is probably facing the same type of challenge.\u201dIn Oklahoma, companies aren\u2019t required to report frack hits unless there is a spill.\u00a0Regulators there have received fewer than 20 confirmed reports of such incidents in the last three years and are currently reviewing several more.\u201cI know that it\u2019s a larger problem than the data we\u2019ve been given,\u201d said Tim Baker,\u00a0director of\u00a0the oil and gas division at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.Oklahoma last month passed a bill that eases restrictions on where producers can drill horizontal wells more than a mile long. Vertical-well operators now worry their wells are more vulnerable than before.Joe Warren, a partner with Brown & Borelli\u00a0Inc., a small oil-and-gas\u00a0producer, said\u00a0roughly two dozen of the company\u2019s wells have been damaged by frack hits.\u00a0He believes the problem is particularly acute\u00a0in Oklahoma\u2019s Stack,\u00a0currently one of the hottest oil regions in the U.S. The Stack has many vertical wells and is now also popular with horizontal drillers.\u201cMost of the large players in the Stack have hit one or more of our wells,\u201d he said.Chad Warmington, president of the Oklahoma Oil & Gas Association, questioned claims that hundreds of wells have been damaged. In some cases, he and others argue, frack hits can actually boost production from an affected well.But given the potential for damage, the association supports making reporting frack hits mandatory, Mr. Warmington said, and would be open to having a mediation or arbitration process put in place.Some experts expect the situation will only get worse.\u201cWe\u2019ve got bigger fracks, so more chance of them reaching across, well-to-well,\u201d said Jennifer Miskimins, an associate professor of petroleum engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. \u201cAs we get closer and closer spacing, I think we\u2019re going to see the occurrence go up.\u201dWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/traditional-oil-drillers-are-getting-hit-in-oklahomaliterally-1497956402", "news_title": "Frackers Collide With Traditional Oil Drillers", "keywords": "brent,frack hit,fracking,hydraulic fracturing,nymex,oil prices,shale gas,shale oil,Chesapeake Energy,CHK,Devon Energy,DVN,Newfield Exploration,NFX,corporate crime,legal action,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,natural reserves,resources discovery,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,advertising,marketing,public relations,basic materials,resources,business,consumer services,natural gas,oil exploration,oil extraction,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "Good morning,The Obamacare battle may reach its climax next week as Senate GOP leaders have set a timeline to vote then on legislation to repeal large chunks of the Affordable Care Act. As yet, they still don\u2019t appear to have secured enough support to pass it. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is intent on keeping pressure on Senate Republicans to move quickly, lawmakers and GOP aides said. The push for a vote before the weeklong July 4 recess could backfire, however, as some conservative and centrist Republicans have expressed concern about the emerging shape of the legislation. Mr. McConnell could pull back if he calculates that a little extra time could get him the votes needed to cross the finish line. Still, he has reasons to try for a quick vote: The pressure could force lawmakers to reach a consensus, and GOP leaders in both chambers want to move on to other legislative items.Otto Warmbier, the American college student imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year before returning home last week with a severe brain injury, died Monday, adding to pressure for more-strenuous action against Pyongyang. The U.S. has few new options but officials have said it could turn to so-called secondary sanctions, which would target companies that do business with North Korea, in a no-holds-barred effort to economically isolate the country. Washington has often warned it could take such steps, but has held back in the face of Chinese opposition. Another last-resort move would be to bar travel by Americans to North Korea. The death of the 22-year-old Mr. Warmbier came as top U.S. and Chinese officials prepared to meet in Washington on Wednesday to discuss security and diplomatic matters.Holiday shopping is about to get more expensive. UPS plans to charge retailers extra fees to deliver packages during the busiest weeks before Christmas, another challenge for an industry coping with a shift away from traditional stores. The surcharges are a shot across the bow for retailers, including giants such as Wal-Mart and Macy\u2019s that have been ramping up e-commerce operations in an effort to offset declining foot traffic to shopping centers. The extra fees also add to the costs of Amazon and other online players, which rely on UPS and rival FedEx to handle a surge in holiday shipments. Retailers will have to decide whether to increase their shipping charges, raise the prices of goods or eat the extra costs themselves.Creative folks from the worlds of advertising, media and marketing like to consider themselves as sharp as anyone in identifying and reacting to social, economic and cultural change. They are, after all, in some ways the diviners and even originators of consumer tastes, moods and attitudes. But lately the dizzying pace of change has caught even our data-heavy, tech-savvy media tribunes off guard. For the media crowd gathered at the Cannes Lions advertising festival this week, these disruptive discoveries have created new sets of challenges. Marketers are seeking to understand better the audiences they reach; advertisers are becoming increasingly nervous about where their material appears; media companies are dealing with all these challenges and the continuing migration of ad dollars to the digital field.

UPS 1.04%       is adding a surcharge onto most online orders around the Black Friday weekend and the week before Christmas, the latest move by package carriers to recoup the big investments they make in peak-season deliveries and the higher costs that come with e-commerce business. The surcharge is a first for UPS, and the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro writes that it\u2019s among the growing add-on charges that have retailers facing the prospect of either eating the higher costs or passing them along by raising prices. The explosion in online shopping has created a kind of tug-of-war between parcel carriers and retailers over the thinner margins and added complications of delivering goods to homes. The new UPS charges will apply only to the busiest shopping days, and only to residential deliveries. That may push retailers to scale up strategies like in-store pickups of online purchases, something it appears UPS would also like to see.Blue Apron Holdings Inc. is pushing forward an initial public offering just as food delivery is getting big new attention, but it\u2019s unclear whether that will help the startup. The WSJ\u2019s Ezequiel Minaya reports the company is at the center of a growing meal-kit delivery business that is carving into sales of traditional grocery stores as consumer change their food-buying habits. With shares expected to price between $15 and $17, Blue Apron is going public just as             Amazon.com Inc.       is plunging into the grocery business, raising big new questions both for legacy supermarkets and startups. Amazon\u2019s entry could change the game for companies like Blue Apron and Instacart that have used new technology and refined logistics to pioneer new paths for food delivery. Blue Apron has gained nearly $800 million in annual revenue so far, but the debt and losses also are growing, and well-funded competition from Amazon could make profits even harder to deliver.Amazon\u2019s surprise deal to buy             Whole Foods Market Inc.       could speed up efforts to bring more digital tools like data analytics to supply chains.             Gartner Inc.       chief forecaster John Lovelock tells the WSJ\u2019s Angus Loten the \u201cnotoriously short shelf life\u201d of food may push Amazon to put its technology to work across Whole Foods\u2019 distribution channels, from warehousing to deliveries and other logistics areas. That will give Amazon another area to test its ability to tie analytics to more sophisticated, data-driven marketing strategies. Many big grocers already are implementing new tools to more closely align inventory management and marketing.             Kroger Co.       has started using cameras and infrared sensors to track foot traffic in its stores, and the company is testing sensor-laden interactive shelves that can detect shoppers in the aisles via their smartphones and provide personalized pricing and product suggestions as they shop.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       is trying to get U.S. entrepreneurs to help flip the script on U.S. trade with China. In a two-day event in Detroit, Alibaba chairman Jack Ma is offering an expected 3,000 U.S. small-business owners tips on how to market and ship wares to Chinese consumers. It\u2019s part of an increasingly urgent competition between Alibaba and Chinese rivalJD.com                   to tap into the U.S. market, the WSJ\u2019s Liza Lin and Laura Stevens report, and to corral customers that are starting to move away from the big sites and toward niche e-commerce providers. To do that, Alibaba will have to convince sellers it\u2019s conquered its problem with counterfeits. The U.S. last year reinstated Alibaba\u2019s Taobao site to a list of \u201cnotorious\u201d marketplaces for fakes, and some U.S. exporters say they\u2019ve lost business to cheaper, Chinese-made knockoffs. Still, American sellers will be tempted by China\u2019s $771 billion online retailing market, which is larger than the U.S. market.\u2018The real objective for the surcharge is to motivate shippers to do their part in avoiding such volume increases.\u2019Year-over-year Increase in grain shipments on U.S. railroads in may, according to the Association of American Railroads.U.S. new-home construction fell 5.5 % in May, the third straight monthly decline.

Mark Carney on Tuesday said that while rate setters\u2019 tolerance for above-target inflation is coming to an end, it is too early to raise the key interest rate for the first time in a decade.In a rescheduled speech to bankers at Mansion House in London,       Mr. Carney       said weak wage growth raised questions about the strength of domestic inflationary pressures, and he was unsure how the economy would respond to talks between the U.K. government and the rest of European Union on the terms of their separation.\u201cFrom my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,\u201d he said.After Mr. Carney\u2019s comments the pound fell 0.5% to $1.2674.The pound\u2019s depreciation since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU has pushed up import prices and inflation. At its meeting earlier this month, the BOE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave the key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25%.However, three members dissented in favor of raising the Bank rate, the largest vote for such a move since the central bank last tightened policy in July 2007.\u201cDifferent members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank rate increase,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cBut all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace.\u201dMr. Carney voted to leave the rate unchanged, but his comments suggest he views an increase as inevitable, although possibly some months away.\u201cArguing to wait and see how the economy will react to the Brexit negotiations\u2014which have only just begun and will last at least two years\u2014suggests that Carney may be prepared to delay raising rates for a long time,\u201d said       Allan Monks,        an economist at             J.P. Morgan.Mr. Carney had been scheduled to deliver his speech Thursday, but the event was postponed as a show of respect to those who died or were left homeless in the Grenfell Tower fire.That tragedy came amid a series of four terror attacks in as many months, and just a year after the murder of lawmaker       Jo Cox       led to the rescheduling of Mr. Carney\u2019s previous Mansion House speech.\u201cThe best tribute this city and this country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment\u2014whatever our differences\u2014to promote the common good,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Carney also addressed the problem of large trade imbalances, which he said were now \u201cpolitically as well as economically unsustainable.\u201dHis proposed solution is a drive by the Group of 20 largest economies to allow trade in services to be as free as trade in goods. This, he said, would remove an impediment to economies that are more dependent on services exports\u2014such as the U.S. and U.K.\u2014and allow them to narrow their trade gaps with countries that are more reliant on goods exports, such as Germany and China.\u201cThe G-20 faces a choice\u2014between leveling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or leveling up by liberalizing trade in services,\u201d he said.Mr. Carney estimated that \u201cleveling up\u201d would reduce the \u201cexcess deficits\u201d of the U.S. by one third and the U.K. by one half.Speaking before Mr. Carney at the Mansion House event, U.K. Treasury chief       Philip Hammond       echoed those sentiments.\u201cFor the U.K. to be able to share fairly in the benefits of globalization, we need to lead a global crusade for liberalization of services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we must employ that logic in our Brexit negotiations, to agree a bold and ambitious free-trade agreement with our EU counterparts that covers both goods and services.\u201dThe central banker identified the treatment of financial services in the Brexit talks, which started Monday, as an opportunity to put this new approach to trade into operation.He also warned against fragmenting Europe\u2019s clearing market, responding to a plan proposed by the EU\u2019s executive arm last week that would subject clearinghouses operating outside the bloc to tougher oversight, including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.\u201cFragmentation is in no one\u2019s economic interest,\u201d he said. \u201cNor is it necessary for financial stability.

Memories linger of China\u2019s 2015 stock-market crash, during which more than 1,000 companies suspending trading in their shares.Some investors have now set aside their qualms. BlackRock, MSCI\u2019s biggest client, said in April for the first time that it supports inclusion. This week, Allianz Global Investors announced its support as well.Others are unconvinced.\u201cWe believe there are still material access and investor protection issues outstanding,\u201d said       Timothy Atwill,        head of investment strategy at Seattle-based             Parametric Portfolio Associates,       a unit of Eaton Vance Corp. that manages $197.8 billion. Mr. Atwill cited the large number of Chinese stocks halted from trading at any given time, representing around 6% to 8% of total market capitalization.\u201cLegal protections for investors are still something based on faith, rather than an established by rule of law,\u201d he said.MSCI\u2019s clout has grown with the global rise of passive investing, whereby investors forgo stock-picking and invest in funds that simply track a benchmark. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI\u2019s indexes came to $524.1 billion as of March 31, up 28% in the previous 12 months, according to a company presentation.Some said MSCI\u2019s reduction in the initial number of Chinese stocks admitted would damp the immediate impact of inclusion. Inflows from exchange-traded funds into domestic Chinese stocks\u2014called A-shares\u2014may come to just $1.6 billion,             AXA Investment Management                   estimates.Nor will it move the foreign-ownership dial much. Overseas investors hold just 1.5% of the Chinese equity market.\u201cThe reaction will be pretty muted,\u201d said       Howard Wang,        \u200eportfolio manager and head of the greater China team at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cMost institutional investors would look at it and yawn.\u201dIf MSCI does decide to include Chinese shares, it intends to gradually increase their weighting from that initial level.Chinese stocks were little changed on Tuesday ahead of the announcement. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%, while the smaller Shenzhen market rose 0.1%.Still, some stocks that would be included in MSCI indexes have rallied sharply in recent weeks.             Kweichow Moutai Co.      , Ltd, which distills a brand of the potent spirit baiju, has gained 20% in the past three months.Some active fund managers say they have already started buying Chinese shares.\u201cIt looks like investors are fairly optimistic about the probability [of inclusion],\u201d said       Kinger Lau,             Goldman Sachs\u2019s       chief China equity strategist.Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have a combined market capitalization of $7.5 trillion.

That has been the recent hot question in China circles, spurred by a deluge of books that handicap the chances.Graham Allison,        the Harvard professor who popularized the term \u201cThucydides Trap\u201d to describe the risk of conflict when a rising power challenges the incumbent, isn\u2019t optimistic.Thucydides, the Athenian historian and general, summarized the causes of the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) in a single line of a monumental history: It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta, he wrote, that made conflict inevitable.War has resulted in 12 out of 16 similar setups over the past 500 years, Mr. Allison asserts, including Germany\u2019s challenge to Britain that led to World War I.In a new book that bears the ominous title \u201cDestined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides\u2019s Trap?\u201d he lays out how conflicts over trade, the South China Sea or cyberspace could all spin out of control.It is \u201cfrighteningly easy to develop scenarios in which American and Chinese soldiers are killing each other,\u201d he writesNonsense, responds the noted Sinologist       Arthur Waldron,        a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania. War is by no means ordained.In a caustic review of Mr. Allison\u2019s book, he declares that the Thucydides Trap is a fallacy. Dig deeper into Thucydides\u2019s text, he argues, and it becomes clear that Sparta, though warlike, tried to head off confrontation with Athens, at one point suggesting a simple compromise.There\u2019s much more here than an academic dispute over classical history.Fundamentally, the two professors disagree in their estimates of China\u2019s rise, and thus the severity of the challenge it represents to the U.S.-led order that has kept the peace since World War II.Mr. Allison focuses on data showing China\u2019s wealth and power soaring ever up.Mr. Waldron dwells on figures that indicate China\u2019s crippling vulnerabilities. He mentions chronic water shortages and energy wastage. Others point to an alarming surge in corporate debt and an aging population that could stall, or even reverse, growth.Those who live in China, rather than observe it from afar, juggle both perspectives daily.Inhale the toxic air in almost any city and it\u2019s clear why wealthy Chinese are fleeing.Yet, testifying to China\u2019s creative energy are the fleets of emerald, blue and fluorescent orange bicycles that have overrun the same cities in a matter of months as multiple startups have jumped into a bike-sharing business powered by smartphone apps.China is choking to death; China is vibrant. Both are true. Washington\u2019s challenge is to make sense of these contradictions, and steer a policy course that avoids the extremes of capitulation and reckless belligerence.The Obama administration was timid; Beijing seized the opportunity to start turning the South China Sea into a Chinese lake.To the extent that the Trump administration has a China policy, it\u2019s on hold due to North Korea.Mr. Trump has suspended the verbal hostilities he unleashed on the campaign trail in hopes that his Chinese counterpart will use his influence to halt Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. If, as seems likely, Mr. Xi can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, deliver a solution this truce could quickly crumble.Influential voices are urging a hard line.       Ely Ratner,        a senior fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, recommended last week the U.S. should consider basing troops on disputed South China Sea islands. Whether the White House takes that inflammatory suggestion, once its disillusion with Beijing\u2019s North Korea efforts sets in, expect renewed bellicosity on issues from trade to Taiwan.There\u2019s little doubt about Chinese intentions. As the journalist Howard French points out in his erudite book \u201cEverything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China\u2019s Push for Global Power,\u201d China aspires to restore its position at the pinnacle of East Asia.The coming decades, he writes, will involve \u201ca certain amount of yielding to China.\u201dHow much will depend on a fine understanding of Chinese capabilities. While China has made giant leaps in military technology\u2014enough to strike U.S. aircraft carriers\u2014it will become progressively harder and more expensive to advance further.In a speech two years ago, Mr. Xi insisted that \u201cthere is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides trap.\u201d But he went on to warn against strategic miscalculations by unnamed \u201cmajor countries\u201d that \u201cmight create such traps.\u201dThe next few years will be perilous: The risks of conflict can\u2019t simply be dismissed. Mr. Waldron, though, is confident that Chinese leaders would quickly smother any unintended conflict rather than escalate and risk their country\u2019s ruin.\u201cThey are, after all, not idiots,\u201d he writes.Write to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Historic \u2018Trap\u2019 Makes Setting Odds of China-U.S. War Tough.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-are-the-odds-of-a-u-s-china-war-1497951724", "news_title": "What Are the Odds of a U.S.-China War?", "keywords": "andy browne column,china's world,china-u.s.,chinese economy,peloponnesian war,south china sea,sparta,taiwan strait,thucydides trap,trade war,u.s.-china"}, {"content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Mexican Finance Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade thinks it unlikely that Mexico will need to make changes in its tax code in the event the U.S. Congress passes corporate tax cuts or other measures sought by U.S. President       Donald Trump.Mr. Meade, a 48-year-old Yale-educated economist, said in an interview Monday that it is too early to say for sure how Mexico would respond to U.S. tax changes, since details of the U.S. plans are still scarce.But he said Mexico, which is now seeking to lower budget deficits after years of spending to support growth, has little room to reduce an already low tax burden. Mexico would only have to consider changes if the U.S. took some innovative action such as enacting a border-adjusted tax\u2014a levy omitted in Mr. Trump\u2019s April tax blueprint.\u201cIf the changes are within parameters already used in existing tax codes, it is unlikely that Mexico or the world would have to react,\u201d Mr. Meade said in his wooden-paneled office in Mexico\u2019s National Palace.The U.S. Congress is expected to address tax reform during the fall session, and the discussions could go on for months. In his tax outline, Mr. Trump seeks to cut the maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 15% and lower individual rates.When Mr. Trump was elected on pledges to renegotiate or pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, many analysts believed Mexico was heading toward a perfect storm. Oil prices remained low, hurting public finances, there were fears foreign investment could dry up and that a blowup over Nafta could hurt Mexican trade. An unpopular 20% jump in local gasoline prices in January announced by Mr. Meade\u2019s ministry prompted widespread protests.But things haven\u2019t turned out that badly. The economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.7% in the first quarter, while the peso has recovered around 22% against the U.S. dollar since February and is trading at its highest level in more than a year amid optimism that Nafta talks can benefit the U.S., Mexico and Canada.Mr. Meade said the peso still has room to appreciate.\u201cThe peso is closer to reflecting Mexico\u2019s economic fundamentals, but not entirely. We still think the peso is competitive at current levels, despite the important correction we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said.Mexico\u2019s government recently raised its growth estimate for this year to 1.5%-2.5%, in line with Mexico\u2019s growth of the last 30 years, and above that of many countries in the region.The improving economy is helping public finances: public debt is expected to fall to 48% of gross domestic product by year-end from 50% last year, and the public sector deficit is seen at 1.4% of GDP this year\u2014the smallest since 2008 and far from the record 4.6% deficit of 2014.Mr. Meade said those figures could be even better as the year advances, as tax revenue is rising more than expected. \u201cMost likely, we\u2019ll have a better performance than what the budget anticipated,\u201d he said.Like his longtime friend       Luis Videgaray,        Mexico\u2019s current foreign minister who preceded Mr. Meade at the Finance Ministry, Mr. Meade combines economist with politician.A discreet, mild-mannered man, Mr. Meade got his first government position in 1997 as a midlevel official with Mexico\u2019s pension fund regulator. He rose through the ranks as an efficient and honest bureaucrat until becoming a cabinet minister for the first time in 2011 under former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto kept him in the cabinet when taking office in 2012.He has headed the ministries of energy, finance, foreign relations and social development, and many think Mr. Meade would be an ideal candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in next year\u2019s presidential election. He is also cited as a possible replacement for Bank of Mexico Gov. Agust\u00edn Carstens, who is leaving the central bank to head the Bank for International Settlements.In the interview, Mr. Meade didn\u2019t deny his ambitions but said it was too early to talk about those issues. The central bank appointment and choice of a ruling party candidate are expected to be determined between September and December.\u201cIn politics, a year is an eternity and cards are reshuffled every day,\u201d Mr. Meade said.Write to Juan Montes at juan.montes@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-unlikely-needs-to-react-to-u-s-tax-overhaul-finance-minister-says-1497951181", "news_title": "Mexico\u2019s Finance Minister: Unlikely to React to U.S. Tax Overhaul", "keywords": "border adjustment,budget,deficit,finance minister,gdp,nafta,overhaul,reform,tax code,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "Voters go to the polls Tuesday in the nationally watched U.S. House special election in Georgia to choose between Democrat       Jon Ossoff       and Republican       Karen Handel,        in a race viewed as the most significant proxy war between the parties since President       Donald Trump       took office.A special election is also being held in South Carolina. Polls in each state are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET.These special elections are being held to pick replacements for two House Republicans President Donald Trump picked for his cabinet\u2014      Tom Price       of Georgia, who is now health and human services secretary, and       Mick Mulvaney       of South Carolina, now the budget director.Here are five things that are important about these contests.Fear of FailureBoth parties have a lot to lose in Georgia after a record $60 million has been poured into this race. It will be embarrassing for Republicans to lose a seat their party has held for almost four decades, and will suggest the Trump presidency is taking a political toll on his party. On the other side, Democrats will be sorely disappointed if they don\u2019t win because, after coming close but losing in House special elections in Montana and Kansas, they are now hungry for a victory.Shaping the 2018 FieldThe outcome could shape the candidate field for the 2018 midterm elections. If Republicans lose the Georgia seat, it will send a message to incumbent Republicans in similar suburban districts that they may have a tougher-than-usual fight on their hands. The result could be a wave of GOP retirements. A Democratic win could add new fuel to the fired-up wave of candidates who have stepped forward to run for Congress. A Democratic loss could dampen that enthusiasm to run.Trump, the Missing PresidentNeither Mr. Ossoff nor Ms. Handel was keen on invoking the president\u2014even though he raised money for the Republican and urged readers of his Twitter feed to vote for her. Mr. Ossoff needs a sizable chunk of the district\u2019s GOP voters to back him, and turning the election into a partisan contest risks invoking Republicans\u2019 party loyalties. Ms. Handel is well aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval ratings and hasn\u2019t been interested in reminding the few undecided voters left that she shares a party with the president.Testing a Centrist Democratic MessageIf Mr. Ossoff wins, it will be on a centrist message: He isn\u2019t running on a       Bernie Sanders      -style progressive agenda of raising taxes on the rich or creating a single payer health-care system. Instead he is calling for cutting government spending and bipartisan cooperation. The party\u2019s left wing has been rallying behind him to win the conservative-leaning seat but may blame that centrist tilt if he doesn\u2019t win.Watching Turnout of African-AmericansIn South Carolina, Democrats don\u2019t expect       Archie Parnell       to defeat Republican       Ralph Norman,        but they are hoping to learn important lessons about what motivates African-American turnout in the Trump era. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is conducting a series of tests to determine what anti-Trump messages work best to motivate black voters to vote for Democratic candidates ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Reid J.

AMZN 0.24%       spent two decades hastening the demise of the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry. So why would the tech giant spend $13.7 billion to acquire an organic-grocery chain with more than 460 stores?The deal for             Whole Foods Market Inc.,             which people familiar with the matter said came together quickly, presents Amazon with several potential gains. It could use the stores as distribution hubs to build out its online grocery-delivery business. Amazon also could stock gadgets such as its Kindle e-readers and Echo speakers, as well as goods from its burgeoning private label.The bigger opportunity, though, is data.Amazon for years has been looking for more ways to gather information about how consumers shop. It has long been rumored to be on the prowl for a breakthrough deal, even as it set up its own much smaller Amazon Go and AmazonFresh Pickup stores as experiments.If the deal goes through, the combination likely will be powerful. Amazon and Whole Foods can join their online and in-store knowledge to better predict what goods to carry in each store, said James Thomson, a former senior manager in business development at Amazon and now partner at the brand consultancy Buy Box Experts.\u201cThey\u2019ll build better private labels and squeeze national brands even more,\u201d Mr. Thomson said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of opportunity to experiment.\u201dThe deal came together so rapidly\u2014the companies signed a confidentiality agreement April 27\u2014that Amazon\u2019s strategy for the acquisition is still largely in the air, according to people familiar with the matter.Amazon shed little light on its plans for the chain of stores when it announced the deal Friday. A spokesman declined to comment on the company\u2019s strategy. Whole Foods also declined to comment.One enticing aspect of a deal between Amazon and Whole Foods is the significant overlap, analysts say, between the companies\u2019 traditionally loyal customer bases.A Morgan Stanley survey shows about 62% of Whole Foods shoppers are members of Amazon\u2019s Prime service, opening the door for cross-sell promotions to entice customers who shop at both to spend more.Amazon, though, doesn\u2019t know how those customers shop in stores\u2014a gaping hole in data about its more than 300 million shoppers.If the deal goes through, Amazon is likely to put a team of employees to work examining Whole Foods\u2019 strategy, cost structures and business practices\u2014as well as their data, according to former Amazon employees.The online retail giant likely will add new ways to track in-store consumer spending. One option is letting people purchase with Amazon Pay, a         PayPal              -type solution that lets customers check out with their Amazon account information. Another option is creating a Whole Foods credit card, the former employees say.\u201cHow consumers purchase in stores is drastically different from online,\u201d said Kevin Howard, CEO of Adroit Worldwide Media Inc., a retail-technology provider that has worked with companies including Whole Foods.Primarily, consumers are more likely to browse and make impulse buys in store\u2014driving up the total purchase\u2014whereas shoppers are more targeted online, he said.\u2018How consumers purchase in stores is drastically different from online.\u2019Amazon has spent time experimenting with brick-and-mortar already. Its bookstores, of which it now has eight open and another five coming, according to its website, have been used in part to start collecting data on how consumers naturally browse in stores, former employees said.Shoppers typically use their phone app to scan books for prices in the stores, connecting their online profiles with their browsing in the real world\u2014not just online.Amazon has had a more difficult experiment with Amazon Go, its convenience-style store in which customers scan their phones as they walk in, pick up items to purchase and exit without a traditional checkout. The public opening has been delayed, in part because of technological hurdles and Amazon\u2019s limited experience in managing the flow of customers and products in a physical space.Amazon likely will implement changes at Whole Foods based on what it finds out about the grocery chain\u2019s shoppers, including changing prices and selection\u2014something right now that can vary widely based on the region, according to the former employees.The data Amazon collects will likely help it decide which of its growing roster of private-label brands to expand and which new ones to launch, especially when it comes to consumables and food. Whole Foods already has a large private-label business.Bringing together online and offline data can help Amazon learn how to entice customers to make more impulse purchases online, according to analysts and retail consultants.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that they\u2019re targeting these specific, highly affluent customers,\u201d said Mark Elfenbein, chief revenue officer at artificial-intelligence firm Sentient Technologies LLC, which works with retailers to better match the in-store shopping experience online.\u201cI\u2019m a Whole Foods shopper.

The administration wants to cut redundancies and modernize the way Americans interact with their government, and tech companies see a $90 billion-a-year business.But those companies also face a common challenge. The government\u2019s sprawling information-technology system is flawed and balky, controlled in agency fiefdoms that will be difficult to break. And much of the spending now goes toward keeping older systems running, limiting the amount the government can invest in new technology.Critics say the lack of oversight over IT spending and operations is part of the problem, as is a plethora of customized and even duplicative systems within a single agency.\u201cWe have a crazy quilt system of management,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D., Va.), who has become a leader in Congress on IT issues. \u201cSo no clear lines of authority, accountability, responsibility, there\u2019s no transparency.\u201dTech companies such as             Amazon.com Inc.,Oracle Corp.       and             Microsoft Corp.       hope to provide the government more cloud computing, software and data services that could help save money as well as improve user experiences and reduce cyberthreats.Advocates of an overhaul also want to consolidate the current proliferation of email, payroll and other systems, as well as thousands of data centers.       David Berteau,        a former Defense Department assistant secretary, said he had to carry four separate mobile devices to communicate with all the Pentagon systems he had to access.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge chance to save money on shared services and the cloud,\u201d said Mr. Berteau, now president of the Professional Services Council, a group that promotes technology to improve government results. \u201cThe real value of IT modernization comes as much in breaking down the internal barriers\u201d as in modernized services, he added.The Monday meeting brought new focus to the issue, even if it shed little new light. Officials promised more action soon.\u201cWe\u2019re embracing big change, bold thinking, and outsider perspectives to transform government and make it the way it should be, and at far less cost,\u201d President       Donald Trump       said in concluding remarks.Amazon\u2019s       Jeff Bezos       talked of using commercial technology wherever possible. He said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence, according to a White House pool reportOther topics included analytics, big data, purchasing modernization, government and private sector partnerships and high-skill visas.But making progress depends on finding political will.\u201cThe real problem is the leadership problem,\u201d said Rep.       Will Hurd       (R., Texas), who is sponsoring a major IT modernization bill in Congress. \u201cWe have to make sure we have people in the agencies that recognize the need for modernization, and it starts with the head of the agency.\u201dThe White House effort to push IT modernization could be a boon to major tech companies that have moved aggressively into cloud computing and software services. It could hurt some consulting firms that have traditionally focused on the government market.\u201cI think the market is moving in a direction that says that more innovative companies are going to come in and break into the market,\u201d said       Mike Hettinger,        an adviser to tech companies and a former senior Capitol Hill aide.Mr. Hurd\u2019s bill would give agency officials more incentive to save money on IT by allowing them to spend the savings on modernization.

The Omaha, Neb., billionaire then asked Ms. Kupferberg to bring him similar deals in the future\u2014the bigger, the better.Berkshire rarely relies on people outside the company to educate potential targets.\u00a0Yet with\u00a0that one deal in 2015, Ms. Kupferberg became Mr. Buffett\u2019s scout inside Europe\u2019s most powerful country.\u201cIt\u2019s very helpful for us to have somebody that actually understands us,\u201d who can represent Berkshire\u2019s interests in Germany, Mr. Buffett said.Ted Weschler,        one of Mr. Buffett\u2019s portfolio managers, added: \u201cShe\u2019s our eyes and ears in Germany.\u201dMs. Kupferberg\u2019s role could\u00a0become more crucial as Mr. Buffett looks for\u00a0new targets in unfamiliar markets.\u00a0Berkshire had $96.5 billion in cash as of\u00a0March 31,\u00a0and Mr. Buffett told shareholders in May that he is eager to spend it.\u00a0The conglomerate owns only a handful of businesses outside the U.S., including Netherlands-based IMC International Metalworking Cos.The story of this unlikely pairing took six years to unfold. It began with Mr. Buffett\u2019s much-publicized tour of Europe in 2008. He was there to drum up potential deals but was unable to find an immediate target.\u00a0Though she hadn\u2019t met Mr. Buffett, Ms. Kupferberg suspected\u00a0she could turn that around.Ms. Kupferberg, 50 years old, was born in M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany, to two Holocaust survivors. Her father co-founded an import-export business in Israel after surviving multiple concentration camps; his work eventually took him to Germany.\u201cI\u2019m from a family history [where] we are not used to making plans,\u201d\u00a0Ms. Kupferberg\u00a0said. \u201cMy parents educated us, \u2018Everything\u00a0can change the next day.\u2019 \u201dAfter a disease from a tick bite prompted her to quit a job in private equity and venture capital, Ms. Kupferberg opened an independent consulting firm in Cologne in 1997 and started working with family-owned businesses in Germany. She gained a reputation as an astute deal maker, but was largely unknown outside of the country.She knew from experience that German companies, which\u00a0typically have strong connections to their local communities and savings banks, could be wary of foreign investors. Berkshire, however, could be a good fit for such companies because it tends to seek out successful firms with strong competitive advantages that can be left alone.In 2014, one of Ms. Kupferberg\u2019s clients,       Ute Louis,        wanted to sell Detlev Louis Motorrad-Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH,\u00a0a motorcycle helmet and equipment retailer. Ms. Louis, who\u00a0inherited the business from\u00a0her late husband, had some tricky requirements: The management team had to stay in place and the company had to keep its headquarters in Hamburg.\u201cI thought, this is a perfect match\u201d for Berkshire, Ms. Kupferberg said. \u201cI think we can offer to Berkshire a company, even if it\u2019s for [Mr. Buffett] comparably quite small, but a company which exactly fits into his investment strategy,\u201d she recalled thinking.Other advisers thought contacting Mr. Buffett would be a waste of time, she said, but Ms. Louis liked the idea. So Ms. Kupferberg reached out to an Omaha investment banker she met years earlier in a Frankfurt law office:       Jim Zipursky.\u201cJim told me that he thinks that the company might be too small for Berkshire,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him I am convinced that this could work and that I will find a way to contact him.\u201dMr. Zipursky told Ms. Kupferberg that his father, Morley, also a banker, knew Mr. Buffett through       Stan Lipsey,        a mutual friend who worked for Mr. Buffett for years.\u00a0He offered to deliver a letter and a deal proposal straight to the billionaire\u2019s desk.\u201cIt was an idea that just came out of our discussion,\u201d Mr. Zipursky said. \u201cAs we talked about the opportunity, it became clear that Berkshire Hathaway would be the best possible acquirer for that company.\u201dThe 1\u00bd-page letter, signed by Morley Zipursky, introduced the company, and Mr. Buffett responded within days asking for a price. He then said that he liked the company but the price was too high. A few months later, Ms. Kupferberg and Mr. Zipursky tried again, with a tweaked offer.\u00a0Mr. Buffett approved the new offer, and Mr. Weschler traveled to Germany to meet Ms. Kupferberg and the company\u2019s owner and managers.At Mr. Weschler\u2019s first meeting with Ms. Louis, Ms. Kupferberg helped translate, Mr. Weschler said. The deal closed in 2015. \u201cHalfway through the process, I thought that, really, I\u2019d like to be on the same side of the table as Zypora sometime,\u201d Mr. Weschler said.Last year, Ms. Kupferberg helped arrange\u00a0a meeting\u00a0for Mr. Weschler with the heads of the 25 largest German savings banks. He was the first guest\u00a0to meet\u00a0with that group of executives,\u00a0said Karl-Peter Schackmann-Fallis, managing director of the German Savings Bank Association.In May, Ms. Kupferberg traveled to Omaha for her first meeting with Mr. Buffett. In his office, the two discussed potential investments and the economic situation in Germany and Europe. As they posed for a photo, Mr. Buffett placed his left arm around Ms. Kupferberg\u2019s shoulder.\u201cShe has a very good sense of what might fit or not,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffetts-scout-inside-europes-biggest-economy-1497951001", "news_title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Scout Inside Europe\u2019s Biggest Economy ", "keywords": "berkshire hathaway deals,berkshire hathaway inc.,detlev louis,jim zipursky,morley zipursky,oracle of omaha,stan lipsey,ted weschler,warren buffett,warren buffett berkshire,warren buffett berkshire hathaway,warren buffett business,warren buffett investment,zypora kupferberg,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Detlev Louis Motorrad-Vertriebsgesellschaft,Warren Buffett,Jim Zipursky,Ted Weschler,corporate,industrial news,motorcycling,motor sports,sports,recreation,routine general news,financial investments,diversified holding companies,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,business consultancy,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Virtual reality, one could say, still hasn\u2019t found its Pok\u00e9mon.The hit mobile game \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d will reach its first birthday next month having defied the odds. It has stayed popular enough past its fad-like initial launch to build a strong business that generated revenue about $1.3 billion to date, according to market research firm SuperData. The game remains one of the highest grossing on both the iOS and Android app stores, and has thus proven to be a powerful use case for Augmented Reality, which refers to technology that blends artificial images with the real world.Augmented Reality\u2019s close cousin, known as virtual reality, could use that kind of draw. The first virtual reality headsets designed for videogame players went on sale last year, but haven\u2019t ginned up enough business to become a major platform in their own right.             Sony                   says it has sold more than 1 million units of its PlayStationVR system. SuperData estimates that HTC\u2019s Vive system and the Oculus Rift from             Facebook                   sold less than 800,000 units combined from their launch up to the end of March.             Samsung                   is believed to have sold more than 5 million units of its Gear VR that works with its mobile phones, but those are different from the headsets designed to run powerhouse videogames\u2014and far cheaper.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.High-end VR hasn\u2019t created a large enough installed base of customers for game publishers to commit major development dollars. And without must-have games, virtual reality just won\u2019t break out of its niche. The diminished enthusiasm for VR was evident at last week\u2019s E3 videogame conference. Oculus, a major presence at the conference over the previous two years, didn\u2019t even host its own booth this year. That was just two months after Facebook CEO       Mark Zuckerberg      spent much of his developers\u2019 conference on AR\u2014citing Pok\u00e9mon Go as inspiration\u2014with scarcely a word about VR.Another hit for VR came from             Microsoft,       which launched a new supercharged version of its Xbox One console at the event. The company didn\u2019t make the console compatible with existing VR systems\u2014a distinct change from its tone the year before. It is worth noting that Microsoft is already a big backer of AR through its HoloLens project.It isn\u2019t game over for VR just yet. Sony announced several new games coming for PlayStationVR later this year, and it launched a big new title called \u201cFarpoint\u201d just last month. Privately held publisher Bethesda Softworks spent E3 showing off three upcoming VR games based on its well-regarded Doom, Fallout and Skyrim franchises. Those demos drew big crowds at the show, which is encouraging. But if VR is to ever level up in a big way, it needs to find something gamers simply can\u2019t live without.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Virtual Reality Needs to Get Real.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-virtual-reality-needs-to-get-real-1497951002", "news_title": "What Virtual Reality Needs to Get Real   ", "keywords": "ar,augmented reality,console,headset,playstationvr,superdata,videogame,virtual reality,vr,HTC,TW:2498,marketing,markets,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,market research,consumer trends,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,commodity,financial market news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,games software,technology,virtual reality technologies"}, {"content": "SAN FRANCISCO\u2014Since             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       launched the iPhone in June 2007, the smartphone revolution it unleashed has changed the way people work and socialize while reshaping industries from music to hotels.It also has transformed the company in ways that co-founder       Steve Jobs       could hardly have foreseen.Ten years later, the iPhone is one of the best-selling products in history, with about 1.3 billion sold, generating more than $800 billion in revenue. It skyrocketed Apple into the business stratosphere, unlocking new markets, spawning an enormous services business and helping turn Apple into the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company.But it also created enormous challenges for Apple, raising the bar for innovation and turning a company that thrived on its self-image as scrappy underdog into an industry leader, with a workforce more than six times what it was.\u201cThe company has grown in every dimension and holding it together is very, very tough,\u201d said       Horace Dediu,        a former             Nokia                   executive and technology analyst with Asymco. Apple has to balance sustaining the iPhone business with preserving employees\u2019 passion to create new products, he said, and \u201cthat\u2019s really hard.\u201dThe iPhone boom has overshadowed Apple\u2019s other products, making the company dependent on one product line for two-thirds of its sales. That means any big stumble with the iPhone could be calamitous.The iPhone\u2019s success is best reflected in China, where a combination of good timing, smart manufacturing and strong branding have made Apple one of the most successful American companies in the world\u2019s most populous country.The iPhone hit Chinese shelves in 2009 as wages in that country were swelling. Apple\u2014which relies on thousands of Chinese workers to assemble its products\u2014benefited as Chinese consumers embraced the iPhone as a status symbol.In 2006, all of Asia-Pacific outside of Japan accounted for 7% of Apple\u2019s revenue. Last year, greater China alone made up 23% of revenue, and at $48.49 billion, was greater than             Coca-Cola Co.\u2019s       total revenue world-wide.The iPhone\u2019s success in China has been so dramatic that analysts now worry Apple is too reliant on sales from the region.The iPhone also spawned Apple\u2019s second-largest business by revenue: apps and other services offerings.Mr. Jobs didn\u2019t plan that. In fact, he opposed it, said Scott Forstall, the company\u2019s former head of software. As a result, Apple didn\u2019t open the device to application developers until 2008, when it added the App Store and began taking 30% of each app purchase.Since then, app sales have generated roughly $100 billion in gross revenue as Apple has registered more than 16 million app developers world-wide. The company also pushed into payments with Apple Pay and a music-subscription service, creating a $24 billion services business that is Apple\u2019s second-largest after the iPhone and is growing rapidly.Now, the iPhone is \u201cthe razor and the blades are the software services,\u201d said longtime Apple adviser and Steve Jobs confidant       Regis McKenna.       \u201cIt creates this great annuity business.\u201dAs sales surged, Apple staffed up. The company hired about 100,000 people in the 10-year span, bringing its global workforce to 116,000 from 18,000 in 2006. New workers were brought on to manage relationships with cellphone carriers, double the number of retail stores and maintain an increasingly complex supply chain.The employees are spread across more than 100 buildings, creating a disparate workforce Apple has pushed to bring together with a new, $5 billion spaceship-style headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.Managing that explosive growth fell on the shoulders of       Tim Cook,        who succeeded Mr. Jobs, who died in 2011. The Duke University business school graduate and supply chain-expert has tried to preserve Apple\u2019s unique culture by taking a more inclusive approach than his predecessor, seeking out more opinions from staff, while consistently saying Apple\u2019s overriding goal is to make great products, echoing a mantra of Mr. Jobs.\u201cThis is a huge undertaking now and requires a lot of talented people, and Tim\u2019s built a team capable of managing a $200 billion company,\u201d said Mr. McKenna. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if Steve could have done that or not.\u201dStill, preserving Apple\u2019s culture has been difficult. Before the iPhone, Apple sought to prove itself after nearly going bankrupt in the mid-1990s, said       Alan Cannistraro,        who worked at Apple from 2000 to 2012 before founding video startup Rheo.\u201cWe felt like: Let\u2019s show the world. We were the underdogs,\u201d he said. But new hires didn\u2019t inherit that attitude and it became \u201cless of a mission-driven\u201d place and \u201cmore function driven.\u201dMr. Cook has committed to maintaining Mr. Jobs\u2019s passion for doing the extraordinary as Apple pushed into new devices such as the Apple Watch and software tools for augmented reality.Meanwhile, pressure intensified to make each iPhone model better than the last. As iPhone revenue fell for the first time in Apple\u2019s fiscal 2016, and its market share dropped in China, Mr. Cook told analysts the key to regaining share was \u201cinnovating like crazy.\u201d\u201cIf we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll do well,\u201d he said.Apple fans are waiting for the newest iPhone, the 10th anniversary model expected this fall, to see whether Mr. Cook makes good on that promise.Questions about innovation have dogged Mr. Cook, whose operational prowess contrasts with Mr. Jobs\u2019s talent as a visionary product developer.The iPhone was so revolutionary it raised expectations that the company would introduce radical new products regularly, said       Patrick Moorhead,        a technology analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call the leadership burden,\u201d Mr. Moorhead said.That has made innovation more difficult in some ways, former employees said. Apple developed products that were linked to the iPhone, such as the Apple Watch and AirPod headphones, but was late to pursue hot internet-connected home devices like Nest\u2019s thermostat and an intelligent speaker like Amazon\u2019s Echo.\u201cThere was a real opportunity missed there,\u201d said Mr. Cannistraro. Still, he said, Apple recognizes and supports innovative ideas internally and executes better than competitors. \u201cThe right ideas tend to be the ones that get through.\u201dWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'How iPhone Decade Reshaped Apple.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/among-the-iphones-biggest-transformations-apple-itself-1497951003", "news_title": "Among the iPhone\u2019s Biggest Transformations: Apple Itself ", "keywords": "apple,china,cupertino,iphone,iphonedecade,samsung,smartphone,steve jobs,tim cook,Apple,AAPL,Steve Jobs,Tim Cook,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "Little known fact: Every summer, New York City awards piles of money to nonprofits that dream up novel experiments to perform on the city\u2019s commercial districts.The Neighborhood Challenge Grant Competition, organized by the Department of Small Business Services, is bit like the Google Lunar XPrize. Except rather than top engineers competing to put robots on the moon, it has tiny neighborhood associations inventing new methods to improve business, from delivery service to generating foot traffic.This year, the city gave the contest a twist. The nonprofits competing for $500,000 in prizes had to pair with local tech startups to generate their proposals.If you think this sounds like a waste of taxpayer dollars, settle down. The cash comes from the city\u2019s Economic Development Corp., a self-funded agency. And the contest itself is a nice admission that bureaucrats don\u2019t have all the answers.Before last week\u2019s live-pitch competition, I got to review entries from the 12 finalists, culled from 40 submissions. Some struck me as wonderfully clever.The nonprofit Soho Strut, for example, proposed pairing with startup Haystack to inventory neighborhood businesses and make their shelves searchable via an app. You could use it to find the local shop selling your favorite dog biscuits. Where has this been all my life?The Rockaway Business Alliance, meanwhile, wants to fund high-tech marketing technology along with a startup that would have local businesses delivering everything from tacos to sunscreen directly to the beach.Yarden Flatow, the Alliance\u2019s college-age chairman, said he\u2019d been practicing his pitch like crazy and felt confident. \u201cI can\u2019t say there\u2019s any competition we\u2019re too worried about,\u201d he said. \u201cMay the best man win.\u201dThe finalists at last Thursday\u2019s showdown ranged from the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce to some of the city\u2019s tiniest merchant associations. There were the standard snazzy suits with open-collared shirts. But there also were stretch pants and tattoos. The Rockaway Business Alliance stormed the stage with a crew of presenters and hangers-on decked out in shorts, flip flops and shades.Some presenters were snappy and polished, others spoke with trembling voices. The most endearing presentation came from       Lonnie Baron       of the Staten Island Economic Development Corp. who stepped up to the mike in his green paisley tie and announced, \u201cNot nervous at all!\u201dThe contest aims to help the city\u2019s small businesses get tech savvy. Personally, I love it when a favorite shop doesn\u2019t even have a             Facebook                   page. But I might not be so charmed when it goes out of business.The Chinatown Partnership noted that 40% of its restaurants have no website, and many of its 7,000 businesses don\u2019t appear on review sites such as             Yelp                   and             TripAdvisor.       It proposed sending a street team to collect store information, product shots and shopkeeper narratives to post on social media.The East Village Independent Merchants Association would have shopkeepers anonymously pool information on a platform powered by tech startup Townsquared. It could help the dress-shop owner realize her rent is 20% higher than the area average, or that she\u2019s paying way too much for garbage pickup.A few presentations were unintelligible. And there was an awful lot of overlap. Everyone wants to use beacon technology to zap cellphones with notifications about local events and deals.The judges, which included city officials along with reps from AOL and the Robin Hood Foundation, were encouraging but skeptical. Could small businesses actually be persuaded to adopt these tools?There\u2019s only one way to find out. After 90 minutes of deliberations, the judges selected five winners, including the Rockaway Business Alliance, who will each get $100,000 and a year\u2019s time to execute.\u201cMy jaw dropped,\u201d said       Mr. Flatow,        about learning his organization had won. \u201cNow we just have to walk the walk and do everything we talked about.\u201dWrite to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Contest Brings Tech Help to Small Businesses.'", "news_time": "2017-06-20 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-500-000-contest-aims-to-boost-nyc-commercial-districts-1497951000", "news_title": "A $500,000 Contest Aims to Boost NYC Commercial Districts ", "keywords": "commerce contest,small business districts,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,political,general news,personal finance"}, {"content": "Walt Disney Co.\u2019s       \u201cCars 3\u201d lost some horsepower but still managed to finish in first place at the box office this weekend.\u201cCars 3\u201d collected an estimated $53.5 million in the U.S. and Canada, among the lowest debuts for a Pixar Animation Studio release.

Its world-wide gross stands at $571.8 million.Since its 2006 debut, the \u201cCars\u201d franchise has become an important moneymaker for Disney and Pixar beyond the box office, drawing in significant revenue from tie-in merchandise.\u00a0International grosses from about 20% of the overseas marketplace brought in an additional $21.3 million.The latest \u201cCars\u201d installment features the voice cast of       Owen Wilson       and       Cristela Alonzo,        whose character attracted more girls and Hispanic moviegoers than previous installments, said       Dave Hollis,        Disney\u2019s distribution chief.\u201cThat response is going to fuel a big summer,\u201d said Mr. Hollis, adding that most Pixar releases draw in audiences in subsequent weekends at a rate that should put the movie\u2019s ultimate domestic gross in the $180 million range.\u201cAll Eyez on Me,\u201d hitting theaters on what would have been the \u201cDear Mama\u201d rapper\u2019s 46th birthday, was marketed and released by the Codeblack Films unit of             Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.

Under the arrangement, Spirit sees the potential of eventually using Norsk\u2019s technology to produce thousands of different parts at 30% lower cost than traditional milling methods.However, before that can happen, the Federal Aviation Administration has to approve the overall process and certify that the cutting-edge, plasma-deposition technology is reliable enough to ensure identical strength and other properties from batch to batch.FAA officials have said they are moving cautiously, because they want to fully understand the unique technical issues.In an interview, veteran aerospace       executive Warren Boley,        president and chief executive of Norsk, agreed that regulators were taking their time and suggested it was likely some of the central questions about the process wouldn\u2019t be resolved until 2018.Norsk, which has been laying the groundwork for the initiative for several years, already has FAA approval to produce a limited category of structural titanium parts for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner. Now, Mr. Boley said regulatory reviews are under way to expand the number of approved structural parts. Mr. Boley said he doesn\u2019t expect certification of any safety-critical parts, the highest level of FAA approval, in the near term.An FAA official declined to comment.Norsk also is targeting space and marine applications, unveiling two partnerships for such categories of parts.By using titanium wire, rather than powder, as the raw material, the company is able to tackle larger parts and churn them out much faster than would be possible otherwise. Mr. Boley said his company\u2019s 3-D printed production runs can be 100 times faster than those using powder, meaning some parts could be ready in a matter of hours, instead of days or weeks.Manufacturing parts from titanium using any process is generally considered more difficult than those involving most other metals. But even as Norsk and Spirit work with FAA experts to open the door to routine uses of 3-D printed parts, Norsk already is ramping up production capacity considerably. The plan includes joining forces with New York state to set up and operate an extensive 3-D printing complex in Plattsburgh.There are scores of companies itching to join the 3-D printing trend for aerospace alone. A large jetliner has between 300 and 1,000 structural titanium parts.Norsk and             General Electric Co.       are believed to be the only two companies that have received FAA approval to supply any 3-D printed parts for commercial transports.GE is using a different, more time-consuming process for more intricate parts. It has approval to print thousands of fuel nozzles, for jet engines powering new planes from Boeing and             Airbus SE,       featuring complex internal structures that would be impossible to produce by traditional methods.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-20 01:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/3-d-printed-airliner-parts-face-regulatory-headwinds-1497936970", "news_title": "3-D Printed Airliner Parts Face Regulatory Headwinds ", "keywords": "3-d printing, airliners, faa, ge, jet parts, plane parts, production, regulators,Norsk Titanium,Boeing,BA,Federal Aviation Administration,Spirit AeroSystems Holdings,SPR,executive Warren Boley,product,consumer safety,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,metal products,forging,stamping,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,3d printing,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Billionaire       Li Ka-shing,        for decades one of the world\u2019s wealthiest tycoons, has told associates he plans to step down as chairman of his global conglomerate,         CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.      , by next year.Mr. Li,        who turns 89 in July, hasn\u2019t given a specific date but is likely to step down by his 90th birthday, according to people briefed by the tycoon.One of the people said Mr. Li has already told his inner coterie of advisers, including son and Deputy Chairman Victor Li, who is earmarked as his successor. Another person said the elder Mr. Li, known for trademark horn-rimmed glasses and an iron grip on his companies, could step down by year-end.Often dubbed \u201cAsia\u2019s Warren Buffett\u201d for his investment acumen, Mr. Li enjoys celebrity status both inside and outside the company, which spans ports, telecoms, retail and property. His departure could create uncertainty among shareholders over CK Hutchison\u2019s future without him at the helm.Mr. Li plans to keep his office on the 70th floor of his downtown headquarters and remain a senior adviser, the people familiar with his plans said. The businessman, who emigrated to the then British colony of Hong Kong from China as a boy, parlayed a plastic-flower manufacturer into a global empire.\u201cMr. Li has from time to time talked about his retirement and his confidence in Victor to lead the company. Mr. Li is in very good health and will make his official announcement when he decides to retire,\u201d a CK Hutchison spokesman said Tuesday.The transition comes at a challenging time for Mr. Li\u2019s companies, as Chinese competitors eat into his port and property businesses in Hong Kong and mainland China, while regulators have blocked bids worth more than $10 billion for a mobile phone operator in the U.K. and a power grid in Australia. Political uncertainty in Britain also poses a risk to CK Hutchison\u2019s bottom line as more than a third of its operating profit comes from the U.K.With a fortune of $33 billion, according to Forbes, Mr. Li has lately been jostling for position as Asia\u2019s richest person with China\u2019s Jack Ma, of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , and property magnate       Wang Jianlin       of Dalian Wanda Group.Victor Li was anointed as CK Hutchison\u2019s future leader in 2012, though no timetable for succession was provided. Victor Li, 52, has spent more than three decades shadowing his father. A younger son, Richard, 50, left the family business in the 1990s to branch out on his own, using family money to buy and run media and telecommunications companies, with varying success.\u201cIt\u2019s quite usual for an older chairman\u2014before he totally and completely leaves his position\u2014to be in an honorary or advisory position to see how his successor does when given a free hand,\u201d said       Joseph Fan,        a finance professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has written a book about family-run businesses. The patriarch\u2019s presence helps ensure managers cooperate with the successor, he said.In 2015, Mr. Li simplified the structure of his two companies and folded them together to increase their appeal to investors and pave the way for Victor Li to take over. Today, CK Hutchison\u2019s market capitalization is more than $49 billion, bigger than             Ford Motor Co.      , with tendrils in U.K. mobile networks, Australian utilities and Canadian air-conditioning makers.Since the restructuring, Victor Li has been involved in all key investment plans and meetings, one of the people familiar with the matter said, adding that the elder Mr. Li will still be involved in decisions.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for Superman to completely remove himself,\u201d the person said, using the nickname local media use for Mr. Li. \u201cHe\u2019ll still stay on and steer the ship but let his son run more of the show.\u201dWhen unrest in Cultural Revolution-era China spilled over to Hong Kong in the late 1960s, Mr. Li saw an opportunity and began buying up property through his company, Cheung Kong\u2014a prescient move, as prices soon soared. He was a daring corporate raider and investor with impeccable timing. In 1979, he stunned the city by paying $127 million to secure control of Hutchison Whampoa, at the time the city\u2019s second-biggest British colonial trading house.The elder Mr. Li was among the first foreign developers to enter China after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, with whom Mr. Li had close ties, began opening up the nation\u2019s economy. He retained good relationships with subsequent presidents Jiang Zemin and       Hu Jintao,        although he is viewed by China watchers as less close to the current president,       Xi Jinping.The Hong Kong tycoon began trimming his property portfolio in China in 2011 and has since focused new investment in Australia, Canada and the U.K., where he believes the political and regulatory environments are more stable and predictable, according to people familiar with his thinking. However, the pivot forced Mr. Li to publicly defend himself after he was accused by Chinese media of abandoning his mainland investments.At home in Hong Kong, the tycoon has at times fallen afoul of public affection. Striking dock workers hanged Mr. Li in effigy in 2013 to protest working conditions at the ports he runs in the city, and citizens disenchanted with sky-high property prices and a widening wealth gap now publicly criticize him in a way that wasn\u2019t imaginable years ago.Two years ago, a plan to merge CK Hutchison\u2019s infrastructure and power affiliates was voted down by shareholders. That defeat was particularly painful for Victor Li, who had been closely involved in the plan, associates say.Even into his 80s, the elder Mr. Li was known for rising at 5 a.m. to play a round of golf at a golf course in Deepwater Bay, located next door to his home. While friends say Mr. Li\u2019s mind remains sharp, there are signs he has slowed down. His longtime partner Solina Chau told reporters two years ago that the tycoon underwent spinal surgery in the U.S. after hurting his back during exercises, while Victor Li told shareholders last year that the elder Mr. Li skipped an annual shareholder meeting because of a stomach illness, according to local media reports.Corrections & Amplifications   Victor Li told shareholders last year that his father skipped an annual shareholder meeting because of a stomach illness. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the statement was made earlier this year.

The plan proposes directly paying out this money to all citizens to defray the likely costs from rising energy prices.A group of influential Republicans, including former secretaries of State       George Shultz       and       James Baker,        have spearheaded the group\u2019s efforts, which are at odds with many in their own party.Since winning control of the White House and Congress last year, Republican lawmakers have worked to roll back Democratic policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, culminating with President       Donald Trump\u2019s       decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.Several business leaders criticized that decision, and some of the companies joining the group, which officially launched in February, have advocated more aggressive policies to address rising temperatures and air pollution. Exxon, GM and the other corporations are joining alongside astrophysicist       Stephen Hawking,        hedge-fund magnate       Ray Dalio,        Harvard economist and former Obama economic adviser       Larry Summers       and others.Exxon Chief Executive       Darren Woods       used his first blog post in that role this February to say a \u201crevenue-neutral carbon tax\u201d would be a \u201csensible approach\u201d to cutting carbon emissions.It can promote energy efficiency and incentivize low-carbon energy sources without \u201cfurther burdening the economy,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWe have been encouraged by the proposal put forth by the Climate Leadership Council as it aligns closely with our longstanding principles,\u201d Mr. Woods said in a statement Monday.\u201cWe acknowledged long ago that climate change is real and that lowering emissions is both a social imperative and an economic opportunity,\u201d GM said in a statement. \u201cAddressing climate change in an effective and sustainable manner requires a holistic approach involving all sectors of the economy.\u201dBy joining now, the companies will be able to help shape the fine details of the proposal that eventually comes from the council, said Ted Halstead, the group\u2019s chief executive.A tax is also simple enough that, if passed, it would mean the country could eliminate a collection of regulations that have guided climate policy in the last several years, including the Obama administration\u2019s power plant rules, which the Trump administration has moved to reverse.\u201cMy guess is that the big appeal is getting rid of all the regulatory morass,\u201d said Benjamin Salisbury, policy analyst at FBR & Co.
