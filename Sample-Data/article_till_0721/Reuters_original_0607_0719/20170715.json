Lots of firsts and improvement defensively. But he found some eloquent words after his first career walk-off hit, a three-run homer in the ninth inning on Friday night for a 5-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at PNC Park.  It's unlike any other experience. Like walking on a cloud, kind of like my first weekend up here. It was cool,  Bell said of his 17th homer.  The lights go off and come back on, you're rounding third and you see all your teammates at home. I haven't had that feeling since Double-A, and the stadium here is a little louder than that.  The long ball to left came off Seung-Hwan Oh (1-5) after Adam Frazier led off the ninth by stretching a hit to left into a double. An out later, Andrew McCutchen was intentionally walked. Pittsburgh (43-47), fourth in the National League Central, won for the sixth time in seven games. Bell, who was 2-for-3 with two walks and four RBIs, continued to impress manager Clint Hurdle.  He did a lot of good things at the plate,  Hurdle said.  We've talked about him being dangerous. We've talked about him learning at the plate as the season goes on, taking his at-bat.  As soon as he hit it, he knew it was out. Fun to watch him grow. He's growing up right in front of our eyes.  Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PiratesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchOh, who came on in the ninth, got the only out of the inning on a shallow fly ball by Josh Harrison. After the Cardinals decided to put McCutchen on, Bell hit a 1-2 pitch a few rows into the seats in left.  It was too high. It was a missed pitch,  Oh said through an interpreter. Bell thought it was out, but he also expected it to be more of a monster.  It didn't go as far as I thought it was going to go, but I hit it pretty good,  he said. Pittsburgh closer Felipe Rivero (4-2) pitched a perfect ninth for the win. Neither starter got a decision after they left with the score tied at 2. St. Louis sinker-baller Mike Leake gave up two runs and seven hits in five innings with five walks and three strikeouts. It was a decent rebound from his previous start when he gave up a season-high eight runs. Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole got his pitch count up to 102 in six innings. He allowed four hits, one of them Jedd Gyorko's two-run homer in the first. Cole, who struck out four and walked none, then retired nine batters in a row and 16 of the 18 he faced after the homer. It was Cole's fifth quality start in his past six starts.  Just continue to stay aggressive,  Cole said.  Got some quick outs here and there, which got us into the sixth, and just trusted the defense.  Cole needed 28 pitches to get out of the first inning, and one of those was a full-count, two-out slider that Gyorko pelted 408 feet to center for a 2-0 St. Louis lead. It also brought home Tommy Pham, who singled with one out.  He had good stuff,  Gyorko said of Cole.  He left a pitch out over. I put a good swing on it, and from there he didn't make too many mistakes from there on.  Pittsburgh climbed within 2-1 in the third. Cole led off with an infield single and two outs later scored on Bell's single to left. In the fourth, Gregory Polanco led off with a double off the wall in center and moved to third on Francisco Cervelli's groundout. After Jordy Mercer walked, Cole had a chance to contribute offensively again. Instead, Polanco got picked off third on a throw from catcher Yadier Molina to Gyorko.  We try to save (that play) for big moments if we can,  Gyorko said.  Getting that out there and getting Leake out of that inning was big.  Especially when the Pirates, who pounded out 12 hits, stranded 10 runners. The Pirates tied it 2-2 in the fifth. Leake walked the bases loaded with two outs and Polanco drove in McCutchen with a single to right. Leake then struck out Cervelli to end the threat.  He was about at his last hitter there,  St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said of Leake.  He ends up getting the strikeout to get us out of the (fifth) inning. There was a lot of damage that could have been done.  That didn't come until the ninth. NOTES: Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle got ejected in the sixth inning by home plate umpire Jerry Layne when he argued against a timeout call that prevented a runner from advancing. ... St. Louis RF Stephen Piscotty left in the ninth inning after running to catch a shallow fly ball and grabbing at his right thigh. ...

Anyone even remotely acquainted with Ken Rosewall, however, knows that simply isn't the style of one of the great gentlemen of the game. Instead, the 82-year-old Australian was as awestruck as anybody on Friday as he sat with his grandson in the royal box watching Federer beat Tomas Berdych to become the oldest men's singles finallist here since Rosewall in 1974.  I'm like millions of others. I admire Roger so much,  Rosewall told Reuters in an interview.   I think he's going to be a force in tennis for a few more years.  As Federer continues to defy the ravages of age with his remarkable run this year - winning an 18th major title in Melbourne in January and now on the cusp of a record eighth Wimbledon title - the comparisons with Rosewall are inevitable.  I'd like to be compared to Roger,  Rosewall said with a laugh.  I was playing some of my best tennis at 35. Roger's doing the same thing. I don't see any reason why he shouldn't continue for at least another two or three years.  Federer still has some way to go if he is to match the longevity of Rosewall's incredible career as the Australian was 39 when he lost the 1974 final to brash youngster Jimmy Connors. Despite that letdown, Rosewall has retained the title of the oldest men's grand slam champion in the professional era for 45 years after lifting the 1972 Australian Open trophy at the age of 37.  If anyone is to break it, I won't be sorry to see the record go to somebody like Roger,  added Rosewall, who was in London to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Wimbledon Pro event.  Rosewall won four of his eight grand slam titles after turning 30 and makes no bones about why he kept leading such a nomadic life for so long.  I was 33 when Open tennis came in ... I was still enjoying the tennis and I was playing well,  said Rosewall  I still felt I was a strong force in winning events... and the chance to play for prize money, that was the main motivation.   Door Stoppers  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 14, 2017   Former tennis player Ken Rosewall in the stands on centre court.Andrew CouldridgeMoney, which Rosewall now keeps neatly folded in a 14 carat gold paper clip he was awarded for winning the 1969 U.S. Open doubles title, played a significant role in his tennis career. Unlike the champions of today who are used to banking seven-figure sums in prize money from the slams, Rosewall started off in the 1950s when he played for kudos and little else.  Tennis Australia would pay his on-road expenses and a per diem but there was no money for winning grand slams, merely  big bronze stumps  of trophies that would end up  being used as door stoppers .  All that changed when Rosewall beat his great friend Rod Laver to triumph at the French Open in 1968, the first time a grand slam had opened its gates to professionals.   While it meant that Rosewall could compete in the majors again without worrying about financial security, his long absence from the grand slams after he turned professional in 1957 raises a question that can never be answered. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 14, 2017   Switzerland’s Roger Federer celebrates during his semi final match against Czech Republic’s Tomas BerdychTim Ireland/Pool I believe I could have won another 10 more slams. But who knows? It's too hard to tell,  said Rosewall.  I developed my game so that I could play well on any surface. And in those days three of the grand slam events were on grass. In Sydney, where I grew up, I learnt to play on claycourts.  I missed 44 slams over 11 years after I turned pro and I missed playing at Wimbledon ... in 72 and ... 73, so that’s 46.  But I don’t think I would have played that many, because if I had I would have been dead!  Rosewall, who is left-handed but switched to playing right-handed at his father's behest, cut his opponents down to size by  swinging away the backhand shots  despite being only 5 feet 7 inches tall. Nicknamed  Muscles  because of his lack of them, Rosewall sometimes wishes he could have faced some of the greats of the modern era and would have  loved to have tried my chances against Roger . There is one aspect of playing in the 1950s that he would never swap, however.  In the amateurs there was a lot of camaraderie with the players,  said Rosewall, who was part of tight-knit group that included Laver, Fred Stolle and the late Lew Hoad.  There was a lot more friendship and togetherness. We travelled together, we ate together, we stayed in the same hotel ...   People would ask 'how can you be so competitive in the matches because you spend so much time together?'.  But that's the way we were. Even with so many years gone, we're still friends.

The Cuban-born slugger proved it Friday night, slugging two homers -- including a go-ahead three-run shot in the top of the ninth -- to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-4 win over the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. Corey Seager also homered for the Dodgers, but the star was Puig, who finished with four RBIs. Puig, who has 18 homers and 47 RBIs this season, was asked if he has talked to manager Dave Roberts about his spot in the batting order.  I've wanted to tell the manager to put me higher up, but I think it's better to stay there, and if he bats me ninth ... the same,  Puig said.  As long as I'm in the lineup ...  On his second homer, Puig fell behind in the count 0-2 but did not panic.  It was good to see his heart rate remain calm after he got behind,  Roberts said.  There have been many times we've seen him get over-amped and throw at-bats away.  Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at MarlinsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchPuig, whose career high in homers was the 19 he hit as a rookie in 2013, said his goal is to get to 20 and also make the World Series. The first part of that goal appears to be a lock. His second goal looks good, too, as the Dodgers, who have the best record in the majors at 62-29, have won seven straight games. They kept their streak alive with that dramatic ninth inning in which three straight batters were within one strike of handing the game to Miami. But closer A.J. Ramos (2-4) allowed a two-out single to Joc Pederson and lost Yasmani Grandal on a walk. Puig then hit a 1-2 pitch to the home run sculpture in left-center. It was the fourth multi-homer game of Puig's career, and it left Ramos with a bitter taste.  I just didn't make the pitch,  Ramos said.  I threw it where (Puig) could hit it. I just couldn't get the last out.  Miami (41-47) had its three-game win streak snapped despite a run-scoring double by Giancarlo Stanton and a two-run double by Justin Bour. Reliever Josh Fields (5-0) earned the win and Kenley Jansen picked up his 22nd save. The Dodgers' bullpen combined to pitch 4 1/3 scoreless innings. Los Angeles opened the scoring, getting a run in the second on an error by second baseman Dee Gordon. The rally started with a double by Pederson and a single by Grandal, who attempted to steal second before stopping short, perhaps hoping to draw a throw. If so, the ploy worked as Gordon dropped the ball and threw home too late to catch Pederson. The next batter, Chris Taylor, followed with a two-out single, but left fielder Marcell Ozuna's perfect one-hop throw caught Grandal at the plate. Miami tied the score 1-1 in the fourth. Martin Prado hit a two-out double and scored on a single to center by J.T. Realmuto. Puig gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead by going deep on the first pitch of the fifth inning for his 17th homer. Two outs later, Seager made it 3-1 with his 14th homer. Miami took a 4-3 lead with three runs in the bottom of the fifth. The rally started when 43-year-old pinch hitter Ichiro Suzuki was hit by a pitch. Stanton hit an RBI double to make it 3-2. And with two outs and a 2-2 count, Bour drilled an opposite-field two-run double. That 4-3 lead survived until the ninth, when Puig came through.  (Puig is) tempting me to move him up in the order,  Roberts said.  (Batting eighth) is something that, prior to this season, he had never done. But you look at the length he has given our lineup.  He does have a flair for the dramatic.  NOTES: Dodgers LF Chris Taylor made a spectacular first-inning catch against Dee Gordon, going back and making the play before crashing into the fence. ...

Gio Gonzalez handled an even longer hiatus just fine, too. Harper hit two home runs, Stephen Drew and Anthony Rendon added run-scoring singles and Gonzalez turned in a season-high 8 1/3 innings as the Washington Nationals pounced on the Cincinnati Reds for a 5-0 win in the opener of a four-game series on Friday. Gonzalez, who lost each of his last three starts despite not allowing more than three runs in any of them, gave up just four hits and two walks with six strikeouts for his first win since June 20 at Miami. Gonzalez (8-4), who hadn't pitched since July 6, retired 15 of the last 16 batters he faced and allowed just two runners to reach second base. Three of Cincinnati's hits off of Gonzalez were infield singles as the left-hander threw 113 pitches, 74 for strikes. Washington manager Dusty Baker lifted Gonzalez after he coaxed Reds All-Star first baseman Joey Votto into flying out to start the ninth. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at Reds That was as sharp as I've seen him, and the longest,  Baker said.  He kept his sharpness. This is a tough offensive team he faced in a very short ballpark. It was outstanding for Gio. I thought that was long enough for him because we need him for, I don't know, 15 or 20 more starts.  Was Baker tempted to give Gonzalez a shot at his first complete game since 2013?  It wasn't that tempting,  Baker said.  No, I wasn't that tempted.  Gonzalez didn't question Baker's move.  It was a lot of work -- second half, coming back and going eight innings,  he said through a translator.  That's a good way to start the second half. I was pretty exhausted. Well, that's a strong word, exhausted. I got some work in today, definitely. It was good to see that Skip let me go out there in the ninth. I was told to go out there in the ninth and pitch, and I felt good enough to keep pitching.  The Reds (39-50) loaded the bases with two outs against reliever Matt Albers in the ninth, but Matt Grace came in and got Tucker Barnhart to ground out on the first pitch for his first career save.  We weren't able to get any pressure on Gio,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  We didn't have any push at all to get back into the game until the ninth inning. I think we only had six baserunners. That was a dominant performance.  Cincinnati was shut out for just the second time this season. The shutout win was the third for Washington (53-36). Reds starter Tim Adleman (5-7) picked up in the first game after the All-Star break where he left off before the hiatus. Adleman, who lost his last two and four of his last five starts before the break, allowed three hits, a walk and two runs in the first inning. Drew and Rendon delivered back-to-back, two-out RBI singles. Rendon extended his hitting streak to eight games. Harper followed Wilmer Difo's third-inning leadoff single with his 21st homer, a drive into the right-field seats. The All-Star starter extended his hitting streak to nine games with the shot before leading off the fifth with a drive well over the center field fence -- the 14th multi-homer game of his career and fourth this season.  Coming back from the All-Star game, (I'm) trying to get a pitch out of the plate I can drive and I got two tonight,  Harper said. Adleman, who logged five innings in each of four starts before Friday, lasted just 4 1/3, his shortest start of the season that didn't involve an injury. Neck soreness limited him to one inning on May 14 at San Francisco. He allowed five runs and seven hits with three walks and four strikeouts. NOTES: The Nationals recalled RHPs Austin Adams and Trevor Gott from Triple-A Syracuse before Friday's game. Washington optioned LHP Sammy Solis to Syracuse on Thursday and placed RHP Joe Ross on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to July 11, with a right elbow sprain. The Nationals were awaiting results of an MRI test of Ross's elbow before deciding on a next step. ... Washington OF Jayson Werth continues to have problems with the left toe contusion that has kept him sidelined since June 3, putting a damper on Nationals hopes that he'd be back in time for their series in Arizona that is scheduled to start on July 21. More intensive workouts lead to increased soreness. ... Reds C Devin Mesoraco took batting practice on Friday and is expected to catch a bullpen session on Saturday.

Hurghada, some 400 km (250 miles) south of the capital Cairo, is one of Egypt's most popular vacation spots on the Red Sea. In January 2016, two assailants armed with a gun, a knife and a suicide belt landed on the beach of a hotel in Hurghada, and wounded two foreign tourists. Egypt has been hoping that investments in airport security and the cheaper Egyptian pound will bring tourist visits to its beaches and ancient sites back up to levels seen before its 2011 uprising. The industry, a crucial source of hard currency, has struggled since then with years of political turmoil and mass protests, as well as the fallout from the crash of a jet taking Russian holidaymakers home from the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in October 2015, in which 224 people died. Islamic State said it had brought the plane down with a bomb. Friday's attack came on a day that five policemen were killed by gunmen on a motorbike who ambushed their car just south of Cairo.

The family of Joshua Holt, 25, a Mormon missionary from Utah, says he is in precarious health, was framed after traveling to Venezuela to marry, and should be allowed home. The Holt case has had a low profile, despite tense diplomatic relations between Washington and Venezuela's leftist government.  A statement from the prosecutor's office recommended that both Holt and his Venezuelan wife Thamara Caleno, also 25, be allowed out of jail, but prohibited from leaving Venezuela.   The preliminary hearing for the pair was delayed  on repeated occasions  and their state of health should be checked, the statement said, adding that they were being held by Venezuela's intelligence service in Caracas. Holt and Caleno were arrested in June last year in connection with a weapons capture by police in Ciudad Caribia, a showcase town built on a mountain outside Caracas close to the Caribbean coast during former leader Hugo Chavez's rule. Officials linked them to a murder gang, saying a rifle, a grenade, ammunition and maps were found at their home. U.S. officials, who in the past have called the charges against Holt  questionable , did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the case. Holt's mother declined to comment to Reuters for fear of prejudicing the case. On a web site set up to help Holt, supporters say he was only planning to stay a couple of months in Venezuela but ended up being accused of conspiring against the government.    We are thoroughly convinced the evidence was planted and the process was rigged. He has never published nor expressed any desire to conspire against the Venezuelan government,  it says.

While it was Conchita Martinez who defeated Martina Navratilova in 1994, standing in the way of Williams and a sixth title, an almost unthinkable 17 years after her first, is the tall and powerful Garbine Muguruza.  I think it's very impressive. I think not everybody can do that,  the 23-year-old, 14th-seed Muguruza, who shot to fame two years ago when losing to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, said on the eve of the match.  For me it's incredible. I don't think I could be 37 and playing at that level.  It is a testament to her durability and strength of character - not to mention a thoroughbred grasscourt game that is surpassed only by her sister who has seven Wimbledon crowns - that Williams still is at a level others can only dream of. There have been times since her last Wimbledon triumph in 2008 against Serena when it seemed the older of the two Williams sisters would hang up her racket.

Her love for the sport remains as strong as ever, though, and when she steps on Centre Court on Saturday she will do so as the popular favorite, having produced a vintage performance to end the run of British hope Johanna Konta in the semi-final. Should she prevail on Saturday, she would surpass Serena as the oldest Wimbledon women's singles champion in the professional era and the oldest since Charlotte Sterry in 1908.

I feel very focused still. There's still a lot to be done. I have one more match that I'd like to be the winner of. I have to go out there and take it,  said Williams, who reached her first major final 20 years ago in New York.  But I like to take courage in the fact that I've been playing well this tournament and this year, and all these moments have led to this.  Slideshow (2 Images)By a twist of fate Martinez will be in Muguruza's corner on Saturday, as she has been for the past fortnight in the absence of her regular coach Sam Sumyk, whose wife is expecting a baby. Martinez remains the only Spanish woman to win Wimbledon. But Muguruza, like Williams, has dropped only one set to reach the final and on Thursday produced a superb display of controlled aggression to thrash Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1 6-1. She also has the belief of knowing she can beat a Williams in a grand slam final - having overpowered Serena to win the French Open last year. Since then, her form has been patchy.  I definitely want to be the one who takes the big one,  Muguruza said. With both players boasting similar weapons - big serves and clubbing forehands, the outcome could depend on who shakes off the inevitable final nerves more quickly. Of the 42 grand slam matches in which Muguruza has won the first set she has lost only two, while Williams has won 232 of the 250 in which she has taken the opener.

Riding in a motorcade of more than a dozen black SUVs, the president rolled in to the 500-acre Trump National, becoming the first sitting U.S. head of state to attend the championship. His arrival was met by applause and some cheers, and a roar rang through the grounds when Trump made his way into the specially-built, personal viewing box overlooking the 15th green and 16th tee. The second-round leaderboard was anything but  America First , however, with the top nine all internationals on the rain-soaked 6,732-yard Old Course. Feng, the overnight leader on 66, was her steady self, following her first bogey of the tournament at the 10th with back-to-back birdies for a 70 and an eight-under-par 136 total, good for a two-shot lead over a trio of South Koreans -- Amy Yang (71), Lee Jeong-eun (69) and amateur Choi Hye-jin (69)  On my front nine, the rain was really heavy,  said Olympic bronze medallist Feng, the world number six who has won seven LPGA events, including one major.

In a court filing, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trump's March 6 executive order, which he says is needed for national security reasons, came after the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which were blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred.  The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. He ruled for the state late on Thursday. In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judge's ruling  empties the (Supreme) Court’s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just “close” family members but virtually all family members. FILE PHOTO: Tom Bossert, Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump during a news briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 11, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administration's application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request.  The truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s stay order defies common sense,  said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban.  That’s what the district court correctly found and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact.  In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government's definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense.  Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watson's ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Court's decision on that part of the executive order  effectively meaningless.  The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  The Supreme Court's decision last month revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution.

Liu, 61, died of multiple organ failure on Thursday in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer, having been given medical parole but not freed. He had been jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His wife, Liu Xia, has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. City government information official Zhang Qingyang said Liu Xiaobo was cremated on Saturday morning, in accordance with his relatives' wishes and local customs. His wife Liu Xia was present, and was given the ashes, Zhang told a news conference in Shenyang. Zhang said, according to his understanding,  Liu Xia is free.  But he did not reveal her whereabouts.  We want Liu Xia to avoid more trouble,  he added.  I believe the relevant departments will protect Liu Xia's rights according to the law.  During the past couple of weeks, Liu Xia had been at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and urged authorities to grant freedom of movement to his wife and the rest of his family. China has repeatedly attacked foreign governments for their concern about Liu and calls to allow Liu Xia to leave the country if she wishes. Liu wanted to overthrow China's political system and replace it with the Western model, the state-run Global Times tabloid said.  He was paranoid, naive and arrogant,  it said in an English-language editorial on Saturday.  He had been divorced from the main theme of Chinese society and therefore became a man of the past, a political agitator and opponent.  Liu threw himself into the lap of Western forces and Western support had become a key source of his influence, it added.  However, his influence has breached the fundamental moral principle of Chinese patriotism and posed a challenge to China's stability and national security. This is why Chinese society opposes and despises him.

Rodgers, who has struggled to translate the promise he showed as amateur world number one into professional success over the last three years, plundered eight birdies in a seven-under-par 64 at TPC Deere Run in Silvis.  The 25-year-old ended his second round on a sour note with a three-putt bogey at the last but his 13-under total of 129 was enough for the two-stroke cushion over fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, who shot a 65 to stand clear in second place.   John Deere specialist Zach Johnson, who fired a 67, and first-round co-leader Charles Howell III (69) were tied in third place on 10-under at the halfway point of the tournament. Rodgers followed in the footsteps of Woods by playing his college golf at Stanford University, where he won 11 amateur tournaments to match the tally of his illustrious predecessor. Woods went on to win 79 PGA Tour events but Rodgers is still stuck on zero, with a second-place in 2015 his best result in 77 starts. On Friday, though, he caught fire after a slow start, nailing a 50-foot chip-in for birdie at his 12th and a 50-foot birdie putt four holes later.  I'm starting to drive it nice so I’m giving myself a lot of wedges from the fairways and able to make some birdies,” Rodgers told PGATour.com, before outlining his plan to be aggressive over the weekend.  It's got to be pedal to the metal, because 13-under is not going to win this.  His first bogey of the week came at his 36th hole, the par-four ninth, where he felt he fell victim to the golfing gods.  I roasted a three-wood into a divot; hit it on the green and both my putts hit spike marks. Nothing I can do about that,” he said. DeChambeau was also a highly-credentialled amateur, one of only five players to win the U.S. Amateur Championship and the U.S. collegiate title in the same year. A physics major, DeChambeau plays with all of his irons the same length, the theory being that single-length clubs require only one swing rather than having to make constant adjustments with every change. Third-placed Johnson, meanwhile, continued his remarkable form in his hometown event, where he finished in the top three six times over seven years from 2009 to 2015, including a win in 2012.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation, unveiled on Thursday, and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the 50  yes  votes needed for passage. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition, but two Republican senators already have declared opposition.  After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,  Trump, who made gutting Obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year, wrote on Twitter from Paris, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations. The top U.S. doctors' group, the American Medical Association, on Friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare. Hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill.  The revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed Medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage,  AMA President Dr. David Barbe said, referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. A major test for McConnell's legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in 22 million Americans losing  insurance over the next decade. Related CoverageU.S. health insurers want Cruz proposal dropped from Senate billA day after that CBO analysis was issued, McConnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party, including moderates and hard-line conservatives. While the bill's prospects may look precarious, the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a vote in March in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on May 4. Pence Seeks Support Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks with reporters about the Senate health care bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 12, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinVice President Mike Pence sought to shore up support among the nation's governors at a meeting in Rhode Island, but a key Republican governor, Ohio's John Kasich, came out strongly against the revised bill, saying its Medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market. Kasich's opposition could put pressure on Rob Portman, a  Republican senator from Ohio, who has not yet taken a position on the bill. If the current Senate legislation collapses, some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of Obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) (C) departs after a Senate Republican caucus meeting about an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017.Jonathan Ernst There are changes that need to be made to the law,  Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC, citing  a bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue.  Moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul already oppose the revised Senate bill. Other Republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal, including Portman, Mike Lee, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Cory Gardner, Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy floated an alternative plan. The new version was crafted to satisfy the Republican Party's various elements, including moderates worried about Americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard-line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance. A provision championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap, bare-bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under Obamacare. But two major health insurance groups, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on McConnell to drop the Cruz proposal, saying it would undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions, raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market. The bill retained certain Obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated, a step moderates could embrace. But it kept the core of the earlier bill, including ending the expansion of Medicaid that was instrumental in enabling Obamacare to expand coverage to 20 million people, and restructuring that social safety-net program. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week, Senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on Tuesday or Wednesday, a move that requires a majority vote.

The Warrick smelter in Indiana has annual capacity of 269,000 tonnes, its own coal-based power source and is integrated with a rolling mill.  None of which saved it from Alcoa's scramble down the cost curve in the face of falling prices, culminating in its permanent closure in January 2016.  That's different from what the industry calls a  curtailment , a temporary idling for possible restart.  But now, miraculously, Warrick is back and Alcoa will fire up three of the plant's five production lines, with capacity of 161,400 tonnes of aluminum. The other two will be classified as  curtailed . The timing of this resurrection is politically charged.  The Trump administration is determined to curb imports of aluminum, along with steel, with the aid of some heavy national security artillery. The results of both so-called Section 232 investigations are pending. And Alcoa, for one,  appreciates the actions the Trump administration has taken to address the challenges faced by the U.S. aluminum industry, including Chinese overcapacity .  The United States had 23 operating plants in 1998. It now has five, soon to be become six. There is a little more than a million tonnes of capacity lying idled, ready for restart if the conditions are right.  However, most of the lost smelters are long past the point of resurrection, with plants dismantled and sites reclaimed. China, with its massive aluminum sector and equally massive exports, stands accused, but the real smelter killers were much closer to home.   Price and Power Alcoa's change of mind is in part down to the aluminum price, which has risen from below $1,500 a tonne in January 2016 to more than $1,900 today. It has done so, ironically, on the promise of Chinese capacity cuts.  But there is also a power supply dimension, Alcoa noting an agreement with local utility Vectren to operate one of the four on-site power generation units through 2023.  This, Alcoa says,  provides important clarity for the power portfolio at Warrick , albeit without providing a lot of clarity for the rest of us.  The key point, however, is that there is always a power dimension in the mix when aluminum smelters close or restart. They use a lot of it and profitability is determined primarily by the interaction of power and aluminum prices.  West Coast Killer It was the breakdown in that relationship in 2000-01 that dealt the killer blow for the 10 smelters feeding off the power generated by hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  One of the more interesting submissions to the Section 232 hearings on aluminum imports came from Tim Belden of EnergyGPS Consulting. Belden used the events of 2000-01 to underline the importance of power availability and price in determining smelter viability.  Those were the years now known as the Western U.S. Energy Crisis, when California was hit by blackouts and wholesale power prices went supernova. The price rises, Belden says, were  of a magnitude and duration that had never been seen before or since in any North American power market . All ten aluminum smelters closed. Five never restarted. Two tried and failed. Only one, Alcoa's Intalco plant in Washington, is currently producing aluminum, albeit after multiple near-death experiences.  The West Coast power crisis was caused by a toxic combination of too little generation capacity, a chaotic pricing model and the machinations of traders who manipulated the flawed system.  So, if you want to know who killed the northwest aluminum smelters, it was Enron.  That flawed company was at the front of the line for official sanction. In June 2003 it was stripped by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of some of its power and gas trading rights for its role in the crisis.  Financial Killer While Enron killed the West Coast smelters in 2000, bankers killed another batch a decade later. The global financial crisis brought a collapse in aluminum demand as the U.S. automotive industry went into meltdown. Prices slumped and London-traded aluminum hit a low of $1,279 a tonne early in 2009.  By the end of that year another four plants had halted production: Alcoa's smelters in Texas and Tennessee, Century Aluminum's Ravenswood smelter in West Virginia and Glencore's Columbia Falls smelter in Montana. The latter was a survivor of the earlier power crisis.  Another, Ormet's Hannibal plant in Ohio, limped on but never fully recovered and gave up the ghost in 2012. Made in the u.s., Powered in the u.s.  It's the remaining nine plants, three of them still inactive, that are now fighting for survival against what is the relatively new threat of Chinese overproduction.  While China doesn't export aluminum in commodity form, it ships out a lot of semi-manufactured products, which displace demand for the rest of the world's producers, not least in the United States.  That could change if the Section 232 investigation results in import quotas or tariffs.  How much of the battered U.S. smelter sector could be brought out of mothballs?  Alcoa and Century between them are running only two of their combined five operating smelters at capacity. Including the two lines on standby at Warrick, idled capacity at active plants is about 420,000 tonnes.  There is another 640,000 tonnes of capacity at three inactive plants.  The New Madrid smelter in Missouri was last year bought out of bankruptcy by Swiss-based ARG International AG, led by former Glencore trader Matt Lucke, with the aim of restarting the 263,000 tonne a year plant.  Alcoa has idled capacity at Wenatchee in Washington, another  Enron survivor , and at Rockdale in Texas. Yes, the same Texas smelter that shut up shop in 2008. Alcoa closed permanently two of its six lines in 2012 but four, with capacity of 191,000 tonnes, are still primed for restart.  Old smelters, it seems, can sleep for a long time. But to awaken, they need the right power price as much as the right aluminum price.  And it is  competitive power  that will determine the extent of any U.S. aluminum smelter revival.  That is why Alcoa has been able to bring back Warrick.   We were pleased to play an important role in helping make this a reality,  said Carl Chapman, chairman, president and CEO of power utility Vectren. It will likely determine ARG's success in bringing back to life what has been renamed that Magnitude 7 Metals smelter.  Missouri lawmakers passed a bill in May, freeing up utilities to enter longer-term, lower-priced supply contracts, offering the plant a potential lifeline.  The Trump administration wants more aluminum to be made in the United States, and import tariffs would tilt the playing field in that direction.  But when it comes to aluminum,  made in the America  needs to be powered in America -- and that's down to local utilities, not national policy.

Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the  worst trade deal ever  in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America's favor.  But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports.   Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers.    Infographic ID: '2tNMtlc'      Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,  said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado.  Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork.  Mexico became even more crucial after Trump's pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers' hopes of free access to more markets.  Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration's goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer's list.  Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump's inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump's ear.   Our first ask is to do no harm,  said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group.  Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August.  Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association, Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land O'Lakes, Inc., Tyson Foods(TSN.N), Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company North America, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and others.  For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA  would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.   Quadrupling Exports  FILE PHOTO - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer speaks during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, U.S. on May 15, 2017.Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoAnnual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA.  Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers' case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices.  Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture's cause in NAFTA and beyond.   He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,  Roberts said.  I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it's going to make life much more difficult in farm country,  Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June.  In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the  tremendous growth  in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA.  Slideshow (4 Images) Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,  they warned.  Trump's pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers.   What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state's low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said.  Storm Over Sunny Slope  Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers' angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer's Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA.   If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,  said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion.  While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico's ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump's  America First  mantra.   The common comment is: 'why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?'  said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council.  The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,  he said.  It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.  Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that.   I think President Trump is a negotiator,  he said.  I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.

The figure was less however than the 2 percent government forecast for 2017 in a country where traditionally activity slows in the second half of the year. The Communist-run island's economy slipped into its first recession in nearly a quarter century last year, as it wrestled with declining oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, a slide in exports and a lack of cash. In his speech to the Cuban parliament that meets twice a year, Cabrisas said  this conjunction of accumulated problems cannot be resolved completely in the short term.  He added the coming half year would not be exempt from tensions, according to the state-run Cuban News Agency. The Caribbean island is struggling to pay foreign providers on time and seeking longer payment terms, Western diplomats say. The minister acknowledged liquidity problems in his speech. Meanwhile, Venezuela's crude and fuel deliveries to Cuba slid almost 13 percent in the first half this year, according to documents from state-run oil company PDVSA viewed by Reuters. The main bright spot in the economy, tourism, performed strongly in the first half of the year with the number of tourists rising 23 percent on the year, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero told the National Assembly on Wednesday. But U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba as part of a rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente, casting a shadow over the industry's outlook. Cabrisas said that besides tourism, construction, transport, communications drove economic growth in the first half of the year. Agricultural production was also positive, except for beef and milk, he said. The minister added that the government had approved 11 new ventures, five in the Mariel special development zone, which Cuba wants to develop into the Caribbean's main shipping hub, and six outside. Since becoming president in 2008, Raul Castro has sought to update Cuba's Soviet-style command economy, cutting the bloated state payroll, introducing reforms and aiming to drum up foreign investment. The United Nations estimates the Cuban economy will grow 1 percent this year, in line with a 1.1 percent expansion on average throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.

Polls show President Enrique Pena Nieto's centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) faces a struggle to fend off rivals from left and right, especially the challenge of two-time presidential runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  Corruption scandals, rising gang violence and anemic growth have damaged the PRI's credibility and battered Pena Nieto's authority, prompting some in the party to argue it must look beyond the membership if it wants to hold on to power. High on the list of potential options is Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, who has held most of the top jobs outside the presidency under two rival administrations. PRI Secretary General Claudia Ruiz Massieu said the party would decide in an assembly next month whether to change rules that could allow the likes of Meade to participate, praising him and other possible runners as exemplary public servants.  There's no doubt he's someone with many of the attributes that could come together in a potential candidate flying the flag for the PRI,  she said in an interview late on Thursday.

An old friend of Pena Nieto's ally, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, Meade began the Pena Nieto administration as foreign minister while Videgaray held the finance job. He took another ministerial post before returning to the finance ministry. Slideshow (2 Images)Unassuming and well-regarded by diplomats and financiers, Meade is also seen as a possible replacement for central bank governor Agustin Carstens when he leaves on Nov. 30. In contrast to many PRI heavyweights, Meade is untainted by graft scandals and he has kept his options open for next year. The PRI's statutes presently permit  supporters  who are not party members to run for all offices bar the presidency. A number of early polls for the July 2018 election have given a lead to former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador, who has campaigned relentlessly on an anti-corruption message. New potential presidential contenders within the PRI have also emerged in recent months, including Tourism Minister Enrique de la Madrid and Health Minister Jose Narro Robles.

Jul 14, 2017; London, United Kingdom; Roger Federer (SUI) in action during his match against Tomas Berdych (CZE) on day eleven at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsBerdych, who reached the semi-final after second seed Novak Djokovic retired hurt in the quarters, spent a diligent two hours and 18 minutes at the coalface on Friday. But while 31-year-old toiled with his muscular game it was the dashing Federer who supplied the gems. Federer, contesting a record 12th Wimbledon semi-final, broke serve in the fifth game when he ran Berdych ragged before whipping a ball out of the air into the corner. Slideshow (13 Images)Out of nowhere Berdych broke back for 4-4 when Federer - to gasps from the crowd - double-faulted at break point down. Berdych's best chance of shaking Federer out of his silky rhythm was to grab the opening set but a terrible forehand at 3-4 in the subsequent tiebreak allowed Federer breathing space which he used to clinch the opener. Tennis has seen few better front-runners than Federer and while Berdych manfully stayed with his opponent in the second set he never was able to apply any real pressure. His only chance came when he had Federer 15-40 down at 2-3 but, as great champions do, the Swiss responded with a couple of slide-rule aces to avert the danger. Three consecutive forehand winners gave a ruthless Federer control of the second set tiebreak as he moved two sets clear. Berdych refused to throw in the towel and had break points at 3-3 in the third set, only for Federer to fling down three aces to finally break his rival's spirit. The end came quickly as Federer broke in the next game and he sealed victory, his 90th at the All England Club, when Berdych netted a forehand, prompting a standing ovation from the crowd who simply cannot get enough of the Swiss history-maker.

Also featuring a bi-national fly-past of American F16 and French Rafale jets symbolizing military cooperation in the Middle East and elsewhere, the occasion followed a day of talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, a first ladies' tour of Paris, and a dinner for the four at a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.  Great evening with President @EmmanuelMacron & Mrs. Macron. Went to Eiffel Tower for dinner. Relationship with France stronger than ever,  Trump wrote in a tweet. The ceremonies brought to an end a visit Macron needs as a boost to France's standing on the world stage - one which could also help a U.S. leader left short of international friends by his stance on free trade and climate change. Trump, also dogged at home by an investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, appeared on Thursday to leave open the door for more talks on the Paris accord which he pulled the United States out of earlier this year.

French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump attend the traditional Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, France, July 14, 2017.Charles PlatiauBut it came as a fierce row raged between Macron and his armed forces chief, General Pierre de Villiers, over proposed defense budget cuts that are part of his bid to put the French economy in order. Trump arrived with his wife Melania in a black sedan to be greeted by French first lady Brigitte Macron. At the parade, the two heads of state sat together in a stand applauding, pointing and touching each other on the arm as military aircraft flew overhead. Trump saluted as U.S. military personnel - some in World War One battledress - opened the march-past with the Arc de Triomphe in the background.

I want to thank America for the choice made a hundred years ago       By the end of the 1914-1918 war, more than a million U.S. troops were stationed in France alongside soldiers of French, British and other nationalities fighting Germany.  One marching group evoked another military landmark of Franco-American history, carrying a pennant marked  Fregate Lafayette , a frigate of the French navy named after the 18th century French aristocrat general Marquis de Lafayette, who helped in the American Revolutionary War against the British. For France, this year's Bastille Day has an additional poignancy as the first anniversary of one of the deadliest Islamist militant attacks of the past few years. After the parade, his first as President, Macron will head for the Mediterranean city of Nice, where he will join a commemoration for the 86 people who died when a Tunisian man drove a truck at a crowd on the waterfront a year ago.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover losses from its nuclear reactor business. In late June, Toshiba announced its preferred bidder was a group made up of Bain Capital, South Korean chip maker SK Hynix and Japanese-government backed banks that offered $18 billion. Western Digital, which is also bidding, sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court in mid-June, saying it believed a joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba needs its consent to sell the flash business. Western Digital's joint venture with Toshiba helps finance equipment at Toshiba's plants in exchange for some of their output. Separately from the California lawsuit, Western Digital is also contesting its consent rights in an international arbitration tribunal. Western Digital filed its lawsuit in San Francisco to prevent Toshiba from closing the sale of its memory unit before arbitration has a chance to play out. At the hearing, Judge Kahn proposed requiring Toshiba to give Western Digital two weeks notice if it believed it would close the sale before the arbitration finished. Toshiba's attorney said they were concerned about agreeing to be bound by the San Francisco court's jurisdiction. Toshiba has argued that because it is a Japanese company and the deal is taking place mostly in Japan, the court should not have jurisdiction. Attorneys for Western Digital subsidiary SanDisk, which is formally party to the case, expressed concern that any order in which Toshiba did not agree to the court's jurisdiction would not be enforceable. The two sides could not agree, so Judge Kahn instructed them to come up with final language for his proposed order and set a new hearing for July 28, when a related dispute between the two will be heard. In a statement, Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan called the proposed order and postponement a  victory.   Our entire goal was to preserve and protect our rights through the binding arbitration process, and that’s precisely what the court has done today,  Milligan said. Toshiba called Judge Kahn's proposed order  a 'finessed' alternative to issuing a preliminary injunction  and confirmed it agreed not to close a sale before July 28.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-accounting-western-digital-idUSL1N1K600B"},

Fujimori, 78, has spent the past decade as the lone inmate in Barbadillo prison, nestled in a police base on the outskirts of Lima, where he is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 rightwing government. Humala, a former military officer whose five-year term ended a year ago, was transferred via police helicopter to Barbadillo where he will be held in custody until prosecutors conclude their money laundering investigation. Humala's attorneys had sought better conditions for their client than Peru's overcrowded jails. A judge ruled on Thursday that Humala and wife Nadine Heredia must be jailed before an eventual trial to keep them from fleeing or obstructing a criminal probe linked to Brazilian builder Odebrecht. The couple has denied wrongdoing and had immediately turned themselves in, calling the measure an abuse of power. Humala became a national figure when he commanded a group of soldiers to rebel against Fujimori's government as it collapsed amid a graft scandal in 2000. He later rallied Fujimori's opponents behind him to beat Fujimori's daughter, Keiko, in the 2011 presidential election. Still, Fujimori's son, Congressman Kenji Fujimori, expressed solidarity with Humala and Heredia's children.  I went through those tough times myself. Stay strong,  he said on Twitter. Peru built Barbadillo for Fujimori before he was extradited from Chile in 2007. His cell includes a bedroom, office and access to a courtyard where he gardens, according to Peru's National Penitentiary Institute (INPE). Fujimori and Humala will not share common spaces, INPE said. After Odebrecht admitted in December to paying $29 million in bribes to high-ranking officials in Peru over three presidencies, Peru's justice minister said additional cells were being built at Barbadillo but did not specify for whom. INPE director Carlos Vasquez said on local broadcaster RPP that Humala has special security needs as a former official, but that Barbadillo was not necessarily a prison for ex-presidents. Former president Alejandro Toledo, another staunch opponent of Fujimori, has also been ordered to pre-trial detention in connection with an Odebrecht probe. Toledo has denied wrongdoing and has refused to turn himself in. In an odd twist of fate, Fujimori might leave Barbadillo before Humala. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who endorsed Keiko Fujimori against Humala in 2011, last month proposed evaluating pardoning Fujimori for health reasons as he seeks better ties with Fujimori's supporters in Congress. In 2013, Humala rejected Fujimori's request for a pardon.

The government proposed the bill as a comprise measure after local residents, who see the Jamanxim national forest as a source of livelihood, blocked a key grains exporting highway in response to President Michel Temer's veto of similar legislation to reduce its protected area.       The government's bill, if approved, would create a new protection area (APA) near the town of Novo Progresso, which is on the edge of the forest around 790 miles (1,270 kms) northwest of the capital Brasilia. The measure would convert 349,086 hectares, or 27 percent of the national forest into an APA, the ministry said. The government said the APA would discipline land occupation, promoting the sustainable use of the rainforest and conservation of its water resources. Environmentalists denounced the measure as an official stimulus to land-grabbing, which in turn leads to illegal logging, clear-cutting and mining in one of the hotspots of deforestation of the Amazon biome.  The bill is seen as an amnesty for illegal occupation of the conservancy unit,  said Observatório do Clima on its website, adding the government  yielded to pressure  from the rural lobby. FILE PHOTO: A police officer inspects a tree illegally felled in the Amazon rainforest in Jamanxim National Park near the city of Novo Progresso, Para State, Brazil June 21, 2013.Nacho Doce/File photoThe bill followed blockades this month of the BR-163 highway, which runs next to the 1.3 million-hectare national forest. The highway links grain producing regions in Mato Grosso state to waterways connected to key Northern ports. Protesters suspended the blockades, which began on July 3, after Temer sent the bill to Congress, according to a statement from the Sociedade Civil Organizada group on Friday. Earlier in the day, Brazil's federal highway police said the BR-163 highway was cleared in the Southwest of Pará after almost two weeks of protests. Carlos Xavier, president of a group in Pará lobbying to reduce the size of the Jamanxim forest, said the APA would bring economic progress to the region. The BR-163 protests were preventing trucks from unloading grains at the riverside hub of Miritituba, the departure point for barges carrying crops to the Northern ports before hitting export markets. Brazilian private ports association ATP said this week it expected $47 million in losses this month as a result of the protests.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover losses from its nuclear reactor business.  In late June, Toshiba announced its preferred bidder was a group made up of Bain Capital, South Korean chip maker SK Hynix and Japanese-government backed banks that offered $18 billion. Western Digital, which is also bidding, sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court in mid-June, saying it believed a joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba needs its consent to sell the flash business. Western Digital's joint venture with Toshiba helps finance equipment at Toshiba's plants in exchange for some of their output.  Separately from the California lawsuit, Western Digital is also contesting its consent rights in an international arbitration tribunal. Western Digital filed its lawsuit in San Francisco to prevent Toshiba from closing the sale of its memory unit before arbitration has a chance to play out. At the hearing, Judge Kahn proposed requiring Toshiba to give Western Digital two weeks notice if it believed it would close the sale before the arbitration finished. Toshiba's attorney said they were concerned about agreeing to be bound by the San Francisco court's jurisdiction. Toshiba has argued that because it is a Japanese company and the deal is taking place mostly in Japan, the court should not have jurisdiction. Attorneys for Western Digital subsidiary SanDisk, which is formally party to the case, expressed concern that any order in which Toshiba did not agree to the court's jurisdiction would not be enforceable. The two sides could not agree, so Judge Kahn instructed them to come up with final language for his proposed order and set a new hearing for July 28, when a related dispute between the two will be heard.

Seoul imported 1.15 million tonnes of crude from Tehran in June, or 281,338 barrels per day (bpd), compared with 1.04 million tonnes a year ago, customs data showed on Saturday. In the first half of the year, South Korea's intake of Iranian oil jumped 51.5 percent to 9.27 million tonnes, or 375,597 bpd, over the same period a year ago. South Korea is one of the main Asian customers for Iranian crude, including an ultra-light oil known as condensate. Although Iran ranked as South Korea's second-biggest crude oil supplier in the January-March period in 2017, the data showed it slid to No.3 spot behind Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the first half of this year as Iran struggled to keep condensate shipment volumes after clearing stocks stored on tankers. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is exempt from the oil producer club's commitment to cut production to clear a global glut. Iran has been pumping around 3.8 million bpd in recent months and expects its oil output to rise to about 4 million bpd by the end of the year, its deputy oil minister Hossein Zamaninia said. Meanwhile, South Korea's imports from Kuwait declined 13.2 percent in June from a year ago to 1.53 million tonnes, or 374,010 bpd, according to the data. But Kuwait regained No.2 position in the first six months of 2017 with almost 11 million tonnes of crude shipment in the Jan-June period of 2017, or 445,123 bpd, up 2.9 percent from the same time last year. In June, oil supplies from Saudi Arabia rose 13.7 percent to 3.48 million tonnes, or 849,772 bpd, a year ago, the data noted. Korea's oil imports from the world's top exporter climbed 4.2 percent to 21.71 million tonnes in the first half of 2017. Overall, the world's fifth-biggest crude importer brought in 11.61 million tonnes of oil last month, or 2.84 million bpd, up 3.2 percent from 11.26 million tonnes a year ago. In the first six months of 2017, South Korea imported 72.24 million tonnes of crude, or 2.93 million bpd, up 1.8 percent from nearly 71 million tonnes over the same period last year. Final data for June crude oil imports by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) is due later this month.

(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday warned U.S. governors against  politically tempting shortcuts  as the two countries and Mexico prepare to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). U.S. President Donald Trump has described the 1994 pact as  the worst trade deal ever  and vowed to change it to the advantage of the United States in talks due to begin later this summer. Trump's stance on the accord has led Trudeau's government to reach out aggressively to U.S. leaders, including one-on-one meetings on Friday with Vice President Mike Pence and the governors of Kentucky, Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Iowa. The meetings are intended to emphasize the importance of the two countries' trading relationship.  Sometimes getting it right means refusing to take the politically tempting shortcuts,  Trudeau told a meeting of the U.S. National Governors Association in Providence, Rhode Island.  More trade barriers, more local-content provisions, more preferential access for homegrown players in government procurement, for example, does not help working families over the long term, or even the mid-term. Such policies kill growth.  He warned that protectionist postures run the risk of becoming  a cycle of tit-for-tat, a race to the bottom, where all sides lose.

We will modernize NAFTA for the 21st century so it is a win-win-win for all our trade partners in North America,  Pence, the former governor of Indiana, told the group.  We are looking forward to bringing NAFTA into the future in a way that will equally benefit both our countries.  Slideshow (14 Images)In a nod to the concerns about competition with foreign labor that influenced Trump's populist trade stance, Trudeau said that state and national governments needed to do more to ensure that the benefits of trade were felt by a wider slice of the population.  We think right upfront about how to make sure that benefits that will come from trade inevitably accrue to more of the population,  he said. Trudeau also told reporters on Friday that Trump told him that he did not expect to subject Canadian steel and aluminum to face tariffs on national security grounds.  I am optimistic that this important trade, which leads to millions of good jobs on both sides of the border, will continue,  Trudeau said.

Trump threatened to ditch the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement too, but eventually decided to renegotiate the pact in talks with Mexico and Canada due to begin in mid-August. On Monday U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will offer first insights into the administration's strategy when he presents Congress its objectives for the NAFTA negotiations. Several U.S. administration  officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Lighthizer will outline plans for updating NAFTA rather than seek a major overhaul of the agreement. While the administration has said it hopes to complete NAFTA negotiations by the end of the year, the strategy will not set a timeline, they say. Thus far, the Trump administration offered few specifics, other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to account for digital trade that was in its infancy in the early 1990s and to tackle festering issues on labor, environment, intellectual property rights and state-owned enterprises.    Since those areas have already been addressed in the TPP negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama and agreed by Canada and Mexico, the pact provides a useful template that could help speed up the NAFTA negotiations, U.S. officials say. They warn, however, that no final decision has been made on using TPP language. TPP requires members, for example, to allow independent unions, set working hours and safety standards and deter forced labor and has set higher environment standards than any other previous U.S. trade deal.  Related CoveragePence, Trudeau discuss U.S.-Canada trade disagreementsMexico finance minister says NAFTA talks create economic uncertaintyCanada's Trudeau warns against 'tempting shortcuts' in NAFTA renegotiationsThe pact also set a 70-year copyright term and eight years of patent protection for costly biologic drugs, significantly less than the 12 years applied in the United States. More Ambitious Deal Lawmakers from the U.S. industrial heartland particularly want to see enforceable labor standards that would lift Mexico's chronically low wages, which they blame for U.S. factories migrating south of the border.  A lot of the negotiators were just in the room a few years ago doing this stuff. They know where the bodies are buried,  said one business executive with knowledge of NAFTA deliberations. Some lawmakers want a more ambitious deal than TPP.  Donald Trump promised to get a better deal than TPP, and Americans are going to be deeply disappointed if he doesn’t follow through on NAFTA negotiations,  said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and an influential voice on trade matters. In particular, Canada and Mexico should be able to agree to U.S. proposals on digital trade and environment that got watered down in the final TPP text, Wyden told Reuters.  This is a once-in-a-generation chance to rewrite NAFTA. Trump can’t squander this opportunity.  The demands the Trump administration makes in the talks  could have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade relations across the globe, with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be pulling back. One area to watch will be the so-called rules of origin that determine how much regional content a product must have to be exempt from tariffs. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has frequently said NAFTA needed to tighten those rules to prevent China from using the trade bloc as a tariff-free  back door  to the U.S. market. Analysts say any U.S. demands for more specifically U.S. rather than broadly North American content for autos or other manufactured goods would be a tough sell, though Mexico has indicated it could be ready for some concessions to strengthen the region's defenses against Asian competition. Christopher Padilla, former U.S. under secretary for international trade at the U.S. Commerce Department now at IBM, believes that merely  tweaking  the rules of origin would be enough to satisfy Trump's political agenda, but it still may require companies to alter their supply chains. The clarion call from U.S. business groups in the lead-up to the talks is  do no harm.  U.S. and international companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars building integrated North American supply networks and Trump rang alarm bells in corporate boardrooms in April when he threatened to terminate the pact. Trump backed off after a furious lobbying effort, but analysts say he may still choose a  hard exit  if the talks fail to achieve his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. NAFTA has quadrupled trade between the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade through to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs, a figure that resonates with Trump. U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2oYClp2) Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration would risk derailing the talks if it focused on reducing the trade imbalance with Mexico, like it has threatened to do.  We're talking about an imbalance of $60 billion and there is no way under the sun that Mexico can eliminate that or even make a big dent in that without doing some really massive uneconomic distortion of trade flows.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it learned that Donald Eugene Webb, who had one of the longest-ever runs on the FBI's  Ten Most Wanted  list, said it learned Webb had died in 1999 but did not provide information on cause of death. Webb's remains were found buried in the back of a property in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, the agency said. State police had obtained a search warrant as part of a separate gambling investigation, prosecutors said. Webb had been sought in connection with the murder of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, Police Chief Greg Adams, who the FBI said was shot twice at close range and beaten about the head and face with a blunt instrument in December 1980. Webb, who would have marked his 86th birthday on Friday if he were still alive, had been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest. Thomas King, a lawyer for Adams' widow, said in an email that he was told by prosecutors that Webb's former wife had told authorities about the remains in exchange for immunity. The FBI said Webb was a career criminal who specialized in jewelry store burglaries and was known to be a  a lover of dogs, a flashy dresser and a big tipper.  The agency added Webb to its  Ten Most Wanted  list in May 1981, and he remained on it until March 2007. The FBI said it had notified Adams' family of the discovery of Webb's remains.

Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura put the emphasis on the international fight against terrorism on Friday as he wrapped up a round of Syria peace talks at which there was  no breakthrough, no breakdown and no one walking out . Speaking at a news conference after briefing the U.N. Security Council by video, de Mistura said he felt the U.N. was expected to say where it stood on the fight against terrorism, which he said was  becoming the main issue being discussed at the highest possible level elsewhere.  Discussion of terrorism has been a constant demand of the Syrian government since the series of talks began early last year, and it was added to the formal agenda earlier this year, along with talks about a new constitution, reformed governance and fresh elections. The main opposition group, the High Negotiations Committee, wants a focus on political transition, meaning an end to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. De Mistura said Assad's negotiators had not given any indication that they were willing to discuss transition.  But what I do believe is that what are going to be the next steps of the international community in wanting to see an acceleration of the end of this conflict may help the government to be ready to address the political process,  he said.  Although the Syrian government has repeatedly described opposition representatives as terrorists, de Mistura said he hoped to push all sides to at least sit in the same room during the next round of talks in September.

De Mistura suggested that was on track, since the three opposition leaders had built mutual trust and confidence and planned to meet again later this month. Slideshow (7 Images)Laying out his understanding of the fight against terrorism, de Mistura said it only related to groups identified by the U.N. Security Council as terrorists, and it must be done in accordance with humanitarian law and human rights law.  Implementation of U.N. resolutions on arming and financing terrorists and the movement of foreign fighters had been very slow, he said, and he expected to see increased efforts against U.N.-listed groups and coordinated action wherever possible.  Such efforts were already being undertaken against Islamic State in Raqqa and by the Syrian government and its allies in areas around the cities of Aleppo, Homs and Hama, he said. The best guarantee against terrorism was a political agreement achieved through a U.N.-led transitional process.  Otherwise in three months time, after Raqqa, there will be a new entity coming up and they will be calling themselves differently and we will be back to that.

The deal would mark Crown Castle's biggest acquisition to date, giving it ownership of a broadband infrastructure provider with significant fiber assets, which would allow it to further diversify away from its traditional tower business. Private equity firm Berkshire Partners LLC, the majority owner of Lightower, will spend the next few days analyzing Crown Castle's bid before agreeing to a sale, the sources said on Friday. A deal could come as early as this month, the sources added. Lightower attracted interest from other telecommunications infrastructure companies, including Uniti Group Inc (UNIT.O), which do not have Crown Castle's deep pockets, the sources added.  Crown Castle, which is organized as a real estate investment trust, has a market capitalization of $37 billion, while Uniti's market capitalization is $4.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  Berkshire Partners declined to comment, while Lightower, Crown Castle and Uniti did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A sale of Lightower would be the latest example of consolidation in the telecommunications infrastructure sector, as companies seek scale to cope with heavier mobile phone and internet traffic. CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) agreed to buy Level 3 Communications (LVLT.N) for $34 billion last year, including debt, adding 200,000 miles of fiber to its network. Based in Houston, Crown Castle's portfolio includes 40,000 towers and 29,000 miles of fiber-supporting small-cell towers. Small-cell towers are increasingly in demand by wireless carriers, as they try to boost coverage and increase capacity, especially in urban areas.  Crown Castle has embarked on an acquisition spree for fiber assets, buying Wilcon Holdings LLC for $600 million last month. It bought FPL FiberNet Holdings LLC in January from Nextera Energy Inc (NEE.N) for $1.5 billion.  Formed by Berkshire Partners, Lightower's network spans 3,000 fiber route miles and serves the financial services industry, as well as government clients over its network in the Northeastern United States. Berkshire Partners led an acquisition and merger of Lightower and another enterprise telecommunications service provider, Sidera Networks, in 2013, in a deal valued at more than $2 billion.

In an interview with Reuters almost a year after the coup attempt, Ambassador Serdar Kilic expressed frustration over the halting U.S. response to its request for Gulen’s extradition and urged Washington to use its data-collection capabilities to help prove Ankara’s accusations against him. “They should help us in this regard. We don't have national intelligence authority in the United States,  he said at the Turkish embassy.  President Donald Trump's administration is taking Turkey's extradition request “more seriously” than Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, Kilic told a news conference later on Friday, but he did not elaborate. Kilic said the United States had not given any sign of when it would decide what to do with Gulen, who denies any involvement in the July 15, 2016, coup attempt.  Kilic cited confessions by some alleged coup plotters and visits he said they paid Gulen at his Pennsylvania compound in the days leading up to the failed putsch as proof that the 79-year-old cleric was behind the coup, in which more than 240 people were killed. However, Kilic acknowledged in the Reuters interview that more concrete evidence of direct involvement by Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999, remains elusive.  If you are asking for a written instruction by Fethullah Gulen to the members of the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization in the army, that would be a futile request,” Kilic said, adding that the planning was done in secrecy. Alp Aslandogan, Gulen's media adviser, said the cleric does not own a cellphone, the land line at his compound is attended by staff members and he does not use email, suggesting that any effort to scour Gulen's communications might yield little. He also said he had not seen any signs of the Trump administration giving the Gulen extradition case a higher priority. He said confessions of coup plotters implicating Gulen were suspect because of accusations that their testimony was  obtained under duress and sometimes torture.  Ankara has repeatedly denied the accusations while saying a firm security posture is needed in the face of dangers it also faces from Kurdish militants as well as wars in neighboring Iraq and Syria.     The U.S. Justice Department declined any comment on the case. Stalled Extradition President Tayyip Erdogan said in May he would pursue  to the end  Gulen’s extradition and has waged a post-coup crackdown on his followers. Kilic told reporters on Friday that U.S. officials had requested further evidence, in addition to 84 boxes of documents already provided, and that Turkey was working to comply. He said in the meantime Turkey wants the United States to limit Gulen's freedom of movement. Aslandogan said the call for such restrictions on Gulen, who is frail-looking and walks with a shuffle, was part of a  harassment campaign  by the Turkish government. Prospects for the U.S. extradition of Gulen appeared to dim in February when Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned over his failure to disclose the extent of his contacts with Russia. Kilic said he met Flynn, who was outspoken in favor of Gulen's extradition, “a couple of times,” described him as “visionary  and said he wished Flynn were still in office.

The government proposed the bill as a comprise measure after local residents, who see the Jamanxim national forest as a source of livelihood, blocked a key grains exporting highway in response to President Michel Temer's veto of similar legislation to reduce its protected area.       The government's bill, if approved, would create a new protection area (APA) near the town of Novo Progresso, which is on the edge of the forest around 790 miles (1,270 kms) northwest of the capital Brasilia. The measure would convert 349,086 hectares, or 27 percent of the national forest into an APA, the ministry said. The government said the APA would discipline land occupation, promoting the sustainable use of the rainforest and conservation of its water resources. Environmentalists denounced the measure as an official stimulus to land-grabbing, which in turn leads to illegal logging, clear-cutting and mining in one of the hotspots of deforestation of the Amazon biome.  The bill is seen as an amnesty for illegal occupation of the conservancy unit,  said Observatório do Clima on its website, adding the government  yielded to pressure  from the rural lobby.

Carlos Xavier, president of a group in Pará lobbying to reduce the size of the Jamanxim forest, said the APA would bring economic progress to the region.

Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a “Section 232” review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before.  The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration. Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices.  But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers. Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.   “Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,” said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.  Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry. Pros and Cons Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers.    The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis.  FILE PHOTO - Rebar is seen in New York May 6, 2013.Eric ThayerBut manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs.  Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves. When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down. Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs. Political Risk Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump’s campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors.       They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “We’ve been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,” said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who  declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House.  Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists.  Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc., Ball Corporation, and Electrolux, submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs.  The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil, Shell Oil Company, Chevron and Dow Chemical Company, issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors. “The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,” the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments.

We felt recent bearish sentiment was a bit too extreme  in the bond market as reflected in the jump in yields, Ivascyn said in a telephone interview. Ivascyn said moderate growth, low inflation, a cautious U.S. central bank, limited policy traction in Washington and continued global central bank accommodation  will support lower, range-bound rates.  Ivascyn added that the email controversy involving the son of U.S. President Donald Trump  is one of many distractions that will make it a bit more difficult to pass meaningful legislation impacting the economy.  Ivascyn's views and opinions are widely followed as he helps oversee one of the largest asset management firms in the world.  On Thursday, Pimco said it oversaw $1.61 trillion as of June 30, up from $1.51 trillion in the previous quarter and $1.47 trillion at the end of last year. The company, which is a unit of Germany’s Allianz SE, did not disclose how much of the second-quarter rise in assets was attributable to new client money moving in, and which portion came from the performance of the funds it manages. The rebound in assets over the past year-and-a-half has been driven by Ivascyn’s Pimco Income Fund and a corporate bond fund managed by Mark Kiesel, chief investment officer for global credit.  The Income Fund earlier this year surpassed the size of Pimco’s Total Return Fund and managed $88.8 billion at the end of June, having more than doubled in size since the end of 2014. The Pimco Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund managed by Kiesel now holds assets of $10.8 billion, having roughly doubled from mid-2014.  Pimco’s flagship Total Return Fund, once the world's largest bond fund at a peak of $292.9 billion in assets under management in April 2013, has shrunk to $73.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Ivascyn declined to comment on the fund.  Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-pimco-idUSL1N1K51PQ"},

NBC News, which did not identify the Russian-American lobbyist, said some U.S. officials suspected him of still having ties to Russian intelligence, something he denied to the network.  The Associated Press said the lobbyist, whom it identified as Rinat Akhmetshin, confirmed that he had attended the June 2016 meeting in New York's Trump Tower. A source familiar with the participants of the meeting confirmed to Reuters that Akhmetshin was in the room. The meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trump's election campaign and Russia, a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort were also at the meeting, which the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to attend because he believed he could get damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. did not mention Akhmetshin's presence when he released a series of emails about the meeting earlier this week.  Deeply Disturbing     Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the report about Akhmetshin  if accurate, adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.  Akhmetshin was not available for comment on Friday. There was no answer at the door of his house in Washington. The White House had no immediate comment about the NBC News report of a Russian-American lobbyist at the meeting. Kushner's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Manafort's spokesman Jason Maloni said Manafort had no comment on the meeting. A former Trump campaign adviser, Michael Caputo, told reporters after he testified to the House Intelligence Committee in closed session on Friday that he had no contact with Russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign  talking with Russians.      Accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated the Republican president's first months in office. Russia denies the allegations, and Trump says there was no collusion. The agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online. To help the White House deal with Russia-related investigations, Trump is hiring veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cobb's role is separate from Trump's outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz.  Akhmetshin has been accused in federal and state courts in the United States of engaging in hacking conspiracies, although the allegations were later withdrawn, according to court records.  In 2015, lawyers for the Russian mining company International Mineral Resources claimed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia that Akhmetshin helped organize the hack, theft and dissemination of private documents. That case was dropped. The same company filed a lawsuit against Akhmetshin in the New York Supreme Court but withdrew it last year.  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley described Akhmetshin in a letter to the Justice Department in March as  a former member of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU)  who was working to overturn the 2012  Magnitsky Act  of Congress, which blacklists Russians for human rights abuses. The Kremlin has often complained about the act.     Congressional records show that Akhmetshin lobbied Congress last year for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that says it is working to lift laws that prevent U.S. residents from adopting Russian children. Those laws were put in place by Moscow in response to the Magnitsky Act. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his son's meeting last year until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said:  In fact, maybe (the meeting) was mentioned at some point,  adding that he was not told it was about Clinton.    Trump Jr.'s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, said he had talked with a person who came to the meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump aides.        He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question,  Futerfas told NBC News. It was not immediately clear if the person he referred to was Akhmetshin. The lawyer said Trump Jr. knew nothing about the man's background at the time of the meeting. The Russian lawyer in the meeting, Veselnitskaya, has said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a U.S.-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor general’s office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said.

A decline in financial shares limited the day's gains, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and other big banks delivered quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations. Data showed consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and subdued expectations of strong economic growth in the second quarter.  The data is pointing to this continuation of fairly accommodative policy, which has obviously served the market well over the last few years. So as far as the market is concerned, it's sort of more of the same,  said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets in Boston. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 48 percent after the release of data, from 55 percent late Thursday. Earlier this week, the market rose after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. The S&P; financials .SPSY, which benefit from a rising rate environment, fell 0.5 percent, and the group was the only one of the S&P; 500 sectors down on the day.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 84.65 points, or 0.39 percent, to 21,637.74, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 11.44 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,459.27, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 38.03 points, or 0.61 percent, to 6,312.47. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX closed at its lowest since December 1993. For the week, the Dow was up 1.1 percent, the S&P; 500 was up 1.4 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 2.6 percent. The Nasdaq's percentage gain for the week was its biggest so far this year. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 12, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe small-cap Russell 2000 index , which has underperformed the S&P; 500 this year, also ended at a record high. Four of the largest lenders beat analysts' quarterly profit expectations by raising loan prices without paying much more for deposits. But analysts said investors had wanted to see even better results and hear a rosier outlook from executives. JPMorgan Chase was down 0.9 percent, while shares of Citigroup (C.N) were down 0.4 percent and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) fell 1.1 percent.   In the past few weeks, (financial) stocks have been very strong. There's been just a little bit of a sell on the news, but afterward, you buy on the idea of a good quarter,  said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. The financial index was down 0.7 percent for the week after rising 1.5 percent the week before. Bank of America (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) all are due to report results next week. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier. First-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. Amazon.com Inc < AMZN.O> shares rose 0.1 percent. The company has raised flags in Washington, with a Democratic lawmaker calling for a hearing on how Amazon's plans to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) will potentially impact consumers. The deal, announced in June, marks the biggest acquisition ever for the world's largest online retailer. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The Bank of Canada raised interest raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in seven years. Investors say that higher rates will weigh on bonds. But they expect a combination of only gradual rate increases and solid economic growth to support stocks.  Stronger growth and slowly rising interest rates creates positive value for equities ... it's at the root of our preference for equities over fixed income,  said Candice Bangsund, vice president, global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corporation. She is buying energy, materials and financials, which together make up nearly two-thirds of the S&P;/TSX composite index. Canada's benchmark index has doubled from its financial crisis trough in 2009 even after it has underperformed many other major markets this year as prices of oil, one of the country's major exports, fell. Still, investors say that the rally in stocks can continue and look to those sectors that will benefit most from a rosy growth outlook.  We have quite a few information technology names ... the valuations can look scary but the growth really has been impressive, said Ian Scott, equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management. Scott likes Kinaxis Inc and Shopify Inc whose fast growth and international expansion leave them less sensitive to higher rates. The Bank of Canada has projected that Canada's economy will expand by 2.8 percent this year and that global economic growth will pick up to 3.4 percent. The improved growth outlook can help support Canadian industrials, said Shailesh Kshatriya, director, Canadian strategies at Russell Investments Canada, who is most bullish on overseas stocks due to attractive valuations. But companies with high debt loads and a lot of refinancing to do in the next couple of years should be avoided, said David Rosenberg, chief economist & strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. He is also wary of sectors of the economy that could be hurt by a stronger Canadian dollar, such as exporters of auto parts and transportation. The loonie has surged more than 6 percent since the Bank of Canada turned hawkish in June. A rising rate environment tends to increase net interest margins of banks. But some investors say that a slowdown in Canada's housing market will weigh on bank shares.  We do think that real estate is at the point now of inflection,  said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments.  We think that the rate hike will be a damaging (for the economy) at some point down the road.  Adatia favors increased allocation to international stocks and is buying bonds to add some defensiveness to his portfolio. He favors debt with a shorter maturity, which tends to be less sensitive to movement in interest rates, but also likes to take the extra risk of owning corporate rather than government debt because global economic growth is solid and it enhances return.

But the breach cost privately held Ruby more than a quarter of its revenue, and prompted the Toronto-based company to spend millions of dollars to improve security and user privacy. Last December, Ruby agreed to pay $1.66 million to settle a probe by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and several states into lax data security and deceptive practices, also without admitting liability. According to Friday's settlement, users with valid claims can recoup up to $3,500 depending on how well they can document their losses attributable to the breach. Layn Phillips, a former federal judge who mediated the settlement, said in a court filing that the accord offered  a valuable recovery for the class in the face of many obstacles,  including Ruby's preference that victims arbitrate their claims. Lawyers for Ashley Madison users may receive up to one-third of the $11.2 million payout to cover legal fees, court papers show. The case is In re: Ashley Madison Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, No. 15-md-02669.

U.S. President Donald Trump has described the 1994 pact as  the worst trade deal ever  and vowed to change it to the advantage of the United States in talks due to begin later this summer. Trump's stance on the accord has led Trudeau's government to reach out aggressively to U.S. leaders, including one-on-one meetings on Friday with Vice President Mike Pence and the governors of Kentucky, Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Iowa. The meetings are intended to emphasize the importance of the two countries' trading relationship.  Sometimes getting it right means refusing to take the politically tempting shortcuts,  Trudeau told a meeting of the U.S. National Governors Association in Providence, Rhode Island.  More trade barriers, more local-content provisions, more preferential access for homegrown players in government procurement, for example, does not help working families over the long term, or even the mid-term. Such policies kill growth.  He warned that protectionist postures run the risk of becoming  a cycle of tit-for-tat, a race to the bottom, where all sides lose.  Pence, who also spoke to the Governors Association, alluded only briefly to the NAFTA talks in his remarks, which focused on this week's healthcare reform bill proposed by Senate Republicans.  We will modernize NAFTA for the 21st century so it is a win-win-win for all our trade partners in North America,  Pence, the former governor of Indiana, told the group.  We are looking forward to bringing NAFTA into the future in a way that will equally benefit both our countries.  In a nod to the concerns about competition with foreign labor that influenced Trump's populist trade stance, Trudeau said that state and national governments needed to do more to ensure that the benefits of trade were felt by a wider slice of the population.  We think right upfront about how to make sure that benefits that will come from trade inevitably accrue to more of the population,  he said. Trudeau also told reporters on Friday that Trump told him that he did not expect to subject Canadian steel and aluminum to face tariffs on national security grounds.  I am optimistic that this important trade, which leads to millions of good jobs on both sides of the border, will continue,  Trudeau said.

Consultancy firm PwC, together with The Crowdfunding Center, analyzed 450,000 crowdfunding campaigns across the globe over the past two years and found that those led by women were 32 percent more successful at reaching their target than those carried out by men.  The results of the study, which were published on Thursday, also found that female-led projects are able to attract an average $87 pledge per funder, while men received $83 on average.  The results are in contrast to more established and off-line funding mechanisms for startups such as venture capital, where women have been traditionally underserved, PwC said in the report.  Crowdfunding is a growing area of fintech where digital platforms allow individuals or businesses to collect money online to fund their activities, typically in exchange for a product, service or for a stake in the company or as a loan.   Crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending startups include Kickstarter, Indiegogo, LendingClub and Seedrs.  The report suggests that the main reason why women tend to be better than men at crowdfunding is that the model itself attracts more women as backers than traditional venture capital. Just seven percent of partners of the top 100 venture firms globally are women, according to the study.

In his first public riposte to Trump since the latter unveiled his new Cuba policy last month, Castro told the national assembly that any attempt to topple the revolution would fail, as it had under 11 previous U.S. presidents.  We reject the manipulation of the topic of human rights against Cuba, that can be proud of much in this area, and does not need to receive lessons from the United States nor anyone,  Castro was quoted as saying by state-run media Cubadebate. Foreign media does not have access to the twice-yearly meetings of the national assembly. Trump said last month he was canceling former President Barack Obama's  terrible and misguided deal  with Communist-run Cuba. In reality, he left in place many of Obama's changes, including the reopened U.S. embassy in Havana.  But he ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the military in the Caribbean island. Castro said Cuba remained open to negotiating matters of bilateral interest with the United States, sticking to the relatively conciliatory tone it has struck of late.   Cuba and the United States can cooperate and live side by side, respecting their differences,  he said.  But no one should expect that for this, one should have to make concessions inherent to one's sovereignty and independence.  Castro said Trump had clearly been ill-informed about Cuba's history with the United States and Cubans' patriotism. The setback in the normalization of relations with the United States comes as Cuba already faces a wide array of political and economic challenges. Castro has seven months to go before he steps down as president, although he will remain head of the Communist Party, in which political power is vested in Cuba. His generation, which has ruled Cuba since the 1959 revolution, is dying. Meanwhile, Cuba's main political and trade ally Venezuela is in crisis with triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine fanning protests against the socialist government. Castro on Friday reiterated Cuba's solidarity with Venezuela, saying the country was suffering a  nonconventional war imposed by imperialism and oligarchic sectors  that were fomenting violence in the streets. Despite lower oil shipments from Venezuela, the Cuban economy managed to grow 1.1 percent in the first half of the year, bouncing back from a recession in 2016, Castro said.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil, settled up 49 cents, or about 1 percent, at $48.91 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled up 46 cents, or 1 percent, at $46.54 per barrel. U.S. crude rose more than 5.2 percent for the week while Brent rose more than 4.7 percent.  I think the big driver is inventory numbers,  said Stewart Glickman, head of energy research at CFRA Research in New York,  We've finally broken below 500 million barrels, I feel like it's a psychological barrier.  U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, its biggest weekly plunge in 10 months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. And while U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a second week in a row according to Friday data from Baker Hughes, the pace of additions has slowed to its lowest this year. Oil production in North Dakota fell 10,000 barrels-per-day in May. Still, oil stocks remained comfortably above the five-year average, and prices were more than 15 percent below their 2017 highs. Output cuts from producing countries coordinated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been stymied by rising output from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt. June compliance among other members also fell to just 78 percent, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Kuwait's OPEC governor told Reuters in an interview that it would be premature to cap Nigerian and Libyan oil production. Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 11, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.  Brent and WTI prices were roughly 5 percent above the week's lows, aided by reports of accelerating demand growth from the IEA, crude oil import growth in China and falling crude stocks in the United States. China's crude oil imports over the first six months of 2017 were 13.8 percent above the year-ago period, customs data showed. Asian traders are selling oil products out of tanks to meet soaring demand, while the EIA reported the largest drop in U.S. crude oil inventories in the week to last week in 10 months. Analysts at Commerzbank said a reduction in the developed world's oil stocks was likely to continue as long as OPEC did not further significantly increase its output.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil, settled up 49 cents, or about 1 percent, at $48.91 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled up 46 cents, or 1 percent, at $46.54 per barrel. U.S. crude rose more than 5.2 percent for the week while Brent rose more than 4.7 percent.  I think the big driver is inventory numbers,  said Stewart Glickman, head of energy research at CFRA Research in New York,  We've finally broken below 500 million barrels, I feel like it's a psychological barrier.  U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, its biggest weekly plunge in 10 months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. And while U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a second week in a row according to Friday data from Baker Hughes, the pace of additions has slowed to its lowest this year. Oil production in North Dakota fell 10,000 barrels-per-day in May. Still, oil stocks remained comfortably above the five-year average, and prices were more than 15 percent below their 2017 highs. Output cuts from producing countries coordinated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been stymied by rising output from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt. June compliance among other members also fell to just 78 percent, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Kuwait's OPEC governor told Reuters in an interview that it would be premature to cap Nigerian and Libyan oil production. Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 11, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.  Brent and WTI prices were roughly 5 percent above the week's lows, aided by reports of accelerating demand growth from the IEA, crude oil import growth in China and falling crude stocks in the United States. China's crude oil imports over the first six months of 2017 were 13.8 percent above the year-ago period, customs data showed. Asian traders are selling oil products out of tanks to meet soaring demand, while the EIA reported the largest drop in U.S. crude oil inventories in the week to last week in 10 months. Analysts at Commerzbank said a reduction in the developed world's oil stocks was likely to continue as long as OPEC did not further significantly increase its output.

Eric Christopher Conn, 56, pleaded guilty on March 24 to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $550 million in federal disability payments for thousands of people. Conn is a fugitive who has been on the run since last month and was not at his sentencing by U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves of the Eastern District of Kentucky in Lexington, the Justice Department said in a statement. Scott White, an attorney for Conn, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White told a Kentucky television station last month that Conn should surrender. Conn must also pay around $106 million in restitution to the Social Security Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Justice Department said in Friday's statement. Prosecutors said that from 2004 to 2016, Conn, of Pikeville, Kentucky, participated in a scheme that involved submitting thousands of falsified medical documents to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Two other co-consiprators, a retired administrative law judge from the U.S. Social Security Administration and a clinical psychologist, are awaiting sentencing for their roles in the scheme. Conn fled home detention last month using a truck registered by one of his co-conspirators.

The statement did not say when the truck was discovered or which co-conspirator gave him the truck. A spokesman for the FBI was not immediately available for comment. Along the way, Conn made several stops including at a gas station and a Wal-Mart store in New Mexico where he was captured on video surveillance.

Desiree Fairooz, 61, a member of the anti-war group Code Pink, was arrested for laughing during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January in response to a lawmaker's  assertion that Sessions, then a Republican U.S. senator from Alabama, treated all Americans equally. Fairooz, a children's librarian, shouted,  This man is evil, pure evil  as police led her out. A jury found Fairooz guilty in May of disrupting a session of Congress and demonstrating on Capitol grounds. She had been due to be sentenced on Friday. But Chief Judge Robert Morin of the District of Columbia Superior Court overturned the guilty verdict and ordered a new trial. In his ruling, Morin said it was unclear whether Fairooz had been convicted for laughter or for speaking out as she was removed, her lawyer, Samuel Bogash, said by telephone.  The government's position was that laughing alone was enough to convict. But the judge made it clear that he didn't think it was,  Morin said.

Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to become U.S. attorney general on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 10, 2017.Kevin LamarqueCode Pink, which often stages protests against politicians, said on its Facebook page that Fairooz denounced a retrial as a waste of taxpayers' money.  The only thing more ridiculous than being tried for laughing, is being tried twice for laughing,  Code Pink quoted her as saying. Morin did not set a trial date and scheduled a status hearing for Sept. 1. Fairooz had faced up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for each of her two convictions. Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said two other Code Pink activists who were convicted for disrupting the hearing, Lenny Bianchi and Tighe Barry, were sentenced to 10 days in jail. The sentences were suspended on condition that Barry and Bianchi complete six months of unsupervised probation, he said.

Negotiations are focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange minutes after the stock rose 4.74 percent, following Reuters' report on the talks.  U.S.-listed shares (DDC.N), which peaked at $13.60 after the report, closed at $13.48 in New York, up 5.6 percent. It was unclear how much Washington had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company. In a statement Friday afternoon, Dominion said it has not made any decisions related to strategic alternatives and there is no assurance that its review will result in a transaction or change in strategy. Washington, which declined to comment, is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond (SWY.TO), which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year. It was unclear if either had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that global miners Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and Anglo American (AAL.L) were also eying Dominion.  Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories. Dominion hired Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) earlier this year to run the sales process.

Trump,Jay Sekulow,John Dowd,John Huang,Marc Kasowitz,Mary McCarthy,Michael Bowe,Paula Jones,Robert Bennett,Ty Cobb,USA,TRUMP/RUSSIA,LAWYER,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House is hiring Ty Cobb, a veteran Washington lawyer with experience as a prosecutor and defense attorney to assist with Russia-related investigations, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cobb has been a long-time partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington and represented people in government during the 1990s Clinton administration. Cobb did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the law firm declined to comment.  We have no announcement at this time,  a White House spokeswoman said. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential connections between Russian officials and the campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any interference and the President has denied any collusion. The intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and spreading false information. Cobb is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys. Trump met with Cobb about the role last month, Reuters exclusively reported on July 3. Bloomberg News wrote about his hiring earlier on Friday. Cobb's role is separate from Trump's outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz. Constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz’s firm, are all on that team. Cobb, who sports a handlebar mustache, is a distant relative of the famous early 20th century baseball player of the same name. Washington lawyer Robert Bennett, also of Hogan Lovells, who represented President Bill Clinton in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones, said Cobb knew how to handle a crisis where politics and the law intersected.  Given recent developments, they really need him and need to listen to him,  said Bennett.

Negotiations are focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange minutes after the stock rose 4.74 percent, following Reuters' report on the talks.  U.S.-listed shares (DDC.N), which peaked at $13.60 after the report, closed at $13.48 in New York, up 5.6 percent. It was unclear how much Washington had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company. In a statement Friday afternoon, Dominion said it has not made any decisions related to strategic alternatives and there is no assurance that its review will result in a transaction or change in strategy. Washington, which declined to comment, is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond (SWY.TO), which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year. It was unclear if either had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that global miners Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and Anglo American (AAL.L) were also eying Dominion.  Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories. Dominion hired Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) earlier this year to run the sales process.

Cobb has been a long-time partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington and represented people in government during the 1990s Clinton administration. Cobb did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the law firm declined to comment.   We have no announcement at this time,  a White House spokeswoman said. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential connections between Russian officials and the  campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any interference and the President has denied any collusion. The intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and spreading false information. Cobb is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys. Trump met with Cobb about the role last month, Reuters exclusively reported on July 3. Bloomberg News wrote about his hiring earlier on Friday. Cobb's role is separate from Trump's outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz. Constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz’s firm, are all on that team. Cobb, who sports a handlebar mustache, is a distant relative of the famous early 20th century baseball player of the same name.   Washington lawyer Robert Bennett, also of Hogan Lovells, who represented President Bill Clinton in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones, said Cobb knew how to handle a crisis where politics and the law intersected.  Given recent developments, they really need him and need to listen to him,  said Bennett. In the 1990s, Cobb, 66, represented former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins, who was probed over the Clinton White House travel office.

(Citi) reported second quarter 2017 (2Q17) earnings of $3.9 billion, representing a 3% decline relative to the year-ago quarter, according to Fitch Ratings. Strength in investment banking and international consumer banking were offset by lower results in the trading business and North America Consumer Banking (NACB). These results combined for a 6.8% annualized return on average common equity (ROAE) in 2Q17 down slightly from 7% in the prior year quarter. On a return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) basis excluding Citi's deferred tax asset (DTA), the firm's 2Q17 result was 9.3%, down 20 basis points from the 9.5% result in the prior year's quarter. ROTCE remains slightly below management's 10% target, though with the firm's expected capital return over the next 12 months, Citi should get closer to, if not reach, this target absent unexpected performance volatility. Results in Citi's NACB segment were challenging this quarter with segment net income down 18% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue in Branded Cards was up 10% year-over-year reflecting the acquisition of the Costco card portfolio in June 2016. Retail services net revenue was up 4% year-over-year due to continued loan growth. Mortgage banking net revenue was a small contributor to the lower results, declining approximately $90 million (or 33%) from the prior year quarter amid lower originations, higher cost of funds, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of Citi's mortgage servicing rights. Credit costs were more significant in the segment, up 27% to $1.3 billion relative to the prior year period due to a combination of the Costco acquisition, continued volume growth, seasoning of the portfolio and the impact of changes in collections activity in Retail Services. Citi indicated that it has not observed more loan delinquencies in its Retail Services portfolio, but it has changed its collections approach given regulation, which drove the $103 million allowance build this quarter. Citi's International Consumer Banking segment had comparatively better results than the NACB segment with net income for the segment only down 2% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, Latin America showed particularly strong growth in this segment with net revenue up 8% year-over-year. Revenue growth in Asia was more muted but still good at 3% higher relative to the prior year period. Credit costs in this segment were also higher at $470 million, up 18% compared to the prior year's quarter. This included net credit losses of $434 million and a loan loss reserve build of $21 million. Nevertheless, the overall net credit loss rate in this segment remained low at 1.58%, up slightly from 1.52% in the prior year quarter. Despite subdued trading conditions during the quarter, performance in Citi's Institutional Clients Group (ICG) segment was good, with net income up 6% relative to the prior year period. Investment Banking net revenue was up 22% relative to last year's second quarter due to strength in equity capital markets (ECM) and advisory. The trading businesses were more challenged, with Fixed Income Markets net revenue down 6% relative to the prior year quarter due in large part to low volatility and a strong year-ago quarter which included solid results in currencies due to the BREXIT vote. Equity markets net revenue was down 11% amid low volatility, but securities services was up 10% due to growth in client volumes. Citi's 2Q17 net interest revenue of $11.17 billion held relatively steady relative to the prior year period amid continued deposit growth and balance sheet growth, but the net interest margin declined to 2.72% in 2Q17 from 2.86% in the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to holding higher cash balances for resolution planning purposes and wind down of legacy assets. Fitch continues to view Citi's liquidity position as sound. Total deposits grew 2% relative to the prior year period to $958 billion. Similarly the bank's loan-to-deposit ratio remained solid at 66% this quarter. Citi's capital ratios continue to remain a rating strength, and generally above other large U.S. banks. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis was 13%, up 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to net income and incrementally lower risk-weighted assets offset by common share dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, Citi's Supplementary Leverage Ratio at the parent company remained strong at 7.2% as of 2Q17, well above regulatory minimums. Over the last 12 months Citi returned $12.2 billion of capital to shareholders via a mix of dividends and share repurchases, which equates to a payout ratio over the last 12 months of approximately 79%. Any future corporate tax reforms may impact Citi's earnings with valuation allowances recorded against the DTA and, potentially, a capital charge, but this would be offset by higher earnings over time. On June 22, 2017, the Federal Reserve released the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) results which Citi passed. Fitch estimates that, relative to other DFAST institutions, Citi was more adversely affected by the global market shock and counterparty default scenarios. On June 28, 2017, Citi received a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which authorizes the firm to increase its dividend to $0.32 per share repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common equity between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 for a total capital return over the next four quarters of $18.9 billion.

The top three most influential movers on the index were energy stocks. Enbridge Inc added 1.2 percent to C$51.67, while Transcanada Corp rose 1.2 percent to C$63.34. U.S. crude futures settled at $46.56 a barrel, up 1 percent, as lower U.S. stockpiles and a slight slowdown in U.S. crude production helped bolster prices, but trading was volatile and global supply remained strong. The overall energy group was up a marginal 0.2 percent, tempered by modest losses from other oil and gas companies, including Canadian Natural Resources and Cenovus Energy .  The fact is that there still appears to be too much supply - they appear to be cheating in terms of OPEC members,  said Irwin Michael, a portfolio manager at ABC Funds.  Oil remains very volatile as a commodity.  The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index rose 39.81 points, or 0.26 percent, to 15,174.81. The index gained more than 0.9 percent on the week. Michael expects the index to  saw-tooth its way to higher levels.  Eight of the 10 main index groups rose. Information technology stocks were down 0.4 percent, while consumer staples was little changed. Telecoms rose 0.9 percent, with Roger Communications Inc climbing 1.3 percent to C$62.42. Dominion Diamond Corp shares jumped as much as 4.7 percent to C$17.00, before being halted, after Reuters' reported it was in advanced talks with the Washington Companies on a sweetened cash takeover bid. The materials group, which encompasses miners and fertilizer producers, added 0.7 percent. Disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data pressured the U.S. dollar, which helped lift gold prices to near two-week highs. Gold futures rose 0.9 percent to $1,227.5 an ounce. Goldcorp advanced 0.6 percent to C$16.47. Barrick Gold was up 1.2 percent at C$20.22. Late on Thursday, a union representing workers at the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile, owned by Barrick and Antofagasta Plc, said talks would resume after workers voted to strike earlier this week. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 147 to 95, for a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the upside.

He is expected back in court on Monday for a status conference. U.S. prosecutors on Thursday unsealed a 14-count indictment accusing Simmons of hiding millions of dollars he earned from hit songs including  X Gon' Give it to Ya  and  Where the Hood At.  Simmons faces up to five years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Following the hearing, Simmons thanked his fans for their support and told reporters he had come up with some new lyrics after he was taken into custody on Thursday evening.

He has had several felony convictions and served prison time in Arizona.  The length of his record is remarkable,  U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck said at Friday's court hearing. Aside from recording hit songs, often with lyrics rooted in rage and violence, Simmons has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama  Belly,  the 2000 action movie  Romeo Must Die  and the 2003 heist film  Cradle 2 The Grave.

We hope to be able to say in the near future how much the royalties will amount to,  Moroney told Reuters. Licensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved guselkumab, which it will market as Tremfya, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. That brings Morphosys a step closer to seeing the first drug using its antibody technology launched on to the market, pushing its shares as much as 9 percent higher on Friday.  While it was largely expected, this approval marks a turning point in Morphosys' story as it prepares to receive its first royalty stream,  Berenberg analysts, who recommend buying shares in Morphosys, said in a note. They see the drug taking 15 percent of the U.S. market for moderate to severe psoriasis at the expense of Janssen's existing Stelara, of Novartis's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's Taltz. Janssen said Tremfya, which is administered by injection, will be an alternative for patients who do not respond to existing treatments. Morphosys has so far not yet said how much Janssen would owe it in royalties, noting only that payments would likely come to a medium single-digit percentage of sales. Berenberg's analysts estimate that guselkumab could reach peak annual sales of about 3.2 billion euros ($3.65 billion) eventually, which would mean royalties of up to 185 million. Morphosys' stock rose about 9 percent in early trade on Friday and were up 6 percent at 66.29 euros by 1350 GMT, having hit its highest level in almost two years. According to CEO Moroney, royalties are not yet included in Morphosys 2017 guidance. The group has so far said it expected its loss before interest and tax to widen to between 75 million and 85 million euros this year from about 60 million in 2016 as its costs for research and development rise. Morphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer .

Net receipts for the fiscal year ended June 30 were $4.266 billion, 0.8 percent below a $4.3 billion forecast, according Nebraska's Department of Revenue. June 2017's net receipts totaled $400 million, falling short of its projected total by 5.9 percent, the department said. June was the third consecutive month that net receipts fell below forecasts. Nebraska's Tax Commissioner Tony Fulton said in an interview the forecast was missed partly because of lower corn prices, lower individual income tax revenue and projections that were too  rosy.   It's been hard out there,  Fulton said of farm conditions.  That has a lot to do with commodity prices are not where they have been in recent years.  The agriculture industry has been down since 2013, which includes a substantial drop in net farm income, said Brad Lubben, an extension agriculture policy specialist at the University of Nebraska. Crop and livestock prices have both fallen since 2012 and 2013, respectively, he said.  Lubben said the lower prices were certainly a leading factor in the lower tax receipts. The agriculture sector in Nebraska accounts for about one of every four jobs in the state, he added. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said in a Friday statement he would  continue to closely monitor tax receipts to protect taxpayers.

He was 86. Johnson, a former chairman of the executive committee at Bank of America who served eight years as chairman of Augusta National from 1998-2006, died on Friday, the club said in a statement. Current Augusta National chairman Billy Payne referred to Johnson as a personal mentor on Masters matters as well as those in business and life.  He boldly directed numerous course improvements to ensure that Augusta National would always represent the very finest test of golf,  said Payne.  Simultaneously, Hootie expanded television coverage of the Masters, improved qualification standards for invitation to the Tournament and reopened the series badge waiting list for the first time in more than 20 years.  Many of these measures brought more people than ever closer to the Masters and inspired us to continue exploring ways to welcome people all over the world to the tournament and the game of golf.  Johnson is widely known for a disagreement with women's activist Martha Burk, who demanded a change in the membership policies at Augusta National. A defiant traditionalist, Johnson felt a private club was well within its right to deny female members, and went as far as to say it would not be forced to act  at the point of bayonet  when Burk demanded a change in 2002. In 2012, under Payne, Augusta National invited its first two female members since the club was founded in the 1930s. One of those women, South Carolinian businesswoman Darla Moore, was sponsored by Johnson. His tenure as chairman also coincided with an era of rapidly improving equipment and longer-hitting players and so ordered sweeping changes that made Augusta National, which hosts the Masters every April, a much longer and tougher test. The moves prompted howls from purists who felt the changes were not what course designers Bobby Jones and Alister MacKenzie had envisioned. The club said it will privately honor Johnson's memory in the coming days.

CME livestock market funds that follow the Standard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index           sold, or  rolled,  August futures and simultaneously bought October on the fifth and final day of the Goldman Roll process.     August         ended up 0.375 cent per pound at 117.800 cents, and October         was 0.750 cent higher at 118.575 cents.     This week the bulk of market-ready, or cash, cattle in the U.S. Plains traded from $118 to $120 per cwt, as much as $3 higher than last week, said feedlot sources.      Traders reacted to higher cash prices, which was surprising for this time of year given the seasonal decline in wholesale beef values, said CME livestock futures trader Dan Norcini.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture's daily price, or cutout, for choice wholesale beef cuts had fallen to $209.35 per cwt on Friday afternoon from $251.03 a month earlier.                Consumers hold fewer cookouts during periods of extremely hot weather, and retailers tend to feature less meat for grilling after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, said analysts and traders.        This week's combination of higher cash returns and eroding wholesale beef prices wore down profits for packers, likely making them think twice about paying up for cattle next week, a trader said.             Buy-stops and live cattle futures gains boosted CME's feeder cattle contract        to a one-month high.     August feeders         ended 1.250 cents per pound higher at 154.275 cents.        HOG FUTURES FALL     Fund liquidation and lower cash prices amid ample supplies undercut CME lean hogs, said traders.     The roll by funds further pressured August futures and slowed the October contract's decline.     July        , which will expire on Monday, ended down 0.150 cent per pound at 92.600 cents.     Most-actively traded August         finished 2.625 cents lower at 79.900 cents, and below the 40-day moving average of 80.996 cents. October         ended 2.150 cents lower at 67.175 cents, and below the 100-day moving average of 67.356 cents.     Despite futures' bullish discounts to current cash prices, packers anticipate having more hogs at their disposal to accommodate two new processing plants that are slated to open in September, a trader said.      Any delay in those facilities coming online, at a time of increased supplies, will create major headaches for farmers and cash prices, he added.

A decline in financial shares limited the day's gains, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and other big banks delivered quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations. Data showed consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and subdued expectations of strong economic growth in the second quarter.  The data is pointing to this continuation of fairly accommodative policy, which has obviously served the market well over the last few years. So as far as the market is concerned, it's sort of more of the same,  said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets in Boston. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 48 percent after the release of data, from 55 percent late Thursday. Earlier this week, the market rose after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. The S&P; financials .SPSY, which benefit from a rising rate environment, fell 0.5 percent, and the group was the only one of the S&P; 500 sectors down on the day.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 84.65 points, or 0.39 percent, to 21,637.74, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 11.44 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,459.27, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 38.03 points, or 0.61 percent, to 6,312.47. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX closed at its lowest since December 1993. For the week, the Dow was up 1.1 percent, the S&P; 500 was up 1.4 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 2.6 percent. The Nasdaq's percentage gain for the week was its biggest so far this year. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 12, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe small-cap Russell 2000 index , which has underperformed the S&P; 500 this year, also ended at a record high. Four of the largest lenders beat analysts' quarterly profit expectations by raising loan prices without paying much more for deposits. But analysts said investors had wanted to see even better results and hear a rosier outlook from executives. JPMorgan Chase was down 0.9 percent, while shares of Citigroup (C.N) were down 0.4 percent and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) fell 1.1 percent.   In the past few weeks, (financial) stocks have been very strong. There's been just a little bit of a sell on the news, but afterward, you buy on the idea of a good quarter,  said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. The financial index was down 0.7 percent for the week after rising 1.5 percent the week before. Bank of America (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) all are due to report results next week. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier. First-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. Amazon.com Inc < AMZN.O> shares rose 0.1 percent. The company has raised flags in Washington, with a Democratic lawmaker calling for a hearing on how Amazon's plans to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) will potentially impact consumers. The deal, announced in June, marks the biggest acquisition ever for the world's largest online retailer. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a seventh straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 8,604 contracts as of July 11 from 39,372 contracts a week earlier.     Gains for the loonie, which rose for a third straight week, came after the Bank of Canada raised rates on Wednesday for the first time in seven years and signaled it will need to hike again over the coming months.          If you are a trader or a corporate and have to judge where the market might be going, you pretty much have to take the bank at its word,  said Michael Goshko, Corporate Risk Manager at Western Union Business Solutions.     The central bank will follow up with another increase in October as it charts a course of gradual policy tightening, with two more hikes expected next year, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers.                          At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2650 to the greenback, or 79.05 U.S. cents, up 0.6 percent.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, were boosted by lower U.S. stockpiles, a slight slowdown in U.S. crude production and signs of increased Chinese demand. U.S. crude        prices settled 46 cents higher at $46.54 a barrel.            The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.2747, while it touched its strongest since May 2016 at C$1.2645.     For the week, the loonie rose 1.8 percent. It has gained more than 6 percent since the Bank of Canada turned hawkish in June.      Until we start seeing weakening economic data I think the market is going to be full steam ahead to higher rates and a stronger Canada  dollar, Goshko said.     The U.S. dollar        fell against a basket of major currencies after weaker-than-forecast data on consumer prices and retail sales in June raised doubts about whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again in 2017.                   Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            price rose 3.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.192 percent and the 10-year             gained 11 Canadian cents to yield 1.897 percent.

Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, met Buffett and Malone separately this week at an annual gathering of business and media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, the sources said on Friday, confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure is also involved in the negotiations, the sources said.  Berkshire Hathaway is considering an investment of up to $20 billion in Sprint, while the amount that Liberty Media is looking to invest is not yet known, the sources said. Talks are in the early stages and could still fall apart, the people added. Shares of Sprint closed up 4.3 percent at $8.55 on Friday. The company has a market cap of $32.75 billion. Sprint and SoftBank declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway and Liberty Media did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. A significant cash infusion in Sprint would give the debt-laden company flexibility and resources to continue its turnaround and invest in its network, the sources said, which could help it better compete in the fierce U.S. wireless industry. It would also relieve pressure from it having to strike a deal with T-Mobile US Inc, a unit of Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG, which it held talks with earlier this year, sources said.  Despite regulatory hurdles, investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies. T-Mobile shares closed up 0.5 percent to $61.24 on Friday.  Sources said last month that Sprint had entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Malone's Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp, which has put Sprint's merger talks with T-Mobile US on hold until the end of July. Comcast and Charter in May agreed to a partnership that bars either company from entering into a material transaction in the wireless space for a year without the other company’s consent. But that agreement does not prevent Malone from engaging in discussions.  Unlike Malone, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has shown little interest in his company investing in Sprint, the sources said.  Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media, in January raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy a wireless carrier. Berkshire has never made telecommunications a major focus, and in 2016 it unloaded its stake in AT&T; Inc that it had held for less than a year after that company bought DirecTV, a Berkshire investment. Investing in or lending money to Sprint could help Buffett generate a higher return on some of Berkshire's cash and equivalents, which totaled $96.5 billion on March 31. Berkshire has invested with Malone since 2011, when it took a stake in Liberty Media. As of March 31, Berkshire owned more than $5.4 billion of stock in three Malone companies: Liberty Media, international cable company Liberty Global Plc and Charter. Greg Maffei, Liberty Media's chief executive, is also chairman of Sirius XM Holdings Inc, in which Berkshire held $887 million of stock as of March 31.

Bezos,Ro Khanna,WHOLEFOODS,MandA/AMAZON.COM,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives' antitrust subcommittee has voiced concerns about Amazon.com Inc's $13.7 billion plan to buy Whole Foods Market Inc and is pushing for a hearing to look into the deal's impact on consumers. The deal announced in June marks the biggest acquisition for the world's largest online retailer. Amazon has not said what it would do with Whole Foods' stores and other assets, but analysts and investors worry the deal could upend the landscape for grocers, food delivery services and meal-kit companies. U.S. Representative David Cicilline requested the hearing on Thursday in a letter to the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and the subcommittee chairman. Amazon and Whole Foods declined to comment. Amazon shares closed up 0.1 percent at $1,001.81. Whole Foods rose 0.3 percent to $42.10.  Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods could impact neighborhood grocery stores and hardworking consumers across America,  the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement.  Congress has a responsibility to fully scrutinize this merger before it goes ahead.  The deal must be approved by U.S. antitrust enforcers, most likely the Federal Trade Commission. Congress plays no formal role in that process but hearings often highlight the possible impact of deals on consumers. The hearing is unlikely to happen without Republican support. FTC members are named by the president. A wild card in the review is the view of President Donald Trump, who famously said before his election that Amazon has  a huge antitrust problem.  Trump was unhappy about coverage of his campaign by the Washington Post, owned by Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. Cicilline's district includes most of the city of Providence, home to United Natural Foods Inc, which is Whole Foods' primary supplier. The company, whose supplies account for roughly one-third of Whole Foods sales and has a contract with the retailer through 2025, said it did not ask the lawmaker to intervene. Prior to the Amazon bid, activist investor group Jana Partners had criticized Whole Foods for high costs associated with its United Natural Foods contract. U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a podcast this month that Amazon's size and clout could hurt small retailers and eventually lead to higher prices. This week, hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said he was shorting shares of the retailer after hearing rumblings on Capitol Hill about Amazon's size and clout.  I am shorting Amazon today because I have learned that there are currently early discussions and due diligence being considered in the legislative chambers in Washington, D.C.,  he wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.  If I am correct, word of this could lower Amazon's shares by 10 percent overnight.  Kass said in emailed comments to Reuters on Friday that he has what he called a  core  short position in Amazon, meaning a sizeable bet based on a long-term outlook.  This has the potential of being the biggest business news story of year,  he said. Kass declined to comment when asked for more details about pressure from Capitol Hill. Kass is followed for his bets on declines in companies' share prices. He shorted Marvel Entertainment in 1992 when its shares were in the high $60s, and the company went bankrupt 1-1/2 years later. He also bet against big U.S. banks leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, shorting Bank of America, MGIC, Citigroup and several other financials that ultimately averaged a 98 percent price decline by the time they bottomed in 2009. While antitrust experts have said they expected Amazon's bid to win regulatory approval, some critics argue the deal should be blocked because it would give the retailer a big head start towards domination of online grocery delivery.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wholefoods-ma-amazoncom-idUSL1N1K50XA"},

While antitrust experts have said they expected Amazon's bid to win regulatory approval, some critics argue the deal should be blocked because it would give the retailer a big head start towards domination of online grocery delivery.

The deal announced in June marks the biggest acquisition for the world's largest online retailer. Amazon has not said what it would do with Whole Foods' stores and other assets, but analysts and investors worry the deal could upend the landscape for grocers, food delivery services and meal-kit companies.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline requested the hearing on Thursday in a letter to the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and the subcommittee chairman. Amazon and Whole Foods declined to comment. Amazon shares closed up 0.1 percent at $1,001.81. Whole Foods rose 0.3 percent to $42.10.   Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods could impact neighborhood grocery stores and hardworking consumers across America,  the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement.  Congress has a responsibility to fully scrutinize this merger before it goes ahead.  The deal must be approved by U.S. antitrust enforcers, most likely the Federal Trade Commission. Congress plays no formal role in that process but hearings often highlight the possible impact of deals on consumers. The hearing is unlikely to happen without Republican support. FTC members are named by the president. A wild card in the review is the view of President Donald Trump, who famously said before his election that Amazon has  a huge antitrust problem.  Trump was unhappy about coverage of his campaign by the Washington Post, owned by Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoCicilline's district includes most of the city of Providence, home to United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI.O), which is Whole Foods' primary supplier. The company, whose supplies account for roughly one-third of Whole Foods sales and has a contract with the retailer through 2025, said it did not ask the lawmaker to intervene. Prior to the Amazon bid, activist investor group Jana Partners had criticized Whole Foods for high costs associated with its United Natural Foods contract.  U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a podcast this month that Amazon's size and clout could hurt small retailers and eventually lead to higher prices. This week, hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said he was shorting shares of the retailer after hearing rumblings on Capitol Hill about Amazon's size and clout.  I am shorting Amazon today because I have learned that there are currently early discussions and due diligence being considered in the legislative chambers in Washington, D.C.,  he wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.

Our study suggests that MBSR could be a useful tool for preventing or treating diabetes in patients with overweight or obesity,” lead author Dr. Nazia Raja-Khan from Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, said by email. MBSR, an intensive instructor-led training program, incorporates meditation, body awareness and other anxiety-reducing techniques. It was originally developed decades ago at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester to help patients manage pain and stress while being treated for cancer and other serious illnesses, but the course is now offered in a wide variety of settings nationwide.  MBSR training has been shown to reduce stress and therefore might reduce the risk of heart disease in overweight or obese individuals, though this has yet to be proven, Raja Khan’s team writes in the journal Obesity. The researchers assigned 86 women to eight weeks of either MBSR training or a health education program focusing on diet and exercise. They told both groups that the main focus of the study was stress reduction.  After eight weeks and again after 16 weeks, they compared changes in stress levels, mood, quality-of-life, sleep quality, blood pressure, blood sugar, weight and other measures.  Not surprisingly, after eight weeks, the MSBR group had a greater improvement in mindfulness and a greater decrease in feelings of stress, compared with the health education group. Perceived stress remained lower in the MBSR group after 16 weeks.  Women in the MBSR group also had lower blood sugar, by about 9 milligrams per deciliter of blood, after eight and 16 weeks compared to before the training, while women in the health education group had no change in blood sugar.  After MBSR or health education, both groups had less overall psychological stress, less anxiety and better sleep, but neither group had lost weight, lowered their inflammation or cholesterol levels or improved their responses to insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar.  “Further studies are needed to determine more long-term benefits of MBSR in overweight/obesity and to confirm the role of MBSR in diabetes prevention and treatment,” Raja-Khan told Reuters Health.

Israeli authorities shut the area to Muslims gathering for Friday prayers citing security concerns, prompting anger among Palestinian religious leaders. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Hussein, urged Palestinians to defy the closure and he was later reported to have been detained. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but also said closing down the area could have repercussions. The three gunmen arrived at the sacred site - known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount - on the edge of Jerusalem's Old City and walked towards one of the nearby ancient stone gates, police spokeswoman Luba Simri said.  When they saw the policemen they shot towards them and then escaped towards one of the mosques in the Temple Mount compound,  Simri said.  A chase ensued and the three terrorists were killed by police.      Ten seconds of security camera footage released by police appeared to show two of the attackers running toward two policemen stationed in a stone passageway and shooting one of them in the back. Mobile phone video footage aired by Israeli media showed several police chasing a man and shooting him at the site, a popular place for foreign tourists to visit.   Simri said three firearms were found on the gunmen's bodies. The Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, said they were all Arab citizens of Israel who were unknown to the authorities.  The two policemen killed were Israeli Arab citizens from the country's Druze community. The Israeli ambulance service said a third policeman had been lightly wounded in the incident. Related CoveragePalestinian President Abbas condemns Jerusalem holy site attack: WAFATensions Tensions are often high around the compound, which houses the Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock. It is managed by Jordanian religious authorities and is adjacent to the Western Wall, a holy site where Jews are permitted to pray. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterre condemned the attack.  This incident has the potential to ignite further violence. All must act responsibly to avoid escalation,  his spokesman said.  Netanyahu said the compound would be reopened gradually from Sunday, in accordance with security assessments. Members of the Druze community stand next to the flag-drapped coffin of Israeli Druze police officer Kamil Shanan during his funeral in the village of Hurfeish, Israel July 14 2017.Ammar AwadJordan's government spokesman Mohammad Al Momani called on Israel to end the closure, which he described to Petra news agency as an  attack on the right of Muslims to practise their religious rituals in their holy sites . A source close to Netanyahu said Israel expected Jordan to condemn the attack. The compound has served as a tinder-box for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the past. Under a delicate status quo agreement, Jews are allowed to enter the compound under closer supervision but only Muslims are permitted to pray. In an apparent effort to ease tensions, Netanyahu said in a statement there would be no change to the status quo, in which only Muslim prayer is permitted, a message he reiterated in his phone call with Abbas, according to Netanyahu's office.   Authorities have often restricted access to the Aqsa mosque when concerned about possible violence there, but a total shutdown is rare.  Slideshow (13 Images)Friday's closure prompted hundreds of Muslim worshippers to gather outside the walled Old City gates and hold prayers there.   We completely reject the ban by Israeli authorities,      Grand Mufti Hussein told Reuters by telephone.  We have urged our Palestinian people to rush to al Aqsa today and every day to hold their prayers.  An aide to Hussein said the Mufti was later detained by police at the Old City. A police spokesman could not confirm that report. Reuters video footage showed the Mufti being escorted away by a man in plain clothes, through a crowd of Palestinians gathered near the compound gate. Ofer Zalzberg, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said images of the gunman being shot dead at the sacred site made the situation even more volatile.  This can have much broader impact because defending al Aqsa is at the core of Palestinian nationalism,  Zalzberg told Reuters.  Israel's response of closing access entirely to Muslims in an attempt to deter further attacks actually exacerbates the crisis.  No group claimed responsibility for the attack, though the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised it.  A wave of Palestinian street attacks that began in 2015 has slowed but not stopped. At least 257 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have been killed since the violence began. A few of the attacks were carried out by Arab Israeli citizens. Israel annexed East Jerusalem, where the Old City and the holy compound are located, after the 1967 Middle East war and regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, a claim not recognised internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The analysis by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korean monitoring project, was based on satellite images of the radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear plant from September until the end of June, amid rising international concerns over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The think tank said images of the uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon could also indicate operation of centrifuges that could be used to increase North Korea’s stock of enriched uranium, its other source of bomb fuel. There were signs too of at least short-term activity at North Korea’s Experimental Light Water Reactor that could be cause for concern, 38 North said. The images of the radiochemical laboratory showed there had been at least two reprocessing cycles not previously known aimed at producing  an undetermined amount of plutonium that can further increase North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile,  something that would worry U.S. officials who see Pyongyang as one of the world's top security threats. It was unclear if the thermal activity detected at the uranium plant was the result of centrifuge operations or maintenance.

Frustrated that China, North Korea's main trading partner, has not done more to rein in Pyongyang, the Trump administration could impose new sanctions on small Chinese banks and other companies doing business with Pyongyang within weeks, two senior U.S. officials told Reuters this week. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has been seeking to overcome resistance from China and Russia to a U.N.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters,  The significance is you kill a leader of one of these groups and it sets them back ... it is obviously a victory on our side in terms of setting them back, it is the right direction.   Sayed is the third Islamic State leader in Afghanistan to be killed since July 2016.

Afghan troops, backed by U.S. warplanes and special forces, have been battling militants linked to Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan for years. The local affiliate of Islamic State, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) after an old name for the region that includes Afghanistan, has been active since 2015, fighting the Taliban and Afghan and U.S. forces.

Negotiations are focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange minutes after the stock rose 4.74 percent, following Reuters' report on the talks. U.S.-listed shares, which peaked at $13.60 after the report, closed at $13.48 in New York, up 5.6 percent. It was unclear how much Washington had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company. In a statement Friday afternoon, Dominion said it has not made any decisions related to strategic alternatives and there is no assurance that its review will result in a transaction or change in strategy. Washington, which declined to comment, is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond , which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year. It was unclear if either had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that global miners Rio Tinto  and Anglo American were also eying Dominion. Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories. Dominion hired Toronto-Dominion Bank earlier this year to run the sales process.

The Dow and S&P; 500 both closed at new records while gauges of global stock markets also scaled fresh highs, capping their best week in more than two months. Oil prices rose 1 percent. The U.S. consumer price index increased 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since October 2016, after rising 1.9 percent in May, the Labor Department said. Year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent. The CPI's drop of 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound last month could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed a recent moderation in price pressures as temporary.  The CPI data begs the question, at what point does transitory becomes something that is more sustained, in terms of the softness,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. U.S. interest rates futures rose as traders pared their view the Fed would increase rates again in 2017.    The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, slid 0.64 percent to 95.113 after earlier falling to 95.100, its lowest since September 2016. The drop came after the U.S. data raised doubts about U.S. economic growth and whether the Fed will hike rates again this year.  This cements the weaker trend in the dollar and lower U.S. yields and I think this story has got legs,  Franulovich said. The annualized rate of inflation in several CPI components over the past three months showed declines of 4.9 percent in apparel, 5.5 percent in used cars and trucks and 4.1 percent in professional services, said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for brokerage Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc (SVS.L).

Buckley,Fitch Affirms Enstar's Ratings; Outlook Stable,Credit / Debt Ratings,Americas,Company News,Multiline Insurance (TRBC),Insurance (TRBC),Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,Insurance (Legacy),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Enstar Group Limited's (Enstar) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB', senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-' and senior shelf registration at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmation reflects Enstar's solid business franchise acquiring and managing non-life runoff companies, consistently strong profitability driven by favorable reserve development, reasonable financial leverage, and very strong earnings coverage. Offsets to these positives include the company's risk profile that is potentially subject to change based on future acquisitions and capital needs, reserves that are long-tailed and thus highly volatile, sizable reinsurance recoverable balance from runoff business and expansion into active non-life business that adds risk outside of the company's core non-life runoff business. Enstar has a leading position in the specialized niche market for non-life runoff (re)insurance business, with an experienced, disciplined and highly knowledgeable team. Enstar has been successful with its runoff acquisition and risk management strategy, generating favorable returns and significant growth in book value per share. Fitch views Enstar's profitability as strong, characterized by high returns on equity (ROEs), with the most recent five-year average (2012-2016) at 10.7%. Enstar posted positive net earnings in every year of its operating history dating back to 2002. The lower 7.7% ROE posted through the first three months of 2017 reflects the seasonality of runoff, with the majority of reserve development and commutations occurring during the second half of the year, as this coincides with reserve reviews and efforts by companies to finalize deals prior to year-end. The key source of Enstar's positive operating performance is its ability to ultimately settle reserves below acquired fair value through both effective claims management and commutations. Over the most recent five-year period (2012-2016), Enstar reduced its estimates of net ultimate prior-period losses in its non-life runoff business by $1.4 billion. This includes $292 million in 2016, representing 12% and 9% of beginning of year shareholders' equity and net non-life runoff loss/LAE reserves, respectively. Enstar's reserve mix changes as the company acquires runoff books and develops its active underwriting business while paying down existing reserves. As of year-end 2016, the largest exposure is to runoff workers' compensation reserves at 30% of total net non-life loss/LAE reserves, with active operations representing 20% of the total. Non-life runoff net reserves grew 35% in first quarter 2017 to $4.9 billion as Enstar assumed $1.6 billion of net insurance reserves ($2.3 billion gross) from two reinsurance deals with RSA Insurance Group and QBE Insurance Group. Enstar maintains a reasonable financial leverage ratio of 20.3% at March 31, 2017, up from 19.3% at Dec. 31, 2016. Debt includes $350 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2022 issued in March 2017. This issuance represented Enstar's initial public debt offering. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the company's revolving credit facility that was primarily utilized to partially fund the company's acquisitions. Fitch expects financial leverage to remain below 25%. Enstar's operating earnings-based interest coverage has been exceptionally strong, averaging a favorable 15.8x from 2012 to 2016, with 13.1x in 2016. GAAP earnings coverage dropped to 2.5x through the first three months of 2017, reflecting the seasonality of earnings that are more weighted to the fourth quarter. Fitch expects annual fixed-charge coverage to be maintained near 10x, which is viewed as very strong. Enstar's consolidated GAAP reinsurance balances recoverables on unpaid losses and loss expenses that totaled $2 billion at March 31, 2017, with 79% derived from the non-life runoff business. This level represents a sizable 70% of shareholders' equity (46% net of collateral), and creates a risk exposure to reinsurers as well as increased potential for reinsurer disputes. The company's active operations posted underwriting profitability in 2016 with combined ratios of 98.6% in StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited and 94% in Atrium Underwriting Group Limited (Atrium). Active non-life operations generated $788 million of net premiums written in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating sensitivities that could lead to an upgrade include continued business profile enhancement such that individual acquisitions and new business transactions have a more muted impact on the overall financial profile; further improvements in the financial strength and credit quality of the active underwriting businesses; and sustained risk-adjusted capital growth commensurate with business and reserve/exposure growth. Any potential future upgrade would likely be limited to one notch due to the nature of the company's business model in acquiring large blocks of runoff business, which can materially alter the company's balance sheet within a short-time horizon and thus places some constraints on the rating. While this risk has been managed well to date, it adds potential near-term capital, earnings and business/exposure mix variability at levels greater than experienced by most insurance companies operating under more traditional business models. Key rating sensitivities that could result in a rating downgrade include failure to generate continued material levels of favorable non-life runoff reserve development; additional capital needs to support the current run-off business; one or more significant new transactions that Fitch views as materially increasing the overall risk profile; net leverage ratio above 3.5x; declines in the financial strength of the active business due to sizeable underwriting losses or other factors; financial leverage ratio approaching 30%; and operating earnings-based interest coverage below 5x. VARIATIONS FROM CRITERIA Fitch's global master criteria report Insurance Rating Methodology references the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) as the typical initial anchor rating when assigning ratings to an insurance holding company. Enstar's anchor rating is the unsecured senior debt rating because the company's core business of non-life runoff does not lend itself to establishing a consolidated IFS rating for notching purposes. All of the Key Credit Factors defined in Fitch's master criteria report have been applied to Enstar to develop its unsecured senior debt rating. However, the median sector credit factor ratio guidelines included in the criteria for IFS ratings are assessed at one full rating category lower to reflect holding company level risk. This criteria variation is based on the fact that in the case of ring-fenced regulatory environments, holding company unsecured senior debt ratings are typically rated three notches (i.e. one full category) below the IFS rating. The holding company IDR is a standard one notch above the unsecured senior debt rating. The variation has not resulted in any change to the rating. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Enstar Group Limited --IDR at 'BBB'; --$350 million 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022 at 'BBB-'; --Senior shelf registration at 'BBB-'.

Yields, which move inversely to prices, on the benchmark 10-year note, including those on the 3-year and 7-year notes fell to two-week lows. U.S. two-year note yields, most sensitive to rate hike expectations, tumbled to three-week lows. U.S. inflation was unchanged in June, following a 0.1 percent dip in May. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up just 0.1 percent in June. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May. U.S. retail sales also underperformed, falling for a second month in June. Retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month. The rate futures market saw a 47 percent chance the Federal Reserve would raise key overnight borrowing costs by at least a quarter point at its Dec. 12-13 meeting, down from about 55 percent at Thursday's close, according to the CME Group's FedWatch. Eric Winograd, senior economist at Alliance Bernstein in New York, still believes the weakness in U.S. core inflation was not enough to change the Federal Reserve's course for raising interest rates.  They will get two more CPI prints and two more PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prints before the September meeting so they will have a lot more information before having to make a decision,  said Winograd.  Because I think the Fed's expectation that inflation will gradually rise from here is correct. I still think that a September announcement on the balance sheet is likely and that a rate hike in December is the base case. The U.S. consumer sentiment index also took a dip this month, with a 93.1 reading, from the previous month's 95.1, highlighting the overall bearish tone of Friday's U.S. data. In late trading, the U.S. 10-year yield fell to 2.324 percent, from 2.348 percent late on Thursday. It earlier fell to 2.279 percent, its lowest since June 30. U.S. two-year yields slid as well, down to 1.355 percent , from Thursday's 1.367 percent, after sliding to a three-week trough of 1.323 percent. The yield gap between shorter-dated and longer-dated Treasuries shrank on Friday after the data, with the spread between 2-year and 10-year yields at 96.70 basis points, its flattest level in more than a week. A flat yield curve suggests investors are buying long-dated securities because there is no fear of inflation.

We're going to make sure schools get open,  the Republican governor told reporters as he reiterated his opposition to a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in May that he called  fundamentally unfair  to schools and taxpayers. The bill establishes an evidence-based model that ties public school funding to  best practices  aimed at enhancing student achievement. It also allocates about $300 million more to the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) for state aid and pensions. Meanwhile, the $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget the Illinois General Assembly enacted last week over Rauner's veto prohibits the flow of state money to schools in the absence of an evidence-based funding model, raising concerns over whether the state will make a looming August payment to the school districts. The governor, a long-time critic of the financially struggling CPS, said the bill benefits  one school district  at the expense of others.  We need to get a fair school funding formula that's fair to everyone,  Rauner said, adding that the bill has not yet been sent to him by the legislature.  Votes in both the House and Senate for the measure's passage in May fell short of the three-fifths threshold required to override a veto. Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that a delay in the first fiscal 2018 state payment due schools in August would pressure districts, including junk-rated CPS, forcing some to tap reserves or borrow for operations.  School districts with relatively low property tax wealth or high poverty face the greatest risk from a disruption in state funding because of their material dependence on state aid,  Moody's said in a report. In fiscal 2016, some 119 school districts relied on state money for 50 percent to as much as 71.5 percent of their budgets, according to Illinois State Board of Education data.

The case is the latest in a series of civil and criminal actions the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department have pursued to crack down on automakers that cheat on pollution tests in an attempt to avoid paying the costs of compliance. The Justice Department said Wayne Powell, while serving as a government relations analyst based at Suzuki Motor's U.S. headquarters in Brea, California, submitted a report to the Environmental Protection Agency in September 2013 that said the automaker had credits to offset any excess tailpipe emissions from its motorcycles. The EPA informed Powell that the company did not have any banked credits, however. Powell submitted a second report in 2014 that said Suzuki's motorcycles did not exceed emissions limits and said he had corrected some mistakes due to a computer software problem. But the Justice Department said he had falsified the numbers in his report. Under a plea agreement made public Friday in U.S. District Court in Detroit, Powell faces up to two years in prison. Volkswagen AG in September 2015 admitted using sophisticated secret software in its cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in March in a U.S. court to three felonies in connection with the scandal. Last week, the government charged a former Audi manager with directing employees at the company, a division of Volkswagen, to design software to cheat U.S. emissions tests in thousands of Audi diesel cars and previously charged seven other current and former VW employees. In May, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit on accusing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/suzuki-motor-emissions-idUSL1N1K51JO"},

Fitch has also upgraded the region's National Long-Term Rating to 'AAA(pol)' from 'AA+(pol)'. The Outlooks are Stable. The affirmation reflects Fitch's view that the region's strong operating performance will be maintained over the medium term, providing strong debt service and debt payback ratios. This is despite the projected moderate growth of the region's total debt following the implementation of an ambitious capex programme. The upgrade of the National Long-Term Rating reflects the region's solid management practices and high flexibility on expenditure compared with the majority of Polish local governments rated 'AA+(pol)'. As a result the region is better placed to respond to potential negative developments in its economic environment. KEY RATING DRIVERS The solid management practices of Malopolska are underlined by the continuity in its policies and priorities, and their consistent implementation. This translates into stable and predictable financials for the region. In 2016 the region's operating results outperformed our projections, supported by income tax revenue growth (above 15%) and tight control of operating spending. Malopolska posted a high operating balance of about PLN133 million, accounting for 16.8% of operating revenue and covering the region's annual debt service (interests and repayments) by 3.1x. Fitch base case scenario expects Malopolska's operating results to remain solid in 2017-2020, with an average operating balance of PLN130 million or 13%-14% of operating revenue  (excluding one-off items), which is broadly in line with the last five years' results. In 2017 operating performance should be supported by one-off revenue of almost PLN50 million, including an investment-related VAT refund. As a result the region's operating balance may exceed PLN165 million or 18% of operating revenue. Fitch expects the region's budgetary deficit to average 5% of total revenue in 2017-2020 (deficit of 4.4% in 2016) following the roll-out of new investments co-financed from the 2014-2020 EU budget. Fitch projects that Malopolska's investment spending could total PLN2.6 billion in 2017-2020, ie. on average PLN650 million annually (or 45% of annual total expenditure), up from about PLN455 million in 2016. Fitch assumes that the region will continue to receive significant EU funds to co-finance its investments. Consequently, Malopolska's investments will be 90%- covered by capital revenue and the current balance, with the remainder from new debt. Malopolska did not incur any long-term debt in 2016, but financed its investments with bridging loans (PLN107 million at end-2016, to be repaid with EU refunds in 2017). It contracted a short-term PLN27 million loan in 2016 to finance VAT, which it repaid in 1H17. Fitch expects Malopolska's direct debt to remain moderate in 2017-2020, at below 65% of current revenue, although it will grow by about PLN50 million annually to total PLN600 million in 2020 (PLN385 million in 2016 or 48.5% of current revenue). This, together with bridging loans for funding EU co-financed investments, is likely to result in total debt increasing to PLN700 million in 2020 or a still moderate 75% of current revenue (PLN520 million or 65% in 2016). At end-2016 about 75% of the debt was made up of long-term loans from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and from the European Investment Bank, both on favourable terms. However, these loans expose the region to foreign exchange risk. As with other local governments in Poland, Malopolska is not allowed to hedge foreign exchange risk. However, this is mitigated by the region budgeting higher amounts for debt service than necessary. Fitch expects the region's debt service ratios to remain strong. Debt service, projected to average PLN60 million annually (principal and interests), is likely to be covered by the operating balance by more than 2x. The debt-to-current balance ratio is expected to weaken to around five years in 2019-2020 from about three years in 2014-2016, but should remain healthy at well below the region's final debt maturity (up to 10 years). Malopolska benefits from high spending flexibility, as reflected in the moderate share of fixed operating costs in the regional budget (staff costs accounted for about 31% of total operating expenditure in 2016). This balances the region's limited revenue-raising flexibility, as income tax rates are decided by the state (tax revenue accounted for about 60% of operating revenue in 2016). The region's economy is well-diversified. Malopolska contributed 7.8% (PLN133,974 million) to national GDP in 2014, making it the fifth-largest contributor among 16 Polish regions. However, due to its large population of 3.37 million, GDP per capita is about 10.9% below the national average. The regulatory regime for Polish local governments (LGs) is stable. Their activities and financial statements are closely monitored and reviewed by the central administration.  Disclosure of LGs' accounts is satisfactory. Main revenue is centrally distributed based on a legally defined formula, which limits the central government's scope for discretion. RATING SENSITIVITIES Malopolska's IDRs are currently constrained by the sovereign (A-/Stable) ratings and any change in the sovereign IDRs will be mirrored in the region's IDRs. The ratings may be downgraded if Malopolska's operating performance weakens and direct risk increases above 80% of current revenue on a sustained basis.

The Russia sanctions bill passed the Senate on June 15 by 98-2, but it has not come up for a vote in the House. The chamber's Republican leaders initially said there was a technical problem with how the bill was written, but after the Senate altered the bill to fix it, the measure still did not move. On Friday, Republicans suggested reworking the legislation to add new sanctions on North Korea. The Russia sanctions measure passed by the Senate is part of a broader bill that also includes new sanctions on Iran. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he wanted the North Korea sanctions added to the bill.  It would be a very strong statement for all of America to get that sanction bill completed and done, and to the president's desk,  the Republican lawmaker said in the House as it wrapped up its activity for the week.  Democrats rejected the suggestion as another tactic by Republicans supporting White House objections to the bill.   This isn't a serious proposal. It's the latest delay tactic,  said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The House passed a new package of sanctions on North Korea in May by 419-1, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, said on Thursday his committee would be taking it up soon.  On Friday, Corker said he would be  more than glad  to consider adding North Korea to the legislation if the House chose to do so. Engel said there was no point in passing North Korea legislation again. The Trump administration objects to a provision in the Russia bill that sets up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Moscow. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corker's 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. Lawmakers and aides have been negotiating for weeks to try to craft a compromise that would allow the Russia-Iran bill to move forward. On Thursday, they said they thought it could advance soon but on Friday said the North Korea issue made that less likely.

The issue ratings on Croatia's senior unsecured long-term foreign- and local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BB'. The Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs have been affirmed at 'B'. The issue ratings on the senior unsecured short-term bonds have also been affirmed at 'B'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Croatia's 'BB' IDRs reflect the following key rating drivers: The Croatian economy is benefiting from favourable cyclical conditions. Strengthening growth in regional trading partners, favourable wage and employment dynamics, robust tourism receipts and improved absorption of EU funds, resulted in real GDP growth rising to 3% in 2016 (the fastest since 2007), and are likely to support performance in 2017. However, economic performance will be affected by the restructuring of the country's largest private company, Agrokor. Agrokor was placed into state administration in April and had debt of around 12% of GDP at end-1Q17. Fitch expects the Agrokor fallout will extend to the company's suppliers and banks and that it will impact employment, investment and credit growth, and cause real GDP growth to slow to 2.6% in 2017 in the event of an orderly restructuring. A further slowdown is projected for 2018. Potential growth remains weak relative to peers, at 1%-2%, due to adverse demographics, structural rigidities, on-going external deleveraging and low investment during the 2009-2014 recession. Growth volatility is higher than 'BB' peers, as is unemployment, which was 13.1% at end-2016. Public finances have improved, leading to the lifting of the Excessive Deficit Procedure by the EU in June. After a sharp narrowing in the budget deficit in 2016 to 0.8% of GDP, the deficit is forecast to widen to an estimated 1.4% of GDP in 2017 as revenues are affected by recent tax reform and the 2016 spending freeze ends. Fitch anticipates moderate deficits to 2019 as the authorities stick to their medium-term target of a structural deficit of 1.75% of GDP in line with the EU Growth and Stability Pact, commensurate with a primary surplus. Primary surpluses will keep debt/GDP on a downward trend. Nonetheless, at a forecast 82.5% of GDP at end-2017 it will remain well above the 'BB' median of 49.5%. Materialisation of contingent liabilities, including from arrears in the healthcare sector or adverse litigations, poses a risk, as do exchange rate fluctuations, given that 76.5% of public debt was foreign-currency denominated at end-2016. Refinancing needs are high, exceeding 15% of GDP in 2017. Net external debt is high, at a projected 32.4% of GDP at end-2017, compared with a 'BB' median of 19.3% of GDP, and the external debt service ratio is nearly 3x the peer median. Risks are mitigated by the strength of the peg to the euro, supported by strong reserves. Fitch projects a decline of external indebtedness over the forecast horizon as robust tourism revenues support continued current account surpluses. The banking sector's strong capitalisation (the capital adequacy ratio was 22.5% at-end 2016), high liquidity and net external creditor position will help absorb spillover effects from Agrokor. However, the restructuring will likely put an end to the recent downward trend in NPLs and could reverse the uptick in new lending after years of domestic deleveraging. Fitch expects monetary policy to be accommodative as inflation remains moderate (1.1% yoy at May 2017), which could help stimulate credit. There is uncertainty over the longevity of the current ruling coalition. Following the fall of a coalition government in April, the dominant party of the coalition, the HDZ, avoided early legislative elections by forming a new coalition with the centrist HNS in June. However, the coalition's majority is only two and tensions could arise on some key legislative bills. Fitch's baseline scenario is that of economic policy continuity, but the fragility of the government and the risk of early elections may slow down the pace of structural reforms. Croatia's structural features compare very favourably with 'BB' medians. GDP per capita is more than twice the median; governance indicators, human development index and doing business indicators are also stronger than peers, reflecting the membership in the EU. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Croatia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BBB' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Macro: -1 notch to reflect weak growth potential and potential spillovers from the Agrokor restructuring on the economy and the banking sector - Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect non linearity of public debt at high levels not captured in the SRM and the high related refinancing needs - External Finances: -1 notch, to reflect the high net external debt (which is not captured in the SRM) Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: - Continued reduction in net external debt - Continued fiscal consolidation ensuring a material and sustained reduction in the public debt ratio - Strengthening of growth prospects and competitiveness, including through the implementation of structural reforms The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger negative rating action are: - Deterioration in growth prospects - A reversal of fiscal consolidation leading to unfavourable public debt dynamics KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that world growth will reach 2.9% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018, and that the eurozone will grow by 2% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. Fitch expects Croatia's track record of monetary and exchange rate policy stability to continue, minimising the risk of household, corporate and government balance sheets, all of which are heavily euroised.

The issue ratings on Romania's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BBB-'/F3. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB+' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F3'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Romania's investment grade rating is supported by its still moderate level of public debt, stable banking sector, and GDP per capita and governance indicators that are in line with 'BBB' range medians. However, the rating is facing an increase in downside risks owing to a substantial pro-cyclical fiscal loosening and rapid increase in wages in excess of productivity growth, which pose risks to macroeconomic stability. Romania's general government budget deficit widened to 3% of GDP in 2016 from 0.8% in 2015, despite the booming economy. The increase was due to large tax cuts and increases in public wages and social welfare payments. Fitch projects the deficit will widen to 3.7% of GDP in 2017, above the government's target of 2.9%, owing to further cuts in VAT and excise rates, and increases in public wage, pensions and other measures. Outturns for the first five months of 2017 show an underperformance in tax receipts of goods and services and corporate income, and the budget deficit (cash basis) RON1.4 billion wider year-on-year, despite rapid economic growth and low execution of capital expenditure. The structural budget deficit is set to widen to 3.9% of GDP in 2017, according to the European Commission, which would represent an expansion of 3.3% of GDP in two years, contrary to national and EU fiscal rules. Romania is at risk of re-entering the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure this year, having only exited it in 2013. In Fitch's view, there is a high level of uncertainty over the outlook for the budget deficit over 2017-2019 owing to an incompatibility between further expansionary fiscal measures in the government's programme and its budget deficit targets of 2.9% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. The recently approved Unified Wage Law involves a 25% hikes in public sector wages (more for the health and education sectors), albeit potentially partially offset by a shift in social security contributions to employees from employers effective January 2018. Other proposals include a net 23% increase in the minimum wage in 2018, a potential cut in the personal income tax rate to 10% from 16%, increased pensions and child benefits, a further cut in VAT (in 2019), changes to the corporate and personal income tax structure and the creation of an off-budget sovereign investment fund to increase investment in infrastructure and state owned enterprises. Further tax cuts would risk eroding the revenue-to-GDP base, which is the lowest in the EU. Taking advantage of EU structural funds would require an increase in the amount and quality of infrastructure expenditure. Fitch forecasts the budget deficit at 4% of GDP in 2018 and 2019. Nevertheless, Romania's general government debt/GDP ratio remains in line with the median 41% ratio of 'BBB' rated peers. Fitch forecasts it to increase to 39.9% of GDP by end-2017 from 37.6% in 2016. Debt repayments are moderate, averaging 3.5-4.0% of GDP annually up until 2019, and the government holds an adequate cash buffer equivalent to 3.6% of GDP, covering 5.1 months of gross financing needs. Economic growth is boosted by the fiscal stimulus. For 2017, Fitch has revised up its real GDP forecast to 5.1% from 4.8% previously, after a stronger than expected 1Q17, when GDP expanded 5.7% yoy (1.7% qoq). Growth is mainly consumption driven, led by households benefiting from robust growth in real wages. Import growth remains strong, but recovery in demand from Romania's key export partners helped net exports contribute positively to Q1 GDP, albeit at a modest level (0.2pp). Contribution from gross fixed capital formation remained negative. Fitch expects growth to ease to 3.4% in 2018 as the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus fade. There is a risk of the economy overheating, although inflation and bank credit growth are currently subdued. The National Bank of Romania estimates that the economy is already operating around 2% above potential and this will increase as actual GDP growth outstrips potential growth, which most independent institutions estimate at around 3.5%. The labour market is tight, with unemployment at a record low and hikes in the minimum wage and public wages have contributed to average wages outstripping productivity growth by a large margin leading to rising unit labour costs. Against this background, Fitch forecasts the current account deficit to widen from 2.3% of GDP in 2016 to 3.1% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018. Progress in converging Romania's GDP per capita levels towards that of higher rated peers has been slow, despite robust economic growth as the economy still faces structural challenges improving the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and absorption of EU-funds into economically viable projects. Romania's rating is constrained by its net external debtor position, which Fitch estimates at 18.9% of GDP for 2016, higher than the 'BBB' median estimate of 2%. Nevertheless, net external debt/GDP is declining, with the majority owed by the private sector and relating to intercompany lending. Romania's ratings are supported by a stable banking sector. Banks are well capitalised (sector capital adequacy ratio 18.8%, 2016), sufficiently funded by local deposits and their balance sheets continue to improve as the share of non-performing loans declines. Legislative risks to the sector have stabilised following a favourable ruling by the Constitutional Court on the Debt Discharge Law and CHF loan conversion, diminishing the risk of a large financial cost for the sector. Recent political developments risk weakening governance indicators and government policy direction. In June, former prime minister Sorin Grindeanu was ousted by his own party in unusual circumstances, ostensibly for slow progress in implementing the government programme. The PSD-ALDE coalition policies will now be carried through by new prime minister, Mihai Tudose of PSD. This includes the controversial Penal Code, which would result in pardoning certain crimes of those abusing powers in office, and which triggered large public demonstrations against the government in January. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Romania a score equivalent to a rating of 'BBB' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External Finances: -1 notch, to reflect Romania's significantly higher net external debtor position than the 'BBB' median, and lower international liquidity ratio than the 'BBB' median. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to the rating are currently balanced. The main risk factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger negative rating action are: - Persistent high fiscal deficits leading to an increase in government debt/GDP. - An overheating of the economy that poses a risk to macroeconomic stability. The main factors that could, individually or collectively, trigger positive rating action include: - Implementation of fiscal consolidation, which improves the long-term trajectory of public debt/GDP. - Sustained improvement in external finances. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes Romania's main economic partners in the EU will benefit from economic growth in line with its Global Economic Outlook.

We're going to make sure schools get open,  the Republican governor told reporters as he reiterated his opposition to a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in May that he called  fundamentally unfair  to schools and taxpayers. The bill establishes an evidence-based model that ties public school funding to  best practices  aimed at enhancing student achievement. It also allocates about $300 million more to the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) for state aid and pensions. Meanwhile, the $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget the Illinois General Assembly enacted last week over Rauner's veto prohibits the flow of state money to schools in the absence of an evidence-based funding model, raising concerns over whether the state will make a looming August payment to the school districts. The governor, a long-time critic of the financially struggling CPS, said the bill benefits  one school district  at the expense of others.  We need to get a fair school funding formula that's fair to everyone,  Rauner said, adding that the bill has not yet been sent to him by the legislature.  Votes in both the House and Senate for the measure's passage in May fell short of the three-fifths threshold required to override a veto. Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that a delay in the first fiscal 2018 state payment due schools in August would pressure districts, including junk-rated CPS, forcing some to tap reserves or borrow for operations.  School districts with relatively low property tax wealth or high poverty face the greatest risk from a disruption in state funding because of their material dependence on state aid,  Moody's said in a report. In fiscal 2016, some 119 school districts relied on state money for 50 percent to as much as 71.5 percent of their budgets, according to Illinois State Board of Education data. An Illinois Association of School Boards official has said that about a dozen districts may not be able to start classes next month if state funding is delayed.

The group of employees filed a C$35 million ($27.7 million)lawsuit on Thursday against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), saying they had been bullied for more than a decade.  CSIS is a workplace rife with discrimination, harassment, bullying and abuse of authority, in the which the tone set by management, namely to mock, abuse, humiliate and threaten employees, has permeated the workforce,  said the lawsuit. Last November, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police offered an apology to female officers and civilian members and settled claims of harassment, discrimination and sexual abuse made in two long-running court cases. The Canadian armed forces have experienced similar issues for years. In 2015, after an investigation uncovered widespread sexual misconduct and hostility towards minorities and women, the new chief of the defense staff said such behavior  must stop now.  CSIS director David Vigneault said the agency took allegations of inappropriate behavior very seriously.  CSIS does not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying under any circumstances,  he said in a statement on Friday, while declining to comment on the specific allegations. CSIS, which employs 3,300 people, has suffered a number of problems since it was created in 1984. Last November, a court declared it had illegally kept data collected during investigations and threatened sanctions. Of the five employees who are suing the agency, three are Muslim, one is gay and one is black.  The gay agent, who has a Muslim partner, stated his manager sent him an e-mail in 2015 that said  careful your Muslim in-laws don't behead you in your sleep for being homo.   The group said superiors regularly made derogatory comments, including that all Muslims were  blood thirsty murderers  or  terrorists.  Richard Fadden, who served as head of CSIS from 2009 to 2013, said he had not had the sense the agency suffered from such problems when he was in charge.  We could not generalize that all Muslims, or all members of any group, were potential terrorists because we had to identify the real terrorists,  he said in a phone interview.  If some of the allegations are true they need to be dealt with quickly.  The opposition New Democrats called for an immediate investigation, citing potential concerns for Canada's national security.

In beating Czech Tomas Berdych in straight sets, the Swiss became the first man to reach 11 finals at the All England Club - making the contention that, after knee surgery and a six-month layoff, he is back to his best at 35 more compelling than ever.  It was a long way back in some ways. Last year was so difficult. Just to stay calm and speak to the team, to take another decision that we were going to sit out and wait,  Federer told the BBC after his 7-6(4) 7-6(4) 6-4 win. January's Australian Open marked his competitive comeback and he won it, besting great rival Rafa Nadal in five sets in a final for the ages. Since then Federer has only lost twice.  I'm so happy I did (the break) because my life continues after tennis too. And that's at this point almost more important than playing itself,  Federer said.  I want to be a good dad and a good husband and a guy who can do sports later on too, so I think giving your body a rest from time to time is a good thing, as we see now.   After another dose of R&R; in missing the claycourt season to better prepare for his favorite tournament, he has yet to drop a set this fortnight. Croatia's Marin Cilic stands between him and a record eighth Wimbledon title, an outcome Federer was at pains not to take for granted.  Last year we had a brutal quarter-final. I was down two sets to love and match points down,  he said.  At some stage things were extremely complicated and I had to get really, really lucky to win.  Whether that might set a precedent for Sunday is another matter for the spectacularly rejuvenated Federer. In 2016, the Swiss lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to Milos Raonic. This year he gained revenge over the Canadian in the quarters for the loss of just 12 games.

The 11th seed pushed Federer hard on Centre Court but whenever the glimpse of an opportunity arose he found the evergreen 35-year-old tantalisingly out of reach. Berdych had beaten Federer the last time they played at Wimbledon - in the 2010 quarter-finals when the Czech went on to lose the final to Rafa Nadal - but the version he faced in the sunshine seven years later appears to have turned back the clock.  I don't see anything that would indicate really Roger is getting older or anything like that,  Berdych, who went down 7-6(4) 7-6(4) 6-4, told reporters.  I think he's just proving his greatness in our sport. So I think that's all I can say about that. That's very simple. This guy doesn't really seem like he's slowing down at all.  If you look at the other guys who are 35 or 36, I think you can very clearly see that the age and the years on tour are affecting them. But not with him. He's doing the right way.  You have to be a unique one for that.  If there was any consolation for Berdych to take into the rest of the season, having fallen to a seven-year low of 15th in the ATP rankings, it was that he made Federer sweat on his way to record 11th Wimbledon final. Eighteen-times major champion Federer had reached the semis without losing a set and while he kept that record intact, there was rarely a moment in the two hour 18 minute contest that he could truly relax, such was Berdych's commitment. It was only a small consolation, though, for the Czech who sported a pair of Novak Djokovic branded shoes because his own ones had been causing him discomfort.  Close or far doesn't really matter. The score is important, and that shows pretty much straightforward,  Berdych, who now trails Federer 19-6 on head-to-head, said.  I mean, he's playing barely with any mistakes. He was controlling the game pretty well. Even those two sets in the tiebreak, I was still the one facing more break points.

The decision follows a similar one against Japanese bank Nomura last month, in what Crystallex says is a broad campaign it is waging to seize Venezuelan assets held in the United States as recompense for the 2008 nationalization of its Las Cristinas gold mine. In 2016, the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Crystallex $1.386 billion in compensation for the seizure. Venezuela has made no attempt to pay the company, Crystallex said.  We intend to use all means available to enforce the judgment,  said Robert Weigel, partner at New York law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which is representing Crystallex. Weigel said the firm was looking to target Venezuela's largest asset in the United States: Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA.  The prize here is Citgo and we're getting closer to getting it,  he said. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the request to bar Haitong from transferring the securities, according to the court papers.Crystallex, which cited Reuters and other news outlets in the request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent collection on the award. Around 20 companies have filed suits against Venezuela at ICSID for a wave of nationalizations under former President Hugo Chavez. Crystallex's moves against Haitong and Nomura are the most aggressive to date. As Venezuela undergoes a major crisis, with millions suffering food shortages and soaring inflation, the ruling further complicates the nation's efforts to raise cash from international financiers. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months against President Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded Chavez after his death. Opposition leaders are urging banks not to finance Maduro's government, citing human rights violations. Maduro insists his government is victim of an  economic war  and has lambasted the opposition's campaign to block financing deals. Both Haitong and Venezuela will be able to respond to the restraining notices, Crystallex said in its request. Haitong and Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sessions said in a statement that the administration would  reluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court  in a bid to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The Justice Department could file papers with the high court as soon as Friday.  By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,  Sessions Said. The Supreme Court last month said the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted.  The truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s stay order defies common sense,  said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban.  That’s what the district court correctly found, and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact.  The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session, but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administration's application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. Separately, the Justice Department filed papers in Hawaii federal court saying it would appeal Watson's ruling to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That would give the government a second route to the Supreme Court. Earlier on Friday, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters that the ruling appeared to be  fairly broad and something that would trouble me if it was as broad as reported.  Bossert, speaking aboard Air Force One as the president returned from a trip to Paris, focused his remarks on the part of the ruling that would allow more refugees to enter the country, saying the ruling could be interpreted as  so expansive as to cover every refugee.  In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government's definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense.  Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week. The Supreme Court's decision last month revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution.

The group of employees filed a C$35 million ($27.7 million)lawsuit on Thursday against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), saying they had been bullied for more than a decade.  CSIS is a workplace rife with discrimination, harassment, bullying and abuse of authority, in the which the tone set by management, namely to mock, abuse, humiliate and threaten employees, has permeated the workforce,  said the lawsuit. Last November, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police offered an apology to female officers and civilian members and settled claims of harassment, discrimination and sexual abuse made in two long-running court cases. The Canadian armed forces have experienced similar issues for years. In 2015, after an investigation uncovered widespread sexual misconduct and hostility towards minorities and women, the new chief of the defense staff said such behavior  must stop now.  CSIS director David Vigneault said the agency took allegations of inappropriate behavior very seriously.  CSIS does not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying under any circumstances,  he said in a statement on Friday, while declining to comment on the specific allegations. CSIS, which employs 3,300 people, has suffered a number of problems since it was created in 1984. Last November, a court declared it had illegally kept data collected during investigations and threatened sanctions. Of the five employees who are suing the agency, three are Muslim, one is gay and one is black.  The gay agent, who has a Muslim partner, stated his manager sent him an e-mail in 2015 that said  careful your Muslim in-laws don't behead you in your sleep for being homo.   The group said superiors regularly made derogatory comments, including that all Muslims were  blood thirsty murderers  or  terrorists.  Richard Fadden, who served as head of CSIS from 2009 to 2013, said he had not had the sense the agency suffered from such problems when he was in charge.  We could not generalize that all Muslims, or all members of any group, were potential terrorists because we had to identify the real terrorists,  he said in a phone interview.  If some of the allegations are true they need to be dealt with quickly.  The opposition New Democrats called for an immediate investigation, citing potential concerns for Canada's national security.

The decision follows a similar one against Japanese bank Nomura last month, in what Crystallex says is a broad campaign it is waging to seize Venezuelan assets held in the United States as recompense for the 2008 nationalization of its Las Cristinas gold mine. In 2016, the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Crystallex $1.386 billion in compensation for the seizure. Venezuela has made no attempt to pay the company, Crystallex said.  We intend to use all means available to enforce the judgment,  said Robert Weigel, partner at New York law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which is representing Crystallex. Weigel said the firm was looking to target Venezuela's largest asset in the United States: Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA.  The prize here is Citgo and we're getting closer to getting it,  he said. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the request to bar Haitong from transferring the securities, according to the court papers.Crystallex, which cited Reuters and other news outlets in the request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent collection on the award. Around 20 companies have filed suits against Venezuela at ICSID for a wave of nationalizations under former President Hugo Chavez. Crystallex's moves against Haitong and Nomura are the most aggressive to date. As Venezuela undergoes a major crisis, with millions suffering food shortages and soaring inflation, the ruling further complicates the nation's efforts to raise cash from international financiers. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months against President Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded Chavez after his death. Opposition leaders are urging banks not to finance Maduro's government, citing human rights violations. Maduro insists his government is victim of an  economic war  and has lambasted the opposition's campaign to block financing deals. Both Haitong and Venezuela will be able to respond to the restraining notices, Crystallex said in its request. Haitong and Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and soft domestic demand.  Economists had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent last month. Its drop of 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory.  The CPI data begs the question, at what point does transitory becomes something that is more sustained, in terms of the softness,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.6 percent to 95.152 after earlier falling to 95.132, its lowest since September 2016. U.S. interest rates futures rose as traders pared their view the Federal Reserve would increase rates again in 2017.   Moderating price pressures suggest the Fed may be less willing to lift U.S. borrowing costs for a third time this year,  Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington, said in a note. The U.S. dollar remained broadly on the back foot against major currencies. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback was down 0.65 percent to 112.53 yen, after hitting a near two-week low of 112.28 yen.  Dollar-yen has got a lot more downside and it could easily go to 110 yen before the summer is out, in fact the next few weeks, especially with U.S. yields heading lower,  Franulovich said. The higher yielding Aussie and New Zealand dollars jumped, with the Australian dollar hitting a near 15-month high as risk appetite was robust with global stock markets hitting record highs and after dovish comments from global policymakers. The Aussie was 1.23 percent higher against the greenback at $0.7821. South Africa's rand hit a two-week high against the greenback. The euro was up 0.62 percent against the greenback to $1.1466 and sterling was 1.18 percent higher at $1.3088, after hitting $1.3093, its highest since September, 2016.

U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, the latest in a run of mixed reports that have kept traders skeptical about the Fed's stated plan for one more rate hike this year and three in 2018.      On Thursday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said it would be  quite challenging  for the United States to reach the 3 percent growth target set by President Donald Trump.     A slower pace of policy tightening could boost the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets, driving up the value of their currencies.     The Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar for the seventh straight day to reach its strongest since May 2016, while the Brazilian real firmed 0.8 percent.     Yields on Mexican interest rate swaps rose after the central bank chief said it is premature to talk about reducing interest rates in the first six to nine months of 2018.      Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens told Reuters that a pause in interest rate increases is likely at the bank's next monetary policy meeting.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index posted its fifth day of gains, with shares of engineering firm MRV Engenharia e Participações SA the biggest riser after posting solid growth in the second quarter.     Shares of Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, rose 3.3 percent after it closed a deal to transfer stakes in Transmineiras to Transmissora Aliança de Energia Elétrica, known as Taesa.

A decline in bank shares limited the day's gains, however. Data showed consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and subdued expectations of strong economic growth in the second quarter.  The data is pointing to this continuation of fairly accommodative policy which has obviously served the market well over the last few years. So as far as the market is concerned, it's sort of more of the same,  said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets in Boston. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 48 percent after the release of data, from 55 percent late Thursday. Earlier this week, the market rose after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. Among the day's biggest drags were shares of banks following their results. JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by strong loan growth and higher interest rates, though it reported its net interest income for the year would be lower than expected. Its stock was down 1.1 percent. Shares of Citigroup were down 0.6 percent and Wells Fargo fell 1.3 percent, despite reporting quarterly profits that beat analysts' expectations. The S&P; 500 financial index fell 0.6 percent and was the only laggard among the 11 major S&P; sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 89.11 points, or 0.41 percent, to 21,642.2, the S&P; 500 gained 12.15 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,459.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.69 points, or 0.65 percent, to 6,315.12. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will report results next week.  The bar for earnings is higher this time around, especially after the phenomenal (profit) growth we saw in the first quarter. So companies that miss expectations or guide down will be overly punished,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier. First-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 is trading at 17.3 times forward earnings, above the long-term average of 15 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

In a court filing, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trump's March 6 executive order, which he says is needed for national security reasons, came after the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which were blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred.  The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. He ruled for the state late on Thursday. In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judge's ruling  empties the (Supreme) Court’s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just “close” family members but virtually all family members. FILE PHOTO: Tom Bossert, Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump during a news briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 11, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administration's application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request.  The truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s stay order defies common sense,  said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban.  That’s what the district court correctly found and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact.  In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government's definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense.  Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watson's ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Court's decision on that part of the executive order  effectively meaningless.  The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  The Supreme Court's decision last month revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution.

Mortgages have modestly underperformed a slow-moving bond market this year, and the sector has seen a steady trickle of outflows of investor dollars, but no stampede for the exits. Investors in the sector by and large remain sanguine, and big players are confident the Fed's glacial pace of portfolio normalization - and willingness to resume bond purchases if needed - will limit their downside.  For now, it simply means that MBS investors should not be concerned about a sudden or drastic change to the Fed's willingness and ability to hold a sizable position of MBS for the foreseeable future and beyond,  Walt Schmidt, manager of mortgage research at FTN Financial in Chicago. Fed officials have signaled they plan soon to begin reducing the bank's $4.24 trillion portfolio of Treasuries and MBS, and market participants expect the process to begin this fall.  Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, have stated a preference for holding only Treasuries in the future, in part to escape criticism that MBS ownership equates to picking winners and losers in markets and the economy.  That means that nearly $1.8 trillion of mortgage bonds, roughly 30 percent of the $6 trillion of securities backed by government-sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, could run off the Fed's portfolio over the next decade. It is a delicate maneuver that the Fed intends to ease into at a snail's pace.  Abandoning MBS altogether might send mortgage rates soaring and roil the housing market, a critical plank in the economy. So far, though, plans telegraphed by the Fed have produced no sign of disruption even as mortgage interest rates have edged up. A Risky Short MBS have produced a 1.45 percent total return so far in 2017, lagging the 2.24 percent generated by all investment-grade U.S. debt, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays Capital. Against that weak performance and the prospect of a slowdown in Fed purchases, some investors might be tempted to bet against the sector, but bond managers at some of the biggest U.S. investment firms caution against it.  In our view, unless they can size and time short positions perfectly - tough to do - investors are unlikely to make money shorting agency MBS at current levels,  according to Daniel Hyman, co-head of agency MBS portfolio management at Newport Beach, California-based PIMCO, which has $1.51 trillion in assets. Indeed, one measure of underperformance signals MBS are already substantially discounted relative to Treasuries. The spread, or yield premium, on MBS over Treasuries has widened this year, reaching its widest in nearly two years in late June at 33 basis points. It has narrowed modestly since. So a modest rise in MBS supply on the open market as the Fed buys less should be well absorbed among investors who are seeking low-risk bonds that offer higher yield than Treasuries, fund managers said.  There's virtually no credit risk and you get a lot more yield,  said Bonnie Wongtrakool, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California, with $432.7 billion in assets. No Tantrum Repeat, So Far When it kicks off the portfolio reduction, the Fed initially plans to slow its MBS purchases by just $4 billion a month and take a year to reach its maximum reduction pace of $20 billion a month, according to plans published recently by the Fed. At that rate, it would take nearly eight years for all of the $1.77 trillion of mortgage securities to roll off. So far, the Fed's announced intentions have managed to ward off a repeat of the 2013  taper tantrum  when, with the final QE program still in full swing, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke surprised markets by signaling the bank was contemplating a reduction of its bond purchases.  Spooked investors dumped bonds, resulting in a widespread spike in mortgage rates and other long-term borrowing costs. MBS spreads shot to levels twice as wide as they are now. This time, a run of weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data, notably a softening in inflation, have kept a lid on bond yields despite the Fed signaling further rate increases in the coming months.  We think the balance sheet unwind is fully priced in and don't expect significant market reaction when the Fed starts the process,  said Brian Quigley, portfolio manager at the fixed-income group at Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard which manages $4.4 trillion in assets.

Investigations are being conducted in the United States into possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and Russia during the presidential election campaign in 2016. The White House and the Kremlin have denied there was any interference in the election. Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, told reporters she had filed a resolution of inquiry demanding the U.S. Treasury Secretary hand over documents in his possession,  relating to President Trump's financial connections to Russia, certain illegal financial schemes, and related information . The resolution asked for any records of loans or credit from a number of banks - including Deutsche Bank and Russian lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) - to Trump, and 22 of his closest associates, including family members and top White House and campaign advisers. Specifically, the group is seeking documents that may have been unearthed by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that could show any ties between Trump's finances and Russia. A resolution of inquiry is a legislative tool by which the House can request information from the administration.

Members of Bundu dia Kongo, a separatist cult blamed for an attack on Kinshasa's main prison in May in which about 4,000 inmates escaped, often wear red bands and carry similar items.     The incident in the heart of Kinshasa's business district further heightened security fears, after a series of mass prison breaks and worsening militia violence across the country. Insecurity in the vast central African country, where millions died in civil wars around the turn of the century, has intensified since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired in December. Police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu said in a statement that unidentified assailants killed the administrator of Kinshasa's Central Market and a police officer from a nearby station. Six other officers were seriously wounded, he said. Hydro Eloko, an official at the market, told Reuters that the attackers stabbed the administrator and several police officers. Other witnesses confirmed his account. A Reuters reporter saw a pool of blood and shattered glass in the administrator's office and drips of blood on the ground outside shortly after the attack.     People ran for blocks to flee the scene and shops on nearby streets were shuttered as dozens of soldiers and police officers were deployed in pickup trucks.

Odebrecht admitted in December to paying bribes across Latin America, and Peru and Brazil have led the most aggressive corruption investigations to date. The arrest order for Humala from Peruvian Judge Richard Concepcion came a day after former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for graft.  Toledo, believed to be in the United States, refused to turn himself in this year, after Concepcion ordered him jailed before a trial for allegedly taking a $20 million bribe from Odebrecht.

Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, told reporters she had filed a resolution of inquiry demanding the U.S. Treasury Secretary hand over documents in his possession,  relating to President Trump's financial connections to Russia, certain illegal financial schemes, and related information . The resolution asked for any records of loans or credit from a number of banks - including Deutsche Bank and Russian lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) - to Trump, and 22 of his closest associates, including family members and top White House and campaign advisers. Specifically, the group is seeking documents that may have been unearthed by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that could show any ties between Trump's finances and Russia. A resolution of inquiry is a legislative tool by which the House can request information from the administration.

He wanted his company to go beyond selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the U.S. government - one of the world's biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools.  Kaspersky set up a U.S. subsidiary, KGSS, in Arlington, Virginia that would be focused on winning that business. He sponsored flashy conferences with high-profile speakers -including Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump's national security adviser - sought to join U.S. trade groups and even underwrote programming on National Public Radio.  All of this was done to burnish Kaspersky's image and help it become an accepted vendor for the U.S. government despite its Russian roots, according to people familiar with the strategy.  But Eugene Kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among U.S. intelligence officials that he and his company were, or could become, pawns of Russia's spy agencies. Kaspersky  has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,  the company said.     Kaspersky's American ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in U.S.-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, and later when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had hacked the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Testifying before the U.S. Congress in May, U.S. intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that Kaspersky products could be trusted.  FBI agents last month interviewed Kaspersky employees, asking whether they reported to Russia-based executives and how much data from American customers could be seen by Russian employees, according to three current and former employees. The FBI declined to comment on Thursday.  On Tuesday, the U.S. General Services Administration, the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy, removed Kaspersky from a list of approved vendors, saying GSA's mission was to ensure the security of U.S. government systems.  There is also a bill before Congress that would explicitly bar the Defense Department from using any Kaspersky products.  Kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons.   These reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition, slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys,” he said in a statement to Reuters.   The Arlington offices of KGSS were empty when a Reuters reporter visited them on Thursday. A Kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff, which number less than 10, often work from home.  The U.S. clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the Russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks.  Two former employees and a person briefed on the FBI case told Reuters that Kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users' machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals, even when those files were not corrupted by viruses.  “Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations,” the Kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email.  Unusual Step  It is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing.  The offices of KGSS (Kaspersky Government Security Solutions), a subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab North America dedicated to providing cybersecurity services to the U.S. government, sit closed and empty during normal work hours in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., July 13, 2017.Dustin Volz This sets a really dangerous precedent  where other nations could make similar, unsubstantiated claims against U.S. vendors, said Robert M. Lee, a former cyberwarfare operative for U.S. intelligence and now CEO of cybersecurity startup Dragos.  The Russian government has denounced the Kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures. Officials at U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Russia say they fear they could become targets.  Federal contracting databases reviewed by Reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from Kaspersky, and an employee confirmed the company's federal government revenue was  miniscule.   But Kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third-party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, U.S. officials say.  Founded in 1997, Kaspersky grew rapidly through the 2000s to become one of the world's leading anti-virus software companies. (Kaspersky's global reach: tmsnrt.rs/2uWTQoV)  But the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the KGB. Eugene Kaspersky attended a KGB school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the FSB.  FILE PHOTO - Eugene Kaspersky, chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab, answers a question during an interview in New York, U.S. on March 10, 2015.Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoAs the company grew, Kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears.   We have to be more American than Americans,  Kaspersky told Reuters in 2013, when a U.S. goodwill offensive began.   Public Shaming   A cornerstone of the effort was a series of KGSS-hosted conferences in Washington where prominent U.S. officials including Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director, former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden and House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul discussed cybersecurity issues.  The company privately courted U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation-state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm, according to people present at those meetings.   They came to us and said, 'We want to change our image, we know people don't trust us',  said one former senior Obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings.  But the suspicions never subsided. When the company sought to join one Washington-based technology trade organization, it was  politely told it couldn’t happen,  according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter.  The source said industry group officials had an inside joke:  Kaspersky (membership) is like having the Kremlin join.   Not coincidentally, Kaspersky's government sales effort never gained traction. In an email to Reuters, the company noted  complexities associated with doing business with North America’s government sector.   Privately held Kaspersky said its U.S. revenue, most of which comes from selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses, slipped from $164 million in 2014 to about $156 million in 2016.  Some U.S. national security experts say Kaspersky is being treated unfairly. Lee said he has long been bothered by the  public shaming  of Kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence.  The U.S. government has the right to choose not to use Kaspersky products for any reason, he said, but  the way they are doing it  is wrong.   I don’t believe in geographic restrictions that say, 'Because Kaspersky is a Russian-based company, therefore it is bad,'  said former White House cybersecurity policy coordinator Michael Daniel.  You would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior.

After the U.S. Veterans Administration implemented its Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative in 2009, growth of enrollment of terminally ill male war veterans in hospice care outstripped enrollment growth in hospice programs for elderly men who did not serve, according to the report in Health Affairs. More veterans likely enrolled in hospice care because the initiative allowed them to continue to have curative treatments, said Joanne Spetz, a professor at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. Other hospice programs require participants to cease disease-modifying treatment. Spetz suspects that being able to use both hospice and concurrent care motivated people to sign up for hospice care  because it wasn’t an either/or decision,” she said in a phone interview. Deciding to forego chemotherapy, radiation or any other possible curative treatments can be difficult for patients and families, said Spetz, who was not involved in the study.  “There’s fear that if I sign up for hospice, I’ve given up,” she said. “It’s also hard for the physician, who’s trained that death is a loss.” Researchers compared hospice use among more than 1.1 million male veterans ages 65 and older between 2007 and 2014 with more than 140,000 demographically similar Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in VA healthcare.  By 2011, they found that 44 percent of veterans who died in hospitals took their last breaths in hospice beds, compared to 30 percent in 2008. By 2012, 71 percent of veterans dying of cancer were enrolled in hospice. Lead author Susan Miller, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, and her team structured the study to examine whether the VA initiative drove growth beyond that in the general Medicare population. Before the initiative, veterans were 15 percent less likely than non-veterans to go into hospice, Miller said in a phone interview. Today, they’re 2.4 percent more likely. The VA initiative focused on increases in palliative and hospice care. By 2012, the VA had installed 54 new hospice and palliative-care inpatient units, the authors write. Elderly men who were not veterans increased hospice use by 5.6 percent between 2007 and 2014, while older male veterans increased hospice use by 7.6 percent, the study found.  Previous studies repeatedly document that dying people receive higher-quality end-of-life care with hospice, the authors write. “Numerous studies show hospice improves quality of care and results in less aggressive and undesired care, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations near the end of life,” Miller said.  “The quality is better, and families feel it’s better,” she said. Spetz applauded the VA initiative for its concerted effort to provide palliative-care and hospice staff across the country. But she wondered if the effort could be reproduced in other healthcare systems. “If you tried to implement this program in a community program, it would be a lot harder,” she said. “It speaks well for integration of care because many people have very, very fragmented care. Could you really pull this off outside the VA?” The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is currently testing a hospice program that allows curative care to continue, called the Medicare Care Choices Model. Miller believes conversations between patients and clinicians soon after a diagnosis of serious illness are key. “The VA’s having discussions with veterans earlier to understand preferences and to meet their needs,” she said.  “It’s the conversations that are so important,” she said. “The VA is trying to have more of these conversations and document the preferences earlier.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tel1xX Health Affairs, online July 5, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-veterans-hospice-idUSKBN19Z288"},

Steve Whitmire made his comments in a blog post on Thursday, days after the Muppets Studio's announcement of a new puppeteer to perform the role of the earnest Kermit, one of creator Jim Henson's best-known characters. Kermit was performed by Henson since he created it in 1955 until his death in 1990. The character is best known for its tempestuous relationship with the ardent Miss Piggy. Whitmire, who started working on  The Muppet Show  in 1978 at age 19, took over the role from Henson. He called the Muppets  not just a job, a career or even a passion. They are an urgent, undeniable, impossible-to-resist way of life.   I would never consider abandoning Kermit,  he added on his personal blog site, saying he was told in October 2016 that executives at Muppets Studio, owned by Walt Disney Co,  would be replacing the Kermit puppeteer. Without giving details, Whitmire said executives had raised two issues with him that he had tried to remedy in the past nine months without success. Disney executives declined to discuss the reasons for Whitmire's departure but issued a statement saying  the Muppets Studio thanks Steve for his tremendous contributions to Kermit the Frog and The Muppets franchise. We wish him well in his future endeavors.  Whitmire performed the role of Kermit in numerous television shows, movies and live appearances, including  Sesame Street,   Fraggle Rock,   Muppets Most Wanted,  and in the recent fictional talk show TV reboot  The Muppets,  which ABC canceled in 2016 after one season. He also voiced the roles of Ernie, Rizzo the Rat, Beaker and Statler. Performer Matt Vogel will make his first outing as Kermit in a  Muppets Thought of the Week  video coming out next week.

Steve Whitmire made his comments in a blog post on Thursday, days after the Muppets Studio's announcement of a new puppeteer to perform the role of the earnest Kermit, one of creator Jim Henson's best-known characters. Kermit was performed by Henson since he created it in 1955 until his death in 1990. The character is best known for its tempestuous relationship with the ardent Miss Piggy. Whitmire, who started working on  The Muppet Show  in 1978 at age 19, took over the role from Henson. He called the Muppets  not just a job, a career or even a passion. They are an urgent, undeniable, impossible-to-resist way of life.   I would never consider abandoning Kermit,  he added on his personal blog site, saying he was told in October 2016 that executives at Muppets Studio, owned by Walt Disney Co,  would be replacing the Kermit puppeteer. Without giving details, Whitmire said executives had raised two issues with him that he had tried to remedy in the past nine months without success. Disney executives declined to discuss the reasons for Whitmire's departure but issued a statement saying  the Muppets Studio thanks Steve for his tremendous contributions to Kermit the Frog and The Muppets franchise. We wish him well in his future endeavors.  Whitmire performed the role of Kermit in numerous television shows, movies and live appearances, including  Sesame Street,   Fraggle Rock,   Muppets Most Wanted,  and in the recent fictional talk show TV reboot  The Muppets,  which ABC canceled in 2016 after one season. He also voiced the roles of Ernie, Rizzo the Rat, Beaker and Statler. Performer Matt Vogel will make his first outing as Kermit in a  Muppets Thought of the Week  video coming out next week.

The sale process, which is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is in its early stages and no price range has been formally established, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the matter is private. They added, however, that a fair value for Chilean distribution companies is considered to be about 10 times EBITDA - or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization - likely giving GasValpo a price in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. Canberra-based Whitehelm, which is 30 percent owned by Australia's Challenger Ltd, did not respond to requests for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment. The asset would likely be attractive to pension funds given that it has a slow-but-steady income structure, one source said. Among the pension funds active in Chilean infrastructure are the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). Earlier in 2017, media reported that Argentine billionaire Eduardo Eurnekian was in talks to sell nearly half of Gas Andes Chile, which transports gas from Chile to Argentina. In December, Portugal's REN Redes Energeticas Nacionais purchased 42.5 percent of Chilean pipeline company Electrogas from Enel Chile for $180 million. A consortium involving Whitehelm Capital's predecessor, Access Capital Advisors, purchased GasValpo in 2004 in a $90 million deal, and the company has since undergone an expansion drive. The distributor, which serves more than 96,000 clients, is dominant in Valparaiso, Chile's second largest city. It has also made inroads into nearby cities in recent years, such as La Serena to the north and Talca to the south, where it participates in a satellite regasification plant. Chile is currently modifying its gas distribution regulations by putting a cap on yearly profits for regulated distributors, among other measures, meaning there will be fewer opportunities for unusually wide profit margins.

But shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) were down in afternoon trading. Investors had wanted to see even better results and hear a sunnier outlook from executives, analysts said.  Bank stocks were due for a breather,  Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told Reuters.  They had a lot of optimism priced into the shares as investors got excited about rising interest rates and the prospect for regulatory reform. However, the fundamental picture is more mixed.  JPMorgan, for instance, reported loan growth, deposit growth and higher net interest income, which measures the difference between its cost of funding and the revenue it generates from those funds. Overall, its earnings rose 13 percent. However, management now expects net interest income to rise by $4 billion this year, down from a previous outlook of $4.5 billion, due to a combination of mortgage adjustments, weakness in markets-related income, and unexpected  downward pressure  on 10-year bonds. As JPMorgan's stock dropped 1.1 percent to $92.05, Citigroup bank stock analyst Keith Horowitz said investors were disappointed by the gloomier outlook, and had  a high bar priced into the stock.  Related CoverageFactbox: Big U.S. banks start earnings on a tepid noteThe Federal Reserve has raised rates three times since the second quarter of last year, with the latest increase coming in June. Rising rates are generally good for banks, but because there have been uneven movements in short- and long-term rates, lenders have not seen income grow as quickly as investors expected. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC each reported year-over-year increases in their loan books. Wells and PNC said the spread between what they pay for deposits and charge for loans had grown, thanks to higher rates. They all beat analysts' average estimates for earnings per share. But Wells Fargo's revenue came in shy of expectations, and analysts questioned executives about elevated expenses on a conference call. Its shares were down 1.2 percent at $54.94. The J.P.Morgan logo is seen at their offices at Canary Wharf financial district in London,Britain, March 3, 2016.Reinhard KrauseCitigroup's picture was muddied by the nature of its business. The bank relies less on deposits from consumers, who have not demanded higher rates as quickly as institutional customers. A big chunk of its loan growth came from credit cards that do not carry balances, meaning it does not earn interest from those loans. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach encouraged analysts to think not just about income tied directly to those loans, but other business it generates from underlying customers. Slideshow (2 Images) But we like the business that we've been putting on,  he said.  We certainly would rather have loan growth than non-loan growth.  Citi shares were down 0.7 percent at $66.54. PNC showed particular strength in commercial loans, and its net interest income rose 5 percent as deposit costs rose less than the yields it earned. The bank plans to expand its corporate lending business, and stuck with its prior forecast that its loan book will grow in the mid-single digits for the full year. But even that positive outlook generated some surprise. Its shares were down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading at $126.78.  You maintained the full year '17 guidance,  Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari said on a conference call with management.  Why not up?

{"news_time":"2017-07-14 14:50:00","news_title":"Conagra’s new SCOTUS pitch: Seesaw week proves need for ascertainability review","keywords":"Samuel Issacharoff,US,OTC,ASCERTAINABILITY,Analyses,United States","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - Late Thursday, Conagra filed a new brief at the U.S. Supreme Court, asserting an irrefutable argument: If there was any doubt that federal appellate courts continue to struggle with the issue of class certification and identifying class members, this week resolved it. According to Conagra, rulings in the last seven days from the 2nd and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeals make it all the more obvious that the Supreme Court must tell the lower courts what to do about class action ascertainability.  Conagra has asked the Supreme Court to review a 9th Circuit decision that upheld certification of a class of Wesson Oil purchasers who claim products were falsely labeled as all-natural. The 9th Circuit rejected Conagra’s defense that the class could not be certified because purchasers could not be identified by an objective and administratively feasible process. Following the lead of the 7th Circuit – and explicitly rejecting contrary precedent from the 3rd Circuit – the 9th Circuit held in Briseno v. Conagra that sworn affidavits from plaintiffs are a perfectly fine way to ascertain class membership.  When Conagra’s Supreme Court lawyers from Jones Day first asked for the justices’ attention in April, they knew the court had rejected two previous requests for review of the ascertainability issue, including a petition in the 7th Circuit case that first created a split among the federal appellate courts. So Conagra emphasized the depth of the circuit split, arguing that three other circuits – the 2nd, 4th and 11th – are aligned with the 3rd Circuit, while the 6th, 7th and 9th stand on the other side. (The 8th Circuit’s precedent, Conagra said, is ambiguous.) Class certification in substantially identical cases, Conagra said, now turns on where the case is filed.  The plaintiffs suing Conagra, as I’ve reported, countered that the circuit split isn’t as intractable as Conagra said and may simply resolve itself in light of the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision to uphold certification of a class of meat-processing employees in Tyson v. Bouaphakeo.  That argument seemed to gain credibility last Friday, when the 2nd Circuit issued its ruling in In re Petrobras Securities. The 2nd Circuit used the Petrobras securities class action opinion as a vehicle to clarify its stance on class action ascertainability. The court said it actually agreed with the 7th and 9th Circuits that the federal class action rules do not implicitly require plaintiffs to offer a failsafe means of identifying class members in order to be certified. The 2nd Circuit explicitly disagreed with the 3rd Circuit’s heightened ascertainability standard, citing a “growing consensus” in the circuits.  The plaintiffs suing Conagra, represented at the Supreme Court by New York University professor Samuel Issacharoff, jumped on the 2nd Circuit’s Petrobras holding in a supplemental brief to the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “In light of what the 2nd Circuit terms the ‘growing consensus,’ this is precisely an area where the law should be permitted to percolate before premature, and perhaps unnecessary, intervention from the court,” the brief said. “There will be time enough for review if conflict persists -- something that appears to be an increasingly remote prospect.”  But at almost the exact same time that plaintiffs filed that supplemental Supreme Court brief, the 6th Circuit issued a decision complicating its stance on ascertainability. The 6th Circuit had been counted as an ally of the 7th and 9th Circuits' position, by virtue of a decision in which it said it saw no reason to adopt the 3rd Circuit’s heightened ascertainability test. Nevertheless, in its ruling Tuesday in Sandusky Wellness Center v. ASD Specialty Healthcare d/b/a Besse Medical, the 6th Circuit agreed that plaintiffs’ affidavits in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act class action were not an adequate means of identifying class members.  That’s a lot of ascertainability action in a week, and Conagra’s new brief attempts to synthesize it in a mere five pages of text. Part of the filing is devoted to explaining why, in Conagra’s view, the plaintiffs overstated the significance of the 2nd Circuit’s Petrobras decision. When you put aside the opinion’s talk of a growing consensus against the 3rd Circuit standard, Conagra said, the 2nd Circuit’s actual holding requires plaintiffs to provide an objective criteria for class membership. That standard, Conagra said, cannot be squared with the 9th Circuit’s decision in the Wesson Oil case.  The brief spends far less time on the 6th Circuit’s Sandusky decision, but said it’s also clearly at odds with the 7th Circuit and the 9th Circuit. Regardless of how the circuits align, Conagra said, it’s obvious that the courts “remain deeply divided” about the problem of unidentifiable class members.  Essentially, Conagra’s brief suggests the real issue isn’t whether the federal rules include an implied ascertainability requirement but the baseline question of whether courts should allow class actions on behalf of unidentified – and possibly unverifiable – class members. The Supreme Court has danced around that question but hasn’t directly answered it. Conagra is arguing that it’s now time to decide.  “Any split in the all-important area of class certification deserves this court’s attention, let alone one as deep as plaintiffs themselves recognize,” the brief said. “Whatever the circuits may say about the ascertainability label, they fundamentally disagree where it counts: whether a class may be certified without any clue as to how to efficiently identify absent class members. This court should put an end to this persistent, important dispute.”  I’ve said before that the Conagra case is an important test of the new court’s willingness to look at fundamental class action questions. This week’s developments, as Conagra wrote, highlight the very basic issue – who’s in the class? – at the heart of the ascertainability split. We’ll know next fall whether the Supreme Court is ready to answer the question.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-ascertainability-idUSKBN19Z269"},

The performance of CalPERS’ public equities, or stock portfolio, topped the S&P; 500 benchmark of major U.S. companies stocks, 19.7 percent to 15.3 percent. The private equity asset class returned 13.9 percent. Real estate had a preliminary net return of 7.6 percent. The returns marked the first time CalPERS has exceeded its expectations since 2014. It also helped to raise the funded status to 68 percent from 65 percent the previous fiscal year, based on a 7 percent discount rate.  I am proud of our investment team for achieving double digit returns this year,  said Ted Eliopoulos, CalPERS chief investment officer.  Our globally diversified portfolio performed well across most asset classes, and we were able to take advantage of what the market gave us.  Eliopoulos warned that these preliminary returns are a one-year snapshot, and the fund's  focus is always on the long-term. We invest for decades, not years.  Among other asset classes, fixed income returned 0.3 percent to CalPERS, while inflation assets lost 2.7 percent. The total fund returned 8.8 percent over the past five years, and 4.4 percent over the last decade. Over the last 20 years, the fund returned 6.6 percent. The $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the fund's assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020. Adding to the challenges, CalPERS is cash negative, meaning it has been paying out more in benefits to retirees each year than it has been collecting in contributions from workers.  Investment earnings are typically the major revenue source for public pension funds, so lower-than-expected investment returns can lead to fund deterioration. To improve, pension funds either need to earn better-than-expected returns in the future, request higher contributions from current workers, or reduce retiree benefits.  CalPERS is focused on the long-term sustainability of our system,  said Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost.  Of course, we welcome this fiscal year's strong returns, but we also remain about 68 percent funded and vulnerable to a downturn in stock markets. This will be our focus as we continue to move through the asset allocation process over the next six months.

Instead, conservative groups such as Heritage Action for America won the ears of Senate Republicans when it came to changing the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. The snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for Medicaid, and threatens to further frustrate the months-long effort to dismantle Obamacare.  The latest version of the Senate bill, released on Thursday, left the Medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the U.S. House of Representatives. A nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly $800 billion in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years. While insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets, the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on Medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals.  These groups, along with insurers, will be charged with enforcing the new law, so Republicans need their buy-in, health policy experts say.   A health policy means nothing if it can't be implemented and doesn't work,  said Andy Slavitt, former administrator under President Barack Obama of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw Obamacare. Conservative Sway The Republican bill ends Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and slashes traditional Medicaid funding, with cuts that deepen beginning in 2025. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation in May.   A lot of conservatives, Heritage Action included, desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the Medicaid portion wasn't watered down in the Senate,  said Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group.  It was something we made known to folks up in the Senate.   When Democrats and the White House enacted Obamacare seven years ago, support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through Congress. The administration actively courted the health industry, lobbyists and former Obama administration officials said, viewing their support as critical to winning votes. While health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with Republican lawmakers, they said their input on the bill's Medicaid changes was largely ignored. A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not immediately available for comment. In 2017, the top hospital, doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than $13 million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of 2017, according to a congressional lobbying database.  One hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by Republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support.  Individual Insurance Changes That has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market. Insurers, including some of the biggest providers of Obamacare individual plans, Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Molina Healthcare (MOH.N), have been asking for changes to specific policies.  For instance, the Senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate, the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee. In its place, insurers received one of their biggest demands: a provision in the bill that provides incentives for Americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse.  If that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes, lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to Medicaid, said Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consultant group to hospitals and insurers  The rubber meets the road on the Medicaid provision,  Carpenter said.

A day after Froome showed a rare sign of weakness on the final slope, Team Sky sent Mikel Landa in front when twice champion Alberto Contador attacked early on, forcing his other rivals to chase as the Spaniard became a threat for the overall title. Froome and team mate Michal Kwiatkowski contributed to the chase later in the stage to make sure the Briton would stay ahead of Landa in the general classification.  It's not the perfect plan for Sky to have Chris Froome attacking and chasing against Landa,  American LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said on Friday in his daily chat with Reuters.  There is something else going on,  he added, referring to the fact that Landa's contract expires at the end of the season. On Thursday, Landa and sports director Nicolas Portal were seen arguing after the Spaniard finished 17 seconds ahead of his leader in Peyragudes as Froome cracked in the final 200 metres.  There was a problem after yesterday's stage and I thought it was crazy because Landa rode Chris up to 200 metres from the finish,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. Sky, however, can play the Landa card again as he is fifth overall, 1:09 behind race leader Fabio Aru, and both Landa and Froome could work as a double act.

Landa dedicated himself to the team yesterday and he was criticised or talked down.  Should Landa be loyal or go for it if he fancies his chances?  In 1985, I made the mistake of being loyal and nobody paid me back,  said LeMond. In 1985, although he was possibly as strong as his leader, LeMond was riding in support of Bernard Hinault, who promised he would help the American win the following year. The Frenchman failed to deliver and raced against LeMond, who did nevertheless prevail in the end. But Landa's contract could mean he has to help Froome, who was in a similar position in 2012 when he seemed stronger in the mountains than Sky team mate and eventual champion Bradley Wiggins, all the way to Paris.     It depends on his contract. It depends what he agreed to, most likely that he is a lieutenant for Chris Froome and if that's the case he should be loyal,  said LeMond.

Hamilton, who is 20 points behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after nine races but chasing his fourth successive home victory, had a similar problem at the previous round in Austria which Bottas won from pole.  His gearbox was damaged in the same way as Lewis's but less severely, and we had hoped to coax it to the end of the cycle,  said a Mercedes spokesman.  However, we have not been able to do so.

Another weak CPI reading stoked concerns about whether the U.S. central bank would raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017. With little evidence of upward price pressure in the economy, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), whose payments to investors are adjusted against the CPI, lagged regular Treasuries after the government said CPI was unchanged last month, compared with a 0.1 percent gain forecast among analysts polled by Reuters.  The Fed is moving further away from its (inflation) target,  said Fred Marki, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California.  Even when we had some better growth earlier this year, it didn't feed into inflation.  Back in February, year-on-year CPI reached 2.7 percent, which was the biggest increase in five years before cooling to 1.6 percent in June, which was the smallest gain since October 2016. Investors' inflation expectations, measured by the yield difference between TIPS and regular Treasuries, have contracted 35 basis points as the CPI retreated on lower prices on gasoline and mobile phone services. In late trading, the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year TIPS and benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, was 1.77 percent, down 0.5 basis point from Thursday, according to Tradeweb and Reuters data. . The 10-year breakeven rate had fallen more than 3 basis points shortly after the June CPI report. It pared its losses as regular Treasury yields bounced off their session lows and a report from the University of Michigan that showed a rise in consumer inflation expectations in early July. Year-to-date, TIPS produced a total return of 0.77 percent, less than the 1.68 percent gain on regular Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. While another weak CPI reading further diminished the TIPS' prospects, investors are not ready to abandon the sector. TIPS-focused funds have enjoyed consistent inflows despite the softening in inflation. Their assets grew to $63.2 billion in the week ended July 12, which was the most going back nearly 15 years, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.  We are not going to see a body blow to the TIPS market,  Western Asset's Marki said.  TIPS might hold their own in the next quarter or two.

But shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) were down in afternoon trading. Investors had wanted to see even better results and hear a sunnier outlook from executives, analysts said.  Bank stocks were due for a breather,  Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told Reuters.  They had a lot of optimism priced into the shares as investors got excited about rising interest rates and the prospect for regulatory reform. However, the fundamental picture is more mixed.  JPMorgan, for instance, reported loan growth, deposit growth and higher net interest income, which measures the difference between its cost of funding and the revenue it generates from those funds. Overall, its earnings rose 13 percent. However, management now expects net interest income to rise by $4 billion this year, down from a previous outlook of $4.5 billion, due to a combination of mortgage adjustments, weakness in markets-related income, and unexpected  downward pressure  on 10-year bonds. As JPMorgan's stock dropped 1.1 percent to $92.05, Citigroup bank stock analyst Keith Horowitz said investors were disappointed by the gloomier outlook, and had  a high bar priced into the stock.  Related CoverageFactbox: Big U.S. banks start earnings on a tepid noteThe Federal Reserve has raised rates three times since the second quarter of last year, with the latest increase coming in June. Rising rates are generally good for banks, but because there have been uneven movements in short- and long-term rates, lenders have not seen income grow as quickly as investors expected. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC each reported year-over-year increases in their loan books. Wells and PNC said the spread between what they pay for deposits and charge for loans had grown, thanks to higher rates. They all beat analysts' average estimates for earnings per share. But Wells Fargo's revenue came in shy of expectations, and analysts questioned executives about elevated expenses on a conference call. Its shares were down 1.2 percent at $54.94. The J.P.Morgan logo is seen at their offices at Canary Wharf financial district in London,Britain, March 3, 2016.Reinhard KrauseCitigroup's picture was muddied by the nature of its business. The bank relies less on deposits from consumers, who have not demanded higher rates as quickly as institutional customers. A big chunk of its loan growth came from credit cards that do not carry balances, meaning it does not earn interest from those loans. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach encouraged analysts to think not just about income tied directly to those loans, but other business it generates from underlying customers. Slideshow (2 Images) But we like the business that we've been putting on,  he said.  We certainly would rather have loan growth than non-loan growth.  Citi shares were down 0.7 percent at $66.54. PNC showed particular strength in commercial loans, and its net interest income rose 5 percent as deposit costs rose less than the yields it earned. The bank plans to expand its corporate lending business, and stuck with its prior forecast that its loan book will grow in the mid-single digits for the full year. But even that positive outlook generated some surprise. Its shares were down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading at $126.78.  You maintained the full year '17 guidance,  Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari said on a conference call with management.  Why not up?

The S&P; 1500 Homebuilding index .SPCOMHOME of homebuilder companies has surged 32 percent this year and hit a decade-high earlier this week. By contrast, the wider S&P; Composite 1500 Index .SPCOMP has gained less than 9 percent. Housing optimists are pinning their bets on strong U.S. job creation, low interest rates, tight housing supply, robust earnings estimates and a lack of recessionary red flags.  Some investors still see opportunities, but others warn the stocks may have run too far.   The sentiment has been quite positive for housing but where they are today, I'm not a buyer of housing stocks. The stocks have run up faster than the data supports and there are better pockets of value in the market,  said Erin Browne, global macro portfolio manager at UBS O'Connor in New York. Brown cited weakening growth in building permits and new projects, known as housing starts, since the first quarter as well as land and labor constraints.   While new home sales still look solid, they are still low versus historical levels, given the ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots which is constraining faster growth,  she said.   Data shows first quarter single-family housing starts grew 6 percent year-over-year and 8.5 percent in May. Overall housing starts have risen 1.27 percent so far this year. Next week's June data is expected to show an 8.3 percent increase from May.  Demand overall has been positive for the builders,  according to Will Randow, analyst at Citi, although he questioned whether it was positive enough to support such an outsized gain by the group. Randow believes the stocks have risen partly on hopes that policy changes by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump could help boost home sales. Double-Digit Growth Wall Street analysts expect most home builders to report solid double-digit earnings growth, according to Reuters data.  D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), whose quarterly profit is seen rising 14 percent, and PulteGroup (PHM.N), pegged for 15.5 percent earnings growth, will both report in the last week of July. But Randow says the 2017 median earnings estimate for 12 housing stocks he covers has barely changed in the last three months.  Maybe the stocks have gotten ahead of themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see any sort of correction in housing starts.  Earlier this week, Barclays downgraded four U.S. homebuilders, citing a buyer traffic pullback in its June survey that was inconsistent with rising valuations. Short interest in seven homebuilders - the four biggest and the three biggest year-to-date gainers - has risen by 20 percent for 2017, with much of that increase coming in June and July, according to financial analytics firm, S3 Partners. Of the seven, the biggest recent short-selling increase was in LGI Homes (LGIH.O), whose shares are up 46.6 percent for 2017, followed by NVR Inc (NVR.N), up 51.4 percent. And recent trading in SPDR S&P; Homebuilders ETF (XHB.P) has leaned toward defensive bets with options positioning implying  investors are on guard against a near-term decline. Still, some investors still see value.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, likes D.R. Horton and LGI Homes, and expects a home shortage to boost prices.   Maybe there's another 20 percent in these stocks over the next 12 months, assuming that interest rates stay relatively low,  said Bradshaw.  I still think there's plenty of home buyers and not that many homes.

The performance of CalPERS’ public equities, or stock portfolio, topped the S&P; 500 benchmark of major U.S. companies stocks, 19.7 percent to 15.3 percent. The private equity asset class returned 13.9 percent. Real estate had a preliminary net return of 7.6 percent. The returns marked the first time CalPERS has exceeded its expectations since 2014. It also helped to raise the funded status to 68 percent from 65 percent the previous fiscal year, based on a 7 percent discount rate.  I am proud of our investment team for achieving double digit returns this year,  said Ted Eliopoulos, CalPERS chief investment officer.  Our globally diversified portfolio performed well across most asset classes, and we were able to take advantage of what the market gave us.  Eliopoulos warned that these preliminary returns are a one-year snapshot, and the fund's  focus is always on the long-term. We invest for decades, not years.  Among other asset classes, fixed income returned 0.3 percent to CalPERS, while inflation assets lost 2.7 percent. The total fund returned 8.8 percent over the past five years, and 4.4 percent over the last decade. Over the last 20 years, the fund returned 6.6 percent. The $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the fund's assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020. Adding to the challenges, CalPERS is cash negative, meaning it has been paying out more in benefits to retirees each year than it has been collecting in contributions from workers.  Investment earnings are typically the major revenue source for public pension funds, so lower-than-expected investment returns can lead to fund deterioration. To improve, pension funds either need to earn better-than-expected returns in the future, request higher contributions from current workers, or reduce retiree benefits.  CalPERS is focused on the long-term sustainability of our system,  said Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost.  Of course, we welcome this fiscal year's strong returns, but we also remain about 68 percent funded and vulnerable to a downturn in stock markets.

Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a “Section 232” review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before.  The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration. Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices.  But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers. Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.   “Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,” said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.  Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry. Pros and Cons Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers.    The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis.  FILE PHOTO - Rebar is seen in New York May 6, 2013.Eric ThayerBut manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs.  Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves. When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down. Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs. Political Risk Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump’s campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors.       They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “We’ve been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,” said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who  declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House.  Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists.  Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc., Ball Corporation, and Electrolux, submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs.  The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil, Shell Oil Company, Chevron and Dow Chemical Company, issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors. “The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,” the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments.

The figure was less however than the 2 percent government forecast for 2017 in a country where traditionally activity slows in the second half of the year. The Communist-run island's economy slipped into its first recession in nearly a quarter century last year, as it wrestled with declining oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, a slide in exports and a lack of cash. In his speech to the Cuban parliament that meets twice a year, Cabrisas said  this conjunction of accumulated problems cannot be resolved completely in the short term.  He added the coming half year would not be exempt from tensions, according to the state-run Cuban News Agency. The Caribbean island is struggling to pay foreign providers on time and seeking longer payment terms, Western diplomats say. The minister acknowledged liquidity problems in his speech. Meanwhile, Venezuela's crude and fuel deliveries to Cuba slid almost 13 percent in the first half this year, according to documents from state-run oil company PDVSA viewed by Reuters. The main bright spot in the economy, tourism, performed strongly in the first half of the year with the number of tourists rising 23 percent on the year, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero told the National Assembly on Wednesday. But U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba as part of a rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente, casting a shadow over the industry's outlook. Cabrisas said that besides tourism, construction, transport, communications drove economic growth in the first half of the year. Agricultural production was also positive, except for beef and milk, he said. The minister added that the government had approved 11 new ventures, five in the Mariel special development zone, which Cuba wants to develop into the Caribbean's main shipping hub, and six outside. Since becoming president in 2008, Raul Castro has sought to update Cuba's Soviet-style command economy, cutting the bloated state payroll, introducing reforms and aiming to drum up foreign investment. The United Nations estimates the Cuban economy will grow 1 percent this year, in line with a 1.1 percent expansion on average throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.

Speculation about his return has been gathering pace, however, and he impressed in two recent tests with Renault in 2012 cars with V8 engines and demonstration tyres. Abiteboul was wary of adding to the hype, reminding reporters at the British Grand Prix that the current V6 turbo hybrid cars were very different beasts.  What I can tell you is that he is still quick, he is still very consistent and more importantly he has this energy and this drive, this enthusiasm that he has always had,  said the Frenchman.  It's really too early to talk about next steps... right now, the focus is on getting the most out of the overall line-up and package that we have. Then we will think about 2018 in due course.  Asked whether the evaluation so far had shown that Kubica was capable of racing a Formula One car, the Frenchman replied:  I don't want to say yes or no. It's not like a test that you are passing at an exam.  We've not seen any obvious roadblocks.

More than 4,400 migrants were due to come ashore during the day after being picked up this week in the southern Mediterranean by rescue boats belonging to European Union and Italian authorities as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Italian government, desperately trying to stem the flow, has drafted a set of rules for NGOs operating on the edge of Libyan territorial waters. The 10-point code, published by Huffington Post's Italian edition and confirmed by a government source, would oblige NGOs to prove their ability to carry out rescues, and forbid them to fire flares that could prompt smugglers to push their boats out to sea. It would also oblige rescue organizations to stop transferring migrants to other ships and instead complete their disembarkation in a safe port themselves, which would limit their operations. If any of the roughly nine NGOs that regularly deploy boats refuses to sign up, it could be barred from Italian ports, meaning it would have to take the migrants to other countries.  Italy is organizing a meeting with the NGOs next week to present the finalised code, the source said.  After Italian and EU officials discussed the issue in Brussels on Thursday, an official said the EU Commission was worried about the risk of accidents in and around Libyan waters, and happy that Italy was working on a code. As of July 13, some 86,123 migrants had come to Italy this year, up 10 percent on the same period last year, according to the interior ministry. While NGOs have said the planned rules will make it more difficult to help migrants fleeing poverty and war, a United Nations spokeswoman said Italy needed more help dealing with the crisis.  Basically, in Italy we need more solidarity from the rest of the European Union. In Libya we need more stability, but we also need, across all of Africa, better investment in order to help people (there),  said Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. Besides 1,428 newcomers who arrived in the Sicilian port of Catania, a further 3,000 were due to arrive in the mainland ports of Salerno, Brindisi and Crotone.

Year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent. The CPI's drop of 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound last month could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed a recent moderation in price pressures as temporary.  The CPI data begs the question, at what point does transitory becomes something that is more sustained, in terms of the softness,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, slid 0.57 percent to 95.187 after earlier falling to 95.181, its lowest since September 2016. The drop came after the U.S. data raised doubts about U.S. economic growth and whether the Fed will hike rates again this year.  This cements the weaker trend in the dollar and lower U.S. yields and I think this story has got legs,  Franulovich said. The annualized rate of inflation in several CPI components over the past three months showed declines of 4.9 percent in apparel, 5.5 percent in used cars and trucks and 4.1 percent in professional services, said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for brokerage Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc. The data indicates  a little bit of concern about how the Fed is going to normalize policy,  Learner said. Yields Drop U.S. Treasury yields dropped to multi-week lows as the benign inflation data and unexpected fall in retail sales fueled doubts about an interest rate increase later this year. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.3176 percent. The 10-year German bund yield fell some 3 basis points when European trading started on Friday to 0.49 percent before paring losses. The euro gained 0.61 percent to $1.464. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.63 percent versus the greenback at 112.56 per dollar, while the Mexican peso gained 0.72 percent and the Canadian dollar rose 0.57 percent versus the greenback. Stock markets, meanwhile, marched higher. MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries gained 0.58 percent, and its world index rose 0.56 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares rebounded to rise 0.10 percent and close at 1520.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.51 points, or 0.34 percent, to 21,625.6. The S&P; 500 gained 9.57 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,457.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.69 points, or 0.49 percent, to 6,305.13. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors rose, with information technology up 0.77 percent to lead the advancers. Shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo , which have run up in the past few weeks, were lower as their earnings reports failed to excite investors. In oil markets, benchmark Brent and U.S. WTI futures contracts were on track for weekly gains. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil, were up 35 cents at $48.77 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 35 cents to $46.43 per barrel.

Any delays to government spending could hobble recovery in  Africa's largest economy, now in its second year of recession. The 2017 budget, still not finalised in the second half of the year, was meant to spark that return to growth after the first downturn in a quarter of a century. The presidency and senior lawmakers had also promised that it would avoid the severe delays in passing the previous year's budget, which was signed off in May 2016 -- five months into the budget year. Acting President Yemi Osinbajo signed Nigeria's 2107 budget into law last month. The delays for the 2017 budget come as the presidency locks horns with the National Assembly over projects added to the document in a practice known as  padding  -- lawmakers' efforts to funnel money and development to their local jurisdictions at the expense of the federal government.  Before the budget was signed it was agreed between the executive and the lawmakers that those insertions of some new projects into the budget made by the National Assembly should be removed and replaced with the priority projects of the federal government which the lawmakers removed,  a presidency official told Reuters, declining to be named because they were not authorized to speak to media. Osinbajo signed this year's budget, despite it not being finalised, because the process had already dragged on for too long, the official said. A budget ministry spokesman referred Reuters to Osinbajo's June statement from the budget signing, in which he said the National Assembly had agreed to reinstate federal government projects and that  will be expeditiously considered and approved by the National Assembly.  He declined to say whether funds from the 2017 budget had begun to be released. (To view a graphic on Nigeria's economy, click reut.rs/2urAprj) Fund Transfers The presidency could still transfer funds from one part of the budget to another, said Abdulrazak Namdas, a spokesman for the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of parliament. He added that the budget, now signed into law,  must be implemented . A spokesman for the Senate, the upper chamber of the National Assembly, did not immediately respond to phone calls and text messages requesting comment. A presidency spokesman declined to comment. The acting president has led Nigeria for most of 2017 while the ailing President Muhammadu Buhari remains in London on medical leave. Last year's budget was similarly delayed for months by disagreements between lawmakers and the presidency over spending plans that cut the supply of government money and deepened the economic crisis. Last month, Buhari said in a statement that the 2018 budget proposal will be submitted by October and parliament will conclude the process by December so the country can return to a normal budget cycle from next year.

More than 4,400 migrants were due to come ashore during the day after being picked up this week in the southern Mediterranean by rescue boats belonging to European Union and Italian authorities as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Italian government, desperately trying to stem the flow, has drafted a set of rules for NGOs operating on the edge of Libyan territorial waters. The 10-point code, published by Huffington Post's Italian edition and confirmed by a government source, would oblige NGOs to prove their ability to carry out rescues, and forbid them to fire flares that could prompt smugglers to push their boats out to sea. It would also oblige rescue organizations to stop transferring migrants to other ships and instead complete their disembarkation in a safe port themselves, which would limit their operations. If any of the roughly nine NGOs that regularly deploy boats refuses to sign up, it could be barred from Italian ports, meaning it would have to take the migrants to other countries.  Italy is organizing a meeting with the NGOs next week to present the finalised code, the source said.  After Italian and EU officials discussed the issue in Brussels on Thursday, an official said the EU Commission was worried about the risk of accidents in and around Libyan waters, and happy that Italy was working on a code. As of July 13, some 86,123 migrants had come to Italy this year, up 10 percent on the same period last year, according to the interior ministry. While NGOs have said the planned rules will make it more difficult to help migrants fleeing poverty and war, a United Nations spokeswoman said Italy needed more help dealing with the crisis.  Basically, in Italy we need more solidarity from the rest of the European Union. In Libya we need more stability, but we also need, across all of Africa, better investment in order to help people (there),  said Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. Besides 1,428 newcomers who arrived in the Sicilian port of Catania, a further 3,000 were due to arrive in the mainland ports of Salerno, Brindisi and Crotone.

Net income of $7 billion was up 13% year over year (YoY), which contributed to the firm's 12% return on common equity in 2Q17, up from 10% in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, return on tangible equity was 14% in 2Q17, up from 13% in 2Q16. These performance metrics are expected to remain above those of the peer group over the balance of the year as benefits from loan growth and higher interest rates, combined with continued expense discipline, provide continued earnings momentum. This quarter's results included a $406 million legal benefit related to settlements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Deutsche Bank in relation to the receivership of Washington Mutual. The legal benefit was recognized as non-interest revenue for the firm. Excluding this benefit Fitch calculates that JPM's return on average equity would have been 10.3%. Net income in the firm's Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment was $2.2 billin, down 16% from the prior year due to lower mortgage banking net revenue. The decline in this revenue was due to higher rates that led to increased funding costs, lower production margins due to higher volumes in the correspondent channel, and lower mortgage servicing rights (MSR)-related hedging revenues. Offsetting this was 13% annual net revenue growth in consumer and business banking, reflecting continued strong deposit growth and increased margins amid higher interest rates. Card, Consumer Solutions and Auto was down 3% YoY, but this comparison was impacted by $200 million of non-core items in last year's 2Q. Excluding this, net revenue would have been up 2%, driven by higher net interest income and higher auto lease volumes, which were up 8.2% compared to the year-ago period. CCB's non-interest expenses were up 8% relative to the prior year due to business growth and investments in marketing. CCB's provisions for losses were $1.4 billion, up $193 million YoY primarily due to a build in credit card reserves. Results in CIB were mixed, with overall net revenue down 3% from the prior year. Strong performance from Investment Banking across multiple products combined with 35% growth in lending-related revenue was offset by weaker performance in the trading businesses. Markets and Investor Services net revenue was collectively down 11% from the prior year with lower revenue in Rates, Credit, and Commodities amid sustained low volatility and tighter credit spreads. Fitch expects Markets revenue to remain variable given its high correlation to market conditions. Securities services net revenue was up 8% primarily due to higher interest rates. Given the mixed revenue performance in CIB, non-interest expenses declined 5% versus the prior year due to lower compensation expenses. Credit costs in CIB improved by $53 million in 2Q17 from 2Q16 primarily due to better performance of energy related credits. Net income in JPM's Commercial Bank segment was strong, growing 30% YoY due to higher net interest income amid strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads. In addition, the segment benefited from a significant $130 million reserve release related to energy exposure. JPM's Asset and Wealth Management segment performed well, with net income up 20% YoY. Assets under management (AUM) was up 11% relative to the prior year to a record $1.9 trillion, dthe result of higher market values and positive net flows into liquidity products. JPM's liquidity position continues to be strong. Total deposits grew 8% YoY to $1.4 trillion primarily due to growth in interest-bearing accounts. Additionally, the loan-to-deposit ratio remained strong and below peer averages at 63%. JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common Equity ratio was up to 12.5% under the standardized approach, which management believes will be the bank's binding constraint capital ratio. The Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (ESLR) was 6.7% at the parent, well above regulatory requirements. JPM paid a dividend of $0.50 per share in the quarter equating to a dividend payout of about 27%. The bank repurchased $3 billion of common equity in the quarter. Including share repurchases, total payout in the quarter was about 72%. On June 22, 2017, the Federal Reserve released the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) results which JPM passed. Fitch estimates that JPM was affected adversely by the global market shock and counterparty default scenarios relative to other DFAST institutions. The binding capital ratio for JPM under DFAST was the ESLR. On June 28, 2017, JPM received a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which authorizes the firm to repurchase up to $19.4 billion of common equity between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018.

The e-commerce titan's plan to buy upscale grocery chain Whole Foods triggered fresh fears of its dominance. For the time being, consumers and investors probably keep winning.  The plan to push aggressively into food last month rattled more than just supermarket investors. It stirred competition critics, too. Open Markets, a branch of Washington think tank New America, called for the government to block the Whole Foods deal and launch an investigation into how it impedes rivals. One hedge-fund boss said this week he was betting against the stock because of a possible congressional review.  Amazon's growing power is obvious. Various estimates reckon the firm founded by Jeff Bezos already controls at least a third of U.S. online retail purchases. After generating $136 billion in revenue last year, it also grabbed 5.1 percent of total retail sales in the categories it serves, excluding food, in the first quarter, according to MKM analysts, who used Census Bureau data to conclude it is  eating the retail world.  Less obvious is how Amazon's foregoing of profit over two decades to achieve its rarefied position might be illegal.  In particular, current law underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive,  as one Yale Law Journal assessment surmised in January. Other scholars also suggest a new approach may be needed for the modern marketplace. In addition, while the likes of Wal-Mart Stores may have been too slow to react to Amazon's threat, they also haven't given up fighting with gusto.  An antitrust case may be more plausible from the European Commission, which has led in challenging technology goliaths. The EU focuses on how monopolies harm other business not just consumers, who have yet to feel any pain from Amazon. The company, however, currently wields far more influence at home than abroad. Even an eventual government effort to restrain or break up $475 billion Amazon might not necessarily be value-destructive. For example, its cloud-computing operation, AWS, could be spun out fairly easily. The same probably goes for the gadget-making business behind Kindle and Echo. Either way, Bezos built Amazon for the long game, and is readying to play against trustbusters, too.

The Canadian crude producer is working with executive recruitment firm Korn/Ferry International to find a replacement for outgoing Chief Executive Brian Ferguson, who was an accountant by profession, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cenovus made a transformational acquisition in March, paying about C$16.8 billion ($13.2 billion) for ConocoPhillips' Canadian oil and gas assets, which doubled the company's production capacity. But the debt-fueled deal angered shareholders, and last month Ferguson, who had championed the transaction, decided to leave the company. Among the potential candidates Cenovus is likely to consider for the top job include Devon Canada President Rob Dutton, MEG Energy Corp CEO Bill McCaffrey, ARC Financial Corp Director Chris Seasons and former Shell Canada President Lorraine Mitchelmore, the sources added. Most of these executives have extensive experience operating in the oil sands but Cenovus is also expected to tap top talent from U.S. energy sector. Cenovus spokesman Brett Harris declined to comment on the search process beyond saying the company's global search would look at both internal and external candidates. Dutton, McCaffrey and Mitchelmore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Seasons declined to comment. Korn/Ferry did not offer an immediate comment. Energy industry analysts and company executives in Canada's oil capital Calgary said Cenovus' search for a new CEO may be hampered by a lack of available top quality candidates with experience in the niche oil sands sector. They added the company is more likely to plump for a candidate with a good track record at turning around struggling businesses, given the hammering Cenovus' share price and strategy have taken since the ConocoPhillips deal. Oil Sands Experience Cenovus could find it challenging if the company is looking for more than a caretaker, said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Group, which holds Cenovus shares.  There aren't that many people with vision ... I would prefer somebody with oil sands experience. I would also prefer an engineer,  she said.  I find engineers to be the best leaders because they're very process-oriented.  Ferguson's successor will take over a company that is on an uphill mission to win back shareholder confidence after the ConocoPhillips deal, which critics say marred Cenovus' pristine balance sheet and brought the crude producer into the unknown field of natural gas.  They probably are looking for a change of culture; the board will be looking for capital discipline,  said Matthew Miller, an analyst with CFRA.  For a CEO search, they're going to look externally, so that could take a bit longer.  Not naming a successor along with Ferguson's retirement announcement last month - leaving a leadership vacuum directly after the company's bold and risky acquisition - has not sat well with investors.  It's like buying a car and then having the keys taken away,  said Ryan Bushell, portfolio manager at Leon Frazer & Associates, which holds Cenovus shares.  I'm confident they will find someone good, but until they find that person, there's a lot of uncertainty.  Apart from steadying the ship, the new CEO will face the daunting task of delivering about C$5 billion in asset sales, required to cut down company's debt. The CEO will also need to boost employee confidence.  The sooner we can demonstrate some good value asset sales, get that balance sheet back in order, all of us will feel better,  Cenovus Chief Financial Officer Ivor Ruste said.  That's the nature of the discussions I've been having with individual investors.  $1 = 1.2723 Canadian dollars Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston, Solarina Ho in Toronto and Nia Williams in Calgary, Alberta; editing by Denny Thomas and Marguerita Choy","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cenovus-energy-ceo-idUSL1N1JW1HZ"},

The group of employees filed a C$35 million ($27.7 million)lawsuit on Thursday against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), saying they had been bullied for more than a decade.  CSIS is a workplace rife with discrimination, harassment, bullying and abuse of authority, in the which the tone set by management, namely to mock, abuse, humiliate and threaten employees, has permeated the workforce,  said the lawsuit. Last November, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police offered an apology to female officers and civilian members and settled claims of harassment, discrimination and sexual abuse made in two long-running court cases. The Canadian armed forces have experienced similar issues for years. In 2015, after an investigation uncovered widespread sexual misconduct and hostility towards minorities and women, the new chief of the defense staff said such behavior  must stop now.  CSIS director David Vigneault said the agency took allegations of inappropriate behavior very seriously.  CSIS does not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying under any circumstances,  he said in a statement on Friday, while declining to comment on the specific allegations. The office of Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said it stood by Vigneault's statement. CSIS, which employs 3,300 people, has suffered a number of problems since it was created in 1984. Last November, a court declared it had illegally kept data collected during investigations and threatened sanctions. Of the five employees who are suing the agency, three are Muslim, one is gay and one is black. The gay agent, who has a Muslim partner, stated his manager sent him an e-mail in 2015 that said  careful your Muslim in-laws don't behead you in your sleep for being homo.  The group said superiors regularly made derogatory comments, including that all Muslims were  blood thirsty murderers  or  terrorists.  University of Ottawa professor Wesley Wark, one of Canada's leading security experts, said such comments might have been expected from the first generation of CSIS employees who should by now have largely retired.  If such attitudes have persisted beyond the first generation that is truly a problem,  he said, adding that  CSIS is a pretty young organization these days in terms of demographics.  $1 = 1.2648 Canadian dollars Reporting by David Ljunggren; editing by Grant McCool","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-spies-idUSL1N1K50Y8"},

But shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co , Citigroup Inc and PNC Financial Services Group Inc were down in early trading. Investors had wanted to see even better results and hear a sunnier outlook from executives, analysts said. See Breakingviews column, Factbox: JPMorgan, for instance, reported loan growth, deposit growth and higher net interest income, which measures the difference between its cost of funding and the revenue it generates from those funds. Overall, its earnings rose 13 percent. However, management now expects net interest income to rise by $4 billion this year, down from a previous outlook of $4.5 billion, due to a combination of mortgage adjustments, weakness in markets-related income, and unexpected  downward pressure  on 10-year bonds. As JPMorgan's stock dropped 1.2 percent to $92.03, Citigroup bank stock analyst Keith Horowitz said investors were disappointed by the gloomier outlook, and had  a high bar priced into the stock.  The Federal Reserve has raised rates three times since the second quarter of last year, with the latest increase coming in June. Rising rates are generally good for banks, but because there have been uneven movements in short- and long-term rates, lenders have not seen income grow as quickly as investors expected. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC each reported year-over-year increases in their loan books. Wells and PNC said the spread between what they pay for deposits and charge for loans had grown, thanks to higher rates. They all beat analysts' average estimates for earnings per share. But Wells Fargo's revenue came in shy of expectations, and Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said he expects litigation costs to rise by up to $1.3 billion due to  a variety of matters,  including regulatory probes into its residential business. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski called the results  lackluster,  pointing to flat revenue and higher expenses despite the earnings beat. Shares of the San Francisco-based bank were down 1.8 percent at $54.62 in morning trading.

SAP said 25-year company veteran Claas Kuehnemann will step into the role of acting managing director for Africa, in charge of the company's business in 51 countries, and that Peter David, its finance chief for Europe, Middle East and Africa, will become acting chief financial officer, SAP Africa. Europe's largest software company also said it had hired Chicago-based international law firm Baker McKenzie to conduct an external investigation. SAP said on Wednesday it would run its own, internal probe using its own compliance organization. Baker McKenzie will work with various experts, including forensic firm FTI Consulting, the company said.    My interim role is to support our employees, customers and partners across all our business sectors while the due diligence process is conducted,  Kuehnemann said in a statement. Twenty-five years ago, he started his first job with SAP in South Africa.            South African media reported on Tuesday that SAP paid alleged kickbacks in the form of sales commissions to a firm linked to the politically connected Gupta family, who are known to be close friends of President Jacob Zuma. (reut.rs/2tnArLY)  AmaBhungane, an investigative reporting group, together with the Daily Maverick's Scorpio investigative team, reported that the alleged kickbacks were to clinch a deal with rail and logistics company Transnet and other state-owned firms worth 1 billion rand ($76.7 million). The AmaPhungane report was based on leaked emails and documents that they say show how the powerful Gupta family unduly influenced the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. SAP has not named the four senior executives it put on administrative leave while investigating the company's actions. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. The Guptas, Indian-born South Africans, and Zuma have denied wrongdoing. A Gupta family spokesman and Zuma's spokesman did not respond to calls and emails for comment on the SAP story. Transnet said in a statement that it has been an SAP customer since 2000 but that it was unaware of the parties reportedly involved in SAP sales to the company. It referred queries to SAP and its sales partners. Baker McKenzie advises a wide range of African companies, multinationals and financial institutions and employs 60 attorneys from its offices in Johannesburg.

Instead, conservative groups such as Heritage Action for America won the ears of Senate Republicans when it came to changing the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. The snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for Medicaid, and threatens to further frustrate the months-long effort to dismantle Obamacare. The latest version of the Senate bill, released on Thursday, left the Medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the U.S. House of Representatives. A nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly $800 billion in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years. While insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets, the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on Medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals. These groups, along with insurers, will be charged with enforcing the new law, so Republicans need their buy-in, health policy experts say.  A health policy means nothing if it can't be implemented and doesn't work,  said Andy Slavitt, former administrator under President Barack Obama of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw Obamacare. Conservative Sway The Republican bill ends Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and slashes traditional Medicaid funding, with cuts that deepen beginning in 2025. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation in May.  A lot of conservatives, Heritage Action included, desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the Medicaid portion wasn't watered down in the Senate,  said Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group.  It was something we made known to folks up in the Senate.  When Democrats and the White House enacted Obamacare seven years ago, support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through Congress. The administration actively courted the health industry, lobbyists and former Obama administration officials said, viewing their support as critical to winning votes. While health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with Republican lawmakers, they said their input on the bill's Medicaid changes was largely ignored. A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not immediately available for comment. In 2017, the top hospital, doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than $13 million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of 2017, according to a congressional lobbying database. One hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by Republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support. Individual Insurance Changes That has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market. Insurers, including some of the biggest providers of Obamacare individual plans, Anthem Inc and Molina Healthcare, have been asking for changes to specific policies. For instance, the Senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate, the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee. In its place, insurers received one of their biggest demands: a provision in the bill that provides incentives for Americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse. If that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes, lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to Medicaid, said Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consultant group to hospitals and insurers  The rubber meets the road on the Medicaid provision,  Carpenter said.

The Finn, on pole twice this season and fastest in both practice sessions at an overcast Silverstone, will collect an automatic five-place grid penalty after Saturday's qualifying. Hamilton, who is 20 points behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after nine races but chasing his fourth successive home victory, had a similar problem at the previous round in Austria which Bottas won from pole.  His gearbox was damaged in the same way as Lewis's but less severely, and we had hoped to coax it to the end of the cycle,  said a Mercedes spokesman.  However, we have not been able to do so. The cause of the damage is understood and now behind us, just as for Lewis's problem.  Bottas, who won the previous race in Austria, had earlier produced a best lap of one minute 28.496 seconds - significantly quicker than Hamilton's 2016 pole position time of 1:29.287.

It was already one of the very best circuits in the world, but with this car and the speed we are able to carry through the corners, it's just phenomenal,  said Hamilton.

The amount of U.S. government bonds held by banks declined by $39 billion in the past four weeks, after the U.S. Treasury Department on June 12 released suggested changes to banking rules that included clarifying the amount of capital buffers banks need to protect against negative events. That was a faster pace than previous declines in the banks' bond holdings. Their Treasury holdings have declined by $59 billion in total this year, compared with an increase of $69 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), TD said. “We believe the report’s proposed easing of…regulations may have incentivised banks to shed some level 1 high quality liquid assets,” which includes Treasuries, TD analysts said in the report. An alternative explanation for the shift out of Treasuries, and into mortgage-backed debt, may be that banks are seeking out higher yielding assets, TD said. TD noted that large domestic banks have accounted for 75 percent of selling in Treasuries this year, after being the largest buyers of the debt in 2014 when the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules was introduced. The LCR rules govern how many liquid assets financial companies need to hold to protect against future shocks. The White House also said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump planned to nominate former Treasury official Randal Quarles to be the Federal Reserve’s top banking regulator, adding to the view that banks will face fewer liquidity constraints. Quarles is viewed as an industry-friendly figure who will likely listen to banks that have complained about the impact of regulations implemented since the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

The vote was 344-81 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and authorizes up to $696 billion in spending for the Department of Defense. Underscoring bipartisan support for higher defense spending in Congress, 117 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in backing the measure. Only eight Republicans and 73 Democrats voted no. But the measure faces more hurdles before it can become law, notably because it would increase military spending beyond last year's $619 billion bill, defying  sequestration  caps on government spending set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing nondefense spending. His fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, but they will need support from Senate Democrats, who want to increase military spending, for Trump's plans to go into effect. The House NDAA also increases spending on missile defense by 25 percent, adds thousands more active-duty troops to the Army, provides five new ships for the Navy and provides a 2.4 percent salary increase for U.S. troops, their largest pay raise in eight years. And it creates a new Space Corps military service, pushed by lawmakers worried about China and Russia's activities in space, but opposed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Senate will vote on its version of the NDAA later this year, and the two versions must be reconciled before the measure can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. Trump has not threatened to veto the bill, but his administration listed several problems with it, including opposition to the proposed Space Corps and its failure to authorize new base realignments and closures. During debate on amendments to the NDAA this week, the House rejected a Republican-sponsored amendment that would have ended the Pentagon's policy of providing gender-reassignment surgery and other therapy for active-duty transgender service members. Lawmakers also defeated a proposed Republican amendment that would have prevented the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies.

Jio has repeatedly denied any breach took place and said that names, telephone numbers and email addresses of Jio users on a website called  Magicapk  appeared to be  unauthentic.  The website was later shut down. The company, part of conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, said on Monday that its subscriber data was safe and protected by the highest levels of security. However, Jio filed a complaint the same day alleging unlawful access to its systems, police have told Reuters. Jio did not respond to requests for comment. In contrast to companies in the European Union, which has stringent data protection standards, companies in India do not have to disclose data breaches to clients, information security professionals said.  It raises questions of security and accountability,  said Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), a research organization. People complained on Twitter about personal information of Jio users being available on the Magicapk site. Several local news outlets said their checks had led them to believe a leak had occurred.  A rule to report breaches exists, but it is unenforceable,  says Prakash.  It says you're not liable if you're following reasonable security practices. What 'reasonable' means is not defined.  Advocates of stronger laws in India say a data breach in countries with more stringent cyber laws, such as Britain or the United States, would prompt an inquiry by regulators. After reports of a data leak at Verizon earlier this week, for example, the U.S. telecoms firm quickly responded with an explanation of what had occurred, how it had happened and the extent of the problem.  India is at a nascent stage. For good norms in Asia, look to Singapore. It's been praised for not having cyber security issues by the UN,  Srinivas Kodali, an independent security researcher, said. Not a Priority  We don't have full-menu data protection laws,  said Apar Gupta, a Supreme Court lawyer working on data privacy issues.  We don't even have an institutional framework or expert body to implement the limited data protection regulations that do exist. It's so limited it's more accurate to say no law exists.  In May alone, there were two data security incidents in India. The records of 17 million customers of Zomato, a popular food-delivery app, were put on sale online. Zomato initially advised customers that their passwords were secure, but later advised users to change them. Separately, a CIS report said the Aadhaar numbers of as many as 135 million Indians had leaked from government databases and could be found online. (bit.ly/2tOseSV) The number, similar to a U.S. social security number, is unique to each Indian citizen and the Aadhaar database also stores a user's biometric data. The government is pushing for Aadhaar numbers to be used in everything from opening bank accounts to filing tax returns. For India, data privacy is not a priority, said Amry Junaideen, a risk advisor at audit firm Deloitte.  From an organizational perspective there's really no incentive other than being a good corporate citizen, to report a breach,  he said, noting that in the European Union and United States the regulatory framework is basically for the good of the consumer, but that this is not the case in India. India, home to the back offices of many large multinationals and outsourcing companies, has also unsuccessfully sought  data-secure  status from the European Union since 2012. The status is vital for information sharing between entities in the EU and India, because it means the EU is satisfied that data protection rules in a country meet its standards, so data of EU citizens can be sent to that jurisdiction. Raman Chima, policy director at Access Now, which advocates stronger digital rights, says weak data privacy laws are likely the main stumbling block to  data-secure  status. In 2010, a European Union study of data protection in India noted there were  no aspects of India's data protection which would unequivocally be regarded as 'adequate' by European Union standards as yet .

The amount of U.S. government bonds held by banks declined by $39 billion in the past four weeks, after the U.S. Treasury Department on June 12 released suggested changes to banking rules that included clarifying the amount of capital buffers banks need to protect against negative events. That was a faster pace than previous declines in the banks' bond holdings. Their Treasury holdings have declined by $59 billion in total this year, compared with an increase of $69 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), TD said. “We believe the report’s proposed easing of…regulations may have incentivised banks to shed some level 1 high quality liquid assets,” which includes Treasuries, TD analysts said in the report. An alternative explanation for the shift out of Treasuries, and into mortgage-backed debt, may be that banks are seeking out higher yielding assets, TD said. TD noted that large domestic banks have accounted for 75 percent of selling in Treasuries this year, after being the largest buyers of the debt in 2014 when the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules was introduced. The LCR rules govern how many liquid assets financial companies need to hold to protect against future shocks. The White House also said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump planned to nominate former Treasury official Randal Quarles to be the Federal Reserve’s top banking regulator, adding to the view that banks will face fewer liquidity constraints. Quarles is viewed as an industry-friendly figure who will likely listen to banks that have complained about the impact of regulations implemented since the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

Chile, with ample solar and wind resources, has become a poster child for renewable energy, with other countries looking to emulate the sector's development.  In August 2016, wind and solar producers won the right to supply around half of the power in a massive 12.3-terrwatt government auction to supply Chile's public grid for 20 years starting in 2021. But some of the winning renewable projects are struggling to obtain financing, raising speculation that the rock-bottom prices at last year's auction will not be repeated when producers come back to the table for a 2.2-terawatt contest this October. In an interview late on Thursday, Chilean Energy Minister Andres Rebolledo dismissed those concerns, and said that while prices may not fall significantly more, they will likely fall nonetheless.  We want the auction this year to reflect what has been happening, which is dropping prices ... and we expect this auction will consolidate this tendency,  he said.  Though it's true that lower prices makes financing more difficult, we don't have any information suggesting projects (that won previous auctions) are going to back out.  Chile's Minister of Energy Andres Rebolledo speaks during an interview with Reuters in Santiago, Chile  July 13, 2017. Picture taken July 13, 2017.Rodrigo GarridoExpanding the Grid Some new renewable projects have been hurt by Chile's underdeveloped transmission network, which has made it difficult in some cases to transport power to key markets, such as metropolitan Santiago. Slideshow (3 Images)Rebolledo said his government is working hard at preparing auctions for new transmission lines, and has received interest from many foreign companies.  A transmission line being constructed by Engie Energia Chile that will connect Chile's two major grid networks should be completed at the end of October or beginning of November, he said. He added that the government hopes to have a formal proposal to pitch to investors for a line connecting northern Chile with southern Peru by the end of the current government in March. The government will also likely thread a transmission line through the proposed Agua Negra tunnel, which is set to connect northern Argentina and Chile, he said. Still, energy cooperation with neighboring countries is largely limited to transmission for now. Rebolledo said state oil company ENAP has not considered exploring Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play, even as the Argentine government has been shopping around aggressively for investors.  ENAP is always looking for alternatives,  Rebolledo said,  but today we're not looking (at Vaca Muerta) specifically.

We urge authorities to respect the wishes of those who want to participate in this consultation and to guarantee people’s rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,  U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell said.  Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Venezuela in recent months calling for an end to Maduro's presidency, amid food shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation.  About 100 people have died and more than 1,500 have been injured in the anti-government unrest, which started in April.

Maduro is seeking to create a new super body called a Constituent Assembly, which would have powers to rewrite the constitution and dismiss the current opposition-controlled legislature, via a July 30 vote. His opponents have accused the Socialist leader of economic incompetence, while Maduro says pro-opposition businessmen and the United States are waging an  economic war  against him. Applications for asylum lodged by Venezuelan nationals have  soared , with 52,000 already this year against 27,000 in all of 2016, the U.N. refugee agency said. This represented  only a fraction  of those in need of safe harbor from violence and food shortages, it said. Venezuelans have sought asylum mainly in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Uruguay, and Mexico, UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said.  UNHCR reiterates its call to states to protect the rights of Venezuelans, particularly the right to seek asylum and to have access to fair and effective asylum procedures,  he said.  Venezuelans should not be sent back against their will.  Additional reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Andrew Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un-idUSKBN19Z0WQ"},

In the past decade, the number of doctors in nursing homes has dropped as the number of “skilled nursing facility specialists” has almost doubled, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Whether this trend is a good one isn't clear, the authors write. “Medicare was created more than 40 years ago around farmers who had problems with access to hernia care. Now our focus is on frail older women with chronic illnesses,” said lead author Dr. Joan Teno of the Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence at the University of Washington in Seattle.  “The patients often have functional impairments and need skilled help,” she told Reuters Health by phone. Patients also need coordinated care because for each new chronic illness, they often meet new doctors and specialists, which can lead to medical errors, lack of coordination and inefficiency, Teno explained.  “Our current system supports silos of care,” she said. But now healthcare policy experts are pushing for programs that coordinate care, provide consistent staffing for older patients and train nurses for geriatric care.  “What we’re seeing is an emerging set of programs targeting this older cohort. It’s important to start asking what’s best for the patient and family instead of the system.” Teno and colleagues used national Medicare Part B claims from 2007, 2010 and 2014 to identify trends in the numbers of physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants working in nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities.  The research team found that the proportion of physicians who had ever billed for care delivered in these facilities fell from 13.7 percent to 9.8 percent. Although the number of physicians classified as skilled nursing facility specialists rose from 1,496 to 2,225, that represented an increase from just 0.3 percent of all physicians to 0.5 percent.  Nurse practitioners and physician assistants classified as nursing facility specialists nearly doubled in number from 1,678 to 3,074 during the study period, but because more people entered these professions in general, that did not represent an increase in the proportions specializing in nursing home care. The proportion of total billing for care at skilled nursing facilities by non-doctor specialists rose from 22 percent to 31.5 percent, though this varied by state, the authors note. It reached nearly 50 percent in Delaware, Hawaii, Tennessee, Connecticut and Massachusetts. “There have been broad concerns at the national level about the quality of care at nursing homes,” said Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Health Agency, who wrote an editor’s note accompanying the study.  “One of the problems is that many nursing homes have no regular doctors, since it is not a requirement,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Most nursing home patients have a private doctor who signs the orders for the nursing care, but it is at an office where they may not be able to get to the nursing home on a regular basis.” In an ideal world, primary care doctors would follow their patients from the office to the hospital and to the nursing home, Katz writes in the journal.  “Even if we ramped up the training by several factors in medical schools, we couldn’t meet the need for geriatrics or palliative care today,” Teno said.  A limitation of the current study is that it doesn’t examine quality of care. Future research should investigate whether this growing trend meets the needs of nursing home patients, Katz said.  “My take-home for patients who are frail is to name a good proxy decision maker who can be your advocate, take careful notes, and make sure your health care is coordinated,” Teno said. “We’re keeping our fingers crossed that these new trends will lead to better quality of care.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tjxLz9 and bit.ly/2uWTC1o JAMA Internal Medicine, online June 26, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elderly-skilled-nursing-idUSKBN19Z20W"},

The plan could be a double-edged sword, though, now that Froome's team mate Mikel Landa has emerged as a potential Tour winner himself. Italian Fabio Aru, who kept his cool despite quickly finding himself without any team mates to help him, retained the leader's yellow jersey and finished in the group of favourites with Froome and third-placed Romain Bardet, all 1:48 seconds off Barguil's pace.  I was always composed,  said Aru, whose Astana lieutenant Jakob Fuglsang abandoned on Friday after sustaining wrist and elbow fractures in a crash two days ago. A day after Froome showed a rare sign of weakness on the final slope, Team Sky sent Spain's Landa in front when twice champion Alberto Contador attacked early on. Landa finished fourth behind Contador and Colombian Nairo Quintana, who is back in contention in eighth place overall, 2:07 behind Aru.  Beating Contador is something huge for me because he's always been my idol,  said Barguil. Related CoverageIce-cool Aru escapes unscathed but now exposed I had great legs today after a tough stage yesterday.  Aru leads Froome by six seconds overall with last year's runner-up Bardet in third place, 25 seconds behind the race leader and Colombian Rigoberto Uran in fourth, a further 10 seconds back. Landa is now fifth, 1:09 behind Aru, and Team Sky's management will need to make clear who the leader is after the Spaniard, whose contract expires at the end of the year, finished ahead of Froome on Thursday. The situation is reminiscent of 2012, when Bradley Wiggins won the Tour but came under pressure from Froome, who had to be restrained by Sky's team managers on a mountain stage when he appeared stronger than his leader.

Perfect Position Froome appeared to struggle in the last of three climbs in the punchy 101-km stage, but he still managed to attack his rivals in the final part of the Mur de Peguere, a punishing 9.3-km ascent at an average gradient of 7.9 percent. Slideshow (2 Images) Landa is a real threat now for the overall title in Paris, it's a great card for us to play, especially since Astana don't have the numbers to control the race,  said Froome.  I'm very happy. That's a perfect position for us especially going into these (tough) stages coming up, he could be a card for us to play again.  Sky never had to chase on a day of danger for them as Landa, who appears to be in top shape despite riding the Giro d'Italia in May-June, was in front with Contador. The leading duo were caught by Barguil and Quintana just before the summit of the Mur de Peguere and the Frenchman, who strengthened his grip on the polka dot jersey, proved the stronger sprinter. In the final descent, Uran, Bardet and also Ireland's Dan Martin and Froome all attacked as they tried to leave Aru behind, but the Sardinian maintained his composure and stayed close to his opponents for the yellow jersey.  At some point I stopped counting the attacks,  said Aru. Saturday's 14th stage, a 181-km ride from Blagnac to Rodez, suits the breakaway specialists. The overall contenders are expected to be in proper action again next Wednesday and Thursday in the last two mountain stages in the Alps.

While defending champion Chris Froome, second overall and six seconds behind, can rely on a strong Team Sky and third-placed Romain Bardet, 25 seconds off the pace, also has AG2R-La Mondiale team mates to count on, Aru seems exposed. He lost Astana team mate Dario Cataldo on Wednesday after the Italian fractured his wrist in a crash and on Friday, his main lieutenant, Dane Jakob Fuglsang, dropped out as he could not bear the pain caused by a couple of minor fractures.  Today I has to follow my main rivals in the general classification,  said Aru, referring to Froome, Bardet and fourth-placed Rigoberto Uran of Colombia.   I could not respond to every attack.  Had he had a stronger team, the Sardinian would probably not have let Froome's team mate Mikel Landa follow Alberto Contador early on and gain 1:46 - which puts the Spaniard only 1:09 adrift in the general classification and now makes him an additional threat.  He's a very strong rider. Today's situation was special because he was a bit far down in the GC,  said Aru of Landa, who started the day 2:55 off the pace.  How are Sky going to deal with this situation (of having two potential GC contenders)? I don't know, I'll deal with it later.  Aru believes Froome is still the main threat.  Froome remains my main rival but not the only one as the first four riders are all within 35 seconds,  he said.  Landa is here now, but today I could not follow everyone.  Sunday's 15th stage is a middle-mountain trek in the Massif Central, and it could prove a very difficult one to control for Astana, who are now down to seven men.

Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, spent 61.1 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated in the second quarter. While that was an improvement from the first quarter, Wells' efficiency ratio remains above a targeted range of 55 to 59 cents in costs per dollar of revenue.  Operating at this level is just not acceptable,  Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said on a conference call with analysts to discuss results, echoing comments on costs he made earlier this year. Wells Fargo has been taking measures to cut $4 billion from its annual expenses by 2019, including branch closures, curtailing travel and entertainment costs and even reducing the amount of postage it uses. However, it takes about a year for savings to trickle down to the bottom line once branches close, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The bank is also facing elevated costs for technology as well as legal and regulatory matters. Some of that relates to a sales scandal that erupted last year involving the bank's creation of as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission.  Wells had to spend an additional $110 million on third-party services related to the scandal last quarter. It also added to legal reserves for various matters, including regulatory investigations into its residential mortgage-backed securities business. Four analysts brought up expenses during the call, including Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew O'Connor, who pushed executives to explain why they do not offer an absolute target for costs the way some other big banks do.  I think it's something worth considering,  he said.  I think it would be helpful for your stock.  Wells shares were down 1.9 percent at $54.54 on Friday afternoon, with analysts citing high expenses and weak revenue as disappointments, even though the bank managed to beat Wall Street's profit expectations. Its net income rose 4.5 percent to $5.40 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the quarter ended June. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue remained flat at $22.17 billion and missed analysts' average estimate of $22.47 billion, with weakness in mortgages and wholesale banking.  Non-interest expenses rose 5 percent to $13.54 billion. It was not all gloom, however. Net interest income, a measure that reflects earnings relative to funding costs, rose 6.4 percent to $12.48 billion thanks to loan growth, higher interest rates and keeping a lid on deposit costs. Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski called the results  lackluster,  and questioned whether problems related to the sales scandal were hurting Wells' underlying businesses. The one bright spot, he said, was that customers' delinquency and default rates looked good.  While we've said many, many times over the years that credit improvement is a gift that will keep on giving, it is not a substitute for core revenue growth,  he wrote in a note to clients.

However, it takes about a year for savings to trickle down to the bottom line once branches close, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The bank is also facing elevated costs for technology as well as legal and regulatory matters. Some of that relates to a sales scandal that erupted last year involving the bank's creation of as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission.  Wells had to spend an additional $110 million on third-party services related to the scandal last quarter. It also added to legal reserves for various matters, including regulatory investigations into its residential mortgage-backed securities business. Four analysts brought up expenses during the call, including Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew O'Connor, who pushed executives to explain why they do not offer an absolute target for costs the way some other big banks do.  I think it's something worth considering,  he said.  I think it would be helpful for your stock.  Wells shares were down 1.9 percent at $54.54 on Friday afternoon, with analysts citing high expenses and weak revenue as disappointments, even though the bank managed to beat Wall Street's profit expectations. Its net income rose 4.5 percent to $5.40 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the quarter ended June. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue remained flat at $22.17 billion and missed analysts' average estimate of $22.47 billion, with weakness in mortgages and wholesale banking.  Non-interest expenses rose 5 percent to $13.54 billion. It was not all gloom, however. Net interest income, a measure that reflects earnings relative to funding costs, rose 6.4 percent to $12.48 billion thanks to loan growth, higher interest rates and keeping a lid on deposit costs. Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski called the results  lackluster,  and questioned whether problems related to the sales scandal were hurting Wells' underlying businesses. The one bright spot, he said, was that customers' delinquency and default rates looked good.  While we've said many, many times over the years that credit improvement is a gift that will keep on giving, it is not a substitute for core revenue growth,  he wrote in a note to clients.

The Communications Workers Union (CWU) has opposed Royal Mail's move to replace its defined benefit pension scheme, saying it would result in employees in the plan losing on average up to a third of their future pensions.  It does not meet our aspiration of a wage in retirement pension scheme, but rather still promotes the conventional wisdom of a cash-out arrangement at the point of retirement,  CWU Deputy General Secretary of Postal Terry Pullinger said.  It would still represent a significant shortfall in the pensions promise and it is not something that we are prepared to recommend to our members.” Royal Mail, one of the few big UK companies to still have a defined benefit plan, wants to replace it with a modified defined benefit or contribution pension scheme. It says this would cost about 400 million pounds ($519 mln) annually, compared with more than 1 billion pounds for the original scheme. Unite/CMA, which represent managers at Royal Mail, said it would seek its members' views in a ballot.  We have had many discussions with the company over the last few months and these have been difficult,  Unite officer Brian Scott said.  The Unite negotiating team consider that what is on offer is the best achievable in the circumstances.  A Royal Mail spokesman said the company would continue to work with its unions. Around 90,000 Royal Mail workers are in a defined benefit scheme, which pays out according to workers' final salary and length of service. Its closure to new members in 2008 resulted in about 40,000 workers joining a less generous defined contribution plan. Under the pension proposal on Friday, Royal Mail said postal employees would be offered a choice between a modified defined benefit or contribution pension scheme. British companies are facing increasing costs to fund pensions as people live longer and investment returns on bonds have fallen and are expected to remain low. Royal Mail's shares closed down 2.4 percent on Friday. The FTSE blue chip index ended 0.5 percent lower.

A rise in Microsoft and Apple lifted the S&P; and the Nasdaq, with the technology index rising 0.63 percent. However, tepid forecasts by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo capped gains. Shares of JPMorgan fell 1.5 percent, Citigroup was down 1 percent and Wells Fargo fell 1.9 percent, despite their quarterly profits beating analysts' expectations. The financial index fell 0.92 percent and was the only laggard among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will report results next week.  The bar for earnings is higher this time around, especially after the phenomenal growth we saw in the first quarter. So companies that miss expectations or guide down will be overly punished,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. Bank of America was the biggest drag on the S&P; and Goldman Sachs shaved off 16 points from the Dow. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier, after first quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. At 12:39 p.m. ET (1639 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 29.96 points, or 0.14 percent, at 21,583.05. It hit a record of 21596.13. The S&P; 500 was up 6.58 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,454.41, slightly easing from its all-time high of 2455.43. The Nasdaq Composite was up 25.56 points, or 0.41 percent, at 6,300.00. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with defensive sectors such as real estate, utilities and consumer staples leading the advancers. Data showed consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and subdued expectations of strong economic growth in the second quarter. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 47 percent after the release of data points, from 55 percent at Thursday's close. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,015 to 793. On the Nasdaq, 1,533 issues rose and 1,217 fell.

Harvie Wilkinson,Paul Niemeyer,USA,NORTHCAROLINA/PRAYER,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court said a North Carolina county violated the U.S. Constitution by letting elected officials open meetings with Christian prayer and asking audience members to participate. Friday's 10-5 decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia overturned a ruling by a three-judge panel of the same court that upheld the practice. The case is likely headed to the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court. Three residents had challenged the Rowan County Board of Commissioners' practice of opening meetings with prayers composed by members, and asking those in attendance to stand and pray together. Ninety-seven percent of 143 prayers in a recent 5-1/2-year period were Christian. Writing for Friday's majority, Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson said it was not  inherently unconstitutional  for lawmakers to deliver invocations, but Rowan County violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by focusing on a single, preferred faith.  The prayer practice served to identify the government with Christianity and risked conveying to citizens of minority faiths a message of exclusion,  wrote Wilkinson.  Indeed, if elected representatives invite their constituents to participate in prayers invoking a single faith for meeting upon meeting, year after year, it is difficult to imagine constitutional limits to sectarian prayer practice.  Wilkinson distinguished prior Supreme Court decisions letting Nebraska's legislature and the upstate New York town of Greece open sessions with prayer led by clergy, rather than elected officials. Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer dissented, saying the majority effectively sought  to outlaw most prayer given in governmental assemblies, even though such prayer has always been an important part of the fabric of our democracy and civic life.  In a separate dissent, Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee said the majority's approach lets lawmakers  offer only a generic prayer to a generic god.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) all-new Camry launching this month, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking, styling that pays homage to German sports sedans, and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures.  In a nod to driving enthusiasts, Honda will offer manual transmission as an option in two versions of the 2018 Accord, instead of only automatic shift in most midsize cars. Certain new Accords will be available with a new 10-speed auto shift, which Honda called a first for a front-wheel drive car. The new Accord's infotainment system can be upgraded over a Wi-Fi network, although functions such as braking or engine performance will not be upgradable over the air, Honda said. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. All are popular marques that will be promoted heavily. Jeff Conrad, senior vice president of the Automobile Division of American Honda Motor, introduces the 2018 Honda Accord at the Garden Theater in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 14, 2017.Rebecca CookHonda Senior Vice President Jeff Conrad said in Detroit on Friday he expected the Accord to sustain its current sales level, estimated at around 350,000 cars this year, despite the overall decline in sedan sales.  We think the addition of new product is going to make people stop and take a look  at the sedan segment, Conrad said, in reference to the models hitting the market this fall. Slideshow (2 Images)With General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.  They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,  said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc (GPI.N), the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) all-new Camry launching this month, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking, styling that pays homage to German sports sedans, and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures.  In a nod to driving enthusiasts, Honda will offer manual transmission as an option in two versions of the 2018 Accord, instead of only automatic shift in most midsize cars. Certain new Accords will be available with a new 10-speed auto shift, which Honda called a first for a front-wheel drive car. The new Accord's infotainment system can be upgraded over a Wi-Fi network, although functions such as braking or engine performance will not be upgradable over the air, Honda said. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. All are popular marques that will be promoted heavily. Jeff Conrad, senior vice president of the Automobile Division of American Honda Motor, introduces the 2018 Honda Accord at the Garden Theater in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 14, 2017.Rebecca CookHonda Senior Vice President Jeff Conrad said in Detroit on Friday he expected the Accord to sustain its current sales level, estimated at around 350,000 cars this year, despite the overall decline in sedan sales.  We think the addition of new product is going to make people stop and take a look  at the sedan segment, Conrad said, in reference to the models hitting the market this fall. Slideshow (2 Images)With General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.  They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,  said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc (GPI.N), the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J) Honda's unveiling of the new Accord coincided with its announcement of a recall of about 2.1 million vehicles for a defect linked to fires.

Still, the economy likely regained speed in the second quarter after a sluggish performance at the start of the year. Other data on Friday showed industrial production picked up in June, driven by a surge in oil and gas drilling.  Today's reports imply that the Fed will go very slowly normalizing rates, but it also means that businesses will have to really hustle to find ways to keep earnings growing strongly,  said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  The Labor Department said the unchanged reading in its Consumer Price Index came as the cost of gasoline and mobile phone services declined further. The CPI dropped 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory.

In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. The year-on-year CPI has been retreating since February, when it hit 2.7 percent, which was the biggest increase in five years. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in June, rising by the same margin for three straight months. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May.  The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure which is currently at 1.4 percent.

Food prices were unchanged after rising for five consecutive months. The cost of cellular phone services fell 0.8 percent, extending their decline amid price competition among service providers. There were also decreases in airline fares and prices for apparel, household furnishings, new motor vehicles, and used cars and trucks. But rental costs rose, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increasing 0.3 percent after advancing 0.2 percent in May.  Americans also paid more for hospital visits and prescription medication, as well as motor vehicle insurance. Low prices are hurting retailers. A second report from the Commerce Department showed retail sales fell 0.2 percent last month, weighed down by declines in receipts at service stations, clothing stores and supermarkets.  Sales at restaurants and bars, as well as at sporting goods and hobby stores fell. May's retail sales were revised to show a 0.1 percent dip instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent drop.

However, that could negatively impact third-quarter GDP.  The weak trajectory of consumer spending at the end of second quarter adds some challenges to the third-quarter consumption outlook, which reinforces our view that growth will step down modestly in the current quarter,  said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

At the same time, Kaplan reiterated his view that while the U.S. is near full employment, inflation has been muted, and he would like to see more progress before raising U.S. interest rates further.  I think in these periods where you're getting conflicting signals, the best course of action is to be patient,  Kaplan said.  I simply want to wait, I want to be patient and review more information to see how the economy is unfolding and see evidence that we're making progress toward our 2-percent inflation goal.  Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan speaks on his mobile after the True Economic Talks event in Mexico City, Mexico, July 14, 2017.Edgard GarridoKaplan supported the Fed's two interest-rates hikes so far this year. The central bank has signaled it expects to raise short-term rates again before the end of the year.  But inflation failed to strengthen in recent months, despite an unemployment rate that is down to 4.4 percent, weakening the case for tightening monetary policy further.  Noting that inflation data was  somewhat better  in April and May than March, Kaplan told reporters that  as we remove slack from the labor market you're going to likely see with a time lag more wage pressure, and some of that will likely translate into greater inflation pressure.   Separately, Kaplan noted that the peso's recent strengthening suggests investors are hopeful about prospects for a renewed trade agreement with the United States, and he reiterated his view that free and open trade are in the U.S. interest.  U.S President Donald Trump has vowed to redo trade agreements to get better deals for American workers.

Year-to-date supply in the U.S. municipal bond market totaled $195 billion, a 14 percent drop from the $226.4 billion sold last year. Barclays this week increased its 2017 supply forecast to a range of $380 billion to $400 billion from a range of $360 billion to $380 billion based on an expected uptick in refundings of outstanding bonds.  As long as rates remain stable, we expect refunding activity to increase and to be driven by the strong new-money issuance of long-dated bonds a decade ago,  Barclays said in its weekly municipal report. The coming week features several transportation-related deals. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority will sell $597.7 million of revenue bonds through Loop Capital Markets on Tuesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will price $353 million of bonds backed by federal highway funds for Georgia's State Road and Tollway Authority on Wednesday. Federal grants also back $230 million of Chicago Transit Authority revenue bonds scheduled to price on Tuesday through Morgan Stanley. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has $310 million of subordinate revenue bonds pricing on Tuesday through Morgan Stanley. About half of the bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax. In competitive bidding, New York state's Dormitory Authority will sell nearly $1.35 billion of state sales tax revenue bonds on Tuesday. The four-part deal, rated AAA by S&P;, includes $72.7 million of taxable bonds.

The bank's borrowing business increased across residential mortgages, business loans, credit cards, and even auto loans, an area where some lenders have been pulling back. However, on a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said net interest income for the full year would increase by $4 billion, rather than a $4.5 billion estimate given in April. This is due to mortgage adjustments and a change in the alignment of interest rates, Lake said.    Overall, JPMorgan's net income rose 13 percent to $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, from $6.2 billion, or $1.55 per share, in the year-ago quarter. (bit.ly/2tQ630n) Related CoverageJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon lashes out against Washington politicsThis was driven by JPMorgan's average core loan book, which grew 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Higher interest rates helped JPMorgan earn more money on these loans. Excluding a gain from a legal settlement, the bank earned $1.71 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stock was down 1.7 percent at $91.55 in morning trade. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the second time this year in June. Rising rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to increase how much they charge for loans faster than they boost how much they pay for deposits. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake called rate movements  a tale of two cities,  in which Wall Street businesses change quickly, but Main Street customers are not yet demanding more money for their deposits.   While there have been changes in the industry and CDs, there's been nothing in checking or savings,  said Lake. The bank expects the Fed to hike rates again in December, she said. As JPMorgan's loan book has expanded, it has also set aside more money for borrowers who do not repay their debts. In credit cards, where it has been growing aggressively, the bank built loan-loss reserves by $252 million as the charge-off rate ticked above 3 percent, an increase from both the prior and year-ago periods. JPMorgan executives have told investors to expect credit card loss rates to go up as the company makes more loans. On newer card accounts, the bank sees charge-off rates of about 4.5 percent, Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking, said at an investor conference in June. Trading revenue was a dark spot for JPMorgan as volatility hit multi-year lows. But executives across Wall Street have been warning investors to look for declines because the year-ago quarter benefited from a surge in trading around the UK's Brexit vote. JPMorgan's markets revenue dropped 14 percent to $4.8 billion, mostly due to fixed income trading. It was the first decline in five quarters. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) also reported results on Friday.

Buyout group Wendel (MWDP.PA), which had asked for final bids for Constantia by a July 12 deadline, views MCC's offer as superior to those of investors Cinven [CINV.UL] and Pamplona, they added.

The administration has not yet said whether it will appeal the decision, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The Justice Department has so far declined to comment. White House Homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters that the ruling appeared to be  fairly broad and something that would trouble me if it was as broad as reported.  Bossert, speaking aboard Air Force One as the president returned from a trip to Paris, focused his remarks on part of the ruling late on Thursday that would allow more refugees to enter the country, saying the ruling could be interpreted as  so expansive as to cover every refugee.  He said the admininstration will consult with its lawyers and  decide whether this is another productive or unproductive step in this saga as we try to secure our country.  In Thursday's ruling, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii said the administration cannot stop grandparents and other relatives of U.S. citizens from entering the country. The administration had narrowly interpreted a Supreme Court order last month saying the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. The state of Hawaii turned to Watson to seek clarity on the Supreme Court order that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days.

Three gunmen on a motorbike attacked police in al-Badrasheen area of Giza province, 30 km (20 miles) south of Cairo, killing two officers and three conscripts in the latest attack on Egyptian security forces battling an Islamist insurgency.  A police officer who was near the site of the attack exchanged fire with the assailants forcing them to flee,  the ministry statement said. Witnesses said attackers blasted the vehicle with automatic rifles then took equipment and threw petrol bombs inside the car before fleeing. Residents extinguished the fire. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Egyptian security forces have been battling the local affiliate of Islamic State in the northern Sinai area and attacks have spread to other parts of Egypt. Hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013 in the Sinai Peninsula. At least 23 soldiers were killed last week when suicide car bombs hit two checkpoints in the region in an attack claimed by Islamic State. It was one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years. Islamic State has also intensified attacks in other areas, often targeting Coptic Christians. About 100 Copts have been killed since December. In May gunmen assault on a group of Copts in a bus traveling to a monastery, killing 29 people and two bombings of churches killed more than 40 people a month earlier. Church sources on Thursday said Egyptian Coptic Orthodox Christians and the Egyptian Catholic church have been told by church leaders to cancel all events, camps and activities outside churches in July because of a security threat.

Asurion’s deal is the largest second-lien loan of the year, and the firm is the second US company in three months to raise a second-lien loan of more than US$1bn following a US$1.245bn second-lien loan in May that backed UK financial software provider Misys Plc’s merger with Canadian fintech company DH Corp. “The second-lien market is currently wide open,” a senior banker said. Junior debt issuance is soaring as investors seek yield in a market where senior loan spreads have tumbled this year due to a lack of new loans. The last time the market saw second-lien loans of more than US$1bn was in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Second-lien volume in the first half of 2017 of US$15.5bn was nearly three times higher than US$5.3bn in the first half of 2016, amid higher market volatility stemming from low oil prices and concern over the economy in China and the United States. Volume dipped slightly in the second quarter to US$7.1bn, down about 15% from US$8.4bn in the first quarter and US$8.6bn in the fourth quarter of 2016. The last time that second-lien volume exceeded US$7bn was the third quarter of 2014 when the number hit US$11.3bn. Second-lien loans pay higher interest margins than senior first-lien paper, as they are second in line for repayment in the event of a bankruptcy. Lenders, however, have been eager to get their hands on this riskier debt in 2017 due to low yields elsewhere, especially as Asurion has a strong borrowing track record. The asset class has at times been regarded as a niche product and most facilities were previously placed on a private basis with a single lender. However, larger deals and the hunt for yield has led to recent deals being syndicated more widely. “Up until last year, you saw most second-lien deals being privately placed, but that has changed because all investors are searching for yield,” the senior banker said. Low Pricing Asurion’s eight-year second-lien term loan refinances an existing facility that was due to mature in 2021 and paid 750bp. The new second-lien loan priced at only 600bp over Libor at the low end of guidance of 600bp-625bp, well inside 725bp that Misys was able to command earlier this year. The average yield on second-lien loans has remained below 10% this year so far at 9.85% in the first quarter and 9.9% in the second quarter, which is the first time that the yield has remained below 10% for consecutive quarters since 2014. So far this year, four issuers have priced second-lien loans under 650bp, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. In addition to Asurion, oil exploration and development firm Gavilan Resources LLC and sale and leaseback specialist Capital Automotive REIT also priced second-lien loans at 600bp in March and May, respectively, and plastic film manufacturer Transcendia Holdings Inc priced a second-lien loan at 400bp in May. Part of Asurion’s attraction lies in the large size of its second-lien loan, which ensures secondary market liquidity and allows investors to trade out if they decide to exit their positions. “A lot of second-lien loans are really small facilities,” an investor said. “Because of that you’re getting paid for some illiquidity. But with a deal of this size, you don’t need that illiquidity premium.” The company’s second-lien loan is also rated relatively highly for junior debt at B3/B-, which also boosted the deal’s appeal. “It’s relatively rare to find a second-lien loan at this rating,” the investor said. “This is a well-known issuer that has performed well.” As well as reducing interest payments on its second-lien loan, Asurion is streamlining its capital structure by paying down expensive US$550m payment-in-kind (PIK) holding company loans with proceeds from an incremental term loan. The PIK loan priced at 900bp over Libor in August 2016, and call protection will roll off at the end of August. The US$800m add-on term loan will be priced at 300bp over Libor.

When it still hadn't rained at the beginning of spring we realized it was already irreparable,  he said, adding that he had installed fans to try and cool his cows that were suffering in the heat. Drought in southern Europe threatens to reduce cereal production in Italy and parts of Spain to its lowest level in at least 20 years, and hit other regional crops including olives and almonds. Castile and Leon, the largest cereal growing region in Spain, has been particularly badly affected, with crop losses estimated at around 60 to 70 percent.  This year was not bad, it was catastrophic. I can't remember a year like this since 1992 when I was a little child,  said Joaquin Antonio Pino, a cereal farmer in Sinlabajos, Avila. Pino said many of his fields had not even been harvested, because crop revenues would not cover the wages of laborers who gathered them. While the EU is collectively a major wheat exporter, Spain and Italy both rely on imports from countries including France, Britain and Ukraine. Spanish soft wheat imports are expected to rise by more than 40 percent to 5.6 million tonnes in the 2017-2018 marketing year, according to Agroinfomarket. The drought has helped support EU wheat futures, which have risen around 6 percent since the beginning of June, although the prospect of a larger harvest in France this year should ensure adequate overall supplies in the trading bloc. Scorched Olives Spain and Italy are also among the world's top producers of olive oil. Production in both countries is expected to fall, but the decline is likely to be particularly steep in Italy, where drought is the latest headache for olive growers already plagued by insects and a bacterial disease in recent years. An olive tree is seen silhouetted in an olive plantation in Amelia, central Italy June 13, 2017.Tony GentileA 60 percent drop in Italian output is forecast by the International Olive Council.  We expected good production this year, but it hasn't turned out like that,  said Francesco Suatoni, who tends about 4,000 olive trees on the fringe of the ancient town of Amelia, in Umbria, central Italy. Holding up a branch with small, shriveled pods on it he added:  Each little ball could have been an olive, but it's scorched.  This year we expect to produce 50 percent less than last year. Let's hope not, but it will be very difficult to have a good crop.  Slideshow (17 Images)Other crops have been damaged, and Italy's agricultural association Coldiretti has estimated the drought could cost the nation's farmers more than 1 billion euros.  The drought is affecting, to a greater or lesser extent, all crops in Spain, even those that rely on greenhouses, because there's a limit on the amount of water available,  said Jose Ugarrio, analyst at the Spanish young farmers' association. The production of nuts such as almonds and pistachios has also fallen sharply.  We expect a 23 pct drop in almond production this year from last year,  Ugarrio said. Some see rising temperatures as a long-term trend, which threatens the viability of farming in the region.  In this situation ... you realize it's almost impossible to keep going. You think OK, this year I will try to manage, but if the harvest is like this next year you won't be able to cope any more,  said farmer Tocchi, who is also the local head of farmers' group Confagricoltura. Some scientists have said heat waves like this year's are becoming more frequent, and are linked to man-made climate change.  This is the first year we have watered the plants. There was never any need before,  said olive grower Suatoni.

Evelyn Beatriz Hernandez, 19, was handed a 30-year prison sentence earlier this month for aggravated murder by a female judge who ruled the teenager had induced an abortion, which is a crime in the Central American nation. Hernandez, a high school student from a poor rural community, said she was raped and did not realise she was pregnant until she went into labour in a bathroom last year. Abortion in El Salvador has been a crime since 1997, even in cases of rape, incest, when the woman's life is in danger or the foetus is deformed. Hernandez's lawyer, Dennis Munoz, said an appeal would be lodged by the end of July on grounds evidence was tampered with and that there was no proof that she tried to kill her baby.  This is absolute cruelty. It's a terrible ruling,  said Munoz, one of several lawyers working to free the teenager. Hernandez is among dozens of women believed to have been  wrongly jailed in El Salvador in the past two decades for defying a ban on abortion, according to local rights group, the Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion (CDFA). Women have been accused of inducing abortions when in fact they suffered miscarriages, stillbirths, or pregnancy complications, the CDFA says. During the trial, three doctors from El Salvador's Institute of Legal Medicine told the court that Hernandez's baby had died of 'natural causes' -  evidence the judge ignored, Munoz said.  It's a witch hunt against women, especially poor women,  said Munoz, who has secured the early release of at least eight women charged or jailed for abortion crimes in the past decade. If the judges deny the appeal, Munoz said lawyers would bring the case before El Salvador's Supreme Court. If that fails, it could be taken before the Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the main rights body for the Americas, Munoz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I believe the conditions are there so that we can file a lawsuit at the international level before the commission,  said Munoz, who works for the CDFA. The U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Rights, together with the CDFA, filed a case in 2015 before the commission on behalf of nine women who had pregnancy complications and who are in prison after being convicted of defying the abortion ban. The commission has yet to rule on the case. But one of the women involved, Maria Teresa Rivera, was released from jail last year after a Salvadoran judge quashed her murder conviction, saying there was not evidence to prove the charges against her.    Along with Hernandez, there are at least another 20 women convicted of abortion crimes, currently serving prison sentences of up to 40 years, rights groups say.   Evelyn's case is yet another example of how the hostility towards abortion in El Salvador leads to innocent women losing their freedom,  said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the Center for Reproductive Rights.  How many more women have to go to jail before the  government realizes abortion law reform is crucial? We'll keep fighting until all these women are set free.  In recent years, the United Nations has urged El Salvador to lift its abortion ban, along with six other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. Last year, El Salvador's ruling leftist FMLN party introduced a bill to allow abortion in cases of rape or risky pregnancy, but no date has been set for a vote on the bill.

The U.N. and rights activists have accused the Sri Lankan military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, in the last weeks of the civil war with Tamil separatists that ended in 2009 and have demanded reforms and redress.  There is little evidence that perpetrators of war crimes committed by members of the Sri Lankan armed forces are being brought to justice,  Ben Emmerson, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism, told reporters after concluding a four-day visit to Sri Lanka. With progress having ground  to a virtual halt , Emmerson said Sri Lanka could face a range of measures, including a referral to the U.N. Security Council, if it fails to meet commitments it made under a 2015 U.N. resolution. The United Nations gave Colombo a two-year extension in March to meet the commitments, which include establishing a judicial process involving foreign judges and prosecutors to investigate the alleged war crimes. Colombo has previously promised an impartial investigation into human rights violations but President Maithripala Sirisena has since said he would not allow foreign judges take part in the investigation.

Emmerson also said he had come across prisoners who had been detained without trial for more than 12-years. He criticized what he said was the  systemic use of torture  in Sri Lanka, saying it was  among the worst in the world , and blamed the situation mainly on Colombo's failure to repeal its Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) despite promises to do so. The Sri Lankan government said it needed more time to tackle the abuses cited by Emmerson.  He can't dictate like this, we can't make laws immediately. They have to go through parliament ... There is a process. He must understand what democracy is,  Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa told Reuters.

The move comes amid heightened concerns over the growing presence and influence of Islamic State in Southeast Asia as the jihadist group loses territory in Syria and Iraq. Indonesia itself has seen a resurgence in home-grown militancy, inspired in large part by Islamic State; a twin suicide bombing at a Jakarta bus station in May killed three police officers and injured several others. It has stepped up anti-terrorism cooperation with Malaysia and the Philippines.   This has to be done because there are many channels on this service that are full of radical and terrorist propaganda, hatred, ways to make bombs, how to carry out attacks, disturbing images, which are all in conflict with Indonesian law,  the communications ministry said in a statement on its website. Telegram is a messaging platform known to be popular among Islamic State sympathizers, who use chatrooms with hundreds of members as well as private conversations. The communications ministry added that both the mobile application and the desktop version of Telegram would be blocked throughout Indonesia. It did not say if it would take similar action against other messaging platforms. Telegram was not immediately available for comment. Many messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Telegram offer end-to-end encryption from sender to recipient, which means not even the companies providing the platform can see the messages. Security officials in several countries have complained that the apps provide a safe space for militants to communicate with each other. Several governments, including those of Australia and Britain, have urged technology companies to do more to help security agencies thwart security threats.

In Konya, German airmen contribute to a NATO air surveillance mission.

We are in intensive talks with all parties, including NATO, to set a new date as soon as possible.  Germany's armed forces are under parliamentary control, for reasons rooted in its modern history, and Berlin says the lawmakers must have access to its soldiers. Germany relocated its troops from Incirlik after repeated attempts to gain lawmaker access. In May Turkey authorized a visit to Konya, but then revoked its permission due to increased bilateral tensions, said Rainer Arnold, defense spokesperson for the Social Democrats (SPD), the junior party in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition. The two countries are at odds over a host of issues, including Berlin's refusal to extradite asylum seekers Ankara accuses of involvement in last year's failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while Berlin is demanding the release of an imprisoned Turkish-German journalist. Merkel's criticisms of Ankara have been muted, partly because she needs its cooperation in upholding a deal whereby Turkey prevents migrants and refugees, many fleeing Syria's civil war, from leaving its shores for the European Union. With a German parliamentary election due in September, relations with Turkey are an especially sensitive issue, exposing her to criticism from other parties that hope to unseat her.

Writing on Twitter from Paris, where he was a guest of honor in Bastille Day celebrations, Trump said Vice President Mike Pence was working to advance the healthcare plan  and getting our wonderful Republican Senators to do what is right for the people.   After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,  Trump wrote. Senate Republican leaders released a revised plan on Thursday to dismantle the Obamacare law, but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the Republican party, indicating a treacherous path for the bill. The bill played to the party's disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy. But the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate. He is under pressure from Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans' seven-year mission to gut the signature legislation of Democratic former President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act.  The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare. They deserve better care. And the time to deliver that to them is next week,  McConnell said. In addition to the criticism from some senators, a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas. With Democrats united against it, McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage. But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate. Several senators, including Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman and John McCain, had concerns about the legislation and particularly its Medicaid cuts. And two other Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan. McConnell, a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-idUSL1N1K5138"},

Her Brexit minister, veteran anti-EU campaigner David Davis, is expected to meet Barnier, a French former cabinet minister, at the European Commission's Berlaymont headquarters on Monday morning. They and their teams will then spend up to four days in a mixture of smaller working groups and plenary sessions, with the priority being to identify areas of accord and discord on a set of issues agreed on during an initial day of talks on June 19. These issues, notably the rights of expatriate citizens, how much Britain may owe to the EU budget and how to manage the new EU-UK border, especially with Ireland, are ones both sides want to settle in a withdrawal treaty. Barnier says this must be ready by about October next year if it is to be ratified on both sides of the Channel before Britain leaves in March 2019.  The clock is ticking,  he said on Wednesday, displaying a degree of impatience with British ministers who continue to dismiss EU demands that they first must agree in principle that London will owe the Union a hefty amount -- probably in the tens of billions of euros -- to cover its existing commitments.  The first serious test of the negotiations will be them agreeing to pay the bill,  a senior EU official said, describing the coming week as a vital moment to establish rapport among the senior civil servants who will handle what is arguably the most convoluted and far-reaching diplomatic deal of modern times. Progress Required Without  significant progress  on all three priority areas of the divorce package, Barnier warns, EU leaders will not let Davis open talks on a free trade relationship, which May and much of British business want to have ready by the time Britain leaves. For now, the EU says May's offer to guarantee the rights of 3 million Europeans in Britain falls short. It is also unhappy at Britain's refusal to accept EU judges as the ultimate arbiters of disputes -- an issue that could get an early airing as London seeks a quick fix to prevent its withdrawal from the Euratom pact disrupting its nuclear industry and medical imaging. Committed to keep all 27 other EU governments informed and on board with a process in which all have differing interests, the Commission negotiators are insisting on publishing negotiating documents and holding regular news conferences -- a cause of some discomfort in London. EU officials expect Barnier and Davis to brief reporters again on Thursday, partly to nail down the week's achievements.  It's important to describe our progress,  the senior EU official said, likening the Brexit process to trade negotiations that the Commission more typically runs with other governments.  If you don't cash the week's progress in public, by having both sides talk to the media, you never know if your partner will go back later on what they promised to agree.  EU leaders hold a regular quarterly summit in mid-October and could use that moment to instruct Barnier to prepare trade negotiations; but that will require good progress next week and in three further week-long rounds of talks. On that timetable, Barnier reckons, a broad political deal on the outlines of a new, open trading relationship could be in place by late next year, allowing for a transitional phase of up to a few years after Brexit to negotiate all the details.

The parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard have been fighting a legal battle to send their son to the United States for the experimental therapy, but Britain's courts have refused permission on the grounds it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of it helping. Charlie suffers from a form of mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition causing progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, and London's world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) says he has no quality of life so his life support should be turned off. The case has garnered worldwide attention after interventions by U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis, who both voiced support for Charlie on Twitter. GOSH asked London's High Court for a new hearing last week after his parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, said they had new evidence the U.S treatment would improve Charlie's condition. Appearing via video link from New York, the U.S. doctor offering the treatment, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said new data and analysis of his research work since the case was first heard in April had given a better perspective on the chances of the treatment's success. He told the court there was between 11 and 56 percent chance the nucleoside therapy would improve the baby's muscular strength and that there was a  small but significant  chance it would also improve brain functions. One of the key arguments in the case has been whether any of the brain damage Charlie has suffered is reversible and whether he is suffering. Connie Yates and Chris Gard, pray before handing in a petition to Great Ormond Street Hospital, in central London, Britain July 9, 2017.Peter NichollsHis parents stormed angrily out of the hearing shortly before the lunch break after the judge said they had agreed that Charlie's life without any medical improvement was not worth sustaining.  We have said he's not suffering, he's not in pain,  Yates said. The U.S. expert said the reports of brain scans suggested that Charlie had brain disorder rather than structural damage. He said the better muscular strength would allow a better assessment of his brain condition. Slideshow (7 Images) In my view my keeping Charlie on artificial ventilation will not cause significant harm because he does not seem to be in pain,  he said. The doctor, who has never seen Charlie and has had limited access to his medical records, said he was prepared to come to Britain for a meeting with other medical experts to try to give a definitive verdict on his condition. Judge Nicholas Francis, whose original ruling has also been upheld by the European Court of Human Rights, said the meeting needed to be held in the next couple of days.   If there is important new evidence that suggests my decision should be changed then I will change it,  he said. A hearing to confirm the details will take place on Friday. The case has provoked heated debate and the judge revealed that some staff from GOSH including doctors and lawyers had been subjected to  the most vile abuse and threats.   It has been and remains the unanimous view of all of those caring for Charlie at Great Ormond Street that withdrawal of ventilation and palliative care are all that the hospital can offer him consistent with his welfare,  the hospital said in a position statement to the court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-baby-idUSKBN19Y1KM"},

A picture of the sign was posted on the Vatican Insider website and its presence on the pope's door confirmed to Reuters by its editor-in-chief Andrea Tornielli, an author who is close to Francis and has interviewed him several times.

Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos.   The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday.   This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,  said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds.  I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO.   Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up.  Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added.   The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles.  Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.   Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook.   We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,  noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares. Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170].   In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York. Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said.   They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,  he said.

I would think he's got (Mercedes team boss) Toto (Wolff) in his ear trying to say extend for a year and then he's probably got Ferrari saying it's three years or nothing,  added the Briton.  I guess he wants to see through what he started at Ferrari. He went there for a reason, to build something and very much emulate what Michael (Schumacher) had done. Stepping out now, with the progress they have, would be a job half done.   Mercedes have triple world champion Lewis Hamilton under contract for next year while Finland's Valtteri Bottas joined in January with no guarantee beyond 2017. Vettel, who won his titles with Red Bull, is leading Hamilton in the championship by 20 points after nine of 20 races and Ferrari are keen to renew a contract that expires this year. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who played a key role in luring Hamilton to Mercedes from McLaren, dismissed the chances of the German joining when speculation mounted earlier in the year. Vettel told Horner he was leaving Red Bull for Ferrari in 2014 in a move that stunned the sport. Formula One - Russian Grand Prix - Sochi, Russia - 1/5/16. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel of Germany speaks to Red Bull Formula One team principal Christian Horner during the race.Srdjan Suki/PoolThe German had hoped to emulate Schumacher, the seven-times world champion who dominated with Ferrari in a golden era for the Italian team. Success has been elusive, however, with Ferrari failing to win a race in 2016 and Vettel making more headlines for angry radio outbursts. This season he has won three races but was summoned to the governing FIA after driving into Hamilton in Azerbaijan in an incident of road rage behind the safety car. Horner said his former driver shared some of Schumacher's characteristics in that respect.  He's got this huge desire within him, the records mean a lot to him,  said the Red Bull boss.   Michael Schumacher was very much his idol and I think what we you see sometimes is that killer instinct of 'I want to win' - sometimes at all costs.  Horner suggested Vettel's recent bad-boy behavior was also a reflection of his team.  (Ferrari chairman Sergio) Marchionne has his own style of management. He's a full-on character, he's quite outspoken. The demeanor of the team comes from the top,  he said.

The U.N. and rights activists have accused the Sri Lankan military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, in the last weeks of the civil war with Tamil separatists that ended in 2009 and have demanded reforms and redress.  There is little evidence that perpetrators of war crimes committed by members of the Sri Lankan armed forces are being brought to justice,  Ben Emmerson, the U.N.

Security Council, if it fails to meet commitments it made under a 2015 U.N. resolution. The United Nations gave Colombo a two-year extension in March to meet the commitments, which include establishing a judicial process involving foreign judges and prosecutors to investigate the alleged war crimes. Colombo has previously promised an impartial investigation into human rights violations but President Maithripala Sirisena has since said he would not allow foreign judges take part in the investigation.

The move on indexes on Friday was more muted as investors digested disappointing earnings reports from major U.S. banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup, which sent banking stocks lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched up 0.1 percent while euro zone bluechips fell 0.2 percent.  In Europe, we're still not dealing with any higher interest rates, which should be benefiting the U.S. (banks) slightly in terms of net interest margin,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  That said we've still got the supportive QE helping, but yields are still low, which is not great for the banks.  Flows data showed investors rushed back into equities this week as the Fed's tone rekindled their enthusiasm for riskier assets. Firmer metals prices underpinned gains on mining stocks on Friday. Miners were led to a three-month high by steel firms Outokumpu, ArcelorMittal, and Tenaris which rose after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he was considering quotas and tariffs on Chinese steel dumping. Analysts at Barclays said they remained positive on the European mining sector, which has gained just 4 percent so far this year after rallying more than 60 percent in 2016.  Chinese rates are falling, demand indicators across the economy appear healthy, industry capex discipline is holding, M&A; is generally off the agenda, and resulting strong cashflows are being utilised for balance sheet reconstruction and distributions to shareholders,  Barclays analysts said in a note. While a rise in bond yields has hit rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities, banking stocks have benefited. On Friday, however, the sector was under pressure as earnings from major U.S. banks disappointed, and CPI data indicated inflation in the U.S. was slowing, potentially putting a dampener on the Fed's monetary policy tightening plans. Banks gain when interest rates rise, widening their margins. Euro zone banks fell 0.7 percent, leaving them unchanged on the week after a strong performance last week. Swedish lender SEB jumped 1.3 percent after its second-quarter profit topped forecasts. Other Nordic stocks were also in focus as Norwegian insurer Gjensidige slumped 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its second quarter results came in below forecasts. It was joined by Swedish construction group Skanksa , which dropped nearly 5 percent after it warned that its second-quarter profit would be hit by project writedowns in the U.S. and Britain. European earnings get underway in earnest later this month. Overall, analysts are calling for about 9 percent year-on-year earnings growth for top European firms, compared to about 8 percent for the U.S., according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

For a city like Hong Kong, which is very cosmopolitan and very free, it's difficult. The right approach is to supply.  She also said that housing is  not just a commercial product . - When asked by Martin Howell how she would measure her success in five years time, Lam said  I want people to be happy and to enjoy Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a wonderful city . Watch the full Reuters Newsmaker here You can follow more of the discussion on Twitter by searching #ReutersLive.

Antofagasta is currently in government-mediated negotiations with workers at the nearby Zaldivar copper mine.

The startling photographs, taken in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area, are the first evidence of such inter-species bonding between predators that are normally mortal enemies.  There is no other recorded case where a big cat in the wild has suckled a cub belonging to another species,  Luke Hunter, president of Panthera, a wild cat conservation group, told Reuters in a telephone interview. The lioness, known locally as  Nosikitok , is well known to scientists as she is radio-collared and monitored by KopeLion, a Tanzanian conservation NGO supported by Panthera. A leopard cub adopted by a lioness is seen  in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania, in this handout picture taken July 11, 2017. Joop Van Der Linde/Panthera/Handout via REUTERSThe photos were taken on Tuesday and Hunter said that, as of Thursday, Nosikitok had returned to her pride some distance from where she was nursing the leopard cub,  so we are not sure what is going on now .  It's possible the mother leopard retrieved the cub from what was a temporary lioness day care, but we just don't know,  he said.  Slideshow (3 Images)Scientists are at a loss to explain the incident; the cub's typical spots make abundantly clear it is no lion. In captivity, predators may bond with other meat-eating species, but in the wild, the gloves are always off as they compete for prey. Hunter said Nosikitok has her own litter of lion cubs about the same age as the leopard cub, estimated to be three weeks old, and this could be a reason.  She is physiologically primed to take care of baby cats, and the little leopard fits the bill — it is almost exactly the age of her own cubs and physically very similar to them.

But the intent gaze of her kohl-rimmed eyes, as she stands with arms folded on the edge of the dancefloor in an all-black outfit, watching couples bob and twirl to the music, gives away her real occupation.  She is Social's famous female bouncer. Mehrunnisha has been a bouncer for nearly a decade, and for the last three years, has done 10-hour night shifts at Social, which functions as a restaurant and co-working space seating 220 people by day, but morphs into a packed club at night.   Now Mehrunnisha is expert in breaking up bar fights, frisking female customers, and uncovering illegal drugs.   We decided to employ women to make sure that women customers too felt safe, and we found a great match in Mehrunnisha,  said Social's owner Riyaaz Amlani, who says she helped has defuse innumerable alcohol-fuelled quarrels.  She was fierce and determined, and the rest is history.  The 30-year-old's career highlights include being part of the security detail for Bollywood actresses such as Priyanka Chopra, the star of the U.S. television drama series  Quantico , Preity Zinta and Vidya Balan. Mehrunnisha is no stranger to smashing stereotypes. Growing up in a large Muslim family in the northern farming town of Saharanpur, 200 km (124 miles) from Delhi, she dreamed of joining the army or becoming a police officer, but her deeply conservative father opposed the idea. Bouncer Mehrunnisha Shokat Ali offers her evening prayer during holy month of Ramadan at her house in New Delhi, India, May 31, 2017.Adnan AbidiOnly her mother's insistence allowed her to further her education beyond primary school.   But when her father's stock market losses forced the family to move to the capital, Mehrunnisha, still in college, became the breadwinner for a household consisting of parents, two sisters, and her elder sister's three children, besides herself.  Several times my brother has asked me, what sort of a job is this?  Mehrunnisha said during a shopping expedition to prepare for Eid al-Fitr, which ends the holy month of Ramadan, recounting how difficult it had been to get her family to accept her night shifts.      But this does not affect me, because my mother and father have faith and confidence in me, and I know I am not doing anything wrong.  Slideshow (18 Images)Her younger sister, Tarannum, 27, also works as a bouncer at a bar just a 5-minute walk away from her own workplace. Together, they earn 30,000 rupees ($465) a month.  They take immense pride in their vocation, spending up to an hour at the gym each day to build their strength, and even working through holidays.   I am very proud of what I do, it's not an easy job,  Mehrunnisha said.  Taking care of people, especially women in a club, is a very big responsibility.  Customers seem to agree.  If I come here and I see a female bouncer, I feel a lot safer,  said one regular patron at Social, Nikita Lamba.  Mehrunnisha is pretty kick-ass. She is good at what she does .

The FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent, underperforming mid-caps and taking weekly gains to a narrow 0.2 percent. The more defensives-heavy index suffers when expectations of monetary policy tightening dampen. European stocks on the other hand enjoyed their best week in more than two months. Defensive housebuilding stocks such as Barratt Development and Persimmon  were among the top blue-chip fallers. Drugmaker AstraZeneca continued Thursday's slide, down 1.6 percent due to uncertainty around reports that CEO Pascal Soriot was preparing to leave the company. As spokespeople declined to comment on the report, the combined two-day share drop wiped more than 3 billion pounds off Astra's market value. Firmer metals prices underpinned gains on mining stocks, with Anglo American and Fresnillo top of the blue-chips. Anglo American, with considerable South Africa exposure, also benefited from the country suspending implementation of a new mining law which analysts had said could negatively impact firms. Royal Mail shares fell 2.4 percent after it replaced its pension plan, giving employees a choice between defined benefit or contribution pension scheme after opposition from trade unions. Among mid-caps, Carillion saw a small relief bounce from heavy losses this week, rising 1.3 percent after the crisis-hit construction and support services contractor hired HSBC as joint financial adviser and corporate broker, amid speculation it is preparing a rights issue. Despite the slight relief, the firm was left with 70 percent less market value than at the start of the week.  A lot of our clients cut their positions on the first day and we haven't seen further flows in the stock after that,  said a trader. Property firm Derwent London was among top European gainers, up 3.4 percent after Exane BNP Paribas raised the stock to an  outperform  rating, citing the firm's  defensive  rents and strong pipeline. It expressed optimism about the prospects for a sector seen as particularly vulnerable to Brexit.  Values in the London office market have barely moved post-Brexit thanks to abundant investment market liquidity (particularly from Asia) and resilient take-up,  its analysts said in a note, adding that firms have recycled capital, deleveraged and payed special dividends. Exane analysts forecast an average 8 percent decline in London office rents by 2019 -  a gradual weakening rather than a sharp correction , as they put it. Emerging markets-focused asset manager Ashmore fell after reporting a 5 percent rise in its fourth-quarter assets, boosted by new client cash. Despite the results being in line with forecasts, the shares slid 2.2 percent to the bottom of the mid-caps.  This was Ashmore's second consecutive quarter of inflows, marking the first time since 2013,  UBS analysts said in a note.  That said, due to the increase in the GBP/USD rate during the quarter, the growth of assets under management measured in sterling was a more moderate 1.1 percent quarter-on-quarter.

Earl Simmons, 46, whose stage name is DMX, was arrested on Thursday after federal prosecutors said he engaged in a multiyear scheme to conceal millions of dollars of income from hit songs including  X Gon' Give it to Ya  and  Where the Hood At.  He was charged with tax evasion, evasion of assessment of income tax liability, corruptly endeavoring to obstruct administration of IRS laws and the failure to file a U.S. individual income tax return, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Simmons faces up to five years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. His lawyer, Murray Richman, told Reuters on Thursday that the artist's focus was making music and he has been  charged over the failure of others to do what he hired them to do.  Prosecutors maintain Simmons actively evaded his tax obligations by sticking to a cash-only lifestyle and depositing royalty checks into the bank accounts of his managers, who then gave him cash or used the money to pay his personal expenses. The rap star's prior arrest record includes charges of animal cruelty, reckless driving, drug possession, weapons charges and probation violations. Aside from recording hit songs, often with lyrics rooted in rage and violence, Simmons has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama  Belly,  the 2000 action movie  Romeo Must Die  and the 2003 heist film  Cradle 2 The Grave.

The economy expanded 1.96 percent year-on-year in the first five months of 2017 and 3 percent in the 12 months through May, Inei said. A Reuters poll had forecast a 2.8 percent reading for May. The finance ministry said the robust expansion in May marked a turning point for the economy following a sharp slowdown earlier this year in the wake of severe flooding and a graft scandal that stalled public work projects.  This economic acceleration will likely hold in coming months, driven by greater public investments and spending on maintaining and rehabilitating public infrastructure,  the ministry said in a statement. Construction fell 3.91 percent year-on-year in May but fishing rocketed 280 percent on anchovy catches, Inei said. Manufacturing rose 11.31 percent, thanks to a pick-up in activity at the factories that turn anchovy into fishmeal for export. Mining, which drove last year's 3.9 percent economic expansion with surging copper output from new mines, grew just 1.68 percent. Peru's economy grew 0.79 percent at a seasonally adjusted rate, Inei said.

As part of Italy's rescue of Banca Marche, Banca Etruria, CariFerrara and CariChieti in November 2015, gross bad debts from the four banks worth 10.3 billion euros were spun off into a separate vehicle, dubbed REV-Gestione Crediti. REV, which is being advised by KPMG, has shortlisted the three U.S. funds after receiving more than two dozen expressions of interest in the portfolio, which is mainly backed by property assets, the sources said.  The three funds will have to submit binding proposals in October, the sources said, adding that a fourth bidder, Starwood Capital Group, may still be allowed to join the race. All interested parties either declined to comment or were not immediately available for a comment. Italian banks are under regulatory pressure to shed soured debts that rose to a total of 349 billion euros during a harsh recession and international investors have increasingly set their sights on a market that is still underdeveloped. Consultancy PWC said bad loan sales in Italy could top 60 billion euros this year, driven by balance-sheet clean-ups at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI). The two lenders alone are set to offload 44 billion euros in bad debts. UniCredit has been able to tap markets to offset the hit from the disposal but Monte dei Paschi failed to raise capital from investors and is being bailed out by the state. Mid-sized regional lender Creval (PCVI.MI) said late on Thursday it had sealed a 1.4 billion euro bad loan sale, sending its shares higher.

The OBG are guaranteed by MPS Covered Bond S.r.l.. The OBG was first placed on RWE when BMPS's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B-' was placed on the same watch (see  Fitch Places Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena on Rating Watch Evolving  dated 4 August 2016 available at www.fitchratings.com). Fitch will resolve the RWE on the covered bonds upon the resolution of the watch on the bank's IDR, which may take longer than the typical six months. KEY RATING DRIVERS The RWE on BMPS's OBG rating is driven by the RWE on BMPS's IDR of 'B-'. The 'BBB-' rating reflects  an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches, the maximum recovery uplift allowed by Fitch criteria and the 83% contractual asset percentage (AP) that Fitch takes into account in its analysis. This level of AP provides more protection than the unchanged breakeven AP for the current 'BBB' rating of 95.0%. The greatest contributor to the breakeven AP remains a credit loss of 3.4% followed by a cash flow valuation of 2.1%. The asset disposal loss component remains close to zero (-0.9%); for conditional pass-through (CPT) programmes such as BMPS's, the asset disposal loss represents the level of OC needed to ensure timely payment of interest on the covered bonds without triggering a forced sale of the assets as well as the positive impact of negative carry deduction made by the issuer in the contractual asset coverage test. In this case, the asset disposal loss is more than compensated by the positive impact of the negative carry deduction. The unchanged IDR uplift of two notches reflects that the bank's Long-Term IDR is above the bank's 'c' Viability Rating and a low risk of under-collateralisation at the point of resolution. This is based on Fitch's assessment of the Italian legal framework, which includes the existence of an independent asset monitor, asset eligibility criteria and a contractual minimum level of over-collateralisation. The unchanged six-notch PCU, rather than the standard eight notches for CPT programmes, reflects Fitch's view that the cover pool-specific alternative management for BMPS represents a high risk of payment continuity due to some weaknesses identified in the programme's structure (i.e. selective events triggering the enforcement of the guarantee, the lengthier grace period for curing a breach of the asset coverage test). This results in a strong reliance on the issuer's ability to service payments due on the OBG and could pose risks to a timely enforcement of the cover pool as a source of payments. RATING SENSITIVITIES The resolution of the RWE on the 'BBB' rating of BMPS OBG will depend on the resolution of the RWE on the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), which may take longer than the typical six months. Fitch notes that the programme documentation defines, among others, proceedings resulting from the implementation of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive as one of the events that would trigger an issuer default notice, delivered by the representative of the bondholders, but not an enforcement of the guarantee. According to the programme documentation, upon delivery of an issuer default notice the issuer would not be allowed, among others, to issue further series or tranche of OBG under the programme and no further payments to the subordinated lender would be made, under certain circumstances. Payments due under the OBG will continue to be made by the issuer until a guarantee enforcement notice is delivered according to the documented provisions. Fitch's breakeven AP for a given OBG rating will be affected by, among other factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, the breakeven AP for a covered bonds rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time. Contact: Primary Analyst Roberto Del Ragno Director +39 02 87 90 87 206 Fitch Italia S.P.A.

The deal valued HS1 at more than 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion), two sources said. HICL Infrastructure said it would pay about 320 million pounds for its 30 percent stake, giving an indicative equity value of 915 million pounds. The South Korean pension fund would also take a 30 percent stake in the consortium, with the Equitix funds holding the remaining 35 percent. Infrastructure is an increasingly attractive asset class for investors looking for stable, long-term yields and the involvement of South Korea's public pension plan reflects growing interest by Asian buyers in prime European assets. The deal was struck with Borealis Infrastructure, the infrastructure investment manager of OMERS, the pension plan for Ontario's municipal employees, and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which has held its stake since 2010. HS1 operates the 109-km (68-mile) high-speed rail line connecting London St Pancras International station with the Channel Tunnel, under a 30-year concession signed in 2010. Seven years ago Borealis and Ontario Teachers' pension plan paid 2.1 billion pounds to operate Britain's only high speed railway, beating rivals including Eurotunnel, Morgan Stanley and Allianz.  We are confident that HS1 will continue to prosper under its new ownership, while Ontario Teachers’ remain committed to the UK as an attractive destination for future investment,  Jo Taylor, Senior Managing Director of Ontario Teachers, said. Operators pay index-linked access charges to HS1, partly regulated and partly depending on the number of trains. They include Eurostar and Southeastern Trains, which operates domestic high-speed services. In the 12 months ending March 2017, HS1 made a loss of 94 million pounds. $1 = 0.7646 pounds Reporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by Dasha Afanasieva and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-funds-high-speed-idUSL8N1K53V3"},

The first part, 'Night', was released on Friday, with 'Day' following later this year.  Connor Ball, Tristan Evans, James McVey and Brad Simpson discussed their third album, why they started their own record label and comparisons with One Direction.  Here are excerpts of their interview with Reuters: Q: Why release a two-part album? Simpson: The past two albums we've done we wrote lots of songs. We wrote about 40 songs and you have to cut down 40 songs to a 12, 13-song album. And you kind of lose a lot of songs that are quite personal to you, and your heart is quite close to. So it's always sad to see them never released into the world. So I think by doing this two-part album means that we're able to release more music and our fans are able to get more music. The first half the album is a bit more sultry. And the second half, 'Day', is a bit more organic and uplifting. Q: You have created your own label. Do you want to take over the industry? Evans: Yeah we signed an American band, a British band. The newest one is called 'The New Hope Club' ... They've been supporting us for a couple years now and it's really interesting for us to dabble in that kind of world of being behind the screen. And it's really interesting to see a band grow and kind of find themselves. So for us that's really exciting and we love doing this on the side.  Q: Do you get along with each other all the time?

Earl Simmons, 46, whose stage name is DMX, was arrested on Thursday after federal prosecutors said he engaged in a multiyear scheme to conceal millions of dollars of income from hit songs including  X Gon' Give it to Ya  and  Where the Hood At.  He was charged with tax evasion, evasion of assessment of income tax liability, corruptly endeavoring to obstruct administration of IRS laws and the failure to file a U.S. individual income tax return, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Simmons faces up to five years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. His lawyer, Murray Richman, told Reuters on Thursday that the artist's focus was making music and he has been  charged over the failure of others to do what he hired them to do.  Prosecutors maintain Simmons actively evaded his tax obligations by sticking to a cash-only lifestyle and depositing royalty checks into the bank accounts of his managers, who then gave him cash or used the money to pay his personal expenses. The rap star's prior arrest record includes charges of animal cruelty, reckless driving, drug possession, weapons charges and probation violations. Aside from recording hit songs, often with lyrics rooted in rage and violence, Simmons has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama  Belly,  the 2000 action movie  Romeo Must Die  and the 2003 heist film  Cradle 2 The Grave.

The centrist Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan advocated late on Thursday a go-slow approach on further hikes which chimed with Fed chair Janet Yellen's comments on Wednesday that rates would not go  all that much further . These cautious signals have taken the sting out of a sell-off in the bloc's bond market that has been gathering steam over the past few weeks on rising expectations that the European Central Bank is set to wind down its asset purchase programme.  They (Fed comments) add to our conviction that no further Fed hike should be expected for the rest of the year, which should prove reassuring for markets concerned about excessive tightening risk globally,  Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. Money markets pricing suggests less than a 50 percent chance of a hike over the next year, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, a Reuters poll of economists released on Friday showed that the ECB is likely to wait until September before announcing a shift away from its ultra-easy policy, while a move at the July meeting next week is seen as too close to call. Reuters reported exclusively on Friday that the ECB is keen to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, an approach to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours. Tracking Treasuries The fall in euro zone yields tracked a move lower in U.S. equivalents which came after Kaplan - who is usually fairly centre-ground on monetary policy - made his comments late on Thursday. Doves and Hawks: A look at where U.S. Fed officials stand on interest rate hikes here The bloc's benchmark German 10-year yield fell as much as 4 basis points to 0.49 percent, before trimming falls by late trade to around 0.52 percent. It remained below an 18-month high hit earlier this week of 0.583 percent. All other euro zone yields were down 1-3 bps on the day. U.S. Treasuries extended the fall that started on Thursday, hitting multi-week lows as benign U.S. inflation data in June and an unexpected fall in retail sales fuelled doubts about an interest rate increase later this year. U.S. inflation was unchanged in June, following a 0.1 percent dip in May. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up just 0.1 percent in June. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May.

Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's have all withdrawn from Russian domestic ratings, refusing to comply with legislation drawn up in 2014 when they downgraded Russia after the annexation of Crimea. Russia says the legislation is designed to prevent rating agencies from withdrawing local ratings under external political pressure, while the agencies see it as a restriction on their work. The withdrawal of the big three will leave ACRA, a new Kremlin-backed ratings agency promoted by the central bank, and Expert RA, a veteran of Russia's domestic rating industry, as the only agencies able to assess Russian debt. Investors, who must rely on the ratings of ACRA and Expert RA from July 14, say they are struggling to believe domestically produced ratings will be of the same standard as international ones.  The central bank organized a rating revolution. If funds won't be able to keep bonds due to rating requirements, they will sell these bonds,  the head of a Moscow-based fund manager said. He added that not all issuers in Russia's 1 trillion rouble ($17 billion) corporate bond market had managed to get an ACRA rating in time for the July 14 deadline, leaving them without any credit rating.  Banks are concerned about the rating overhaul as it affects their ability to borrow from the central bank.     Credit ratings are also relied on by investors to decide whether to hold a company's bonds or enter into other transactions with them. Some investors only deal with firms that carry a credit rating above a certain level, so if a company carries no rating or is judged to be rated by unreliable agencies it can lose access to potential investment funds. Russian pension funds are likely to find it particularly difficult to invest in bonds if the new rating arrangements stay as they are, market sources said.      Favored Position When the big three international agencies withdrew their domestic ratings, the central bank and the finance ministry encouraged Russian borrowers to get ACRA ratings.  Rival agency Expert, set up two decades ago, complained that ACRA was benefiting from favoritism.  Imagine there is only one agency on the ratings market. Clients have nowhere to go,  Sergei Tishchenko, head of Expert, told Reuters. He said that without proper competition, ratings could be artificially low as the monopoly agency would want to protect its reputation by being ultra-cautious. ACRA's head, Ekaterina Trofimova, a former director at S&P;, acknowledges that only ACRA had  full regulatory recognition  but said the management of other agencies should be blamed for not complying with new central bank rules. As of mid-July, ACRA had 40 ratings on its books, aiming at bringing that to more than 100 by the end of the year. Expert has 415 active ratings but has rated only four banks from ACRA's list, making it difficult to compare estimates by the two rivals. Expert has many more ratings for smaller Russian firms. Impartiality in Focus ACRA has tried to win a reputation for a conservative approach, making it unpopular in some business circles. Andrey Kostin, who heads Russia's second-largest bank, VTB (VTBR.MM), attacked ACRA's methodology earlier this year.  They rated us even lower than Western agencies, the ones we complained about due to their politicized approach,  Kostin was quoted as saying by Russian media organization RBC. VTB withdrew the ratings it received from Fitch, calling the international agency  unprofessional . ACRA has not revealed the rating it assigned to VTB, one of its shareholders, but Expert assigned it the highest possible rating,  ruAAA , putting it above state lender Gazprombank, where ACRA head Trofimova worked before joining ACRA.  ACRA rates Gazprombank  AA(RU) , two notches below its highest grade. This month, ACRA gave Otkritie, Russia's largest private bank, a BBB- rating, preventing it from raising some funds.  Trofimova rejected allegations that ACRA enjoyed state favoritism, saying competition should exist for quality ratings and this should not take the form of what is called a  rating shopping , when competitors are fighting for a client.

Dicamba is sprayed by farmers on crops genetically modified to resist it but it has drifted, damaging vulnerable soybeans, cotton and other crops across the southern United States. Farmers have fought with neighbors over lost crops and brought lawsuits against dicamba producers. Arkansas banned its use last week and Missouri, which initially halted dicamba spraying, has joined Tennessee with tight restrictions on when and in what weather spraying can be done. Kansas is investigating complaints.  We've had damage across just about every acre of soybeans we farm in southeast Missouri,  said Hunter Raffety, a farmer in Wyatt, Missouri.  In our small town, the azaleas, the ornamentals, people have lost their vegetable gardens. It's a big problem.  He suspects between 3,000 and 4,000 acres of soybeans on the 6,000 acres he and his family farm have sustained damage, evidenced by the leaves of plants constricting into cup-like shapes. Monsanto, which said it has spent years working to make dicamba stickier and limit drift when it is sprayed, is campaigning to overturn the bans. It blames early-adoption headaches similar to wind drift and cross-contaminated farm equipment problems the company faced when it launched its popular Roundup Ready glyphosate-resistant crops two decades ago.  In almost every technology in that first year there are kinks that you need to work out,  Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer, said on a news media call. He said many of the dicamba issues are caused by farmers not following application labels, using contaminated equipment or buying older formulations of dicamba that are cheaper but more prone to drift. The company, together with BASF SE and DuPont , which also produce dicamba-based weed killers, has agreed to additional safeguards for product use, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said in a statement. The dicamba problem is the latest regulatory woe for Monsanto after California last month announced it would list glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in the state.  It's not good for Monsanto - if anything, this is more likely to lead to lawsuits rather than additional sales,  Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst with asset management firm Bernstein, said regarding the dicamba launch woes. Dicamba is key to Monsanto's biggest-ever biotech seed launch, which occurred last year. Its Xtend line of soybeans and cotton are designed to tolerate the weed killer, which replaces earlier products that contained only glyphosate. Some weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, which Monsanto introduced in the 1970s. Crop seeds such as corn, soybeans and cotton are genetically modified to survive the pesticide while yield-sapping weeds die. Dicamba has long been used to kill weeds before crops are planted, but its use has spiked this season across the United States after regulators last year approved it for crops that are already growing. Monsanto sells a new dicamba formulation under the name Xtendimax. The company says that Xtendimax drifts less than older versions. BASF and DuPont also sell less drift-prone formulations. New restrictions in Tennessee include allowing application only from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to limit potential pesticide drift and banning use of older dicamba formulations.  I'm confident that we can address this issue as we have in other cases to ensure the safe and effective use of these tools,  Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton said in a statement. In Monsanto's home state of Missouri, state Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst commended the quick action to update guidelines on dicamba use, which are similar to those in Tennessee.  The Special Local Need label is designed to provide additional protection for neighboring landowners and still allow the application of Dicamba to control weed problems,  he said in a statement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tennessee-grains-monsanto-idUSL1N1K41MB"},

As part of Italy's rescue of Banca Marche, Banca Etruria, CariFerrara and CariChieti in November 2015, gross bad debts from the four banks worth 10.3 billion euros were spun off into a separate vehicle, dubbed REV-Gestione Crediti. REV, which is being advised by KPMG, has shortlisted the three U.S. funds after receiving more than two dozen expressions of interest in the portfolio, which is mainly backed by property assets, the sources said.  The three funds will have to submit binding proposals in October, the sources said, adding that a fourth bidder, Starwood Capital Group, may still be allowed to join the race. All interested parties either declined to comment or were not immediately available for a comment. Italian banks are under regulatory pressure to shed soured debts that rose to a total of 349 billion euros during a harsh recession and international investors have increasingly set their sights on a market that is still underdeveloped. Consultancy PWC said bad loan sales in Italy could top 60 billion euros this year, driven by balance-sheet clean-ups at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI). The two lenders alone are set to offload 44 billion euros in bad debts. UniCredit has been able to tap markets to offset the hit from the disposal but Monte dei Paschi failed to raise capital from investors and is being bailed out by the state.

We hope to be able to say in the near future how much the royalties will amount to,  Moroney told Reuters. Licensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved guselkumab, which it will market as Tremfya, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. That brings Morphosys a step closer to seeing the first drug using its antibody technology launched on to the market, pushing its shares as much as 9 percent higher on Friday.  While it was largely expected, this approval marks a turning point in Morphosys' story as it prepares to receive its  first royalty stream,  Berenberg analysts, who recommend buying shares in Morphosys, said in a note. They see the drug taking 15 percent of the U.S. market for moderate to severe psoriasis at the expense of Janssen's existing Stelara, of Novartis's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's Taltz. Janssen said Tremfya, which is administered by injection, will be an alternative for patients who do not respond to existing treatments. Morphosys has so far not yet said how much Janssen would owe it in royalties, noting only that payments would likely come to a medium single-digit percentage of sales. Berenberg's analysts estimate that guselkumab could reach peak annual sales of about 3.2 billion euros ($3.65 billion) eventually, which would mean royalties of up to 185 million. Morphosys' stock rose about 9 percent in early trade on Friday and were up 6 percent at 66.29 euros by 1350 GMT, having hit its highest level in almost two years. According to CEO Moroney, royalties are not yet included in Morphosys 2017 guidance. The group has so far said it expected its loss before interest and tax to widen to between 75 million and 85 million euros this year from about 60 million in 2016 as its costs for research and development rise. Morphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer. The company is due to publish second-quarter financial results on Aug. 3.

Shares of JPMorgan fell 1.7 percent, Citigroup was down 1.1 percent and Wells Fargo fell 2.4 percent, despite their quarterly profits beating analysts' expectations. The financial index fell 1.03 percent and was the only laggard among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will report results next week.  The bar for earnings is higher this time around, especially after the phenomenal growth we saw in the first quarter. So companies that miss expectations or guide down will be overly punished,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. Bank of America was the biggest drag on the S&P; and Goldman Sachs shaved off 21 points from the Dow. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier, after first quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. At 10:51 a.m. ET (1451 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.41 points, or 0.09 percent, at 21,573.5, the S&P; 500 was up 4.37 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,452.20. The Nasdaq Composite was up 11.84 points, or 0.19 percent, at 6,286.28. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with defensive sectors such as real estate, utilities and consumer staples leading the advancers. Data showed consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and subdued expectations of strong economic growth in the second quarter. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 47 percent after the release of data points, from 55 percent at Thursday's close. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said future rate hikes could be gradual in the face of persistently low inflation. Among stocks, Nutanix jumped 7.5 percent after Goldman Sachs added the cloud data-storage firm to its conviction list. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,943 to 774. On the Nasdaq, 1,395 issues rose and 1,239 fell. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL4N1K54NM"},

Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's have all withdrawn from Russian domestic ratings, refusing to comply with legislation drawn up in 2014 when they downgraded Russia after the annexation of Crimea. Russia says the legislation is designed to prevent rating agencies from withdrawing local ratings under external political pressure, while the agencies see it as a restriction on their work. The withdrawal of the big three will leave ACRA, a new Kremlin-backed ratings agency promoted by the central bank, and Expert RA, a veteran of Russia's domestic rating industry, as the only agencies able to assess Russian debt. Investors, who must rely on the ratings of ACRA and Expert RA from July 14, say they are struggling to believe domestically produced ratings will be of the same standard as international ones.  The central bank organized a rating revolution. If funds won't be able to keep bonds due to rating requirements, they will sell these bonds,  the head of a Moscow-based fund manager said. He added that not all issuers in Russia's 1 trillion rouble ($17 billion) corporate bond market had managed to get an ACRA rating in time for the July 14 deadline, leaving them without any credit rating.  Banks are concerned about the rating overhaul as it affects their ability to borrow from the central bank.     Credit ratings are also relied on by investors to decide whether to hold a company's bonds or enter into other transactions with them. Some investors only deal with firms that carry a credit rating above a certain level, so if a company carries no rating or is judged to be rated by unreliable agencies it can lose access to potential investment funds. Russian pension funds are likely to find it particularly difficult to invest in bonds if the new rating arrangements stay as they are, market sources said.      Favored Position When the big three international agencies withdrew their domestic ratings, the central bank and the finance ministry encouraged Russian borrowers to get ACRA ratings.  Rival agency Expert, set up two decades ago, complained that ACRA was benefiting from favoritism.  Imagine there is only one agency on the ratings market. Clients have nowhere to go,  Sergei Tishchenko, head of Expert, told Reuters. He said that without proper competition, ratings could be artificially low as the monopoly agency would want to protect its reputation by being ultra-cautious. ACRA's head, Ekaterina Trofimova, a former director at S&P;, acknowledges that only ACRA had  full regulatory recognition  but said the management of other agencies should be blamed for not complying with new central bank rules. As of mid-July, ACRA had 40 ratings on its books, aiming at bringing that to more than 100 by the end of the year. Expert has 415 active ratings but has rated only four banks from ACRA's list, making it difficult to compare estimates by the two rivals. Expert has many more ratings for smaller Russian firms. Impartiality in Focus ACRA has tried to win a reputation for a conservative approach, making it unpopular in some business circles. Andrey Kostin, who heads Russia's second-largest bank, VTB (VTBR.MM), attacked ACRA's methodology earlier this year.  They rated us even lower than Western agencies, the ones we complained about due to their politicized approach,  Kostin was quoted as saying by Russian media organization RBC. VTB withdrew the ratings it received from Fitch, calling the international agency  unprofessional . ACRA has not revealed the rating it assigned to VTB, one of its shareholders, but Expert assigned it the highest possible rating,  ruAAA , putting it above state lender Gazprombank, where ACRA head Trofimova worked before joining ACRA.  ACRA rates Gazprombank  AA(RU) , two notches below its highest grade. This month, ACRA gave Otkritie, Russia's largest private bank, a BBB- rating, preventing it from raising some funds.  Trofimova rejected allegations that ACRA enjoyed state favoritism, saying competition should exist for quality ratings and this should not take the form of what is called a  rating shopping , when competitors are fighting for a client.

Global stock markets scaled fresh record highs, capping their best week in more than two months, and oil prices gained in volatile trading amid signs of strengthening demand. The U.S. consumer price index increased 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since October 2016, after rising 1.9 percent in May, the Labor Department said. Year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent. The CPI's drop of 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound last month could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed a recent moderation in price pressures as temporary.  The CPI data begs the question, at what point does transitory becomes something that is more sustained, in terms of the softness,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.5 percent to 95.248 after earlier falling to 95.186, its lowest since September 2016. The drop came after the lackluster U.S. data raised doubts about U.S. economic growth and whether the Fed will hike rates again this year.  This cements the weaker trend in the dollar and lower U.S. yields and I think this story has got legs,  he said. The annualized rate of inflation in several CPI components over the past three months showed declines of 4.9 percent in apparel, 5.5 percent in used cars and trucks and 4.1 percent in professional services, said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for brokerage Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc. The data indicates  a little bit of concern about how the Fed is going to normalize policy,  Learner said. Yields Drop U.S. Treasury yields dropped to multi-week lows as the benign inflation data and unexpected fall in retail sales fueled doubts about an interest rate increase later this year. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.3212 percent. The 10-year German Bund ticked up almost 1 basis point to yield 0.525 percent. The dollar index fell 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies, while the euro gained 0.39 percent to $1.144. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.52 percent versus the greenback at 112.69 per dollar, while the Mexican peso gained 0.48 percent and the Canadian dollar rose 0.31 percent versus the greenback. Stock markets, meanwhile, marched higher. MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries gained 0.38 percent, and its pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rebounded to rise 0.07 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.57 points, or 0.09 percent, to 21,572.66. The S&P; 500 gained 4.28 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,452.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,287.19. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors rose, with the utilities index's 0.73 percent gain leading the advancers. Shares of JPMorgan Citigroup and Wells Fargo , which have run up in the past few weeks, were lower as their earnings reports failed to excite investors. In oil markets, benchmark Brent and U.S. WTI futures contracts were on track for weekly gains. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil, were up 31 cents at $48.73 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 33 cents to $46.41 per barrel. Editing by Bernadette Baum","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL8N1K53KU"},

The move comes amid heightened concerns over the growing presence and influence of Islamic State in Southeast Asia as the jihadist group loses territory in Syria and Iraq. Indonesia itself has seen a resurgence in home-grown militancy, inspired in large part by Islamic State; a twin suicide bombing at a Jakarta bus station in May killed three police officers and injured several others. It has stepped up anti-terrorism cooperation with Malaysia and the Philippines.   This has to be done because there are many channels on this service that are full of radical and terrorist propaganda, hatred, ways to make bombs, how to carry out attacks, disturbing images, which are all in conflict with Indonesian law,  the communications ministry said in a statement on its website. Telegram is a messaging platform known to be popular among Islamic State sympathizers, who use chatrooms with hundreds of members as well as private conversations. The communications ministry added that both the mobile application and the desktop version of Telegram would be blocked throughout Indonesia. It did not say if it would take similar action against other messaging platforms. Telegram was not immediately available for comment. Many messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Telegram offer end-to-end encryption from sender to recipient, which means not even the companies providing the platform can see the messages. Security officials in several countries have complained that the apps provide a safe space for militants to communicate with each other. Several governments, including those of Australia and Britain, have urged technology companies to do more to help security agencies thwart security threats. In March, an attacker on London's Westminster Bridge was reported to have sent encrypted messages moments before plowing his car into pedestrians, killing four people, and fatally stabbing a police officer. British interior minister Amber Rudd said at the time that such encryption was  unacceptable .

Speaking to Reuters at the British Grand Prix, the Scot also felt Mercedes title contender and triple champion Lewis Hamilton was wrong to stay away from Wednesday's major promotional event in the capital.  I think we've got one of the best racetracks in the world, the history of this place since 1950 - it's the home of British motorsport. I personally think it (the race) should be here,  said the 78-year-old Stewart.  Why go and start spending huge amounts of money, and it would have to be government money, to have a racetrack (in London)? It would be ridiculous,  he said.  Even Singapore finds that difficult and with the economy of the United Kingdom I just don't think that fits,  added Stewart, a two-times British Grand Prix winner at the circuit.   Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), triggered a break clause in their contract on Tuesday that threw the future of the country's race into doubt after 2019. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said he would be  happy to listen  to Formula One bosses if they proposed bringing a race to the city. One proposal emerged on Friday when a privately owned company, London GP, issued a statement saying it had been developing plans over the last year for a race at the Olympic  Park in East London. It said talks with major stakeholders would continue in private. Some 100,000 spectators watched the F1 Live event in London, with all the drivers apart from Hamilton putting on a tyre-smoking display.  London was a great idea,  Stewart said.  A huge crowd arrived. It lit London up, it lit Trafalgar Square up, it just taught everybody how big Formula One really is and how important it is to the country, how glamorous it is and how exciting it is.  Hamilton's absence - the Briton was taking a break in Greece - was a talking point ahead of a race that he has won for the past three years, and four times in all.  He should have been there. Lewis is a first-class guy and he's got a huge following,  said Stewart.  He was taking a couple of days off. Can you imagine what I was doing when I was driving racing cars?

The move comes amid heightened concerns over the growing presence and influence of Islamic State in Southeast Asia as the jihadist group loses territory in Syria and Iraq. Indonesia itself has seen a resurgence in home-grown militancy, inspired in large part by Islamic State; a twin suicide bombing at a Jakarta bus station in May killed three police officers and injured several others. It has stepped up anti-terrorism cooperation with Malaysia and the Philippines.  This has to be done because there are many channels on this service that are full of radical and terrorist propaganda, hatred, ways to make bombs, how to carry out attacks, disturbing images, which are all in conflict with Indonesian law,  the communications ministry said in a statement on its website. Telegram is a messaging platform known to be popular among Islamic State sympathisers, who use chatrooms with hundreds of members as well as private conversations. The communications ministry added that both the mobile application and the desktop version of Telegram would be blocked throughout Indonesia. It did not say if it would take similar action against other messaging platforms. Many messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Telegram offer end-to-end encryption from sender to recipient, which means not even the companies providing the platform can see the messages. Security officials in several countries have complained that the apps provide a safe space for militants to communicate with each other. Several governments, including those of Australia and Britain, have urged technology companies to do more to help security agencies thwart security threats. In March, an attacker on London's Westminster Bridge was reported to have sent encrypted messages moments before ploughing his car into pedestrians, killing four people, and fatally stabbing a police officer. British interior minister Amber Rudd said at the time that such encryption was  unacceptable .

ICICI Lombard's two main shareholders - ICICI Bank Ltd and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd - will sell a combined 19 percent stake in the insurer in the IPO, according to the filing released on Friday. (bit.ly/2uqYrTh) Bankers estimate the IPO could raise 60 billion rupees ($932 million), making it one of the biggest Indian IPOs in recent years. India's IPO market has been on a roll with companies raising $2.6 billion in the first half of 2017, after $4 billion in 2016, the best year for IPOs in six years. ICICI Bank, India's third-biggest lender by assets which owns about 63 percent of ICICI Lombard, plans to sell up to a 7 percent stake, or 31.8 million shares, in the IPO. Fairfax, led by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa, is selling about 12 percent, or 54.5 million shares, in ICICI Lombard, the largest private sector non-life insurer in India. It owns about 22 percent of the insurer, after it sold a 12.2 percent stake in May to investors including Warburg Pincus. That deal had valued ICICI Lombard at 203 billion rupees. Fairfax, which is setting up a new insurance joint venture in India, needs to bring its stake in ICICI Lombard to below 10 percent to comply with regulations. SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd is also gearing up for an IPO this year which bankers have said could raise as much as $1 billion. Non-life insurance companies owned by the Indian government also have plans to go public in 2017-18. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ICICI Securities, IIFL Holdings are leading six banks on the ICICI Lombard IPO. CLSA, Edelweiss and JM Financial are the other banks on the deal.

The estimate includes only seniors living on their own and excludes those in institutional settings and most who are cognitively impaired. Complicating the count, Burnes said in a Skype interview, is the fact that victims tend to underreport the scams.  Burnes and his team divided financial exploitation of older adults into two categories: financial fraud and scams perpetrated by strangers or others outside of conventional positions of trust; and financial abuse perpetrated by those in positions of trust, generally friends and relatives.  They reviewed 12 studies involving nearly 42,000 community-dwelling older adults and determined that in every five-year period, an estimated 5.6 percent of older adults are a target of a financial fraud, and 5.4 percent are targeted within one year.  The swindles run the gamut from online romance to counterfeit prescription drug scams, Burnes said.  “Scammers will target and prey on older adults who are lonely, socially isolated, and will develop an online relationship and over time will ask them to send money over and over again,” he said.  Most of the studies defined older adults as being at least 65 years old, but two included people as young as 50.  The studies covered scams pertaining to investments, products and services, employment, prizes and identity theft. Victims often are unable to detect differences between legitimate email calls for help from relatives, for example, and scammers, Burnes said. Victims frequently send money overseas, complicating law-enforcement and recovery efforts across borders, he said. The authors call on researchers and policymakers to explore ways to prevent financial scams and for healthcare professionals to screen elders for vulnerability to scams during wellness visits. Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrics specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the new study, agrees that physicians should screen for vulnerability.  “I do agree that physicians should play a role in helping patients by recognizing the signs of possible impaired financial capacity and recognizing elder abuse, because it’s more common than we often think and because it impacts their health and wellbeing,” he said in an email. “Unfortunately, while there are a number of elder-abuse screening instruments out there, not all screen for financial abuse, and very little if any screen for scams and fraud,” he said. Widera fears the new report failed to capture many instances of financial fraud and scams, especially in the most vulnerable. A previous recent study estimated the one-year prevalence of elder financial abuse in relationships of trust as 4.5 percent. Given that elders could be targeted for both financial abuse and financial fraud or scams, the authors believe nearly 10 percent of older Americans may be subject to some form of financial exploitation each year. Both doctors and consumers tend to overlook elders’ declining ability to manage their own financial affairs, one of the most common and devastating problems of aging, a 2015 report in the Annals of Internal Medicine found.  The authors of that report, Dr. Mark Lachs of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and Duke Han of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, coined the term “age-associated financial vulnerability” to encourage physicians to consider the issue with their patients.  Financial fraud victims may suffer serious health consequences, including major depression, anxiety and premature mortality, the authors of the new study write. Most victims also report feeling anger, stress, betrayal, embarrassment, helplessness and shame. In addition, victims of elder financial fraud and scams suffer financial losses from which they may never be able to recover.

The bank's borrowing business increased across residential mortgages, business loans, credit cards, and even auto loans, an area where some lenders have been pulling back. However, on a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said net interest income for the full year would increase by $4 billion, rather than a $4.5 billion estimate given in April. This is due to mortgage adjustments and a change in the alignment of interest rates, Lake said.    Overall, JPMorgan's net income rose 13 percent to $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, from $6.2 billion, or $1.55 per share, in the year-ago quarter. (bit.ly/2tQ630n) Related CoverageJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon lashes out against Washington politicsThis was driven by JPMorgan's average core loan book, which grew 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Higher interest rates helped JPMorgan earn more money on these loans. Excluding a gain from a legal settlement, the bank earned $1.71 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stock was down 1.7 percent at $91.55 in morning trade. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the second time this year in June. Rising rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to increase how much they charge for loans faster than they boost how much they pay for deposits. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake called rate movements  a tale of two cities,  in which Wall Street businesses change quickly, but Main Street customers are not yet demanding more money for their deposits.   While there have been changes in the industry and CDs, there's been nothing in checking or savings,  said Lake. The bank expects the Fed to hike rates again in December, she said. As JPMorgan's loan book has expanded, it has also set aside more money for borrowers who do not repay their debts. In credit cards, where it has been growing aggressively, the bank built loan-loss reserves by $252 million as the charge-off rate ticked above 3 percent, an increase from both the prior and year-ago periods. JPMorgan executives have told investors to expect credit card loss rates to go up as the company makes more loans. On newer card accounts, the bank sees charge-off rates of about 4.5 percent, Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking, said at an investor conference in June. Trading revenue was a dark spot for JPMorgan as volatility hit multi-year lows. But executives across Wall Street have been warning investors to look for declines because the year-ago quarter benefited from a surge in trading around the UK's Brexit vote. JPMorgan's markets revenue dropped 14 percent to $4.8 billion, mostly due to fixed income trading. It was the first decline in five quarters. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) also reported results on Friday.

Questions about Ikaika Erik Kang's state of mind and the possibility of entrapment were raised by defense lawyer Birney Bervar in remarks to reporters after his client was ordered to remain in jail without bond. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Mansfield in Honolulu ruled after a brief hearing that Kang, 34, posed a flight risk and a danger to the public if released pending further proceedings. The defense did not object to his continued incarceration. Bervar said after the ruling he told his client:  You're going to stay in for now, and we're going to get you evaluated and see what's going on.  He said he believed Kang was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or some other mental problem that the Army failed to address properly after Kang returned from deployments to Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2014. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit, Kang was reprimanded several times dating back to 2011 for threatening fellow service members and expressing extremist views while on duty. The Army referred the matter to the FBI in 2016. Kang soon became the target of what the FBI described in its affidavit as an elaborate sting operation employing several undercover agents and other  confidential human sources  who posed as Islamic State operatives and sympathizers. A photograph with a redacted date, and entered into federal court July 13, 2017 as an exhibit to support the government's motion to keep U.S. Army Sergeant Ikaika Erik Kang in detention without bond, shows what is described as Kang kissing the Islamic State Flag and putting it up to his forehead.

Asked if he was suggesting a case of entrapment, Bervar said:  It sounds pretty close to that, doesn't it?  Bervar said he would seek a  full mental health evaluation  for his client. The government, in support of its motion to keep Kang detained without bond, entered several photographs said to show Kang demonstrating military combat tactics.  Two other images purport to show him kissing and then holding to his forehead a folded flag of Islamic State, also known as ISIS, the militant organization that had seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. He is shown in a third photo holding up an unfurled ISIS flag. Kang, an air traffic control specialist with extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, was arrested by the FBI on Saturday following a year-long undercover investigation. The FBI said he swore allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made training videos for the extremist group and purchased a drone aircraft intended to help ISIS fighters in the Middle East evade enemy tanks in battle. Kang is also accused of trying to furnish ISIS with classified and other sensitive military documents that would have assisted the group in its combat tactics.

U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation. Economists had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and its drop of 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory.  The CPI data begs the question, at what point does transitory becomes something that is more sustained, in terms of the softness,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.5 to 95.248 after earlier falling to 95.186, its lowest since September 2016.

As the bull market in stocks enters its eighth year and shows little signs of slowing there are growing signs that sthe Federal Reserve chief may be on the money. Conventional wisdom argues that a lack of volatility in markets coupled with high asset prices reflects growing complacency among investors, making an aging expansion increasingly vulnerable to a turn. But the view that age determines when boom turns to bust has come under question in an era of abnormally low interest rates and at a time when central bankers are struggling to combat anaemic readings of output, productivity and wage growth.

If he aims to his left, his chances of scoring go up to 85 percent and 89 percent if he goes to his right.  One of the oldest cliches in football is the one about penalties being a lottery. For many people, however, taking penalties is a science, as evidenced by a growing number of studies and books on the subject by academics and psychologists. One of the most recent is from a group of Portuguese researchers who have studied thousands of penalties, including those taken by Ronaldo, and built up a database describing the behavior of individual players while taking a spot kick. The researchers say they can use the information to predict how a given player is likely to take a penalty, or how a goalkeeper will react, depending on the circumstances of the match, and their recent form. They hope to sell the information to clubs, with project coordinator Alexandre Real telling Reuters it could be worth  between three and 12 points to a team  during a season - enough to make the difference between survival and relegation.   Although many clubs compile their own dossiers on penalties, Real says his group's research has added value in that it identifies individual traits in penalty takers and goalkeepers and how that can vary according to circumstances. Joao Fialho, a mathematics professor at the American University of the Middle East in Kuwait and also on the research team, said that, for example, when Chile captain Arturo Vidal misses a penalty, he always takes the following one to his left. Penalty-Taking Psychology FILE PHOTO: Football Soccer - Portugal v Latvia - 2018 World Cup Qualifying European Zone  - Group B - Algarve Stadium, Faro, Portugal - November 13, 2016. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo puts the ball on the penalty mark.Pedro Nunes/File PhotoOn this basis, Fialho said he was able to forecast that when Vidal took a penalty in the Confederations Cup shootout against Portugal he would shoot to the left - which he did, scoring and sending Portugal goalkeeper Rui Patricio the wrong way. Vidal had missed his previous penalty, for Bayern Munich against Real Madrid in the Champions League.  Fialho told Reuters that the way a player will take a penalty often depends on the circumstances of the match or penalty shootout. If his team are behind, the player is less likely to vary his normal routine. Slideshow (2 Images)One goalkeeper the group studied tended to try pulling a double bluff over the penalty taker. If the penalty taker looked one way before kicking, the keeper would assume it was a decoy and would dive towards the opposite corner. The researchers did not want to give too much away but, as a teaser, published an analysis of Germany's goalkeepers at the Confederations Cup. The report said that first choice Marc-Andre ter Stegen  has a tendency to open his arms and does not try to make eye contact with the penalty taker . If the penalty taker shot to the right - or Ter Stegen's left,  there was a strong chance the penalty would be saved . Real said that information would be sold to only one club per league, or competition in the case of international club contests, on an  exclusive rights  basis. Other researchers say they have found clubs are reluctant to invest in such projects but Real, who did not want to reveal how much he would charge, was confident of attracting clients.  We have already had an inquiry from one very important coach and we have had requests from clubs which we justifies the effort,  he said.

Army helicopters flew overhead and explosions could be heard, residents said.  Three mortars landed on our district,  a resident of Faysaliya, just across the Tigris river in east Mosul, said by telephone. The U.S.-led coalition backing the Iraqi military campaign said it had conducted two air strikes in the Mosul area a day earlier, destroying 22 fighting positions and a tunnel. The victory of U.S.-backed Iraqi forces in Mosul marked the biggest defeat for Islamic State, which is also under siege in the eastern Syrian city of Raqqa, its operational base. A few hundred Islamic State insurgents swept into Mosul three years ago as the Iraqi army collapsed, imposing a reign of terror and declaring a caliphate in territory it had seized spanning swathes of Iraq and Syria. Related CoverageIraqi police parade car bombs seized from Islamic StateThe group still controls areas south and west of Mosul inhabited by tens of thousands of people. The top U.S. general in Iraq said this week that security forces would rest and re-equip before moving on to Tal Afar, 65 km (40 miles) west of Mosul. The United Nations on Friday estimated that than 20,000 people remained in the city, whose pre-war population were mostly Shi'ite and Sunni Turkmen. Iraqi forces have regained control of more than half of Imam Gharbi, a village south of Mosul that Islamic State militants armed with machine guns and mortars stormed last week, a security source said. A few dozen insurgents are estimated to remain in the area. Long-Term Challenges Securing long-term peace in Iraq will not be easy. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi faces the challenge of preventing revenge killings that could create more instability, as well as stemming the sectarian tensions and ethnic strife that have dogged Iraq since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch said it had used satellite imagery to verify that a video published on Facebook on Tuesday, showing armed men in military uniforms beating a detainee before throwing him from a precipice and then shooting at him, had been filmed in west Mosul.  The footage also shows the men shooting at the body of another man already lying at the bottom of the precipice. Reuters could not independently verify the footage. Since the victory announcement, security forces have severely restricted media access to west Mosul, saying they need to remove or defuse explosive devices. In his first Friday sermon since the proclamation of victory in Mosul, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, urged his compatriots to avoid violence and sectarianism.  Iraq's joint operations command said the allegations were being looked at closely and if any violations were found, those responsible would be held accountable. It also said that the videos could have been fabricated. Three other videos posted this week by the same account appear to show members of various Iraqi security forces beating men wearing ordinary clothes. Reuters could not independently verify the footage. Human Rights Watch also accused the security forces of forcibly relocating at least 170 families of alleged Islamic State members to a closed  rehabilitation camp  as a form of collective punishment.

With IT spending in the core banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment subdued in the United States - the largest market for India's more than $150 billion software services sector - companies are looking at different sectors and a wider range of service offerings to drive revenue growth. Gopinathan said in an interview with Reuters that technology was playing a growing role in not just the manufacturing process, but also in products, allowing companies such as TCS to target non-traditional sectors more than they did in the past.  When we look at manufacturing, the extent of smart features that go into not just the manufacturing process, but the product itself are steadily increasing,  he said. From smart refrigerators to connected cars, technology now plays a far bigger role in products, with the proliferation of the Internet of Things and embedded tracking devices helping companies manage logistics and inventory.   TCS posted slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly results late on Thursday, but it reported over 10 percent year-over-year revenue growth from clients in the manufacturing, life sciences and energy sectors. The three combined currently account for less than 20 percent of TCS's revenue and the BFSI segment accounts for a third. Gopinathan also said that while TCS would have traditionally focused on servicing the sales and administration functions of such clients, it was now working with those companies even on the final products they market. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan speaks during a news conference announcing the company's quarterly results in Mumbai, India, July 13, 2017.Danish Siddiqui We have a situation where we are under-penetrated in such sectors. On top of that the addressable space in these sectors is rapidly expanding,  said Gopinathan.  That's a growth driver and an unfolding opportunity.  Bfsi Optimism Gopinathan said the mood among BFSI clients had turned optimistic with the prospect of a further interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the potential easing of regulatory requirements.  Sentiment is definitely positive,  he said, adding that movement on interest rates and regulations could help trigger increased IT spending by BFSI clients. Interest rate hikes can improve banks' margins, while U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is looking to ease regulations that were imposed on banks after the global financial crises.  The Mumbai-based company sees scope to expand in the BFSI market by adding smaller clients, such as regional banks. The Indian market also offers a big opportunity for TCS as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship Digital India initiative could boost tech spending in Asia's third-largest economy, Gopinathan said. Sales in India, which accounts for 7 percent of TCS revenues, rose by around 13 percent year-on year in the quarter to June, coming in a close second to mainland Europe.  I think as growth rates pick up back in India, we should see a pickup (in spending).

Chris Martin, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker said the recall would include 1.15 million Honda Accord vehicles from the 2013-2016 model years in the United States, and nearly 1 million elsewhere, to replace a 12-volt battery sensor. The company said it had received four reports of engine compartment fires in the United States and at least one in Canada, in areas that use significant amounts of road salt during the winter. There have been no reported injuries. The automaker has received 3,972 U.S. warranty claims relating to the issue. The battery sensors may not be sufficiently sealed against moisture intrusion, Honda said. Over time, moisture may introduce road salt or other material into the battery sensor, leading to rust and eventual electrical shorting of the sensor. Due to the large size of the recall, Honda said dealers would initially adopt a temporary fix by applying an adhesive to prevent moisture intrusion, and then later replace the sensor.   The company first received a claim of an engine compartment fire from Canada in 2015 and began investigating the issue. In early 2016, it received a claim of a similar fire in China. Honda introduced a redesigned battery sensor in June 2016. After an investigation of the China incident, the automaker said it initially believed the  future occurrence rate was estimated to be low,  but continued to probe the matter after receiving additional reports of fires.

The disappointing data supported the caution raised this week by several policy-makers, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen about the softening in inflation since February.  You have seen them change their tone already. This keeps the Fed on a gradual pace  for further rate increases, said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco. Just last month, the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for a second time in 2017, downplaying the weakening in price growth amid one-time factors. It signaled it was open to another rate hike and prepared to reduce its $4.5-trillion balance sheet by year-end. The fourth straight below-forecast reading on the consumer price index in June pushed inflation further away from the Fed's 2-percent goal. It also raised speculation that a third rate hike is out of Fed's reach. The Labor Department said earlier Friday the CPI grew 1.6 percent from a year earlier in June, marking the smallest year-over-year gain since October 2016. At the same time, retail sales unexpectedly fell by 0.2 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported. At 10:12 a.m. EDT (1412 GMT), federal funds futures implied that traders saw a 53-percent chance the Federal Reserve would raise key overnight borrowing costs by at least a quarter point at its Dec. 12-13 meeting, down from about 55 percent at Thursday's close, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

Officials at the coeducational boarding school in Concord, New Hampshire, had apologized after the release of that report, which was commissioned after a 2015 trial shone a harsh light on the school's culture. Among the allegations that surfaced was the practice of the St. Paul's  senior salute,  in which graduating students sought out underclassmen for sex. The school, which was all-male until 1971, has repeatedly denied that this practice was a part of its culture. The probe will initially focus on whether the 161-year-old school violated state laws by allowing the endangerment of a child or obstructing government operations, state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald said in a statement late on Thursday.  Protection of children is a paramount priority for law enforcement,  MacDonald said.  I am confident that an institution such as St. Paul's School will be fully cooperative with this investigation.  School Rector Michael Hirschfeld vowed in a statement to  fully cooperate  with the investigation.  We have been in close contact with local law enforcement regarding recent events of concern,  Hirschfeld said.

It was based on interviews with alleged victims and witnesses, whose statements St. Paul's said substantiated the claims. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu praised the launch of the probe.  I am encouraged by the attorney general's actions to investigate the alleged abuse,  Sununu said in a statement on Friday.  Sexual assault will not be tolerated in New Hampshire.  St. Paul's is not the only boarding school grappling with past sexual abuse of students. Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut said earlier this year that 12 of its former teachers had abused students, and St. George's School in Rhode Island last year disclosed similar abuse in the 1970s and '80s. The former St. Paul's chaplain whose arrest led to the May report went on to work at St. George's. He pleaded guilty in Boston to charges of sex abuse. In 2015, former St. Paul's student Owen Labrie was sentenced to a year in jail for luring an underage female classmate into a sexual encounter. St. Paul's alumni include well-known business and political figures, including former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

DX said it would split its business into DX Express and DX Freight and the reorganisation would give greater flexibility in managing costs. Nick Cullen, its current chief operations officer will head DX Express and Stuart Godman, currently chief commercial officer, will be head of DX Freight, it said. Chief Executive Officer Petar Cvetkovic and Finance Director Daljit Basi will step down from the board with immediate effect. DX named James Hayward as its interim chief financial officer, making a non-board appointment. On July 7 the group said it had made changes to internal businesses processes at its collection and delivery service DX Exchange, after a preliminary police investigation last month which was later dropped.

The IPO could be launched around September, when the people expect Neoenergia SA to have won industry regulatory approval for Elektro Eletricidade & Serviços SA's takeover. Antitrust agency Cade gave the nod to the takeover on July 4. Spain's Iberdrola SA will have 52.4 percent of Neoenergia once the takeover is completed. The dual listing will be a so-called secondary offer, allowing Banco do Brasil SA and pension fund Previ Fundação [PREVI.UL] to sell part of their 9.4-percent and 38-percent stakes, respectively, in Neoenergia, the people said. Banco do Brasil, Iberdrola and Previ declined to comment, while Neoenergia said that no decision has been taken yet on a potential debut offering. The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the plan remains private. Listing Neoenergia in both stock markets would give the utility access to a wide base of investors seeking greater exposure to an industry that for years has struggled with erratic policies, a harsh recession and high borrowing costs. Chinese power conglomerates have become the dominant force in Brazil's power industry with high-profile acquisitions that have resulted in delistings. State Grid Corp of China's $12.1 billion purchase of CPFL Energia SA - the largest-ever foreign acquisition in Brazil - involves a buyout of small shareholders. Shares of Iberdrola reversed early losses, and were up 0.3 percent at 6.904 euros on Friday afternoon in Madrid. Shares of Banco do Brasil added 1 percent to 29.40 reais in São Paulo. Investment Banks When announcing the Elektro acquisition on June 8, Iberdrola committed to list Neoenergia when Previ and Banco do Brasil  deemed it appropriate.  Neoenergia's business scope includes power generation, transmission and distribution across Brazil, in an area almost five times as big as Iberdrola's in Spain. With 13.4 million customers in Brazil, the Elektro deal could be followed by a transfer of Iberdrola's wind farm assets to the combined entity. Banco do Brasil, the country's No. 1 state-controlled lender, is looking for investment-banking peers to help it underwrite the IPO, two of the people said, naming Banco Santander Brasil SA, Morgan Stanley & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG as candidates. Other local investment banks vying for underwriting roles include Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA, the people said. The banks declined to comment. In the wake of the Elektro acquisition, Neoenergia said combined annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 3.6 billion reais ($1.12 billion) last year on a proforma basis, on revenue of about 31 billion reais. If successful, Neoenergia's IPO may be one of Brazil's largest this year. The last stock market debut of a Brazilian electricity company in Brazil took place in July 2013, when CPFL Energias Renováveis SA raised about 364 million reais  ($113 million) from investors. Still, efforts by President Michel Temer's administration to undo some of the policies of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff - who imposed caps on project returns and renegotiated contracts that led to copious losses - have revived industry equity offerings. Over the past year, utilities have raised 3.6 billion reais through equity offerings, more than in the prior four years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Omega Geração SA expects to price a 1.4 billion-real IPO on July 27.

Hyperloop One, the Los-Angeles-based company developing the technology, is gearing up to send a 28-foot-long (8.5 meter-long) pod gliding across a set of tracks in a test run in Nevada in the next few weeks, spokeswoman Marcy Simon said. Hyperloop One is working to develop a technical vision proposed by Musk, the founder of rocket maker SpaceX and electric car company Tesla Motors. In 2013, he suggested sending pods with passengers through giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Hyperloop aims to achieve speeds of 250 miles per hour (402 km per hour) in its upcoming phase of testing. As it gears up for that experiment, the company on Wednesday released the results from a May 12 test in the Nevada desert. A Hyperloop One sled on wheels for the first time coasted above a track using electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation, Simon said. It levitated for 5.3 seconds in a vacuum-sealed tube and reached speeds of 70 mph (113 kph), the company said in a statement. By comparison, another test by Hyperloop One that made national headlines last year was done on an open-air track, not in the tube, a key to achieving high speeds. Backers of the project envision the pods reaching speeds of 750 mph (1,200 kph), but skeptics say the hyperloop idea faces real-world challenges ranging from obtaining construction permits to making turns at jet speed. Hyperloop One has raised $160 million in funding and has touted the technology's potential as a rapid-transit option.  Hyperloop One will move people and things faster than at any other time in the world,  Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and executive chairman of Hyperloop One, said in a statement.

They've also been mobbed by angry voters and confronted by men offended that their wives are being interviewed instead of them. The work of political pollsters is still widely misunderstood in Kenya, with international companies like Ipsos accused of everything from corruption to making children sick.   We have had to airlift people out before,  said Hilda Kiritu, head of public relations for Ipsos's Kenya office, as she listed her colleagues' travails.  Kenyans are preparing to elect their next president, lawmakers and local representatives on Aug. 8, with incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta seeking a second five-year term and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga determined to unseat him. As campaign rhetoric heats up, hostility toward pollsters has erupted again. The latest Ipsos poll showing the presidential race may go to a second round sparked angry denunciations and threats on social media.   There's a lot of people who believe polling is not scientific, that everything has a price tag,  Aggrey Oriwo, managing director at Ipsos Kenya, told Reuters.  They don't understand there are a lot of checks and balances.  Kenyan elections are traditionally tight but there has never been a run-off. President Mwai Kibaki won in 2007 by 232,000 votes; in 2013, Kenyatta avoided a run-off by just 8,100 votes.  Both times, irregularities marred the elections and the opposition alleged rigging. In 2007, protests sparked widespread ethnic violence that killed around 1,200 people. In 2013, Odinga took his challenge to court. Protests were mostly peaceful.  A close race and eroding trust in public institutions are two of the most closely-watched indicators of potential violence. Ipsos polls show worrying trends for both.  The latest Ipsos survey of 2,026 Kenyans, released last month, showed 48 percent supported incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta, seeking a second and final five-year term. Forty-two percent supported veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga. Two percent refused to say and eight percent were undecided.  The sampling error was plus or minus 2.18 percent.  The winner needs one vote more than 50 percent of the national total, with at least a quarter of the vote in 24 of the 47 counties.  Trust in institutions has increased overall, but it's split along partisan lines: 79 percent of Kenyatta supporters trust the electoral board, but only 43 percent of Odinga's supporters.  Aggrey Oriwo, managing director at Ipsos Kenya, speaks during a Reuters interview in his office in Nairobi, Kenya July 12, 2017.Katharine HoureldLess than half of all Kenyans said they would trust the presidential result and only 39 percent said they trust the courts. That may be dip further when the next survey comes out this month. On Sunday, Kenyatta angrily attacked a high court decision he said favored the opposition. Kish Grids and Smartphones Voters' faith in pollsters has slipped globally after polls failed to predict a majority of people in Britain would vote to leave the European Union or that Donald Trump would win the presidential election in the United States.  Who are these aliens you claim to take opinions from?  is one of the more polite comments on the Ipsos Kenya Facebook page.  Ipsos made a Swahili-speaking American, Tom Wolf, its public face in Kenya to dampen accusations of ethnic bias. The price of fame means that he has twice had to flee angry mobs and is often surrounded by voters demanding their views be heard.  Politicians have called for his deportation, threatened to sue Ipsos over defamation and complained to its Paris headquarters, saying their work is biased.  It's not just Kenyans who have a problem with pollsters, Wolf said. After Trump denounced polls during his presidential campaign, some of his supporters stopped responding to them, possibly helping skew results in the United States, he said.  America is becoming more like Kenya every day,  he said with a wry smile. Ipsos tries to counter doubters by explaining how its methodology is designed to ensure representative sampling. For its quarterly survey, computers send pollsters to 200 locations around the country, randomly chosen to reflect population density. They visit urban slums and remote deserts bordering Somalia.  A computer program ensures randomness in the selection of households by telling pollsters to pass a certain number of homes before stopping. After the pollster lists everyone inside over the age of 18, the person to be surveyed is chosen using a kish grid, a table widely used in international research.  A smartphone records the interview, answers, time and exact location. For questions on presidential candidates, interviewees enter answers on the phone so the interviewer can't see them.  We are trying to remove the element of human error,  Oriwo said, and added the most important thing is to accurately reflect voters' concerns, so their leaders can listen.

Mining shares fell to more than one-year lows when Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane released the revised mining charter last month, giving resource firms 12 months to meet a new 30 percent minimum for black ownership, up from 26 percent. The Chamber of Mines said the minister had given a written undertaking that the new code would not be implemented until a court ruled on a case against the move brought by the chamber. It said the court would likely hear the so-called interdict application in September. The charter aims to widen ownership in South Africa's economy, which has yet to shake off the legacy of white rule more than two decades after the end of apartheid. The Chamber of Mines applied to the high court to prevent  implementation of the charter, saying it risked  vast and systemic damage  to the industry. The industry body said there had been insufficient consultation drawing it up. Ratings agency Moody's said the new rules seeking to accelerate black ownership in South Africa's mining industry would deter investment, raise costs and diminish cashflow generation. The mining minister has defended the new code, calling it a  win-win  for all. Johannesburg's Mining Index extended gains to be up 1 percent following the news of the suspension.

Policymakers are likely to calibrate the language they use as they edge towards normalizing policy after years of huge post-crisis stimulus.  The bank may drop a reference to its readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase program before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond-buying.  But after the reaction to his June 27 speech in Sintra, Portugal, hinting at the possibility of changes to the central bank's aggressive stimulus, ECB President Mario Draghi will be wary of sparking another  taper tantrum . His comments in Sintra sent the euro and bond yields sharply higher, and prompted some rowing back.   We expect the gradual adjustments in Draghi's communication to continue next week,  Nordea analysts said in a note.  So far the ECB has had an implicit bias towards increasing the size of the asset-purchase program, but this stance could change to a more neutral one, as the ECB will try to smooth the communication path towards the next tapering announcement in the fall.   Noting the nervous response to Draghi's Sintra speech and recent adjustments to the U.S. Federal Reserve's language, they added:  It will be just as interesting to see the market reactions before and after the meeting ... Draghi will need to pave the way for a tapering announcement later on without scaring the bond markets too much.      Half of analysts polled by Reuters now expect the ECB to announce in September that it will gradually wind down its asset buying, a process known as tapering, while a quarter see a one-off reduction and the remainder expect no change. [nL4N1K44AV]  The Sept. 7 meeting will include new inflation and growth forecasts by the ECB's own staff.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) are illuminated with a giant euro sign at the start of the  Luminale, light and building  event in Frankfurt, Germany, March 12, 2016.   EUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoReuters reported on Friday that three sources had said the ECB is reluctant to set a firm date on which asset purchases will fall to zero so it can retain flexibility in case economic variables, particularly wage growth, fall short of expectations. [nL8N1K43T0] So far, the ECB has said its purchases are intended to run at their current pace until December 2017  or beyond, if necessary , with a winding-down phase to follow. Inflation Not Playing While euro zone growth is on its best run since the start of the global financial crisis a decade ago and unemployment is falling faster than expected, anemic wage growth continues to anchor inflation well below the ECB's near 2 percent target.  Current forecasts suggest inflation will remain weak at least until the end of 2019.     Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the ECB would increasingly have to distinguish between extraordinary stimulus and regular interest rate policy in its communications, emphasizing waning deflation risks to justify winding down its asset purchases but keeping rates low to reflect weak inflation.   We think that to further habituate the market to this approach, next week Draghi will need to  assume Sintra , i.e. to continue to prepare the market for tapering -- in practice by removing the easing bias on QE as well -- while making it clear that  patience , persistence  and sustained monetary stimulus will still be needed,  they wrote.  Bank of Japan policymakers meet on Wednesday and Thursday and are expected to keep monetary policy settings unchanged, reflecting a gradual economic uptick that is likely to see the bank's growth forecasts revised upwards. [nL4N1K4410] Trade data on Thursday is expected to show Japanese exports rising for a seventh consecutive month, aided by a weak yen, underpinning the improvement in growth, although feeble inflation will keep the BoJ's stimulus measures in place.  With Bank of England policymakers split over whether to raise interest rates and at least one arguing for its 435 billion pound ($566.85 billion) quantitative easing program to be unwound early, UK inflation figures on Tuesday will be closely scrutinized. [nL8N1K369Y] Retail sales figures on Thursday should also give an indication of whether consumers, whose wages have not matched a surge in inflation cased largely by the plunge in sterling following last year's Brexit vote, are feeling the squeeze. $1 = 0.7674 pounds","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economy-outlook-idUSKBN19Z1MM"},

Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens is proud of his accomplishments at the helm of the central bank as he prepares to step down. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Carstens, a former finance minister with blue-chip academic credentials, described himself as the latest in a line of governors bolstering the autonomy of Mexico's central bank. The 59-year-old Carstens, who is highly respected on Wall Street, will leave in December to take the top job at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). He said he was cutting short a tenure meant to have lasted through 2021 because opportunities such as the one at BIS only come up occasionally. After he took over in 2010, Banco de Mexico began publishing minutes of monthly monetary policy meetings, and Carstens increased the quality and flow of data and analysis about Latin America's No. 2 economy.  That has brought Banco de Mexico to be one of the strongest central banks, needless to say among emerging markets, but also in general, considering advanced economies' central banks,  Carstens said. Carstens' much-praised governorship is ending with a bumpy ride. On his watch, annualized inflation surged to 6.31 percent in June, way past the central bank's 3 percent target and the highest level since December 2008. Largely to blame was a slump in the peso currency following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise election in November and a surge in gasoline prices after President Enrique Pena Nieto this year began to remove government subsidies. Carstens said he was disappointed to be leaving the job with inflation high.  Of course I would have loved to have it on the record in my period that we had consolidated strongly the 3 percent objective,  said Carstens, who has headed the central bank for eight years. However, he said the liberalization of fuel prices would be positive for the economy in the long run.  If you take it way, because it is not a generalized increase in prices, we are not that far way from our target,  he said. The peso currency weakened more than 1 percent against the dollar last Dec. 1 when Carstens' plan to leave the bank was announced, surprising investors and raising concerns about who might replace him. It slumped further, to record lows, after Trump took office, but has since recovered. In an effort to beat back prices, Carstens and the bank's other board members have hiked interest rates for seven straight monetary policy meetings. The benchmark rate now stands at 7.00 percent, the highest level since 2009. Carstens said criticism of current inflation rates shows just how much the central bank has improved in recent decades from the mid 1990s when inflation hit nearly 52 percent.  When the Banco de Mexico became independent more than 20 years ago, (current levels) of inflation were considered acceptable, even extremely good. Today, Mexican society considers 6.3 percent inflation as excessive and undesirable, and it should be that way,  he said. Carstens, who earned a doctorate in economics in 1985 from the University of Chicago, served two stints at the International Monetary Fund, including as deputy managing director, and unsuccessfully sought the job of IMF head in 2011, losing out to France's Christine Lagarde. Pena Nieto has not announced who will replace him. (Writing by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-cenbank-legacy-idUSL1N1K50RT"},

Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah group backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government in the country's more than six-year-old conflict. It has sent thousands of men to fight the mostly Sunni Syrian rebels and is the dominant force in the Syrian border area where the refugees returned.   We will only address this issue in close coordination and joint planning with the U.N. and its specialized agencies,  Hariri said, adding that a  concerning debate  had emerged surrounding refugee returns.      We are in support of a speedy and safe return of the Syrian displaced, however, we will, under no circumstances, force the Syrian displaced to return to Syria,  he said at a meeting of the government's steering committee for displaced persons.   Lebanese politicians are deeply divided over whether Lebanon should work directly with the Syrian government over the return of refugees, which Hezbollah and its allies advocate. Lebanon, which suffered its own fifteen-year civil war, has since 2012 followed a policy of neutrality over the Syrian conflict.  On Tuesday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in a televised speech urged Beirut to work directly with the Syrian government on refugee returns.  Lebanon's infrastructure and communities have been strained by hosting more than one million Syrian refugees, which make up around a quarter of the country's population.  The weight of the Syrian displaced crisis has been very heavy on Lebanon. The entire country feels this weight and their presence has aggravated socio-economic indicators,  Hariri said.  During the meeting Hariri stressed the importance of improving the health and education services Syrians receive in Lebanon, but said international aid levels were not adequate.

Only US$26.2bn of CLOs was issued in the same period of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data, amid higher market volatility. Only two US CLOs were arranged in January 2016 and six in February, compared to 26 CLOs arranged in June 2017. Dodd-Frank risk-retention rules, which came into effect in December and force managers to hold 5% of their funds, did not curb issuance as expected as managers entered 2017 ready to issue compliant CLOs after working on solutions. “Experience has shown that risk retention has been a project to solve and there has been, for most part, good solutions implemented and there seems to be plenty of capital willing to participate in risk-retention vehicles,” said Bjarni Torfason, a CLO analyst at Deutsche Bank. “While [risk retention] definitely creates bumps in the road and slows down the process and creates extra transaction costs, it looks like the market is comfortable solving it.” JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank increased their 2017 CLO forecasts in June, with JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank raising their predictions to as much as US$95bn, according to research reports. If volume hits that target, 2017 will be one of the top five biggest years of US CLO issuance ever. Forecasts initially ranged from US$50bn to US$70bn. Citigroup was the top arranger of US CLOs by volume in the first half of the year with US$8.9bn of issuance, according to LPC Collateral data. Morgan Stanley was second and Bank of America Merrill Lynch was third. Citigroup was also the most active arranger by volume in the second quarter with US$6.3bn of issuance, according to the data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch was second and Natixis third. “We’ve made a significant effort to build the broadly syndicated CLO business to complement our existing middle-market CLO platform,” Kevin Alexander, Natixis’ head of global markets and investment banking, Americas, said in a statement. In the first quarter of 2017, Wells Fargo was the most active arranger with US$3.4bn of volume. The bank was in 10th place in the second quarter. Citigroup was also the most active arranger of US CLO resets in the second quarter with US$4.1bn of volume, according to LPC Collateral. In a reset, the maturity of the CLO is extended to allow the deal to remain outstanding for longer. JP Morgan was the second most active arranger of resets and Wells Fargo was the third most active. Spokespeople for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo all declined to comment.

Policymakers are likely to calibrate the language they use as they edge towards normalizing policy after years of huge post-crisis stimulus.  The bank may drop a reference to its readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase program before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond-buying.  But after the reaction to his June 27 speech in Sintra, Portugal, hinting at the possibility of changes to the central bank's aggressive stimulus, ECB President Mario Draghi will be wary of sparking another  taper tantrum . His comments in Sintra sent the euro and bond yields sharply higher, and prompted some rowing back.   We expect the gradual adjustments in Draghi's communication to continue next week,  Nordea analysts said in a note.  So far the ECB has had an implicit bias towards increasing the size of the asset-purchase program, but this stance could change to a more neutral one, as the ECB will try to smooth the communication path towards the next tapering announcement in the fall.   Noting the nervous response to Draghi's Sintra speech and recent adjustments to the U.S. Federal Reserve's language, they added:  It will be just as interesting to see the market reactions before and after the meeting ... Draghi will need to pave the way for a tapering announcement later on without scaring the bond markets too much.      Half of analysts polled by Reuters now expect the ECB to announce in September that it will gradually wind down its asset buying, a process known as tapering, while a quarter see a one-off reduction and the remainder expect no change. [nL4N1K44AV]  The Sept. 7 meeting will include new inflation and growth forecasts by the ECB's own staff.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) are illuminated with a giant euro sign at the start of the  Luminale, light and building  event in Frankfurt, Germany, March 12, 2016.   EUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoReuters reported on Friday that three sources had said the ECB is reluctant to set a firm date on which asset purchases will fall to zero so it can retain flexibility in case economic variables, particularly wage growth, fall short of expectations. [nL8N1K43T0] So far, the ECB has said its purchases are intended to run at their current pace until December 2017  or beyond, if necessary , with a winding-down phase to follow. Inflation Not Playing While euro zone growth is on its best run since the start of the global financial crisis a decade ago and unemployment is falling faster than expected, anemic wage growth continues to anchor inflation well below the ECB's near 2 percent target.  Current forecasts suggest inflation will remain weak at least until the end of 2019.     Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the ECB would increasingly have to distinguish between extraordinary stimulus and regular interest rate policy in its communications, emphasizing waning deflation risks to justify winding down its asset purchases but keeping rates low to reflect weak inflation.   We think that to further habituate the market to this approach, next week Draghi will need to  assume Sintra , i.e. to continue to prepare the market for tapering -- in practice by removing the easing bias on QE as well -- while making it clear that  patience , persistence  and sustained monetary stimulus will still be needed,  they wrote.  Bank of Japan policymakers meet on Wednesday and Thursday and are expected to keep monetary policy settings unchanged, reflecting a gradual economic uptick that is likely to see the bank's growth forecasts revised upwards. [nL4N1K4410] Trade data on Thursday is expected to show Japanese exports rising for a seventh consecutive month, aided by a weak yen, underpinning the improvement in growth, although feeble inflation will keep the BoJ's stimulus measures in place.  With Bank of England policymakers split over whether to raise interest rates and at least one arguing for its 435 billion pound ($566.85 billion) quantitative easing program to be unwound early, UK inflation figures on Tuesday will be closely scrutinized. [nL8N1K369Y] Retail sales figures on Thursday should also give an indication of whether consumers, whose wages have not matched a surge in inflation cased largely by the plunge in sterling following last year's Brexit vote, are feeling the squeeze. $1 = 0.7674 pounds","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy-outlook-idUSL8N1K523W"},

The lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, confirmed he had attended the meeting, the Associated Press reported without providing further details. NBC News, who did not identify him, said he had denied any current ties to Russian spy agencies but had served in the Soviet military before emigrating to the United States, where he holds dual citizenship. (nbcnews.to/2uqwlHQ) Washington this week has been fixated on emails released by President Donald Trump's eldest son showing he met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The revelation of the meeting would be the most tangible evidence yet of a connection between Trump's campaign and Russia, a subject that has also prompted an investigation by a federal special counsel. NBC said the lobbyist accompanied the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, to the meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan attended by Donald Trump Jr. as well as the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort. Veselnitskaya acknowledged in an exclusive interview that she was accompanied by at least one other man, whom she would not identify, NBC said. The White House had no immediate comment. NBC News said representatives for Kushner and Manafort declined to comment, but that a lawyer for Donald Trump Jr. said he had spoken to the lobbyist. Attorney Alan Futerfas said the man was described as a friend of Emin Agalarov, a Russian pop star who was a client of Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who had arranged the meeting, and possibly of Velenitskaya's, NBC said. Futerfas said he had talked with the individual who came to the meeting with Veselnitskaya:  He is a U.S. citizen. He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question.” Futerfas told NBC that, “for the purpose of security or otherwise, the names were reviewed” but said Trump Jr. knew nothing about the man's background at the time of the meeting. When asked by NBC about whether he had concerns, knowing what he knows now, Futerfas said: “I have absolutely no concerns about what was said in that meeting.” NBC said Veselnitskaya denied having any connection to the Kremlin and insisted the meeting was to discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia, not the presidential campaign. Accusations that Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated Trump's first months in office. Russia denies the allegations, and Trump says there was no collusion. U.S intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his son's meeting until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said:  In fact, maybe (the meeting) was mentioned at some point,  adding he was not told it was about Clinton. The Republican president drew criticism last week from Democrats who accused him of not pressing Russian President Vladimir Putin hard enough at a meeting they held in Germany over Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 campaign. Trump said in comments released by the White House on Thursday that he would invite Putin to the White House but added that now was not the right time for that.

The pilgrimage draws 2-4 million Muslims every year, including 1.5-2 million foreigners, raising the risk from diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus and meningococcal disease as well as cholera, the WHO said.  The current highly spreading outbreak of cholera in Yemen, as well as in some African countries, may represent a serious risk to all pilgrims during the (haj) days and even after returning to their countries,  a WHO bulletin said. Dominique Legros, a WHO cholera expert, said Saudi Arabia had not had a cholera outbreak in many years thanks to reinforced surveillance and rapid tests to detect cases early.  Don’t forget that today we are speaking of Yemen but they are receiving pilgrims from a lot of endemic countries, and they managed not to have an outbreak, essentially by making sure that living conditions, access to water in particular, hygienic conditions, are in place,  he told a regular U.N. briefing.  They are well-prepared in my view.      The incubation period of the disease, which spreads through ingestion of faecal matter and causes acute watery diarrhoea, is a matter of hours. Once symptoms start, cholera can kill within hours if the patient does not get treatment.  But people with symptoms are just the tip of the iceberg because 80 percent of patients show no symptoms, Legros said.  That’s why we advise countries against airport screening for patients. The Saudis don’t do that. It's useless, technically speaking.  The United Nations has blamed the warring sides in Yemen and their international allies, including Saudi Arabia, for fuelling the 11-week cholera outbreak, driving millions of people closer to famine, and for hindering aid access. The WHO has rolled out an emergency treatment programme, based on the vestiges of Yemen's shattered health system, to try and catch new cases early and stop the explosive spread of the disease. The number of new cases has continued to grow by about 6,000 per day, but the number of deaths appears to have slowed dramatically, according to Reuters analysis of WHO data. Death rates have slumped from 20-40 in recent weeks to an average of nine per day over the past six days.

Yields, which move inversely to prices, on the benchmark 10-year note, including those on the 3-year and 7-year notes fell to two-week lows. U.S. two-year note yields, the tenor most sensitive to rate hike expectations, tumbled to three-week lows. U.S. inflation was unchanged in June, following a 0.1 percent dip in May. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up just 0.1 percent in June. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May. U.S. retail sales also underperformed, falling for a second month in June. Retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month.  This data does put into question a rate hike in December,  said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York.  I have been saying this: inflation isn't around. The only inflation I see is in college education.  The rate futures market saw a 47 percent chance the Federal Reserve would raise key overnight borrowing costs by at least a quarter point at its Dec. 12-13 meeting, down from about 55 percent at Thursday's close, according to the CME Group's FedWatch. The U.S. consumer sentiment index also took a dip this month, with a 93.1 reading, from the previous month's 95.1, highlighting the overall bearish tone of Friday's U.S. data. In mid-morning trading, U.S. 10-year yield fell to 2.303 percent, from 2.348 percent late on Thursday. It earlier fell to 2.279 percent, its lowest since June 30. U.S. two-year yields slid as well, down to 1.339 percent , from Thursday's 1.367 percent, after sliding to a three-week trough of 1.323 percent. The yield gap between shorter-dated and longer-dated Treasuries shrank on Friday after the data, with the spread between 2-year and 10-year yields at 95.7 basis points, its flattest level in more than a week. A flat yield curve suggests investors are buying long-dated securities because there is no fear of inflation.

The rules were already changed in 2005 to remove a two-term limit that allowed Museveni, now 72 and in his fifth term, to stay on. Under the current constitution, he would be too old to run in the next election, due in 2021. Mwesigwa Rukutana, Uganda's deputy attorney general, said the cabinet was examining several possible changes to the constitution and that the age limit was one of them. The proposals will be put to parliament.  If anybody has been serving very well and the population thinks he still has a lot to contribute he should not be precluded from doing so merely because he has clocked 75 (years),  he told Reuters.   There are so many people who like that (age limit) amendment ... as long  as people are voting, age of the candidate doesn't matter,  Rukutana said. FILE PHOTO: Uganda's incumbent President Yoweri Museveni displays his inked finger after casting his vote at a polling station during the presidential elections in Kirihura in western Uganda, February 18, 2016.James Akena/File PhotoMuseveni, president since 1986, has not publicly stated he intends to run for another term but many Ugandans assume the move to lift the 75-year age limit is to let him do so.  He is already one of the longest-serving leaders in a continent where many presidents have changed their constitutions to hold on to power beyond what was initially envisaged. Rukutana denied the proposal was being crafted to benefit Museveni, and declined to say when the government planned to present its proposals. Museveni's spokesman, Don Wanyama, declined to say if the president would seek another term, calling such talk  speculation . Museveni's critics accuse him of using security forces and the judiciary to stifle opposition and say government officials are rarely punished for widespread corruption.

The warning, delivered by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, reflects rising frustration in Moscow over the Trump administration's refusal to hand back two Russian diplomatic compounds which were seized at the same time as some of Russia's diplomats were sent home last year. Barack Obama, U.S. president at the time, ordered the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies in December, along with the seizure of the two diplomatic compounds, over what he said was the hacking of U.S. political groups during the 2016 presidential election, something Russia has flatly denied. President Vladimir Putin decided not to retaliate immediately at the time, saying he would wait to see what the new administration of Donald Trump would do.  Zakharova complained on Friday that U.S. officials were not issuing visas to Russian diplomats to allow Moscow to replace the expelled employees and get its embassy back up to full strength. Related CoverageKremlin wants U.S. to return seized Russian compounds without strings We have a way of responding,  she told a news briefing.  The number of staff at the U.S. embassy in Moscow exceeds the number of our embassy employees in Washington by a big margin. One of our options, apart from a tit-for-tat expulsion of Americans, would be to even out the numbers.  If there was no movement in the U.S.-Russia dispute soon, she said Moscow would have to reluctantly retaliate and suggested U.S. spies working in Russia would be among those to be expelled.   There are too many employees of the CIA and the Pentagon's espionage unit working under the roof of the American diplomatic mission whose activity does not correspond at all with their status,  said Zakharova.

Separately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had not yet taken any decision on retaliation. He said Russia rejected the idea of linking the dispute to other issues. Peskov was responding to comments made to CNN by Sebastian Gorka, a Trump adviser, that appeared to link the compounds' return to Russia's behavior in Syria. Zakharova said time for Washington to act  was running out.        We don't want to resort to extreme measures.

Chris Martin, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker said the recall would include 1.15 million Honda Accord vehicles from the 2013-2016 model years in the United States, and nearly 1 million elsewhere, to replace a 12-volt battery sensor. The company said it had received four reports of engine compartment fires in the United States and at least one in Canada, in areas that use significant amounts of road salt during the winter. There have been no reported injuries. The automaker has received 3,972 U.S. warranty claims relating to the issue. The battery sensors may not be sufficiently sealed against moisture intrusion, Honda said. Over time, moisture may introduce road salt or other material into the battery sensor, leading to rust and eventual electrical shorting of the sensor. Due to the large size of the recall, Honda said dealers would initially adopt a temporary fix by applying an adhesive to prevent moisture intrusion, and then later replace the sensor.   The company first received a claim of an engine compartment fire from Canada in 2015 and began investigating the issue. In early 2016, it received a claim of a similar fire in China. Honda introduced a redesigned battery sensor in June 2016. After an investigation of the China incident, the automaker said it initially believed the  future occurrence rate was estimated to be low,  but continued to probe the matter after receiving additional reports of fires.

The market is on a recovery track due to rising global demand, Kuwait's OPEC governor Haitham Al-Ghais told Reuters. In an effort to eradicate a supply glut, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much. But oil prices have fallen more than 15 percent this year due to still-booming supplies and stubbornly high global stocks, which remain way above OPEC targets despite the cut agreement. A ministerial committee from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, which is headed by Gulf OPEC member Kuwait, meets in Russia on July 24 to discuss compliance with the cuts, from which Nigeria and Libya are exempt due to years of output-sapping unrest.  All this talk about putting a production cap on Libya and Nigeria is premature,  Al-Ghais said.  Data so far is showing that the real spike in production only happened in June.   The official added that output had increased on average by between 300,000 and 500,000 bpd from the two countries combined since the start of the supply-cutting agreement in January 2017. He said representatives from Libya and Nigeria had been invited to a technical OPEC/non-OPEC committee meeting on July 22 ahead of the ministerial gathering, to give presentations on production from both countries.  We have to look at the sustainability and stability of production from those countries,  said Al-Ghais, who also heads the technical committee.  We need to wait and see more production data before we can make any decision.  The technical committee could make recommendations on Nigeria and Libya, which the ministerial committee would then review. The latter cannot take production decisions but can make recommendations to OPEC and other participating producers, which are scheduled to meet formally in November. Al-Ghais said that despite production increases from Libya and Nigeria, there were signs of market rebalancing including U.S. government data showing a large drop in stockpiles.  We feel that the market is on the right way of correcting itself,  he said.  Demand will pick up and we expect to see stronger demand in the third quarter.

Competing in strong winds tests every facet of a player's game, Chamblee told Reuters, while the hard bounce of Open courses allows shorter hitters a better chance than on some of the longer, softer layouts at the American majors. Royal Birkdale, where the 146th version of the championship starts next Thursday, is perhaps the fairest test on the Open rota, however, one that has never produced a lucky winner.  It has the flattest fairways of any of the Open courses,   Chamblee, who will be part of Golf Channel’s team for its 'Live from the Open' show from England, said.  It's fair and you don’t hear any rumblings from the players. In general, Open championship golf demands the most out of players. You’ve got to be able to work the ball left-right, right-left, up, down, cope with cross-winds.  That’s why Sergio Garcia has had his most consistent major there. He works it easily (both ways).  Like most links courses, wind is the best defense for Birkdale, a par-70 measuring 7,156-yards which Chamblee says is  long enough  to offer a decent test, although in an ideal world he would like all championship courses stretched much longer. Questions hang over some of the big names heading to Birkdale. American Brooks Koepka has not played since winning the U.S. Open four weeks ago, and neither has world number one Dustin Johnson.  I can’t wait to see Koepka come back,” said Chamblee. “What does he do for an encore? “I hope Dustin has found his equilibrium after the birth of his child and injury at the Masters.” Chamblee, though, thinks Spaniard Jon Rahm is the nominal favorite, a player with all the makings of greatness, while also expecting big things out of American Rickie Fowler and Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy.

Shares of JPMorgan Citigroup and Wells Fargo , which have run up in the past few weeks, were lower as their earnings reports failed to excite investors. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will report results next week.  Companies that miss or just meet expectations or if they don't give post strong forecasts, will be punished by investors,  said  J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.  While the economy is growing, there is still some room to run. People are waiting to hear from CEOs to see if they're optimistic for the rest of the year. Given where valuations are right now, some sell off in the market won't be bad in the short term.  The financial index fell 1.15 percent and was the only laggard among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier, with financials projected to have had the third-best profit growth among sectors, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.98 points, or 0.05 percent, at 21,563.07, the S&P; 500 was up 3.63 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,451.46. The Nasdaq Composite was up 16.27 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,290.71. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the utilities index's 0.83 percent rise leading the advancers. Data showed that in the 12 months through June, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 1.7 percent from a year ago. Other data showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in June for a second straight month. Chances of a rate hike in December fell to 47 percent after the release of data points, from 55 percent at Thursday's close. Risk sentiment got a boost this week, with the Dow hitting another record close on Thursday, following dovish comments on interest rate hikes from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,767 to 792. On the Nasdaq, 1,192 issues rose and 1,123 fell.

The economy minister, Etienne Schneider, said on Friday that Luxembourg had become the first European country to offer a legal framework ensuring that private operators can be confident about their rights over resources extracted in space. The law will come into force on Aug. 1 and is based on the premise that space resources are capable of being owned. The country's law also establishes the procedures for authorizing and supervising space exploration missions.  Luxembourg is the first adopter in Europe of a legal and regulatory framework recognizing that space resources are capable of being owned by private companies,  Schneider said. Luxembourg in June 2016 set aside 200 million euros ($229 million) to fund initiatives aimed at bringing back rare minerals from space.  In February last year it announced plans to become the first state in Europe to give legal clarity to the commercial exploitation of asteroids. A similar package of laws was introduced in the United States in 2015. The draft legal framework forms a key part of the country's strategy to aggressively pursue and encourage economic opportunities and the development of new parts of the space industry, including mining, the statement said. Luxembourg has already managed to attract significant interest from pioneers in the field such as U.S. operators Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries and aims to attract research and development projects to set up there.

We hope to be able to say in the near future how much the royalties will amount to,  Moroney told Reuters. Licensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved guselkumab, which it will market as Tremfya, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. That brings Morphosys a step closer to seeing the first drug using its antibody technology launched on to the market, pushing its shares as much as 9 percent higher on Friday.  While it was largely expected, this approval marks a turning point in Morphosys' story as it prepares to receive its  first royalty stream,  Berenberg analysts, who recommend buying shares in Morphosys, said in a note. They see the drug taking 15 percent of the U.S. market for moderate to severe psoriasis at the expense of Janssen's existing Stelara, of Novartis's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's Taltz. Janssen said Tremfya, which is administered by injection, will be an alternative for patients who do not respond to existing treatments. Morphosys has so far not yet said how much Janssen would owe it in royalties, noting only that payments would likely come to a medium single-digit percentage of sales. Berenberg's analysts estimate that guselkumab could reach peak annual sales of about 3.2 billion euros ($3.65 billion) eventually, which would mean royalties of up to 185 million. Morphosys' stock rose about 9 percent in early trade on Friday and were up 6 percent at 66.29 euros by 1350 GMT, having hit its highest level in almost two years. According to CEO Moroney, royalties are not yet included in Morphosys 2017 guidance. The group has so far said it expected its loss before interest and tax to widen to between 75 million and 85 million euros this year from about 60 million in 2016 as its costs for research and development rise. Morphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer. The company is due to publish second-quarter financial results on Aug. 3.

Tsai said on Thursday that the self-ruled island hoped China could show self-confidence and promote political reform, after the dissident Liu died of cancer.  Only through democracy, in which every Chinese person has freedom and respect, can China truly become a proud and important country,  she said. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying that such  reckless  comments were  very dangerous  for cross-strait relations.   Liu, who died aged 61, was sentenced to 11 years jail in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms.

Liu Xiaobo, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and was allowed to visit him in prison about once a month.  Liu Xiaobo died on Thursday after suffering multiple organ failure. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Liu Xia was at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated over the past couple of weeks. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and also called for authorities to grant his wife and the rest of his family freedom of movement. China responded by lodging  stern representations  with countries that made remarks about Liu Xiaobo, including the United States, expressing its firm opposition, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing. China also lambasted Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen for her comments on Liu and her calls for China to embrace democracy, saying her behavior was  very dangerous . Geng said he had no information about Liu Xia, but added that the entry and exit of Chinese citizens would be handled in accordance with the law.  Let's not make any prejudgments here,  he responded, when pressed on whether Liu Xia was allowed to leave the country. He did not elaborate. Mo Shaoping, Liu Xiaobo's lawyer, said there was no legal reason for China to prevent Liu Xia from leaving the country.

In an interview, Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she shared the compassion of people over Liu's death. Hu Jia, a fellow dissident and family friend, said:  Now, we are most concerned about Liu Xia, but there has been no information about her.   All the willpower and force we put behind freeing Liu Xiaobo, we have turned to Liu Xia,  he said. Efforts should also focus on Liu Hui, the younger brother of Liu Xia, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2013 for fraud and to whom Liu Xia is very close, Hu added.  Several other friends said they were unable to reach Liu Xia, who suffers from depression, or confirm her whereabouts.

Diplomatic sources also said that, before her husband's hospitalization, Liu Xia had expressed a wish to go to Germany, in telephone calls with the German embassy. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, said it was  deeply worried  about Liu Xia's situation. Its leader, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said the Chinese embassy in Oslo had declined to receive her visa application for travel so she could attend Liu's funeral.   I was told that my visa application was incorrectly filled in ... because I did not have an invitation from the person I was visiting,  Reiss-Andersen told Reuters. Slideshow (8 Images)The Shenyang justice department released a video clip of Liu Xiaobo's treatment, emphasizing that his family had a history of liver cancer and that family members were involved in the treatment process and informed of developments. Funeral Arrangements Friends have begun calling to be allowed to join in Liu Xiaobo's funeral arrangements and support his wife and family. More than 150 friends and supporters have signed an open letter announcing plans for an  online memorial  to Liu, urging authorities to release his body and allow a public funeral.   We will pay close attention to how Liu Xiaobo's funeral will be arranged,  said Shanghai-based writer Wen Kejian, another friend of the family.  We, at the very least, hope to have the opportunity to go to Shenyang or Beijing to send him off.   Liu's remains were taken to Shenyang's Xiheyuan funeral parlor, a source close to the family said, but a Reuters reporter was turned away on Friday. Shenyang authorities forced half-a-dozen supporters of Liu who went to pay their respects to leave, or detained them, said Beijing-based rights activist Li Yu, who is tracking the situation. News of Liu's death prompted an outpouring of grief online, with many liberals, lawyers, dissidents and journalists sharing articles and posting on messaging app WeChat. But censors were swift to act. An article titled,  Speaking of heroes, who is a hero?  from respected business publication Caixin was taken down after being shared by many of Liu Xiaobo's supporters, despite making no mention of him.  The deceased has gone, the feigned sorrow is really preposterous,  the state-backed Global Times tabloid said in a social media post that appeared to mock mourners.  We will just eat watermelon and watch for the night.  Ye Du, a writer and friend of Liu's, said he hoped people would be able to commemorate Liu Xiaobo, adding,  Liu Xia will surely be monitored and controlled .

At the root, they maintain, is the disappearance of pediatric community hospital care. The number of children transferred from one hospital to another increased by more than 36 percent in Massachusetts from 2004 to 2014, and only about 20 percent of the state’s 66 hospitals completed care for more than half of their pediatric patients without transferring them, the research team reports in JAMA Pediatrics.  “Pediatric hospital care is less available than it used to be, mostly because community hospitals are increasingly transferring children to larger centers,” said senior author Dr. Michael McManus, a pediatrician and professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Transfer can greatly improve care for some conditions,” he said in an email, “but can delay and potentially worsen care for others.” The research showed consolidation of care into regional centers for both adults and children over the decade studied. But the move to regional care for children far outpaced that for adults. The likelihood of a hospital completing a child’s care without a transfer dropped by 65 percent from 2004 to 2014, while the likelihood of a hospital completing an adult’s care without a transfer fell by 11 percent, the study found. Dr. Nicholas Mohr, a professor at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City, said doctors have seen the trend in hospitals throughout the U.S. But the number of children transferred between Massachusetts hospitals surprised him. “Fewer children are being cared for in community hospitals,” he said in a phone interview. “The big question is whether that’s good or bad.” “We don’t know what the outcome differences are. That’s the million-dollar question,” said Mohr, who was not involved in the study.  Altogether, the researchers analyzed more than 34 million emergency department as well as inpatient and observation admissions, using data from every acute-care hospital in Massachusetts for 10 years. Transfer from a hospital generally indicates that it lacked the capability to treat the patient, the authors write.  Although pediatric emergency department visits decreased nearly 3 percent and admissions fell 15 percent, pediatric transfers increased 36 percent over the 10 years, the study found. The findings could be interpreted to mean that children now get better medical care in more specialized sites. But many of the children moved from one hospital to another were treated for conditions as common as broken limbs, or asthma. Mohr said the consolidation of hospital care is a well-known factor for both adults and children these days. “At the same time we have hospitals in some parts of the country closing, tertiary care centers are bursting at the seams,” he said. “It’s striking that both of these things are happening at the same time.” “If quality of care is no better, then we’re looking at an unsupported practice that’s increasing cost and waste. The big glaring question is whether regionalized care is better,” he said. The new study can’t answer the question. A previous study showed that almost a quarter of American children were transferred from one hospital to another for minor conditions and then discharged directly home, while another 17 percent were released in less than 24 hours.  McManus is conducting additional research to explore the myriad of possible reasons for consolidation of pediatric hospital care. In the meantime, he said, his study’s findings illustrate “how pediatric systems of care are very different from adult systems and need to be considered separately in public health and health policy discussions.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uoA1tO JAMA Pediatrics, online July 10, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-children-emergencies-idUSKBN19Z1IX"},

Carillion, which had seen 70 percent wiped off its market value over the past four days, is reviewing  all options  after it booked a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown against customer payments it no longer expected to be able to collect. Analysts believe Carillion might have to raise at least 500 million pounds via a share sale or that a debt-for-equity swap could be on the cards to shore up the balance sheet. Its average net borrowing in the first half of the year rose to 695 million pounds from 586.5 million over 2016. Shares bounced 5.7 percent to 58.6 pence by 1330 GMT, valuing the company at only about 250 million pounds. Carillion shares have been in freefall following the profit warning and exit of its chief executive at the start of the week. Its bondholders have braced for  painful  talks as a pile-up of receivables and debt spooked investors. The news has caused a number of analysts to cut their rating on Carillion. The HSBC research team has not issued any target price or recommendation on the stock in the last 12 months. HSBC, which has been part of Carillion's banking group in the past, joins Morgan Stanley and Stifel as Carillion's existing corporate brokers and Lazard as its financial adviser. A source said HSBC would complement Carillion's existing advisor line up.  With (HSBC) having a long-standing relationship with Carillion, they're quite supportive at this time,   the source said. Carillion was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine. The company has worked on projects ranging from London's Tate Modern gallery to the Twickenham rugby stadium. HSBC was Carillion's joint bookrunner on its bond placing in 2014 and also adviser on its failed attempt to take over peer Balfour Beatty. The deal would have been Carillion's largest ever if it had been successful. HSBC was bookrunner on rights issues across Europe, Middle East and Africa which raised $1.78 billion in the first six months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. This helped its market share rise by 3.4 percent, bumping up its ranking to eighth from 24 last year. The bank, which re-launched its corporate broking in January 2013, has since been targetting more mandates. A spokeswoman for HSBC declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Trump,Eugene Kaspersky,Michael Daniel,Michael Flynn,Michael Hayden,Michael McCaul,Robert M. Lee,USA,KASPERSKYLAB/ (REPEAT,ANALYSIS,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(Reuters) - Eugene Kaspersky, the CEO of the Russian cybersecurity software firm that bears his name, had a big American dream. He wanted his company to go beyond selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the U.S. government - one of the world's biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools. Kaspersky set up a U.S. subsidiary, KGSS, in Arlington, Virginia that would be focused on winning that business. He sponsored flashy conferences with high-profile speakers -including Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump's national security adviser - sought to join U.S. trade groups and even underwrote programming on National Public Radio. All of this was done to burnish Kaspersky's image and help it become an accepted vendor for the U.S. government despite its Russian roots, according to people familiar with the strategy. But Eugene Kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among U.S. intelligence officials that he and his company were, or could become, pawns of Russia's spy agencies. Kaspersky  has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,  the company said. Kaspersky's American ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in U.S.-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, and later when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had hacked the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Testifying before the U.S. Congress in May, U.S. intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that Kaspersky products could be trusted. FBI agents last month interviewed Kaspersky employees, asking whether they reported to Russia-based executives and how much data from American customers could be seen by Russian employees, according to three current and former employees. The FBI declined to comment on Thursday. On Tuesday, the U.S. General Services Administration, the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy, removed Kaspersky from a list of approved vendors, saying GSA's mission was to ensure the security of U.S. government systems. There is also a bill before Congress that would explicitly bar the Defense Department from using any Kaspersky products. Kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons.  These reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition, slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys,” he said in a statement to Reuters. The Arlington offices of KGSS were empty when a Reuters reporter visited them on Thursday. A Kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff, which number less than 10, often work from home. The U.S. clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the Russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks. Two former employees and a person briefed on the FBI case told Reuters that Kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users' machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals, even when those files were not corrupted by viruses. “Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations,” the Kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email. Unusual Step It is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing.  This sets a really dangerous precedent  where other nations could make similar, unsubstantiated claims against U.S. vendors, said Robert M. Lee, a former cyberwarfare operative for U.S. intelligence and now CEO of cybersecurity startup Dragos. The Russian government has denounced the Kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures. Officials at U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Russia say they fear they could become targets. Federal contracting databases reviewed by Reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from Kaspersky, and an employee confirmed the company's federal government revenue was  miniscule.  But Kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third-party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, U.S. officials say. Founded in 1997, Kaspersky grew rapidly through the 2000s to become one of the world's leading anti-virus software companies. (Kaspersky's global reach: tmsnrt.rs/2uWTQoV) But the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the KGB. Eugene Kaspersky attended a KGB school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the FSB. As the company grew, Kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears.  We have to be more American than Americans,  Kaspersky told Reuters in 2013, when a U.S. goodwill offensive began.  Public Shaming  A cornerstone of the effort was a series of KGSS-hosted conferences in Washington where prominent U.S. officials including Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director, former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden and House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul discussed cybersecurity issues. The company privately courted U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation-state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm, according to people present at those meetings.  They came to us and said, 'We want to change our image, we know people don't trust us',  said one former senior Obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings. But the suspicions never subsided. When the company sought to join one Washington-based technology trade organization, it was  politely told it couldn’t happen,  according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter. The source said industry group officials had an inside joke:  Kaspersky (membership) is like having the Kremlin join.  Not coincidentally, Kaspersky's government sales effort never gained traction. In an email to Reuters, the company noted  complexities associated with doing business with North America’s government sector.  Privately held Kaspersky said its U.S. revenue, most of which comes from selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses, slipped from $164 million in 2014 to about $156 million in 2016. Some U.S. national security experts say Kaspersky is being treated unfairly. Lee said he has long been bothered by the  public shaming  of Kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence. The U.S. government has the right to choose not to use Kaspersky products for any reason, he said, but  the way they are doing it  is wrong.  I don’t believe in geographic restrictions that say, 'Because Kaspersky is a Russian-based company, therefore it is bad,'  said former White House cybersecurity policy coordinator Michael Daniel.  You would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior.

This owes more to European Central Bank sensitivities than market dynamics or economic drivers. Forward-looking pricing from the options market EURVOL= and investor positioning against the dollar are the strongest in years and show a head of steam building for a significant euro rally. Yet strategists plotting the currency's path over the coming year are far more cautious.  Of the 65 economists and bank strategists polled by Reuters recently, only one -- HSBC -- was prepared to predict the euro would reach $1.20 this year, just five percent higher than it is now, while the median in the poll was $1.13.  That contrasts starkly with the euro's surge to close to $1.15 since a speech two weeks ago by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that itself spurred an almost 2.5 percent jump. Many analysts say the disconnect is down to nerves over the ECB's reaction to any further strength.  They (the ECB) are sensitive to financial conditions and if it is just the currency going up by 2-3 percent then I don't think they have a problem,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with Millennium Global in London.  But above $1.20 that is clearly another story. If it coincides with European equity weakness and higher spreads to the periphery then that is a bigger issue.  The United States' convincing upturn since 2011 has benefited the dollar, weakened the euro and aided the euro zone's broader export-led bounce.  So how much currency appreciation the ECB will be willing to tolerate during a likely slow plod back to policy normality is now the biggest question facing forecasters. In trade-weighted terms the euro has gained 7.6 percent in the past 18 months and 3 percent in the past 12, but the surge in the last quarter alone is more than 4 percent, taking it to its highest since the launch of quantitative easing in early 2015.        State Street's European head of macro strategy Tim Graf says that figure is not worrying yet, but that a similar rise in the months ahead would raise the stakes.  If you look at any chart of REER (real effective exchange rate), it still looks super cheap. They probably are even happy with this bit of strength because it shows the economy is improving,  he said.   If it were to double, maybe they would have something to thing about.  Hawk Eyes At the heart of the market thinking is the concern which the ECB itself has signaled about the euro.  It took less than 24 hours for officials at the bank to step in and try to moderate Draghi's message on June 27 with background briefings; most analysts read that as a response to the scale of the surge of the euro.  Although the ECB has no exchange rate target, sources close to discussions say that board members closely watch market developments, particularly during periods of turmoil, like Draghi’s speech.  In 2014 Draghi said that every 10 percent of gains for the currency was liable to knock 0.4-0.5 percentage points off headline inflation.  His language on the impact when the euro was falling dramatically in 2015 was more vague and ECB staff projections currently provide for an alternative scenario where the euro is weaker over the next two years, not stronger.  While any big euro firming is watched with concern, the sources also say that policymakers are focused more on bond yields than the currency, viewing the bank’s asset purchase program as the key policy transmission tool and worried any blowout in yields could unravel its work.  Executive Board member Benoit Coeure recently argued that currency depreciation during the early phase of the bank’s 2.3 trillion euro asset buying scheme was a side-effect and not the objective.  Far from 'beggaring its neighbors', monetary policy easing by the ECB has added to global demand and thereby stabilized the global economy, in particular after the euro area had been a major drag on global growth for many years,  Coeure said.  It is just that markets don't quite believe it.   It is an issue for the ECB. In the past when the euro was where it is today, we have seen them intervening to talk the currency down,  said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.  It is above what they are assuming in their inflation forecast. If you are at $1.20 you at an equilibrium which is supposed to happen when policy has been normalized. So taking the business cycle into account, the euro would be overvalued at $1.20.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ EURO-DOLLAR POLL    reut.rs/2tQ60S0 Euro Trade Weighted Index (ECB)    reut.rs/2tmCXSV ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi in FRANKFURT and Ritvik Carvalho in LONDON  Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-markets-euro-idUSKBN19Z1IJ"},

Altice Chief Executive Michel Combes, speaking on Friday after the 440 million euro ($502 million) deal to buy Media Capital from Spain's Prisa was announced, said his firm wanted to grow its digital platforms and content. The Media Capital purchase has raised expectations of further acquisitions in Portugal's media sector, prompting a 14 percent jump in the shares of Impresa, which owns SIC television channel. Analysts say PT's main rivals NOS and Vodafone Portugal might now try to buy Impresa and its rival Cofina , owner of CMTV. Cofina shares were up around 2 percent. The Media Capital deal still needs approvals by regulators in Portugal. But Combes said he expected that to run smoothly. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa has criticised the sale of PT, the former state telecoms monopoly, and has said he was concerned Altice would break up the firm, leading to layoffs in a nation with a jobless rate of about 10 percent. Altice, founded and controlled by Franco-Israeli tycoon Patrick Drahi, bought PT in 2015. Combes did not comment directly on the prime minister's concerns but when asked about plans for PT and Media Capital, he said:  We are not laying off people at PT ... We have no intention to lay off workers at Media Capital. It's all about growing business, that's where we are going to concentrate our efforts,  he told a joint news conference with PT CEO Paulo Neves. The firm wants Media Capital to launch new television channels and export content like soap operas mainly to France and the United States. This is part of Altice's global strategy that is being implemented in those two countries and in Israel.  We have presented a strong industrial project for (Portugal),  Combes said, adding that this involved expanding the company's Portuguese digital business. Altice stocks were little changed.

Starting with the major U.S. firms over the next two weeks, followed by Asia and Europe through July and early August, investors will get a peek into how much companies are benefiting from the upturn in global economic activity. After some blistering Q1 numbers expectations are high. It is the first time since 2010 that earnings forecasts globally, which usually tend to be upbeat at the start of the year and then slowly get trimmed, are not seeing downgrades.  For a graphic on global earnings growth click reut.rs/2upAeNv 2/ Banking on the Banks In the United States a lot is riding on the banks, and how their stocks react to numbers over the coming week could set the tone for the rest of the earnings season and the year. U.S. financial stocks have enjoyed a tailwind from announcements of stock buybacks, dividend increases and rising global bond yields, and their prices have been breaking to new highs on the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund. The 2/10 yield spread has also begun to increase, an aid to bank earnings. The sector still trades at a valuation discount to the 10-year average. However, the sector has lagged the broader market and investors are bracing for a rocky second half of 2017. JPMorgan's Q2 number were not received particularly well as trading volumes fell. Recent high frequency economic data suggests a guide down to both domestic economic growth and profit expectations during the next few months. And given the controversy over Donald Trump Jr’s emails, the Trump administration’s initiatives toward reviving economic growth may now be dead on arrival. Hedge funds and other institutional investors are reversing their bets and shorting some financials and banks, based on slowing global economic growth and a flattening yield curve.     For a graphic on U.S. bank stocks YTD click reut.rs/2uq36VK 3/ Sneezing Panda They say that when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. But what if China feels a bit feverish? The world’s second largest economy is expected to post robust second quarter growth on Monday, but its outlook for the rest of the year looks less rosy after moves to cool the property market and curb shadow banking. Earlier this week, China’s total social financing (TSF) showed a rise in June - so all good. If TSF falls from now on matters not only for China, but for the rest of the world as it is closely correlated with U.S. manufacturing.

While absolute price-to-earnings valuations across most major indices are above averages, the yield on offer in relation to bonds is still a draw. In the week to Wednesday, money flowed out of bonds for the 17th straight week, while equities drew inflows for the fifth straight week.

The investment bank says the last leg of the ongoing rally -- which it dubs the  Icarus trade  -- will only exacerbate inequality, forcing central banks to pop the bubble later this year.

Italian banks are under regulatory pressure to cut NPL ratios which, for the industry as a whole, are more than three times the European average of around 5 percent.

But the state had to step in to recapitalise Italy's fourth-largest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena and help it absorb the hit from a bad loan sale enforced by the European Central Bank. Creval said the sale took 1.2 percentage points off its best-quality capital. At 11 percent, however, the CET 1 ratio is still well above a regulatory minimum of 7.75 percent, it added. Broker Equita said the loss linked to the disposal was lower than it had expected and raised its target price on the stock by 15 percent. The bank is studying further asset sales to improve its capital buffer. Creval is selling the bad loans repackaged as securities. An institutional investor has bought the riskier tranches worth a combined 62.5 million euros in nominal terms, Creval said, without disclosing the actual selling price or the identity of the investor. The bank will tap a state guarantee scheme on a 464 million euro tranche that it could either sell or keep on its books.

Although the mining season does not begin until autumn, when the ground freezes and work is safer, the 31-year-old and his colleagues are seeking to gain a head start by digging a shaft in Nalaikh, one of the nine districts of Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar, in late June.  But their mine could soon be shut by the government, which has launched an unprecedented crackdown on sites that don't meet safety standards.  That would mean even fewer opportunities for Mongolia's individual prospectors, who have already been hit hard by the privatization of mines previously open to all. Miners such as Uuganbaatar dig for coal under loose arrangements with local unions and private companies.   Things seem really tough for private miners now,  said Uuganbaatar, who, like many Mongolians, goes by one name.   All the licenses have been bought up by influential big shots. Whenever you start to dig somewhere, someone shows up and chases us away. It's impossible to find a place or mine to dig in.   A weak economy and particularly harsh winters drove herdsman from across Mongolia to Nalaikh's private mines in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Uuganbaatar works on extracting coal from a primitive mine in Nalaikh, one of the nine districts of Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia June 29, 2017.B. RentsendorjThe district, with a population of nearly 30,000, was home to Mongolia's first state mining company, which collapsed in the 1990s in the midst of a post-communist economic crisis. The firm's dilapidated buildings dot the landscape.  With the economy slowing again after a commodities boom earlier in the decade, authorities fear more people could be tempted down the mines.   More mines will probably be shut down,  said Byambadorj, a woman who ran two private mine shafts with her husband for 13 years until the government closed them in June.  Slideshow (2 Images) In Nalaikh, life revolves around mining, and mining is the main means to support our lives,  she says, insisting that her mines were operating according to the safety standards.  The government had tried to get companies to improve safety by issuing licenses. An official said nine companies had been granted licenses, but not all had met the standards.      People were working in shafts with no air supply,  said S. Battulga, an official whose department is responsible for reviewing mining licenses across the country.   Therefore it was requested that the private mining licenses in Nalaikh be canceled,  on health and safety grounds, he added. Nalaikh authorities would like people to switch from mining to work in brick factories but no one seems keen to switch despite the danger. In the past 25 years, the government has recorded 234 fatalities in Nalaikh's coal mines, although residents say the real number is hundreds higher.

Bertelsmann announced it intends to increase its stake in PRH by acquiring a further 22% from current owner Pearson and undertake a capital increase at PRH. Together this is expected to amount to around EUR850 million (USD968 million). The transaction will take Bertelsmann's ownership of PRH to 75% from 53% with Pearson retaining a 25% holding. The move is broadly in line with Fitch's expectations (see  Fitch: No Rating Impact on Bertelsmann from Stake Increase in PRH  dated January 2017) and will not impact Bertelsmann's rating due to the company's strong retained free cash flow, reduced dividend leakage and leverage headroom. The transaction gives Bertelsmann greater control over a key part of its operations by virtue of its enlarged stake and new ability to appoint PRH's Chairman. PRH accounted for 20% of group revenues in 2016 and is a global leader in book publishing. The transaction also introduces a simpler agreement between Bertelsmann and Pearson, replacing a more complex agreement that existed under the previous ownership structure. Under the new agreement Pearson no longer has a right to IPO its remaining shareholding while Bertelsmann has retained a right of first offer for Pearson's remaining stake. Fitch also assumes that as part of the new agreement, Pearson has lost its previous right to increase PRH's net debt to EBITDA to 3.5x. In addition to the increased stake, Pearson and Bertelsmann have agreed to recapitalise PRH through exceptional dividend payments that will raise leverage in two steps at the unit to 2.0x net debt to EBITDA. The first step will increase leverage in 2017 to 1.5x and the second step (to be executed in April 2018) will add a further 0.5x. Following its bond issuance in May 2017, Bertelsmann has sufficient liquidity to fund a substantive portion of the stake increase and recapitalisation through existing cash resources. Fitch expects Bertelsmann's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to increase by around 0.1x to 0.2x in 2017 and 2018 as a result of the transaction. Upon successful completion, FFO adjusted net leverage should be 2.3x at the end of 2018. Bertelsmann generates around EUR600 million to EUR700 million of post dividend free cash flow per year that provides significant financial flexibility to fund inorganic expansion. At the same time, the increase in the stake reduces dividend leakage to minorities, which has a positive impact on FFO. In 2016, dividends paid to Pearson for its 47% stake in PRH was EUR149 million. Fitch has treated cash flow in relation to the dividend capitalisations as exceptional in nature and consequently these do not impact Bertelsmann's FFO.

The billboards and full-page media ads that have appeared across Hungary depict a smiling Soros -- a vocal critic of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government -- with the caption:  Don't let Soros have the last laugh.  Some Soros billboards have been defaced with graffiti that reads  stinking Jew .  The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz) has urged Orban to halt the campaign, which a spokesman for Soros said earlier this week was reminiscent of  Europe's darkest hours . Orban's government has strongly denied that the billboard campaign is anti-Semitic. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told Reuters the campaign, which was a follow-up to the launch by Orban of a  national consultation  on issues of foreign influence and mass immigration, would expire on July 15.  The six-week follow-up campaign will run out on July 15,  Kovacs said in an emailed reply to Reuters questions. Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary's right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration. Kovacs said the campaign's end-date had nothing to do with the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Budapest next week. He declined to say how much the massive billboard campaign had cost.  Orban will seek a third consecutive term at elections in April 2018.   Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen at an underground stop in Budapest, Hungary July 11, 2017.Laszlo BaloghHe launched the poster campaign portraying Soros as an enemy of Hungary after voters who responded to the government's  national consultation  rejected both  foreign influence  and mass immigration.  Israel's ambassador to Hungary initially denounced the campaign, saying it  evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear , an apparent reference to Hungary's part in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust. But the Israeli foreign ministry later issued a  clarification  saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism, a move that appeared designed to align Israel more closely with Hungary ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Budapest.  Slideshow (2 Images)Israel is normally quick to denounce anti-Semitism or threats to Jewish communities anywhere in the world. While it made that point in the statement, it chose to focus on the threat it believes Soros poses to Israeli democracy. Among the organizations Soros funds is Human Rights Watch, which is frequently critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians.  Soros, 86, who emigrated from Hungary after World War Two, made his fortune in the United States and has long supported groups promoting liberal, democratic and open-border values in eastern Europe. Orban has long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, though he has more recently risked angering Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far-right voters. In a statement on Thursday, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan expressed deep concern about the poster campaign, which he said played on  xenophobic sentiments . Noting the thousands of Hungarians who emigrated after the 1956 revolution, Annan said he hoped Hungary would  find a way out of its current isolation and back to the values enshrined in the U.N. refugee convention and U.N. charter for human rights .   Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-soros-idUSKBN19Y0UQ"},

Popular was taken over by Santander on June 7 for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. The lender estimated the maximum cost of its initiative at 680 million euros ($775 million) and said its plan would have no impact on the group's earnings nor additional capital impact. As part of its acquisition, Santander has launched a 7.1 billion euro rights issue. Santander said that it had taken the decision given the  exceptional circumstances  and also for commercial reasons and to foster customer loyalty. As part of the initiative, Santander said it was planning to issue up to 980 million euros nominal value of perpetual bonds. Santander did not detail how many shareholders would be affected by its offer. A source with knowledge of the offer said more than 110,000 retail investors of Popular could benefit, around a third of its minority stakeholders. Some retail investors and junior bond investors, affected by Popular's rescue, have already begun filing lawsuits to determine who was responsible. FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a Banco Popular and Santander banks offices in Barcelona, Spain June 7, 2017.Albert Gea/File PhotoSpanish and European authorities said that Popular needed to be rescued due its weak liquidity situation after a bank run. In order to benefit from the offer, customers would be required to waive the right to pursue legal actions against Santander, the lender said. Santander said that the plan excluded institutional investors and was directed at retail clients who acquired shares from May 26 to June 21 of 2016, during the period of Banco Popular's last capital increase of around 2.5 billion euros. It would also include retail clients who acquired subordinated obligations computable as Tier 2 of the July 29, 2011 and Oct. 14, 2011 issues of Popular. In both cases, the plan would apply to customers who had their investments deposited in any of the retail networks of the Popular or Santander at the time of the resolution. Santander said that those who invested up to 100,000 euros would receive the total amount of the investment, which was the case of 99 percent of Popular clients and employees who bought shares during Popular's capital rights issue in 2016. Members of the board of directors of Popular and major shareholders would be excluded from this plan, Santander said. Banco Santander said it would register shortly a prospectus of the detailed bond offer with Spain's stock market regulator.

The June 18 letter addressed to the head of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is the most cohesive pushback yet from the industry against ambitious targets for so-called new energy vehicles in the world's biggest auto market. Keen to combat air pollution, China is planning to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025, with a staggered system of quotas beginning in 2018.  Beijing also sees the policy as a means to help the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines. The strict new rules plus planned harsh penalties for non-compliance, such as the cancellation of licenses to sell non- electric cars in China, has the potential to cause much pain for some automakers in the market.  This will hit the industry pretty hard, especially well-known companies,  said Liping Kang, senior manager at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, a Beijing-based think tank. Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last month that concessions would be made, the ministry later released draft regulations upholding the strict sales quotas.  The proposed rules' ambitious enforcement date is not possible to meet,  the letter from U.S., European, Japanese and Korean auto industry bodies said.   At a minimum, the mandate needs to be delayed a year and include additional flexibilities.   The ministry declined to comment.

Equal Treatment The auto industry bodies also asked for China to reconsider some of the penalties for not achieving the quotas, such as plans to ban carmakers from importing and producing non-new energy vehicles altogether. FILE PHOTO - A sign is pictured on an electric car charging station at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland June 2, 2017.Denis BalibouseThey also called for equal treatment of Chinese and foreign makers. Currently foreign carmakers are excluded from getting full subsidies for new energy vehicles and batteries, leaving manufacturers such as Tesla (TSLA.O) at a disadvantage.   This preference for domestic automakers over import automakers undermines the environmental goals of the regulation, puts imports at a competitive disadvantage, and risks opening China up to international trade disputes,  the letter said. Chinese manufacturers are the biggest producers of electric vehicles worldwide, making 43 percent of the total last year, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co. The letter was signed by the American Automotive Policy Council, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association. European carmakers such as Daimler (DAIGn.DE) have responded to the Chinese proposals by announcing plans to ramp up local production of electric cars, while Tesla has said it is in talks with the Shanghai Municipal government to try to avoid a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles. Foreign manufacturers also want more credit given to plug-in hybrid cars, and for carmakers to be allowed to  bank  credits accrued from already sold cars as well as to  carry forward  credits into subsequent model years. The letter was first reported by Germany's WirtschaftsWoche magazine.

Starting with the major U.S. firms over the next two weeks, followed by Asia and Europe through July and early August, investors will get a peek into how much companies are benefiting from the upturn in global economic activity. After some blistering Q1 numbers expectations are high. It is the first time since 2010 that earnings forecasts globally, which usually tend to be upbeat at the start of the year and then slowly get trimmed, are not seeing downgrades.  For a graphic on global earnings growth click reut.rs/2upAeNv 2/ Banking on the Banks In the United States a lot is riding on the banks, and how their stocks react to numbers over the coming week could set the tone for the rest of the earnings season and the year. U.S. financial stocks have enjoyed a tailwind from announcements of stock buybacks, dividend increases and rising global bond yields, and their prices have been breaking to new highs on the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund. The 2/10 yield spread has also begun to increase, an aid to bank earnings. The sector still trades at a valuation discount to the 10-year average. However, the sector has lagged the broader market and investors are bracing for a rocky second half of 2017. JPMorgan's Q2 number were not received particularly well as trading volumes fell. Recent high frequency economic data suggests a guide down to both domestic economic growth and profit expectations during the next few months. And given the controversy over Donald Trump Jr’s emails, the Trump administration’s initiatives toward reviving economic growth may now be dead on arrival. Hedge funds and other institutional investors are reversing their bets and shorting some financials and banks, based on slowing global economic growth and a flattening yield curve.     For a graphic on U.S. bank stocks YTD click reut.rs/2uq36VK 3/ Sneezing Panda They say that when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. But what if China feels a bit feverish? The world’s second largest economy is expected to post robust second quarter growth on Monday, but its outlook for the rest of the year looks less rosy after moves to cool the property market and curb shadow banking. Earlier this week, China’s total social financing (TSF) showed a rise in June - so all good. If TSF falls from now on matters not only for China, but for the rest of the world as it is closely correlated with U.S. manufacturing. For a graphic on China TSF VS ISM click reut.rs/2tPsEKp 4/to Yield or Not to Yield High valuations, central banks turning hawkish and uncertainties around Brexit or U.S. politics have done little to ruffle one of the longest bull markets in history, despite some short-lived stumbles. While absolute price-to-earnings valuations across most major indices are above averages, the yield on offer in relation to bonds is still a draw. In the week to Wednesday, money flowed out of bonds for the 17th straight week, while equities drew inflows for the fifth straight week. For a graphic on stocks versus bonds click reut.rs/2tQlVQB 5/the Icarus Trade and Inequality How many hours does the average private sector employee in the United States have to work to buy one unit of the S&P; 500? More than 110 hours, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch says, the highest ever. The investment bank says the last leg of the ongoing rally -- which it dubs the  Icarus trade  -- will only exacerbate inequality, forcing central banks to pop the bubble later this year. Or wage growth needs to pick up from the stubbornly sluggish levels it is currently stuck at across most developed countries.

The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 1.2 basis points to a spread of -14.4 basis points, its narrowest since Aug. 18.     The narrower spread comes after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in seven years.     The central bank will follow up with another increase in October as it charts a course of gradual policy tightening, with two more hikes expected next year, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers.                      Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed and were on track for solid weekly gains following positive demand signals, production issues in Nigeria and a reported decline in inventory.                  U.S. crude        prices were up 0.43 percent to $46.28 a barrel.     At 9:10 a.m. ET (1310 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2715 to the greenback, or 78.65 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2693 to C$1.2747. It touched on Wednesday its strongest in nearly 13 months at C$1.2681.     The U.S. dollar        fell against a basket of major currencies after data showed U.S. inflation in June was unchanged from the previous month and retail sales unexpectedly weakened, fueling doubts about an interest rate increase later this year.                   Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            rose 5 Canadian cents to yield 1.183 percent and the 10-year             climbed 40 Canadian cents to yield 1.863 percent.     On Thursday, the 2-year yield touched its highest since September 2013 at 1.257 percent.

The Italian-American automaker said it is recalling about 770,000 sport utility vehicles because of a wiring issue that may lead to inadvertent deployment of the driver-side air bag and is linked to reports of five related minor injuries, but no crashes. The company said wiring could chafe against pieces of steering-wheel trim, potentially causing a short-circuit and ultimately leading to an inadvertent air bag deployment. The issue could also cause unintended windshield wiper operation or inoperable switches. The recall covers 538,000 2011-2015 Dodge Journey vehicles in North America and 233,000 2011-2015 Fiat Freemont crossovers sold elsewhere. Dealers will inspect and replace the wiring, as needed and equip it with additional protective covering.

The company said hot ambient temperatures could lead to premature diode wear, may result in a burning odor or smoke, could impact the anti-lock braking system or lead to engine stalls. The company said it is aware of two potentially related accidents but no injuries. The recall covers 2011-2014 model year Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger cars and Dodge Durango SUVs and 2012-2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs. In October, Fiat Chrysler recalled about 86,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks, 3500, 4500 and 5500 chassis cabs from the 2007-2013 model years and 2011-2014 Dodge Charger Pursuit sedans for the same alternator issue. Fiat Chrysler said at the time one minor injury was related to the recall. Dealers will replace the alternators.

Investigations are being conducted in the United States into possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and Russia when he was running for president in 2016. The White House and the Kremlin have denied there was any interference in the election. Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, told reporters she had filed a resolution of inquiry demanding the U.S. Treasury Secretary hand over documents in his possession,  relating to President Trump's financial connections to Russia, certain illegal financial schemes, and related information . The resolution asked for any records of loans or credit from a number of banks - including Deutsche Bank and Russian lenders Sberbank and Gazprombank - to Trump, some of his closest family members and a list of associates. A resolution of inquiry is a legislative tool by which the House can get information from the administration. Waters filed the resolution with the Financial Services Committee, which now has 14 legislative days to address it, either by debating it or voting it down. If the committee, which is chaired and dominated by Republicans, ignores the resolution, it could head to the floor of the broader House. Waters and four other colleagues have been especially interested in learning more from Deutsche Bank, which is one of Trump's biggest lenders, according to government ethics disclosures. Deutsche Bank's lawyers have rejected requests for information, citing privacy laws. Waters asked Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at a hearing on Wednesday whether the U.S. central bank had uncovered anything about Trump in its Deutsche regulatory work. Yellen said they had not looked into it.

Economists have been raising their forecasts for Italian growth this year since June 1, when statistics institute ISTAT sharply revised up its reading for the first quarter to 0.4 percent from a previously reported 0.2 percent. In its quarterly economic bulletin the central bank said growth in the second quarter should maintain the same 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter rate as seen in the first.  GDP appears to have benefited from the positive trend in the services sector,  the bulletin said, adding that industry  is also picking up after a brief dip at the start of the year. The Bank of Italy's outlook for the full year is a fraction higher than those of the International Monetary Fund and employers' lobby Confindustria, which both forecast 1.3 percent. The government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni still has an official forecast of 1.1 percent, made in April, which it is expected to raise in autumn when it presents its 2018 budget. Italy has been the euro zone's most sluggish economy since the launch of monetary union in 1999, and growth of 1.4 percent would be its strongest expansion since 2007. However, it would still be below a euro zone average rate forecast at 1.8 percent by the European Central Bank. The Italian economy grew 0.9 percent last year and by 0.8 percent in 2015. The Bank of Italy forecast growth would slow slightly to 1.3 percent next year and 1.2 percent in 2019. It added that its forecasts were more likely to prove too optimistic than too pessimistic, due to uncertainties linked to financial markets and future global economic and trade policies. It forecast that Italian inflation, based on the EU-harmonized index, would average 1.4 percent this year and slow to 1.1 percent in 2018.

Academics from Bristol in southwest England have developed a mobile phone app that alerts walkers when they pass some of the goriest sites from the region's history.

The extraordinary 18th century practice of hanging and sometimes gibbeting selected felons - exhibiting their bodies to public view in iron cages - at the scene of their crime was intended to leave an indelible and exemplary impression on disorderly villages and small towns,  the university said. Four murders ranging from 1741 to 1813 feature in the walking tours, which will be launched via a smartphone app on July 20. These include an aristocrat who was strangled by two sailors on his brother's orders over an inheritance dispute, and a woman killed by her cheating husband. After being hanged, the body of one of the sailors convicted of murder was put on display in a gibbet on an island at the mouth of the river Avon, which flows through Bristol.  The body of the murderous husband  was tarred, placed in the iron cage and hung on a 30-ft (9-metre) pole on a hill overlooking his childhood haunts, his parent's cottage ... and the actual crime scene , the university said.

Shares of JPMorgan Citigroup and Wells Fargo were lower in premarket trading, after the banks released mixed earnings reports. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier, with financials projected to have had the third-best profit growth among sectors, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will report results next week.  While the economy is growing, there is still some room to run,  said  J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.  People are waiting to hear from CEOs to see if they're optimistic for the rest of the year. Given where valuations are right now, some sell off in the market won't be bad in the short term.  Earnings will be closely watched to see if high valuations are justified in the face of tepid inflation and a recent patch of mixed economic data. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. Dow e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.02 percent, with 17,277 contracts changing hands at 8:39 a.m. ET (1239 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, with 102,371 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 25,803 contracts. Data showed that in the 12 months through June, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 1.7 percent from a year ago. Other data showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in June for a second straight month, dampening expectations of strong acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. Risk sentiment got a boost this week, with the Dow hitting another record close on Thursday, following dovish comments on interest rate hikes from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Yellen said the central bank's further rate hikes could be gradual, given persistently low inflation and that it would be  quite challenging  for U.S. growth to reach a 3-percent target set by President Donald Trump.

A former British colony, Hong Kong reverted to China 20 years ago under a  one country, two systems  formula that guaranteed a range of freedoms not enjoyed in China, including a direct vote for half of the 70-seat legislative assembly. A group of young political activists chaffing against what they see as undue Beijing interference, won seats in an assembly election last year, and some made gestures of defiance at their swearing-in, which authorities have said ruled them out. Activists say the city government's efforts in disqualifying democratically elected lawmakers is a direct assault on the city's freedoms. In reaching his verdict, judge Thomas Au referred to a November ruling by China's parliament that city lawmakers must swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China and that candidates would be disqualified if they changed the wording of their oath or if they failed to take it in a sincere and solemn manner. The November ruling was considered Beijing's most direct intervention in the city's legal and political system since the 1997 handover, and it effectively barred two elected pro-independence politicians from office. Among the four disqualified on Friday was Nathan Law, 24, the youngest person to win in a seat and a leader of the  Umbrella movement  protests in 2014. Law was disqualified for adding words to his oath and adopting a tone of voice that  expressed a doubt on or disrespect of the status of the PRC as a legitimate sovereign of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,  the court said in a summary of its ruling, referring to the People's Republic of China. Another of those disqualified was veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as  Long Hair . At his swearing-in he had brandished a yellow umbrella - the symbol of the 2014 protests - bearing pro-democracy messages, tore up a piece of paper with more protest messages and truncated his oath.     Lecturer Lau Siu-lai, who spoke to crowds about democracy during the protests, was disqualified for reading out her oath very slowly, and surveyor Edward Yiu was removed because he added words to his oath. Opposition lawmakers (L-R) Nathan Law, Leung Kwok-hung, Lau Siu-lai and Edward Yiu make a statement at the Legislative Council after being disqualified by a court ruling in Hong Kong, China July 14, 2017.Bobby YipIn issuing the verdict, judge Au, who disqualified the two pro-independence lawmakers in November, said concern about political pressure behind the verdict was  at best speculative and the conclusions are illogical . 'Rig the System' The disqualified lawmakers said they were looking into filing appeals.  Political suppression is not the scariest. What's the scariest is if people become used to it and aren't willing to fight against it,  Law said. Pro-China protesters against four lawmakers chant slogans outside the High Court in Hong Kong, China July 14, 2017.Bobby YipAbout 60 of supporters of the four shouted  shame  outside the court while about 30 Beijing supporters shouted  rubbish legislators, kick them out . Human Rights Watch senior Maya Wang said the verdicts represented  another alarming blow to Hong Kong's fast deteriorating autonomy .  It is used to excise some elected pro-democracy activists from the legislature, to rig the system further in favor of pro-Beijing politicians,  she said in an email. The opposition won 30 of the Legislative Council's 70 seats last September, giving it a comfortable margin in maintaining a veto over most legislation and, most critically, the 24 votes needed for a one-third bloc to veto changes to the city's mini constitution, the Basic Law. But the bloc shrunk in November after the disqualification of the two activists. Now with 24 seats - one held by a centrist lawmaker - and with four more of them facing legal battles - the opposition risks losing its veto power. Separately, Hong Kong's new chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has vowed to build a stronger relationship with the opposition, said she would not intervene in the case.  I don't think this chief executive, or any government official, should compromise on the rule of law just because we want to be friendly,  she said at a Reuters Newsmaker event.

The German team will be defending their World Cup title in Russia next year.

Given soccer's huge popularity VW views the deal with the national team as an ideal marketing platform as it seeks to restore its image following the  dieselgate  emissions test cheating scandal and makes a strategic shift towards electric cars.

The views expressed are his own.) U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are paying more to hire drilling rigs as the number of rigs still idle after the slump declines. Drilling costs were up by 8 percent in June 2017 compared with their recent low in November 2016, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published on Thursday. The rise in drilling costs has barely started to reverse the previous 34 percent decline reported between March 2014 and November 2016, but it does mark an important turning point in the oilfield services costs cycle. Drilling costs have been rising year-on-year since March and in June were almost 3 percent higher than in the corresponding month a year earlier (tmsnrt.rs/2uqzdEI). Services costs are cyclical and follow changes in the rig count with a lag of a few months, but so far cost increases have been very modest compared with the resurgence in drilling activity (tmsnrt.rs/2uqx9wG). The number of active rigs has more than doubled over the last year, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes, while costs have risen by less than 3 percent. Drilling costs have remained low as rig owners have engaged in deep discounting to win contracts following the worst slump for more than a generation. In the early summer of 2016, there were 2,100 rigs available for use in the United States, but just 455 were operating, according to an annual census conducted by National Oilwell Varco (NOV)(tmsnrt.rs/2uZgrBz). NOV defines a rig as  available  as one that is currently active or ready to drill without significant capital expenditure ( 63rd Annual Rig Census , NOV, 2016). The utilization rate of 22 percent was the lowest in over six decades, and down from 51 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2tQrBtT). To be considered still available, a land rig must not have been idle for more than three years, or five in the case of offshore units. Badly damaged rigs, those which have been cannibalized for spare parts, and any in long-term storage are excluded. The large number of idled rigs last year sparked fierce competition among operators and intense discounting to secure contracts. As a result, exploration and production companies were able to lock in very favorable drilling rates for 2017 in the second half of 2016. But the drilling boom has significantly reduced the number of idle rigs and given rig contractors more pricing power. The number of active rigs has climbed from a cycle low of just 404 at the end of May 2016 to 952 in early July 2017. The utilization rate is now well over 40 percent, which is still low by historic standards, but no longer at emergency levels. The rigs which are still idle are mostly older, less powerful, less sophisticated and likely less productive. As the rig count continues to increase, and contracts negotiated during 2016 expire, drilling firms are likely to push for significant price increases. Oilfield services costs are therefore set to rise in the second half of 2017 and especially in 2018 unless the drilling boom slows.

Sir, you are in the decree,  a colleague told the 67-year-old constitutional law professor by phone, referring to a list of 4,000 employees suspended from their jobs in a single swoop. Five months later, as Turkey's government prepares to commemorate thwarting the attempted overthrow of President Tayyip Erdogan, Kaboglu is still barred from his job at Marmara University and a year-long purge continues - hitting the judiciary particularly hard.  A quarter of judges and prosecutors have been sacked, leaving under-resourced courts swamped with tens of thousands of cases against people targeted in the crackdown, and weakening a pillar of constitutional authority in Turkey. Kaboglu was half-expecting the call, he said, and he chose to carry on working into the night rather than wake up his wife and daughter. But the sense of inevitability could not soften the blow.   For a jurist who has reached the last stage of his professional career, to be included in a ... decree prepared in an anti-constitutional way, has an impact that is worse than death,  he said.  Because your whole life has passed in a struggle for the law.  Around 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 150,000 people like Kaboglu suspended from work since the failed July 15, 2016 putsch, when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters, attacked parliament and tried to abduct Erdogan, killing 250 people. The president's ruling AK Party says the coup was planned by supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen deeply embedded in Turkey's institutions - the army, schools and courts - and only a massive purge could neutralize the threat. But for those targeted in the crackdown the effect has been devastating. Stripped either of their liberty or their livelihood, they have little prospect of employment.  You are deprived of all your rights. They say you cannot work (in Turkey) ... You cannot work abroad either. My pension rights were taken away,  Kaboglu told Reuters.  The wider impact on the judiciary has been an erosion of legal safeguards, Kaboglu and other critics say, accusing Erdogan of using last year's attempted coup as an excuse to trample on constitutional rights.  One-Man Rule Turkey's main opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, echoed that charge at a rally in Istanbul on Sunday, the biggest protest yet against the crackdown, when he described the state of emergency imposed last July as a second coup. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim visit graves of the civilians who were killed during last year's failed July 15 coup, in Istanbul, Turkey, July 11, 2017. Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS All powers of the legislature, judiciary and executive have been concentrated in one person,  Kilicdaroglu told protesters.  The independence and impartiality of the judiciary, which underpins democracy and the protection of all rights to life and property, must be ensured,  he said. The crackdown, and a bitterly fought April referendum which granted greater presidential powers to Erdogan, have strained Turkey's ties with the European Union and put its decades-old ambition to join the bloc in limbo. Turkey's justice ministry says  procedures  have been launched against 169,000 people. Some had used a messaging app favored by Gulen's network, others worked at schools founded by his supporters or held accounts at a Gulen-linked bank.  Even ownership of one-dollar bills has been enough to raise suspicion. Authorities believe Gulen supporters, labeled the Gulenist Terrorist Organisation (FETO) by the government, used the notes to identify fellow members. Slideshow (9 Images)Arrested soldiers have been paraded in court in front of television cameras, crowds throwing nooses at them in a call to reinstate the death penalty for the coup plotters. Other detainees wait to learn their fate.  They penetrated everywhere,  Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told Reuters, adding that eliminating the influence of Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan as he built up his power base, would take years.  We are talking about a structure (going back) more than 40 years, hence it is not possible to cleanse it in one day,  Kurtulmus said. Acknowledging that mistakes could be made in a wide-ranging purge, he said 33,000 people had been restored to their posts. People wrongly caught up could also apply to a commission which is starting to operate.  This is a process that will continue for a long time. We have to continue very decisively,  he said, adding that this weekend's commemoration of the failed coup would strengthen Turkey's resolve to continue to confront those behind the coup.  Neither the heroism nor the treachery should be allowed to be forgotten ... Every one of our 80 million people, whatever their political view, should support our fight against FETO,  he said.  This cleansing will go on to the end.  Erdogan has been reinforcing that message in a series of high profile ceremonies this week, which will culminate in a speech in Ankara at 2.34 am on Sunday, a year to the minute since parliament came under fire from the coup plotters. For Kaboglu, who described himself as an enemy of the Gulenists when they were in alliance with Erdogan's ruling AK Party, being  thrown in the same bag  as them in the post-coup crackdown was a cruel irony.  Those who were affected were people like me who defend the law,  he said.  I defended human rights and the state of law 15 years ago and I defend them today. I will defend them in 10 years time if I live that long.

Spain slashed spending on infrastructure over the course of a double-dip recession triggered by a property and construction crash in 2008. Toll roads built during a construction boom in the early 2000s were also hit by the crisis and often had to compete for traffic with nearby toll-free highways. Several concessions were bankrupted, and the state is still trying to strike a deal with creditors on those roads to reduce the cost of bailing them out.  Investment in infrastructure remains restricted as Spain attempts to reduce its public deficit and bring it in line with targets imposed by Brussels, but Rajoy said Spain had sufficiently recovered from the downturn to restart projects.

The program will involve investment on 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) of roads around Spain over the next three years - including to complete unfinished highways - and the tenders will be put out with 30-year maintenance contracts.  The plan will create around 190,000 jobs overall, Rajoy said.  Government spending on infrastructure as a percentage of economic output is at record low levels, says construction lobby group Seopan.

With talks due to start next month between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mexican officials have stressed the need to craft a new deal that would strengthen the region against competitors, particularly in Asia. Trump has threatened to ditch NAFTA if he cannot rework it to the benefit of the United States, arguing it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. Mexican officials say a revamped NAFTA must further integrate the region and are awaiting U.S. negotiating objectives, due to be published on or around Sunday. They point to sectors like autos, where U.S. inputs make up some 40 percent of the value of products imported into the United States from Mexico, while Chinese exports contain only 4 percent, according to the U.S. Center for Automotive Research.   If we integrate further and make Mexico more competitive versus China ... even if our exports rise, U.S. jobs will rise, because when we export (to the United States), they're exporting too (via U.S. content),  said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who led the initial NAFTA negotiations for Mexico. However, mindful that Trump needs to be able to claim a more obvious win from the shake-up, they are also looking at rules governing how much of a product is made in the region. NAFTA rules of origin stipulate that to qualify for tariff-free access, some products need to be sourced to a certain degree regionally. Cars, a recurring point of attack for Trump, must meet a threshold of 62.5 percent. Because raising that threshold would not automatically benefit U.S. workers - firms could just expand capacity in Mexico - Trump's trade team want to have some national content rules within the regional framework, Mexican officials say. 'A Tricky Issue' FILE PHOTO: Employees work at a wire harness and cable assembly manufacturing company that exports to the U.S., in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, April 27, 2017.Jose Luis Gonzalez/File PhotoMoises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is coordinating the private sector's role in the renegotiation, said they may explore domestic content rules on certain products.  It'll be a tricky issue, and we'll have to see case by case,  he said. Kalach declined to say what goods might be eligible. In May, he said a revamped NAFTA might source more work for future product lines from the region. The Mexican electronics industry wants to increase regional production of some components to reduce reliance on Asia, said Cesar Castro, vice president of electronics industry group Canieti. Slideshow (2 Images)About 70 percent of content in electronic goods exported by Mexico to the United States is sourced from Asia, he said, highlighting products that would have a big slice of Chinese content even if manufactured by U.S. companies. To boost North American output, Canieti is considering a proposal that could see regional content in certain products raised from 5 percent to 50 percent over 10 years, Castro said. Bargaining Chips If Mexico's arguments fall flat, however, and Trump threatens to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods, the sizeable U.S. surplus in services with Mexico could end up as a bargaining chip. That could complement Mexican efforts to target the big U.S. agricultural surplus with Mexico, which the Trump administration is already feeling pressure to preserve. Mexico could insist companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) build servers in the country, said a former Mexican official familiar with discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity.  As the U.S.'s second biggest market, it's clear we can hit back,  said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister.  (Services are worth) more and more every day.

The Labor Department said on Friday that the unchanged reading in its Consumer Price Index followed a 0.1 percent dip in May. The lack of a rebound in the CPI in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory. In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. The year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and climbing 1.7 percent from a year ago. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in June, rising by the same margin for three straight months. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May.

Those courts, including an influential Washington appeals court and two appellate courts that ruled against Trump in cases involving his travel ban, all had an influx of fresh liberal blood under President Barack Obama.  Trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the Democrats’ control of those three (appellate) circuits,  said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. After eight years in office, Obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts. When he left the White House in January, nine of the 13 federal appeals courts had a majority of Democratic-appointed judges. The federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in the District of Columbia, often have the final say in major legal disputes. The conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court, which now includes Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, can overrule appeals court decisions, but hears only a small number of cases, which leaves lower court rulings in place most of the time. The appeals courts can shape the interpretation of such issues as abortion, religious freedom, voting rights and race. Appellate court judges serve lifetime terms, and so far Trump’s opportunities to appoint new ones have been mostly limited to courts that already lean conservative. Among the courts conservatives would most like to shift are the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, both of which ruled against Trump in cases challenging the Republican president's executive orders temporarily banning travel to the United States by people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The Supreme Court partially revived the ban last month. The ideological balance of those courts has provided some hope to Trump's legal opponents, including Democratic state attorneys general, who have already sued the administration over the travel ban and other issues.  Strategic attorneys general can likely chart a path through Democratic-leaning courts - making it harder on the Trump administration to pursue its agenda through executive action,  said Sarah Binder, a scholar the nonpartisan Brookings Institution think tank. Second Highest Court Thanks in part to efforts by the Republican-led Senate in the final two years of Obama's presidency to block the Democratic president's judicial appointments, Trump has 21 appeals court slots to fill, according to the federal judiciary's administrative office. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved two of Trump's appeals court nominees on Thursday. In some of the key courts, new vacancies in the near term are more likely to be in slots currently filled by Republican appointees, so Trump's early appointments will be unlikely to change the court balance. A case in point is the announcement this week by Republican appointee Janice Rogers Brown on the Washington appeals court that she plans to step down. In Washington, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is often called the second-highest court in the land, in part because it hears a large number of cases concerning major government regulations on issues such as the environment and labor. Democratic appointees hold a 7-4 advantage among the 11 active judges. Of the Democratic appointees, Judge David Tatel is 75 and Judge Judith Rogers is 77. The next oldest is Merrick Garland at 64. Obama made four appointments to the court, the oldest of whom is 56. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is also stacked against Trump: out of 25 full-time judges, Democratic presidents appointed 18 and Republican presidents seven. The oldest Democratic appointee, liberal icon Stephen Reinhardt, is 86 years old. The 10 9th Circuit judges appointed by President Bill Clinton who still work full-time range in age from 63 to 72, and none have given any indication they plan to reduce their caseloads. The court currently has four vacancies, but three of those seats are based in states - California, Oregon and Hawaii - with two Democratic senators who are likely to resist attempts to place extreme conservatives on the court. Those dynamics make it extremely unlikely that Trump will be able to significantly alter the 9th Circuit's orientation, Hellman said. The Virginia-based 4th Circuit has a 10-5 majority of Democratic appointees and no current vacancies. The oldest Democratic appointee is Judge Robert King, who is 77. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, who has advised the White House on judicial nominations, is optimistic about Trump's long-term prospects. “It takes time to recalibrate the federal courts,” he said. In the meantime, Leo said, every slot matters, since conservative judges on liberal-majority courts can offer critical dissents in important cases and serve a kind of signaling function to the Supreme Court.

Following the state rescue of Monte dei Paschi di Siena this month and the liquidation of two ailing regional banks, Genoa-based Carige has come into focus as one of the last remaining large Italian lenders with problems. Among options being studied for the 1.2 billion euro ($1.4 billion) disposal, Carige may also sell its bad loan management platform, the two sources said. Consultancy Bain & Company is advising the bank on the deal, one of the sources said. Bain & Company was not immediately available for comment. The Italian debt servicing industry is expanding fast with banks in the country under pressure from regulators to reduce their holdings of impaired loans that rose to a total of 349 billion euros during a harsh recession. Shares in Italian debt collector doBank debuted in Milan on Friday, rising as much as 17 percent. DoBank, Italy's biggest debt servicing company, was created from the bad loan management platform that UniCredit sold to U.S. fund Fortress Investment Group in 2015. Carige, which has been dogged by governance problems and has changed its chief executive twice in little over a year, plans to raise up to 500 million euros in a share issue. Italy's ninth-biggest bank has also been told by the European Central Bank it must cut its bad loans to 3.7 billion euros by the end of 2019 from 7.3 billion euros last year. Carige last week transferred 938 million euros in bad loans to a vehicle that will repackage them as securities and sell them to investors. Carige aims to complete that deal this month and immediately start on the 1.2 billion euro sale.

Trump,Mariel Combs,Michael Milstein,CALIFORNIA,GILLNETS/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(Reuters) - Environmentalists have filed a lawsuit seeking to force U.S. fisheries managers to implement plans for restricting the number of whales and turtles permitted to be inadvertently snared in drift gillnets used for catching swordfish off California's coast. The proposed rule, endorsed in 2015 by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, would place numerical limits on  bycatch  of whales and other marine creatures, and suspend swordfish gillnet operations if any of the caps are exceeded. The regulation was expected to gain final approval from the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. But it was withdrawn last month after the Commerce Department agency determined the cost to the commercial fishing industry outweighed conservation benefits, agency spokesman Michael Milstein said on Thursday. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the environmental group Oceana accused the Commerce Department under President Donald Trump's administration of violating U.S. fisheries laws and the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The suit seeks a court order requiring the agency ultimately to put the restrictions into effect.  This rule is critical to protect endangered whales and turtles from death and injury in this wasteful fishery,  Oceana attorney Mariel Combs said. Drift gillnets, consisting of mile-long (1.8 km-long) strands of nylon mesh draped 200 feet (60 meters) deep in the ocean from surface floats, pose a hazard to a wide assortment of marine mammals and turtles that can become entangled and drown. According to Oceana, vessels targeting swordfish ended up discarding 61 percent of all animals caught in their gillnets from 2004 to 2017. The group also cited figures showing that 53 whales, 35 sea turtles and hundreds of dolphins, seals and sea lions were inadvertently captured between 2001 and 2015. Under the proposed rule, the swordfish grounds off Southern California would be temporarily closed to commercial harvests if bycatch limits set for any one of nine protected marine creatures were reached or exceeded, including bottlenose dolphins, four species of whale and four types of sea turtles. A temporary gillnet closure imposed in 2014 to protect endangered sea turtles in Southern California waters halted fishing operations for a fleet of 16 boats whose annual swordfish and thresher shark catch was then valued at about $1 million on average, a small fraction of California's overall commercial fishery. Milstein said commercial fishermen have adopted new measures to mitigate bycatch, including a device that lowers the top of the gillnet below the water's surface where whales and turtles are likely to swim.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/california-gillnets-idUSL1N1K50GB"},

Writing on Twitter from Paris, where he was a guest of honor in Bastille Day celebrations, Trump said Vice President Mike Pence was working to advance the healthcare plan  and getting our wonderful Republican Senators to do what is right for the people.   After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,  Trump wrote. Senate Republican leaders released a revised plan on Thursday to dismantle the Obamacare law, but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the Republican party, indicating a treacherous path for the bill. The bill played to the party's disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy. But the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate. He is under pressure from Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans' seven-year mission to gut the signature legislation of Democratic former President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act.  The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare. They deserve better care. And the time to deliver that to them is next week,  McConnell said. In addition to the criticism from some senators, a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas. With Democrats united against it, McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage. But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate. Several senators, including Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman and John McCain, had concerns about the legislation and particularly its Medicaid cuts. And two other Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan. McConnell, a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week.

Wall Street was set for a broadly flat open, with shares in JP Morgan and Wells Fargo dipping in pre-market trade after the U.S. banks released mixed earnings reports, offsetting some of the central bank-fuelled optimism. After a scare at the end of last month, when stock markets skidded on the view that the era of easy money might be coming to an end across the globe, investors have been soothed by a run of more dovish comments from central bankers. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Thursday advocated a  gradual and patient  approach to further tightening after two hikes so far this year, saying he first wanted to see more evidence that inflation is heading back up to the Fed's 2-percent goal. Fed Chair Janet Yellen also said on Thursday that the central bank's further rate hikes could be gradual, given persistently low inflation despite an improving economy. European shares were poised for their best week since late April as investors piled back into equities, though moves on indexes on Friday ahead of the U.S. open. The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched up 0.1 percent, adding to earlier gains on stock markets in Asia that took MSCI's world stock index to an all-time high.  Yellen's cautious testimony - and the dovish tones of her deputies - may have given risk-taking a new lease of life,  said BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor in London.  Perhaps with the exception of Monday's figures from China, there appears to be nothing on next week's schedule that may seriously alter the market's current view of the world.  As the dollar dipped towards a nine-month low reached on Thursday, high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and Mexican peso benefited from the risk-on mood, with the latter touching 14-month highs as the VIX index, a key gauge of asset volatility, drifted lower. Reassured Markets The recent caution from central bankers has also taken the sting out of a sell-off in the bond market, which had been gathering steam over the past few weeks in the euro zone on rising expectations that the European Central Bank is set to wind down its asset purchase programme. The bloc's benchmark German 10-year yield fell some 3 basis points when European trading started on Friday to 0.50 percent, moving away from an 18-month high hit earlier this week of 0.583 percent.  (The Fed comments) add to our conviction that no further Fed hike should be expected for the rest of the year, which should prove reassuring for markets concerned about excessive tightening risk globally,  Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei added 0.2 percent, poised for a weekly rise of just over 1 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3 percent to its highest level in two years. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.1410 and was set to end the week flat. The ECB is keen to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours, three sources familiar with the discussion told Reuters. The Canadian dollar remained near its strongest in over a year after the Bank of Canada this week raised interest rates for the first time since 2010, with further tightening expected this year. In commodities, oil prices edged higher and were on track for solid weekly gains following positive demand signals, production issues in Nigeria and a reported decline in stocks. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil, were up 43 cents at $48.85 per barrel. Gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,217.32 an ounce, heading for more than half-percent gain for the week.

The lender said markets revenue declined about 7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, smaller than the 12 percent drop Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach had projected at a conference two weeks before the end of the quarter. Client trading surged a year earlier around UK's Brexit vote.  The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said on Friday net income fell 3.2 percent to $3.87 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Earnings per share was $1.28, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit earlier on Friday, helped by higher interest rates and loan growth that cushioned a decline in trading. Citigroup's total revenue rose 2 percent to $17.90 billion and beat estimates of $17.37 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue fell 6 percent, while equity trading revenue dropped 11 percent. Loans at the end of the period were up about 2 percent from a year earlier, as well from the end of March, indicating a new momentum for lending. Operating expenses rose 1.3 percent to $10.51 billion. But the ratio of expenses to revenue remained at 59 percent. Tangible book value per share increased 6 percent to $67.32.  Citigroup's shares were nearly flat in premarket trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had gained 12.8 percent this year.  The shares have climbed toward their tangible book value since mid-April largely in anticipation of the company being allowed by the Federal Reserve to use excess capital to buy back stock.     Citigroup got the go-ahead on June to repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common stock over the next year - nearly twice as much as the year before - as well as double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion for the period.

On average he estimated around 67 crowns per kilo. A salmon producer expected a somewhat smaller increase in prices.  We expect 65 crowns. This week was sold out pretty early. It's lower volumes and that is pushing prices,  the producer added. Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since recovered. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints supported prices in the first half of 2017, ahead of an expected increase in volumes later in the year. July is a seasonally slow month in terms of output, and more volumes are expected from August.

The lender said markets revenue declined about 7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, smaller than the 12 percent drop Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach had projected at a conference two weeks before the end of the quarter. Client trading surged a year earlier around UK's Brexit vote.  The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said on Friday net income fell 3.2 percent to $3.87 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Earnings per share was $1.28, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit earlier on Friday, helped by higher interest rates and loan growth that cushioned a decline in trading. Citigroup's total revenue rose 2 percent to $17.90 billion and beat estimates of $17.37 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue fell 6 percent, while equity trading revenue dropped 11 percent. Loans at the end of the period were up about 2 percent from a year earlier, as well from the end of March, indicating a new momentum for lending. Operating expenses rose 1.3 percent to $10.51 billion. But the ratio of expenses to revenue remained at 59 percent. Tangible book value per share increased 6 percent to $67.32.  Citigroup's shares were nearly flat in premarket trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had gained 12.8 percent this year.  The shares have climbed toward their tangible book value since mid-April largely in anticipation of the company being allowed by the Federal Reserve to use excess capital to buy back stock.     Citigroup got the go-ahead on June to repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common stock over the next year - nearly twice as much as the year before - as well as double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion for the period.

The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.7758, well on track to post its best weekly performance in four months. It gained by a similar quantum against the Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar remained broadly on the back foot as traders preferred to play the risk-on trade against the yen, especially before key U.S. inflation data later today that may skew interest rate expectations in the markets.  Current market pricing suggests that the impact of these inflation related releases could be asymmetric, with higher inflation expectations leading towards a repricing of the U.S. curve translating into dollar strength,  Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note. Money markets pricing suggests less than a 50 percent chance of a hike over the next year, according to CME's FedWatch tool. For the week, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar are among the top gainers after European shares were poised to post their best week since late April. Major market gauges of asset volatility, such as the Merrill Lynch Option volatility estimate and VIX, drifted lower on Friday, providing a boost to carry trades. The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen , has stalled towards the end of this week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback. That view was further reinforced by other U.S. policymakers such as Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Thursday, though analysts were wary of kicking the dollar lower before U.S. inflation data. Signs of a pick-up in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar. However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month.  It is broadly a U.S. dollar-negative market as latest comments from Yellen and others suggest that interest rates will rise very gently and that is supportive for high-yielding currencies for now,  said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1418, unable to find much of a lift even as Germany's 10-year bond yield climbed back above the 0.50 percent threshold overnight. That followed a report that the European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase programme will be gradually wound down next year.

The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is different from the figure monitored by Greece's EU/IMF lenders, but indicates the state of the country's finances. The government's target was for a primary budget surplus - which excludes debt-servicing costs - of 431 million euros for the first six months of the year. Net tax revenue came in at 21.3 billion euros, 73 million euros above target, while spending reached 22.9 billion euros, below a target of 24 billion euros. The government is aiming for a general government primary budget surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP this year, based on its medium term fiscal strategy plan. The bailout target is for a primary surplus of 1.75 percent of GDP. It overshot its bailout target last year after achieving a general government primary budget surplus of 4.2 percent of GDP. The EU commission said on Wednesday that Greece's fiscal position has improved and the European Union should end disciplinary procedures against it over its excessive deficit, paving the way for the country to return to international bond markets.

Syria's six-year conflict has caused widespread damage to agriculture and left 7 million people without enough to eat, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Fighting destroyed veterinary clinics, sparked vaccine shortages and restricted vets' access to rural areas, leaving many herds exposed to infections.  The risk of trans-boundary animal diseases spreading rapidly and beyond borders remains a major concern,  the FAO representative in Syria, Adam Yao, said in a statement.   If no drastic measures are immediately taken, the effects on livestock production and food security can be devastating.  The FAO said it had wrapped up a three-month, anti-parasite campaign, reaching 234,000 farmers in government and rebel-held areas in ten regions, including Homs, Aleppo and Hasakeh. The recipients were mostly women, who are traditionally responsible for livestock in rural Syria and who now make up more than 60 percent of the country's agricultural workforce.  This is often their only source of income to feed their families,  said Yao. The U.S.-funded campaign was aimed at small farmers who could not afford to buy drugs that protect against lice, tube worms and other parasites, as war has driven up prices, said FAO senior livestock officer George Khoury.

Central bank officials were not immediately available for comments. The central bank's Deputy Governor, Nandalal Weerasinghe, told Reuters on Wednesday that the bank had completely stopped defending the rupee unlike in the past. The central bank has only been buying dollars since February, and not sold any at all, Weerasinghe said. The central bank does not see any pressure on the rupee and the currency is determined through market-driven demand and supply, he added. The market has priced in further depreciation due to the central bank's no-intervention policy, dealers said. The rupee has dropped around 2.6 percent so far this year. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50.

Lam was speaking in her first interview with the international media since she was sworn in as the city's new leader by Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1.  Hong Kong people are always very compassionate and so I share that compassion of many Hong Kong people by sending my condolences to the wife and the family of Mr Liu,  Lam, a devout Catholic, told a Reuters Newsmaker event in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have long branded Liu as a  subversive  so such comments are unusual and the only sympathetic remarks so far from a Beijing-backed leader regarding his death.  Liu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his efforts to promote democracy in China, died on Thursday at the age of 61 of multiple organ failure while in detention [L4N1K51AG]. Liu was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power . Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It enjoys wide-ranging freedoms not granted in mainland China, a promise of full democracy at some future date, and an independent judiciary under a so-called  one country, two systems  formula. But the abduction by mainland agents of Hong Kong booksellers who had published critical books on China, and Beijing's efforts to disqualify democratically elected, pro-independence lawmakers in the local legislature, have rattled confidence in that arrangement. 'Anxieties and Perception' In a wide-ranging interview, Lam acknowledged concerns about certain  individual incidents  in the city. She said it was her duty to accurately reflect them to the central government in Beijing.   I would say there are worries, there are anxieties, there is a strong perception over individual isolated incidents, but unless you've got evidence to prove there are clear breaches then it will remain at the level of anxieties and perception,  Lam said, without elaborating. She did say, however, police were still investigating the booksellers' cases.  Britain called the cases a  serious breach   of the Joint Declaration -- the 1984 treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong's return to China -- and said one of the booksellers, a British passport holder, had been removed from Hong Kong  under duress . Hong Kong's high court on Friday removed four opposition lawmakers from the city's legislative council for failing to sincerely take the oath of office, in a significant blow to the opposition that could weaken its one-third veto bloc in the 70-seat assembly. [L4N1K43NH] While the lawsuit had been initiated by her predecessor, Lam said she wouldn't intervene in the case   Building bridges still has to be done in a lawful way. I don’t think this CE (chief executive) or any government official should compromise on the rule of law just because we want to be friendly. But I’m sure the judicial process will go on.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attends an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong, China July 14, 2017.Bobby YipSpeaking about Hong Kong's financial sector, Lam said it has a lot of catching up to do, particularly given big strides in financial technology on the mainland, and needs stronger leadership. She also expressed concern over stock price manipulation in the territory. Xi's Harder Line  Xi took what some saw as an explicitly harder line about Hong Kong's future during his visit marking the 20th anniversary of the financial hub's return from British to Chinese rule.  Xi warned in a speech that any attempt to endanger Chinese sovereignty and security, challenge its power, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities would be acts that cross  the red line  and are  absolutely impermissible . Lam said she would seek to enact contentious national security laws, known as Article 23,  as soon as possible,  without giving a specific timetable, that would prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against China. Slideshow (2 Images)A proposed blueprint for those laws in 2003, however, was seen as a grave threat to Hong Kong's autonomy, and drew a half-million protesters to the streets before it was finally shelved. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong's  one country, two systems arrangement  has come under considerable strain, as the city's opposition forces have agitated for full democracy and railed against creeping Chinese interference in various sectors including business, politics, media, law and education. The 60-year-old Lam has said she hopes to lead Hong Kong  towards new glory  in the next five years and heal divisions that have festered since the massive 2014 pro-democracy  protests that blocked major roads in Hong Kong for 79 days. Lam also pledged to stand by the people of Hong Kong in protecting their rights.  If our core values are being undermined by whatever things happened both in Hong Kong or not in Hong Kong, then of course I have that duty.  At times, Lam, the mother of two grown sons, showed a lighter side, boasting that she slept soundly through the night when asked about the insomnia of leadership.  She expressed hopes she could ease the pressures of Hong Kong's pressure cooker school system, saying parents should let their children  dream  - and acknowledging that was not a traditional Asian  Tiger Mum  thing to say.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Hong Kong public opinion poll (interactive) - A look at citizens' view on the future of the territory under China    tmsnrt.rs/299O0cu Hong Kong public opinion - A look at citizens' view on the future of the territory under China    tmsnrt.rs/2tnzxjF ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Additional reporting by Anne Marie Roantree, Venus Wu, Twinnie Siu, Greg Torode.

The shareholder lawsuit filed in the federal court in Manhattan, where Arconic is based, may be the first in the United States tied to the fire that gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower, in London's North Kensington section. Arconic's share price fell 21 percent between June 14 and June 27, the day after the company once known as Alcoa said it would stop selling the panels for use in high-rises. That decline reduced Arconic's market value by more than $2.5 billion, according to Reuters data. Arconic declined to comment on the lawsuit. Brave also named former Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld and current Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Giacobbe as defendants. Extensive damage is seen to the Grenfell Tower block which was destroyed in a disastrous fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017.Hannah McKayThe complaint seeks to allow Arconic shareholders from Feb. 28 to June 26 to sue as a group. Brave said shareholders were deceived by Arconic's inadequate disclosures regarding the cladding panels, and that their use significantly increased the risk of property damage, injury or death in buildings containing them.

It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States over unexpected stock price declines that they believe could have been averted. Shares of Arconic closed Thursday up 26 cents at $24.45. They had closed at $21.84 on June 27.

Federer is the only member of the so-called  big four  left in the draw after Rafa Nadal, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic all failed to make it past the quarter-finals and few would bet against the 35-year-old from claiming victory on a surface he loves. The third seed is two victories away from moving clear of Pete Sampras and William Renshaw at the top of the list of men's Wimbledon champions and will meet either Croatia's Marin Cilic or American Sam Querrey should he get past Berdych. Federer has yet to drop a set at this year's championships and the form guide suggests he will prevail against Berdych, with the Swiss on a seven-match winning streak against the Czech player, who has not beaten him since 2013.

The 31-year-old has said he will attempt to play with self-belief and produce his best form against Federer but acknowledges the scale of the task ahead.

Seventh-seed Cilic defeated Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in five sets on Wednesday to reach his first Wimbledon semi-final where he will meet American Sam Querrey on Friday.  This is his chance to win Wimbledon,  Ivanisevic, a Croatian who won Wimbledon in 2001, told The Times of London newspaper.  Gilles Muller is a great player, but Cilic is better and if you were offered the chance to play Sam Querrey in the semi-final of a grand-slam event, you would take it.  Ivanisevic believes he saw  something different  in Cilic when he first saw him play at the age of 14 and followed his entire career. He took over as Cilic's coach in 2013 and helped him on his way to a grand slam title, a year later, at the U.S. Open. The two parted ways in July 2016, after Cilic was knocked out of Wimbledon by Roger Federer in the quarter-finals.   It's tough to explain, but it's something different, something that you cannot learn, something that you cannot buy. You are born with it,  Ivanisevic added.  He has the potential to be a top-four player. It will be big news in Croatia if he gets past Querrey today and makes the final.  Cilic has won all his previous four encounters against Querrey and so will start as the favorite to book a place in Sunday's final.

France and Germany unveiled plans on Thursday for a new European fighter to tighten defence and security cooperation. The two countries currently compete for sales, with Germany and Britain both part of the Eurofighter consortium.  I welcome it. I don't feel threatened by it. I would like to see how it matures,  Chris Boardman, BAE's managing director of Military Air and Information, said, adding BAE was always willing to collaborate in Europe, America and elsewhere.  I am sure it would happen over time and I am absolutely convinced that we, the UK, and we, BAE Systems, will one way or another have an involvement,  Boardman told a news conference at the Royal International Air Tattoo, a major military air show.  If you ask me what that will be and when it will be, I can't answer those questions, but I understand what the general trend in the world is,  he said. However, he drew a contrast between Franco-German plans to look at a replacement for the Eurofighter and France's Rafale aircraft and two separate fighter projects already under way between Britain and Turkey and Britain and Japan, in which BAE is involved.  My comment on Europe is 'fantastic'. Europe has now recognised what the rest of the world is doing,  he said. Britain and Turkey signed a deal in January to develop Turkish fighter jets. Britain and Japan are looking at the potential development of a new stealth fighter under a technology deal reached in March. Boardman also said there had been no let-up in efforts by France and Britain to develop an unmanned aerial combat demonstrator. BAE is working on the project with France's Dassault Aviation, which also builds the Rafale fighter jet and is expected to represent France in the new Franco-German project. France and Germany said on Thursday they would look at a new  combat air system,  suggesting it could involve both manned and unmanned components. Referring to the Anglo-French combat drone project, Boardman said,  We are now working very closely with Dassault to take that to the next stage of commitment ... at the end of this year. There is nothing that I see which is stopping the pace of that discussion (or) the partnership that we have developed .

Eight years after her last Wimbledon final and more than two decades since Martina Navratilova became the last 37-year-old to reach the same stage, Williams produced the sort of attacking performance that led her to five titles in her heyday.  Her 6-4 6-2 semi-final win over the Briton was a clinical execution and set up a Saturday showdown with Garbine Muguruza, whose own ruthless demolition of Magdalena Rybarikova whetted the appetite for an intriguing final.  It will be Williams's ninth at Wimbledon and the stage for a potential eighth grand slam crown and having defied the odds to reach this point, few would now bet against her.

The American, who has dropped only one set all tournament, was too strong for her opponent from the baseline and was able to produce booming serves whenever Konta threatened. After initially going toe-to-toe with Williams, Konta was unable to generate any sort of sustained pressure and ended the contest a clear second best, losing eight of the final 10 games.

Experience can either work against you or for you. I like to think it's working for me.  Konta's one chance to upset Williams came in the ninth game of the first set when the Briton crafted two break points. It proved only a fleeting window of opportunity, however, as Williams saved the first with a backhand winner and launched a 106mph second serve to snuff out the second.  That was as good as it got for Konta, who was immediately broken in the next game to cede the opening set and then twice more in the second as Williams wrapped up victory over her sixth-seeded opponent in an hour and 13 minutes.  She dictated the match from the very first ball till the very last one,  Konta said.  I think she just showed her true qualities and why she's a five-time champion here, just a true champion that she is.

Five-time champion Williams is the oldest woman to reach the final since Martina Navratilova did it in 1994 and will take on Spain's Garbine Muguruza for the title on Saturday.  It's amazing,  Hingis told reporters at Wimbledon, where she is into the semi-finals of the mixed doubles.  Maybe nobody would have picked right from the start that Venus would be there in the finals.      But I think the longer the tournament went on, she got herself out of a couple of tough matches, tough situations and struggles maybe in the first couple of rounds, but the more the draw opened up, the more she feels like it's her time to shine.      The 36-year-old Hingis is just three months younger than Williams but unlike the American, she now only plays doubles and mixed doubles, having last played singles on the Tour in 2007.     The Swiss is also the only woman other than Serena Williams to have beaten Venus in a grand slam final, having done so in the US Open in 1997.     Hingis, who won four of her six grand slam battles with Venus, said the achievement was all the more remarkable given that she was diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome in 2011, an auto-immune disease that causes chronic fatigue and muscle soreness.      It's been a little bit of a roller-coaster for her, with her injuries, her virus (Sjogren's) and all these issues but now it seems like she's fine and she's sorted it all out and she's playing great tennis,  Hingis said.    Williams reached the final at the Australian Open in January and shows no sign of slowing down.     Hingis, who won five grand slam singles titles, is happy to concentrate now on doubles.      That's one of the reasons I don't play singles anymore because I don’t want to put my body through the struggles any more,  Hingis said.     Doubles is not as physical. There are quick exchanges and reactions but obviously there is not as much court to cover.

Novartis's near-copy of Amgen's Enbrel won European approval last month. It will submit versions of Johnson & Johnson's Remicade and AbbVie's Humira for regulators' blessing later this year.

The Colombo stock index snapped three sessions of declines to end 0.41 percent higher at 6,766.14, its highest close since Jan. 8, 2016.  Foreign investors have been buying because they expect improvement in earnings in the future,  said Hussain Gani, deputy CEO, Softlogic Stockbrokers.

The market could see a rising trend if yields on fixed-income securities fall as expected by the central bank, said analysts. The central bank expects a further fall in T-bill yields due to less pressure from government borrowing and a proposed new auction system, Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth 478.1 million rupees, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 23.4 billion rupees worth of equities this year. The day's turnover was 1.63 billion rupees, higher than this year's daily average of 912.1 million rupees. New foreign investors have been buying Sri Lankan shares since the Pakistani bourse was upgraded as an emerging market from a frontier one, said analysts. Brokers said domestic investors have been waiting for clarity on the proposed inland revenue legislation, which some companies expect would result in higher costs of production. The IMF, which has long urged Sri Lanka to boost tax revenue through modernisation and simplification of its fiscal system, has urged the government to submit to parliament a new Inland Revenue Act.

Regulators on Tuesday capped incumbent BT’s participation in upcoming mobile-spectrum sales, potentially hitting the Treasury’s income from the sales. It’s a reasonable trade-off in order to ensure a competitive four-player telecoms market. It makes sense for governments that are selling assets to try and maximise their revenue. In this case, that would mean letting telecoms slug it out and handing frequencies to the highest bidders. In the case of mobile-internet spectrum, however, there’s a snag. BT is the largest holder of spectrum and, were it to increase its share substantially, might be able to squeeze small rivals and leave them unable to offer services on competitive terms. That could lead to higher prices and reduce smaller firms’ willingness to invest. For those reasons regulator Ofcom stopped BT from participating in an auction due later this year for spectrum in the 2.3 GHz band – the kind that’s already usable today. It also capped operators at 37 percent of total mobile spectrum expected to be usable in 2020. That constrains BT for an auction also due this year of the 3.4 GHz band, which is expected to be used for superfast 5G mobile internet. For Britain’s coffers, that probably means lower takings. The National Audit Office says proceeds from the 2.4 billion pound 4G auction in 2013 were about 7 percent lower than they could have been, as a result of Ofcom reserving spectrum for a new entrant. It’s possible the lost income would be proportionately higher this time, as biggest player BT is the most constrained. On the other hand, it’s possible that BT and mobile operator Vodafone would bid less aggressively for immediately usable spectrum since they already have plenty. Either way, the consumer benefit from having a competitive four-player market is likely to be high. Kepler analysts reckon average revenue per user in neighbouring France fell by 30 percent after Iliad joined the market as a fourth player. A 2009 paper in the RAND Journal of Economics, meanwhile, estimated that the value to U.S consumers of a competitive market has proved many times higher than the amount the government has earned in wireless licence sales. The hit to Treasury coffers is a sacrifice worth making.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The departure of Kern, who had been at Richemont for 17 years, is a blow after the maker of Cartier, IWC, Montblanc and other top brands recently moved to a new management structure that split the top role between a handful of heir-apparents to the post. Swiss newspaper Le Temps reported that Kern had taken a stake in rival Swiss watchmaker Breitling and planned to try to revive that brand. Breitling declined to comment on the report.  Georges has been offered an interesting opportunity to become an entrepreneur,  Chairman Johann Rupert said in a statement.  He has had a very successful career at IWC Schaffhausen and we wish him well.  Kern, who steered watchmaker IWC Schaffhausen for 15 years, was previously seen going head-to-head for the CEO job with former Montblanc executive Jerome Lambert.  Kern was touted as a potential future CEO of the group but the company has recently moved to a committee structure after Richard Lepeu retired as CEO,  Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.  He may have just thought the structure wasn't for him.  In a reshuffle announced last November, Lambert assumed responsibility for all businesses outside jewellery and watchmaking, while Kern was appointed head of watchmaking, marketing and digital. They assumed their new roles just under four months ago. Richemont's other brands include Jaeger-LeCoultre, Van Cleef & Arpels and Piaget. Luxury watchmakers have been struggling with dwindling demand in their biggest markets, Hong Kong and the United States, and growing competition from the likes of Apple. Change at the Top The unconventional move to abolish the top executive role came as part of chairman and leading investor Rupert's efforts to refresh the Geneva-based group's ageing management team and board. Rene Weber, a luxury specialist at Swiss bank Vontobel, said rumours had been circulating about Kern's possible departure for months, making his resignation only  half a surprise .  We recognised (Kern) as a strong leader and an emotional person, who could also sometimes cause friction,  Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said in a note on Friday.  Apparently, the new role didn't allow him to fulfill his potential.  The group has been hard hit by a severe and prolonged watch industry downturn, which saw Richemont's timepiece sales - accounting for just under half of group revenue - plummet 15 percent last year. Despite some recovery in recent months, Richemont in May struck a cautious note, citing worries over volatile geopolitical and trading climates. Analysts said they didn't see Kern's departure as a reflection of any underlying problems with the watchmaking division.  We don't assume the abrupt shift is related to any deterioration in the watch business,  Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said, pointing to recent improvements in Richemont's watch sales. Watchmaking -- as well as marketing and digital activities -- will now report directly to the senior executive committee, Richemont said.

Cosmo Dinardo's attorney, Paul Lang, said Dinardo made his confession to Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub and told investigators where the bodies were buried in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. Video aired by KYW-TV showed the handcuffed Dinardo emerging from a meeting with authorities and telling reporters  I'm sorry  when asked what he had to say to the families of the men.  He confessed to his participation or commission in the murders of the four young men. In exchange for that confession, Mr. Dinardo was promised by the district attorney that he will spare his life by not invoking the death penalty,  Lang told reporters in Doylestown, where the district attorney's office is located. Weintraub has not commented on any confession, but his office posted a message on Twitter that included a video of Lang's comments to reporters. Jimi Patrick, 19, of Newtown Township, has been missing since last Wednesday and Mark Sturgis, 22, of Pennsburg, and Thomas Meo, 21, of Plumstead Township, and Finocchiaro of Middletown Township have been missing since Friday. Dinardo was arrested on Wednesday and charged with stealing and trying to sell a car owned by one of the men. Police found Meo's Nissan Maxima on the farm early on Sunday morning and discovered the car's title, unsigned by Meo, along with his insulin kit for diabetes.

Courtesy Bucks County District Attorney's Office/Handout via REUTERSWeintraub said at a news conference on Wednesday, “I feel that we bought ourselves a little bit of time in charging Mr. Dinardo with the stolen car case today,  and he referenced that Dinardo's bail had been set at $5 million.     Dinardo had been arrested on Monday at his home for owning a gun he was not allowed to possess because he had previously been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, prosecutors said. He was released after his father posted a bond. Cadaver dogs found 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro's body on Wednesday along with remains of other people not yet identified in a 12-foot-deep (3.7-meter) common grave on the 90-acre (36.4 hectare) farm in Solebury, Pennsylvania.  This was a homicide. Make no doubt about it,  Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said at an overnight news conference. He did not say how Finocchiaro died.  Weintraub has said there were indications that some or all of the men knew one another and investigators were working to confirm the extent of any connections.   The Bucks County District Attorney's office wrote in a Twitter message that Weintraub would hold a press conference at 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) on Friday.

One of the biggest investments in that year was the purchase of the country's third largest bank Nova KBM which was bought by U.S. investment firm Apollo Global Management and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for a total of 250 million euros. Slovenia is trying to attract more foreign investment in order to reduce unemployment and ensure long-term economic growth by giving financial support to investors from abroad. In March the government awarded financial support to three foreign investment projects which include Canadian car parts maker Magna International's plan to build a paint shop in Slovenia and Japanese Yaskawa Electric's plan to build a robot factory in the country. Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks in 2013, returned to growth a year later and the government expects the export-oriented economy to expand by 3.6 percent this year versus 2.5 percent in 2016.

Liu Xiaobo, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and was allowed to visit him in prison about once a month.  Liu Xiaobo died on Thursday after suffering multiple organ failure. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Liu Xia was at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated over the past couple of weeks. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and also called for authorities to grant his wife and the rest of his family freedom of movement. China responded by lodging  stern representations  with countries that made remarks about Liu Xiaobo, including the United States, expressing its firm opposition, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing. China also lambasted Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen for her comments on Liu and her calls for China to embrace democracy, saying her behavior was  very dangerous . Geng said he had no information about Liu Xia, but added that the entry and exit of Chinese citizens would be handled in accordance with the law.  Let's not make any prejudgments here,  he responded, when pressed on whether Liu Xia was allowed to leave the country. He did not elaborate. Mo Shaoping, Liu Xiaobo's lawyer, said there was no legal reason for China to prevent Liu Xia from leaving the country. Related CoverageChina says Taiwan remarks on dissident Liu 'very dangerous'Nobel Peace chief says China declined her visa application But China is not a country with pure rule of law, so it is possible they will ignore the law and stop her from going,  he added. In an interview, Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she shared the compassion of people over Liu's death. Hu Jia, a fellow dissident and family friend, said:  Now, we are most concerned about Liu Xia, but there has been no information about her.   All the willpower and force we put behind freeing Liu Xiaobo, we have turned to Liu Xia,  he said. Efforts should also focus on Liu Hui, the younger brother of Liu Xia, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2013 for fraud and to whom Liu Xia is very close, Hu added.  Several other friends said they were unable to reach Liu Xia, who suffers from depression, or confirm her whereabouts. FILE PHOTO - Liu Xia, the wife of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, talks to the media in Beijing February 11, 2010.Nir Elias/File PhotoEfforts are being made to secure permission from Chinese authorities for Liu Xia and Liu Hui to leave, a Western diplomat said, but it was unclear if they would succeed.  Diplomatic sources also said that, before her husband's hospitalization, Liu Xia had expressed a wish to go to Germany, in telephone calls with the German embassy. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, said it was  deeply worried  about Liu Xia's situation. Its leader, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said the Chinese embassy in Oslo had declined to receive her visa application for travel so she could attend Liu's funeral.   I was told that my visa application was incorrectly filled in ... because I did not have an invitation from the person I was visiting,  Reiss-Andersen told Reuters. Slideshow (8 Images)The Shenyang justice department released a video clip of Liu Xiaobo's treatment, emphasizing that his family had a history of liver cancer and that family members were involved in the treatment process and informed of developments. Funeral Arrangements Friends have begun calling to be allowed to join in Liu Xiaobo's funeral arrangements and support his wife and family. More than 150 friends and supporters have signed an open letter announcing plans for an  online memorial  to Liu, urging authorities to release his body and allow a public funeral.   We will pay close attention to how Liu Xiaobo's funeral will be arranged,  said Shanghai-based writer Wen Kejian, another friend of the family.  We, at the very least, hope to have the opportunity to go to Shenyang or Beijing to send him off.   Liu's remains were taken to Shenyang's Xiheyuan funeral parlor, a source close to the family said, but a Reuters reporter was turned away on Friday. Shenyang authorities forced half-a-dozen supporters of Liu who went to pay their respects to leave, or detained them, said Beijing-based rights activist Li Yu, who is tracking the situation. News of Liu's death prompted an outpouring of grief online, with many liberals, lawyers, dissidents and journalists sharing articles and posting on messaging app WeChat. But censors were swift to act. An article titled,  Speaking of heroes, who is a hero?  from respected business publication Caixin was taken down after being shared by many of Liu Xiaobo's supporters, despite making no mention of him.  The deceased has gone, the feigned sorrow is really preposterous,  the state-backed Global Times tabloid said in a social media post that appeared to mock mourners.  We will just eat watermelon and watch for the night.  Ye Du, a writer and friend of Liu's, said he hoped people would be able to commemorate Liu Xiaobo, adding,  Liu Xia will surely be monitored and controlled .

Three traders told Reuters they have cut the amount of oil they hold in tanks or decided not to renew storage contracts in the past year. A shift away from storage could potentially be bad news for tank operators running in the region like the Netherlands' Vopak and Oiltanking, a subsidiary of Hamburg-based Marquard & Bahls. Oiltanking declined comment.  But Vopak said it is focused on long term imbalances.   Our business is mainly serving structural product flows and is therefore relatively limited exposed to contango and backwardation situation,  a company spokeswoman said.  Storage in this backwardated market makes no sense as we won't be able to recoup the costs to store the oil,  said a Singapore-based trader in middle distillates, a group of oil products including gasoil and jet fuel.  Backwardation refers to a market where prices for prompt-loading cargoes are higher than for months further out, making storage uneconomical. The trader, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media, added that his firm had recently decided not to renew a short-term storage lease.    The Asian gasoil and fuel oil markets have been backwardated for most of this year. The spread between the front-month and second-month gasoil contract climbed to an over three-year high of 50 cents a barrel this week, while the fuel oil spread is trading at parity, compared with about minus $4 a tonne at the same time last year. To make money by holding oil products in tanks, the spread between gasoil prices for future months needs to be at about minus 60 to 70 cents a barrel or less to cover the cost of leasing tank space and borrowing the money to buy the fuel to fill it.  And traders who are keeping some oil products in storage are putting pressure on tank operators to reduce rates, the sources said.  For instance, oil trader Glencore has reduced its storage lease volume of middle distillates, while oil trader Vitol may be giving up some tank space for fuel oil though discussions are still ongoing, the three traders said. Glencore declined to comment, while Vitol did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  Storage rates for middle distillates have dropped to about S$6.50 ($4.72) to S$7 per cubic meter from S$7.50 to S$8.50 around 1 to 2 years ago, while fuel oil tank rates have fallen to about S$5 to S$6 from S$6.50 to S$7 a few years ago, they said. Many traders are also re-negotiating contracts to shorter time periods of six months to 1 year, from longer term contracts of 2 to 5 years previously, two sources from storage operators said.  Expanding capacity in the Johor Straits between Singapore and Malaysia has also put pressure on tank rates.  Oiltanking commissioned the Karimun terminal with a total storage capacity of 730,000 cubic meters in mid-2016, while Jurong Port and Oiltanking are building a 200,000 cubic meter storage facility in Singapore, to be ready by 2019.   Traders are also opting to store fuel oil in tankers as freight rates for very large crude carriers have halved from 1-1/2 years ago, the sources said.   Tankers provide more flexibility as they can meet bunker demand quickly without having to load and unload in tanks,  said a Singapore-based fuel oil trader.

Many financial companies have said they will move some British jobs to continental Europe to keep serving clients in the single market. However Hays said it had not received requests to make large-scale hires in Europe.  The reality on the ground is there has been little or no movement at all so far,  Finance Director Paul Venables said.  Most of the clients we deal with have the headcount they want for the market and their views for the next couple of years. The positive in banking in London is that leavers are being replaced,  he added. Rival PageGroup said on Tuesday that financial companies were talking about moving only very small teams to the continent. On Wednesday, smaller group Robert Walters said banks continued to hire significant numbers of people in London and that it had yet to see jobs move to Europe. Hays said hiring for banking in Britain, which accounts for 8 percent of the group's UK net fee, had been flat since November. Venables forecast that the UK banking market would remain  stable and subdued  with European banking not seeing any pickup for  a period of time . Asked whether Hays had been given any future visibility by the banks around potential size of jobs, Venables said:  I don't think you're right in saying huge mandates. If you looked across all of the statements that have been made, it is still around the edges.  Beyond the banking sector, Hays said hiring by private firms in the UK and Ireland, which accounts for a quarter of its gross profit, had seen modest improvements and forecast similar hiring trends for the remaining year. Net fees from its UK and Ireland operations fell 5 percent year-on-year at constant currencies for its fourth quarter which ended June 30, but group net fees climbed 7 due to an uptick in Europe and Asia Pacific. Hays, which operates in 33 markets, estimated a marginal beat to full-year operating expectations of 209.5 million pounds ($271.5 million), and Venables said the group would invest in growing European markets such as Germany, France and Poland. Shares is Hays were up 0.4 percent at 168.2 pence at 1108 GMT, in-line with the Stoxx Europe 600 Price Index.

JERA contacted the sellers after Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) ruled two weeks ago that new long-term LNG contracts signed with Japanese buyers could not have destination restrictions, or clauses that mandate where a cargo can be delivered and limit buyers from reselling excess gas. Removing the destination clauses would radically alter the Asian LNG marketplace. Sellers have insisted on the measures for years. However, amid a glut of new supply from Australia and the United States and slackening end-user demand that has left them unable to absorb their current supply, buyers are demanding more flexibility in their contracts.  We have already taken action to approach sellers,  JERA's Senior Executive Vice President Hiroki Sato told Reuters in an interview on Friday.  We still need further discussions on details, but it looks like this would be accepted.  JERA, a joint venture between Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric, recently began to contact its existing long-term contract sellers to explain the FTC's finding. Sato did not say which sellers were contacted.  Hiroki Sato, the world's biggest LNG buyer JERA Co., Inc. Senior Executive Vice President, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan July 14, 2017.Issei KatoJERA imports 40 million tonnes a year of LNG, including about 35 million tonnes under long-term contracts. Other Japanese buyers are also looking to change their contracts. Tokyo Gas, the country's biggest city-gas buyer, said on Thursday that it would seek more flexibility in its new contracts. Slideshow (2 Images)JERA would not try to lift or mitigate the destination restrictions in all existing contracts, said Sato, because trying to revise a contract that expires in the near future would be meaningless, for example.    There is a chance that sellers may ask buyers to make concessions in return for removing destination constraints.  That includes a request to raise prices,  he said.  But FTC takes a legal approach and it's not commercial. So if there were sellers to make that demand, they do not understand FTC's guidance at all.      Sato negotiated the first destination-free contract in Asia in 2000 when he worked for Chubu Electric. He has worked for more than a year to convince sellers to remove the clauses from upcoming contracts.  There is no change in our insistence of not accepting destination clauses in new contracts, but we now have an official legal backing,  he said.

Some 16 million people are in need of humanitarian aid across areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda - 30 percent more than in late 2016 and their number expected to increase in the coming months, the U.N. food agency said.    This is the third season in a row that families have had to endure failed rains - they are simply running out of ways to cope,  said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  Support is needed now before the situation rapidly deteriorates further,  said Burgeon.     Affected regions received less than half of their normal rainfall form March to May leaving crops scorched and pushing cereal prices up to near-record levels in most markets, the FAO said in a statement. Damage was exacerbated by infestations of crop-eating caterpillars known as fall armyworms that have been ravaging harvests in several regions, the agency said.  Dry pastures and water shortages also left thousands of animals dead or emaciated, curtailing milk production.  When we know how critical milk is for the healthy development of children aged under five, and the irreversible damage its lack can create,  said Burgeon. The situation was particularly alarming for herdsmen in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, who are at risk of losing more animals that are entering the dry season in already very poor  conditions, the FAO said.

The agreement will fund the growth of an additional 300 American Family Care urgent care franchises throughout the United States, more than doubling its existing footprint of more than 170 clinics, according to the company.  American Family Care will remain owned by its founders. It will continue to invest its own capital in new franchises and wholly owned clinics.  American Development Partners will finance the acquisition and development of land for the urgent care centers, and will purchase equipment and provide working capital. It will recoup its investment by collecting lease payments from franchisees.   This isn't a private equity infusion per se,  said William Koleszar, chief marketing officer at American Family Care in an interview.   It's private capital working with small business owners to make healthcare more accessible to local communities.   The new facilities will be primarily focused in states that American Family Care considers likely to have strong uptake of urgent care centers, ranging from Florida, to Illinois, to Texas.  Birmingham, Alabama-based American Family Care was founded by Bruce Irwin and now serves more than 3 million patients per year.  Urgent care has benefited in recent years by a drive by insurers and health providers to cut costs. Based on the same principles as retailers, urgent care centers aim to offer a cheaper and more efficient alternative to visting a doctor's office or emergency room. They typically promise to service patients on a walk-in basis and accept payments for services like x-rays or stitches from people with or without health insurance.  Earlier this year, buyout firm Warburg Pincus LLC acquired a majority stake in urgent care provider CityMD, valuing it at around $600 million, Reuters reported.

Their arrival comes as the Italian government, looking to stem the flow of migrants into the country, has drawn up a draft code of conduct for non-governmental organisations operating in the Mediterranean. The interior ministry said that up until July 13, some 86,123 migrants had come to Italy so far this year, up 10 percent on the same period in 2016. While NGOs have criticised plans for a code of conduct, saying it will make it more difficult to help migrants fleeing poverty and war, a United Nations spokeswoman said Italy needed more help dealing with the crisis.

Force One? Force Racing? The Indian businessman says a new name will be a commercial decision driven by potential sponsors looking for global exposure with a team not defined by geography.  When I bought this team 10 years ago now...I could have called it Mallya Formula One or Kingfisher Formula One,  he told Reuters at the British Grand Prix.  I was passionate about putting an Indian team on the grid. Now, things have changed. Force India is getting very limited in terms of potential.  The Indian Grand Prix is gone, sadly. There are no Indian sponsors who’ve come to the table. They seem to be spending all their money on cricket. And I need for the continuing financial stability of this team to reach out to more international sponsors.  In the early years of Force India, a Silverstone-based team previously known as Jordan, Midland and Spyker, Mallya was asked regularly about the absence of sponsors not connected to his own beer and liquor empire. There was speculation about the team finances and whether the then-billionaire, whose empire has since crumbled, was committed to the long-term. Mallya, wanted in India with extradition proceedings pending following the collapse of his Kingfisher airline, tells a different story now.  We have to think about positioning the team for the next 10 years. We’re doing well, thanks to the efforts of everybody involved and we’ve got a whole bunch of new sponsors,  said the 61-year-old.  We are in touch with some sponsors who are very interested in a title sponsorship arrangement. We’ll see how that all progresses.  Force One A string of companies using the Force One name were recently registered by the team.  Force One was the most obvious that came to mind. The first thing you do is find out if the name is available and register it before somebody else takes it. so I went through the process. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be Force One,  he said.  There may be other options. When I was up at the factory on Tuesday this week somebody suggested why don’t we just call ourselves Force Racing.  Mallya would not speculate on when a decision would be made.  You can’t change the name of a team frequently. It’s not done. Force India is well known now. The average fan understands and relates to Force India. We’ve built up this name over 10 years,  he said.  We need to make sure that whatever we decide upon is another 10 year programme. That’s one of the reasons why we were all keen to retain the Force bit of it. There’s some continuity.  Mallya started the season with Force India on a high, targeting third place after achieving a best-ever fourth. They are still behind the big three, with Mallya experiencing highs and lows as Mexican Sergio Perez and French rookie Esteban Ocon threw away a possible double podium in Azerbaijan in June while performing strongly elsewhere.  I was merrily sitting in front of my big screen, headphones on, looking at my computer and thinking that a podium was in the pocket in Baku and then I saw what happened. I almost broke the bloody television, I was so angry,  he said.  But I am enjoying the strong performance of the team.  He is also enjoying rubbing the results in the face of Renault, whose boss Cyril Abiteboul had warned before the season started that Force India might struggle to maintain the pace of development.  Some of my French friends said that they would be ahead of us and feared that we would suffer during the season. We are fourth and my French friends are eighth,  he said.

Some 16 million people are in need of humanitarian aid across areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda - 30 percent more than in late 2016 and their number expected to increase in the coming months, the U.N. food agency said.    This is the third season in a row that families have had to endure failed rains - they are simply running out of ways to cope,  said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  Support is needed now before the situation rapidly deteriorates further,  said Burgeon.     Affected regions received less than half of their normal rainfall form March to May leaving crops scorched and pushing cereal prices up to near-record levels in most markets, the FAO said in a statement. Damage was exacerbated by infestations of crop-eating caterpillars known as fall armyworms that have been ravaging harvests in several regions, the agency said.  Dry pastures and water shortages also left thousands of animals dead or emaciated, curtailing milk production.  When we know how critical milk is for the healthy development of children aged under five, and the irreversible damage its lack can create,  said Burgeon. The situation was particularly alarming for herdsmen in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, who are at risk of losing more animals that are entering the dry season in already very poor  conditions, the FAO said.

Winners of nine of their last 11, the National League Central-leading Brewers aim to continue their surge as they return from the All-Star break on Friday to host the Phillies in the opener of a three-game series. Stephen Vogt has added some punch since being acquired off waivers from Oakland, belting his fourth homer with Milwaukee in Sunday's 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees.  We like where we're at,  Vogt told reporters.  I think we're all excited to have the break, but excited to come back and get it going again and make a push.  While the Brewers are interested in fending off the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis, Philadelphia is doing its best to look at the rare positives despite being saddled with the majors' worst record at 29-58.

Pivetta has surrendered seven homers in his last four outings and 12 in 11 trips to the mound. A positive was that he did not walk a batter during his seven-inning start against the Padres after issuing at least three free passes in six of his previous eight games. Davies won his third straight start and improved to 5-1 in his last seven outings on July 6 after yielding two runs on five hits in six innings of an 11-2 rout of the Chicago Cubs.  Personally, (10 wins is) something that kind of makes you happy,  the 24-year-old told reporters.  There are personal goals that you want to hit, but at the same time, we want to play in October.

The Yankees get an opportunity to chip into their bitter rival's 3 1/2-game lead atop the division when they visit the Red Sox on Friday night in the opener of a four-game series. New York has dropped 18 of 25 to yield first place to Boston and faces the daunting prospect of kicking off the second half with an 11-game road trip.  Every series is crucial, but especially playing the Red Sox,  said Yankees rookie sensation Aaron Judge, who leads the majors with 30 homers and won the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game.  They're in first place right now, so it's going to be big for us.  The Red Sox lost four of their last five before the break to close out a 10-game trek and are 1-4 against New York, scoring one run or fewer in each of the four losses. First baseman Mitch Moreland was a first-half surprise for Boston, but he did not have a homer or an RBI in his last 11 games after going deep in three straight contests. TV: 7:10 p.m. ET, MLB Network, YES (New York), NESN (Boston) PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees TBD vs. Red Sox LH Drew Pomeranz (9-4, 3.60 ERA) Manager Joe Girardi declined to reveal his rotation, but CC Sabathia, Masahiro Tanaka, Luis Severino and Michael Pineda each have turned in dominant efforts against Boston this season. Tanaka turned in a clunker last Sunday, so Sabathia could get the nod. The veteran lefty lasted only 2 2/3 innings versus Toronto on July 4 in his first start since coming off the disabled list, but he blanked Boston for eight innings on June 7. Pomeranz is riding a three-start winning streak and is unbeaten in his last five turns, allowing a combined six earned runs during that stretch. He earned Boston's only win over the Yankees this season with five innings of two-run ball at Yankee Stadium on June 6 to improve to 2-1 with a 2.40 in six appearances (five starts) versus New York. Judge is 2-for-2 and Didi Gregorius 6-for-11 with a homer against Pomeranz. Walk-Offs 1. Yankees DH Matt Holliday, who last played on June 24 due to a viral infection, is expected back in the lineup Friday. 2. Boston closer RHP Craig Kimbrel has struck out more than half the batters (68 of 134) he has faced this season. 3.

The 23-year-old DeJong has 10 hits in his last 13 at-bats and became the first Cardinals player in the modern era to collect seven extra-base hits in a three-game series. DeJong, who is riding a six-game hitting streak, homered for the third straight day in a 6-0 rout of the New York Mets on Sunday and also went deep in a 4-3 loss to Pittsburgh on June 23. Like St. Louis, the Pirates are slowly turning around their fortunes and reside below the .500 mark to find themselves looking up at upstart Milwaukee in the National League Central. Pittsburgh's lone All-Star, Josh Harrison, highlighted a three hit-performance with a homer in Sunday's 14-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs to help his team sail to its fifth win in the last six games. Harrison was mired in a 2-for-28 stretch before that outing and is 4-for-19 versus the Cardinals this season.

The 29-year-old has recorded a pair of quality starts versus Pittsburgh this season, including an 8-4 win on June 25 to improve to 10-5 in 30 career starts against the Pirates. Despite a positive win-loss record, Leake has struggled against the likes of former Cardinal David Freese (.471) and Jordy Mercer (.375). Cole answered a pair of disastrous starts in which he yielded seven earned runs in back-to-back outings by permitting two or fewer in four of his last five. Included in that stretch is a sterling effort versus St. Louis on June 24, when the 26-year-old allowed one run on five hits in six innings of a 7-3 triumph. Cole also pitched six strong frames against the Cardinals on April 19, but has endured considerable trouble when facing Matt Carpenter (12-for-32, four homers) in his career. Walk-Offs 1.

Trout was off to a superb start as he batted .337 with 16 homers and 36 RBIs prior to his injury, and the Angels hope his presence can help jump-start the team. Los Angeles (45-47) dropped seven of its last 10 contests prior to the All-Star break and sits just three games behind in the AL wild-card race. The Rays (47-43) currently possess one of the wild-card spots, but it is a crowded competition as seven teams lurking within five games of a berth.

Faria walked four in six innings while defeating Boston in his last turn after handing out a total of five free passes in his first five outings. Nolasco has served up 25 homers in just 101 1/3 innings - three shy of his career-high total from 2008 while with Miami. The 34-year-old surrendered three blasts in a loss to the Rays on May 24, when he gave up five runs and seven hits in six frames. Nolasco, who is 3-7 with a 6.67 ERA in 10 career starts against Tampa Bay, gave up two homers to Steven Souza Jr. and one to Colby Rasmus in the May defeat. Walk-Offs 1.

New York could benefit from deGrom's continued dominance as the team has been outscored 36-14 en route to losing five of six to drop to eight games under .500. While the Mets haven't provided much juice in that stretch, Jay Bruce has fared well by going 7-for-17 with three homers and four RBIs in his last four contests and went 10-for-30 with three blasts and eight RBIs last season versus Colorado. The Rockies are not shy about scoring runs as their potent offense has the team 13 games over .500, although it resides in third place in the top-heavy National League West.

The 25-year-old overcame eight hits on July 5 and tossed 108 pitches over 5 2/3 innings of a 5-3 victory versus Cincinnati. Gray helped his cause by launching a monstrous 467-foot homer in the second inning. After yielding a single run in each of his previous four outings, deGrom surrendered a career-high four homers over seven innings in a 6-5 victory at St. Louis last Friday.

The Giants have lost 98 out of their past 162 games dating back to last season’s All-Star break, and executive vice president of baseball operations Brian Sabean said the team will consider moving everyone with the exception of Buster Posey, Madison Bumgarner and Brandon Crawford. “To watch us literally hope to win one game in a series … I mean, I can’t remember a season, and I’ve been here since ’93, whether it’s home or road, that we’ve been swept so many times,” Sabean told the Mercury News. “That to me is a sign of our total ineptitude.” Expectations going into the season were much lower for the rebuilding Padres, who are hoping for continued growth from youngsters Jose Pirela, Manuel Margot, Hunter Renfroe and others in the second half.

With talks due to start next month between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mexican officials have stressed the need to craft a new deal that would strengthen the region against competitors, particularly in Asia. Trump has threatened to ditch NAFTA if he cannot rework it to the benefit of the United States, arguing it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. Mexican officials say a revamped NAFTA must further integrate the region and are awaiting U.S. negotiating objectives, due to be published on or around Sunday. They point to sectors like autos, where U.S. inputs make up some 40 percent of the value of products imported into the United States from Mexico, while Chinese exports contain only 4 percent, according to the U.S. Center for Automotive Research.  If we integrate further and make Mexico more competitive versus China ... even if our exports rise, U.S. jobs will rise, because when we export (to the United States), they're exporting too (via U.S. content),  said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who led the initial NAFTA negotiations for Mexico. However, mindful that Trump needs to be able to claim a more obvious win from the shake-up, they are also looking at rules governing how much of a product is made in the region. NAFTA rules of origin stipulate that to qualify for tariff-free access, some products need to be sourced to a certain degree regionally. Cars, a recurring point of attack for Trump, must meet a threshold of 62.5 percent. Because raising that threshold would not automatically benefit U.S. workers - firms could just expand capacity in Mexico - Trump's trade team want to have some national content rules within the regional framework, Mexican officials say. 'A Tricky Issue' Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is coordinating the private sector's role in the renegotiation, said they may explore domestic content rules on certain products.  It'll be a tricky issue, and we'll have to see case by case,  he said. Kalach declined to say what goods might be eligible. In May, he said a revamped NAFTA might source more work for future product lines from the region. The Mexican electronics industry wants to increase regional production of some components to reduce reliance on Asia, said Cesar Castro, vice president of electronics industry group Canieti. About 70 percent of content in electronic goods exported by Mexico to the United States is sourced from Asia, he said, highlighting products that would have a big slice of Chinese content even if manufactured by U.S. companies. To boost North American output, Canieti is considering a proposal that could see regional content in certain products raised from 5 percent to 50 percent over 10 years, Castro said. Bargaining Chips If Mexico's arguments fall flat, however, and Trump threatens to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods, the sizeable U.S. surplus in services with Mexico could end up as a bargaining chip. That could complement Mexican efforts to target the big U.S. agricultural surplus with Mexico, which the Trump administration is already feeling pressure to preserve. Mexico could insist companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc build servers in the country, said a former Mexican official familiar with discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity.  As the U.S.'s second biggest market, it's clear we can hit back,  said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister.  (Services are worth) more and more every day.

Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos. The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday.  This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,  said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds.  I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO.  Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up. Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added. The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles. Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit. Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook.  We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,  noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares. Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion.  In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York. Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said.  They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,  he said.

Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the  worst trade deal ever  in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America's favor. But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tNMtlc) Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers.  Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,  said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado. Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork. Mexico became even more crucial after Trump's pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers' hopes of free access to more markets. Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration's goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer's list. Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump's inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump's ear.  Our first ask is to do no harm,  said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group. Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August. Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association, Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land O'Lakes, Inc., Tyson Foods, Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company North America, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and others. For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA  would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.  Quadrupling Exports Annual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA. Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers' case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices. Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture's cause in NAFTA and beyond.  He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,  Roberts said.  I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it's going to make life much more difficult in farm country,  Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June. In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the  tremendous growth  in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA.  Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,  they warned. Trump's pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers.  What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state's low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said. Storm Over Sunny Slope Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers' angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer's Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA.  If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,  said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion. While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico's ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump's  America First  mantra.  The common comment is: 'why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?'  said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council.  The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,  he said. It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that.  I think President Trump is a negotiator,  he said.  I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.

The agreement will fund the growth of an additional 300 American Family Care urgent care franchises throughout the United States, more than doubling its existing footprint of more than 170 clinics, according to the company.  American Family Care will remain owned by its founders. It will continue to invest its own capital in new franchises and wholly owned clinics.  American Development Partners will finance the acquisition and development of land for the urgent care centers, and will purchase equipment and provide working capital. It will recoup its investment by collecting lease payments from franchisees.   This isn't a private equity infusion per se,  said William Koleszar, chief marketing officer at American Family Care in an interview.   It's private capital working with small business owners to make healthcare more accessible to local communities.   The new facilities will be primarily focused in states that American Family Care considers likely to have strong uptake of urgent care centers, ranging from Florida, to Illinois, to Texas.  Birmingham, Alabama-based American Family Care was founded by Bruce Irwin and now serves more than 3 million patients per year.  Urgent care has benefited in recent years by a drive by insurers and health providers to cut costs. Based on the same principles as retailers, urgent care centers aim to offer a cheaper and more efficient alternative to visting a doctor's office or emergency room. They typically promise to service patients on a walk-in basis and accept payments for services like x-rays or stitches from people with or without health insurance.  Earlier this year, buyout firm Warburg Pincus LLC acquired a majority stake in urgent care provider CityMD, valuing it at around $600 million, Reuters reported.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers. Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.  There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,  said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.  They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,  said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.  Not Finding a Place With Consumers  The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J) The new Accord and Camry  may stem the decline,  said IHS Markit's Tom Libby.  I don't think they will cause a marked reverse.  Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said.  As a dealer we can't ask for much more.

We wrote about 40 songs and you have to cut down 40 songs to a 12, 13-song album. And you kind of lose a lot of songs that are quite personal to you, and your heart is quite close to. So it's always sad to see them never released into the world. So I think by doing this two-part album means that we're able to release more music and our fans are able to get more music. The first half the album is a bit more sultry. And the second half, 'Day', is a bit more organic and uplifting. Q: You have created your own label. Do you want to take over the industry? Evans: Yeah we signed an American band, a British band. The newest one is called 'The New Hope Club' ... They've been supporting us for a couple years now and it's really interesting for us to dabble in that kind of world of being behind the screen. And it's really interesting to see a band grow and kind of find themselves. So for us that's really exciting and we love doing this on the side.  Q: Do you get along with each other all the time? MCVEY: It's like a family. We generally get on. So I think that's why we're kind of mates and it's like six years now since I first met Brad ... We've not really had any hiccups or anything. We never had any big fallouts. Q: I heard you guys don’t like to be called a boyband and to be compared with One Direction? EVANS: Our live shows are different. Our music is different. We don't have as good hair as them. So we are different I think. But we are boys in a band so we're a boyband. So yeah, we don't mind at all.  Reporting by Pedro Caiado.

India's more than $150 billion software services sector faces headwinds in its biggest market, the United States, as clients hold back technology spending amid concerns about President Donald Trump's review of a visa program for highly-skilled workers. Net profit rose 1.4 percent to 34.8 billion rupees ($540 million) in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, just a tad above expectations. Infosys retained its annual revenue outlook at between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent growth on a constant currency basis. But Mumbai brokerage Emkay said in a client note that the company's failure to lift its revenue guidance indicated first-quarter pricing gains were not sustainable and profitability could see a  downtick  in the coming quarter on lower growth, wage hikes and rupee appreciation. After Trump targeted outsourcing firms, Infosys said in May it plans to hire 10,000 U.S. workers in the next two years - a move that will likely lead to higher labor costs. It is also due to give annual salary increases to employees this month.  We'll be announcing the compensation hikes and we are also ramping up the U.S. talent model,  Finance Chief M.D. Ranganath told reporters. The Indian rupee has also risen 5.4 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, adding to the woes of outsourcers who bill for the majority of their services in foreign currencies. But Infosys fared better than bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services which missed analysts' expectations on Thursday with a 6 percent drop in first-quarter profit. Shares in Infosys, valued at about $35 billion, ended 0.5 percent lower. Infosys has had a rocky year with some founders and former executives of the company publicly accusing its board of governance lapses and urging it to reward shareholders through a share buyback. The company plans to return about $2 billion to shareholders this financial year, but has yet to detail the manner of the payout. At end-June, Infosys had a record $6.1 billion cash balance, Ranganath said.  IT outsourcing firms are also facing pressure as traditional businesses such as routine infrastructure maintenance are seeing their margins squeezed as clients demand more work for less money, pushing the sector to develop cloud, data analytics and cyber security services. Infosys lost one client in its $100 million category during the quarter from the previous quarter, but total active clients rose by a net of 2 to 1,164.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the EPA's request for extra time to examine its next steps in court before being required to enforce the law, which says oil and gas companies must check for and fix methane leaks in their equipment. The 14-day period is far shorter than the minimum of 52 days the agency requested in a July 7 court filing.   To stay issuance of the mandate for longer would hand the agency, in all practical effect, the very delay in implementation this panel determined to be 'arbitrary, capricious and in excess of EPA's statutory authority',  the court ruled.  An EPA spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency on June 5 announced a halt to the rule after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter that the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But environmental groups sued the EPA, arguing that the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations, and the appeals court agreed.  The court reaffirmed the importance of ensuring that its decision vacating Administrator Pruitt's unlawful suspension of these clean-air protections limiting oil and gas pollution swiftly take effect,  said Peter Zalzal, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups suing the agency, in a news release issued after the ruling.

Worries over the potential bursting of price bubbles in China's biggest cities have led to a flurry of government cooling measures in recent months as buyer demand appeared to be more resilient than expected. The growth rate of new construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developer confidence and correspondingly volatile, almost halved to 5.2 percent in May from April's 10.1 percent on a yearly basis, suggesting a sharp slowdown in the commencement of new projects, a Reuters calculation showed. Meanwhile growth in property investment, which mainly focuses on residential real estate but also includes commercial and office space, eased to 7.3 percent in May from a year earlier, versus 9.6 percent in April, Reuters calculated from the National Bureau of Statistics' data. Investors, banned from the hottest markets, are increasingly looking inland, driving up prices in more remote, smaller cities with fewer buying restrictions, leading to a surprise pick-up in May sales. The area of property sold grew 10.2 percent in May, compared with a 7.7 percent increase in April, reflecting a quickening in destocking of existing homes in smaller cities, a Reuters' calculation showed. Inventory floor area in the first five months dropped at a quicker pace of 8.5 percent, compared to a fall of 7.2 percent in the January-to-April period.  It's been very obvious in the past two months that the buying demand has spilled over to the third- and fourth-tier cities,  said Joe Zhou, head of research for China at real-estate agent Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL). But such forces are unlikely to offset the fast-cooling market in bigger cities in the longer term, as regulators continued to intensify the crackdown on speculators with more measures to close loopholes. Sales in the top tier cities have dropped about 50 percent from the same period a year ago, property analysts say. In May, China issued draft new rules for property sales and leasing, requiring developers to promptly publish accurate price information for new homes on sale, barring them from charging various additional fees, hoarding unsold homes or spreading false information about rising prices. Some cities have also announced more stringent measures such as introducing price caps on new units and setting a holding period before reselling a property is permitted. Analysts say developers remain cautious about growth potential in those smaller cities and are still focusing largely on bigger cities as their core revenue driver.  This kind of spill-over demand is at its peak, and probably will only last for one or two quarters,  JLL's Zhou said.  Developers were too optimistic about third- and fourth-tier cities a few years back, and they wouldn't increase new starts there even if sales are a bit better now.  Developers continue to be squeezed as authorities tightened controls on their funding channels. Bankers and developers told Reuters in May that China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which approves corporate debt issuance, has virtually stopped granting new quotas for offshore bond sales this quarter. Chinese home-buyers also face rising borrowing costs. Media have reported that some banks in major Chinese cities have raised their mortgage rates. Nonetheless, chances that property prices would fall across the board in the future are slim because housing supply remains short in the big cities, a top state think-tank said on May 15.

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the sale on Aug. 16 would offer leases offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for exploration and development. The sale will be the first of the administration's 2017-22 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.  Zinke signed an order last week to hold more lease sales and speed up approvals of permits to explore for oil and gas, a process he said got bogged down under former President Barack Obama. Zinke told reporters on Thursday that offshore royalties returned about $18 billion to taxpayers in 2008, before Obama took office, but had dwindled to $2.6 billion last year. He acknowledged that 2008 was an  abnormal year  because of high oil and gas prices, but he said drilling expanded on private lands where developers saw a better return on their investment and fewer regulatory hurdles.  Some of it was oil and gas price, some of it was, the signal was clear: that we're not in the business as a government to deliver on oil and gas,  Zinke said. The Interior Department said it would lower royalty rates for shallow-water leases in the August sale to encourage drilling by oil companies, which have faced lower profits during years of sustained low global crude prices. Energy companies will pay 12.5 percent royalty rates for leases in less than 200 meters (656 feet) of water, instead of a rate of 18.75 percent that had been proposed earlier.    The rate change reflects this Administration's willingness to swiftly respond to economic indicators,  said Vincent DeVito, counselor to Zinke on energy policy.  The 12.5 percent royalty rate is closer in harmony with the current market and federal onshore lease sales,  he said.

By not saying when its net bond purchases will fall to zero, the ECB hopes to underline that there is no preset course for its stimulus program, and that any changes remain dependent on economic data, with a special focus on wages, the sources added. They held up the Federal Reserve's exit from its asset buying in 2014 as a potential blueprint, noting the U.S. central bank's unwillingness to publicly target an end-date.  The Fed has done the most successful exit so it's the example for us to study,  said a source who asked not to be named.  The important thing is not to pre-commit and keep it very gradual.         ECB President Mario Draghi sent a shockwave through markets earlier this month when he opened the door to potential tweaks to the quantitative easing program. That left investors scrutinizing any potential clues to the bank's next move, which is expected to come at its Sept. 7 meeting. ECB policymakers also meet next Thursday.  Half of analysts polled by Reuters now expect the ECB to announce in September that it will gradually wind down its asset buying, a process known as tapering, while a quarter see a one-off reduction and another quarter expect no change. Related CoverageFactbox: Key quotes from ECB policymakers ahead of July 20 rate meetingSo far, the ECB has said its purchases are intended to run at their current pace until December 2017  or beyond, if necessary  and that there would be winding-down phase after that. The biggest challenge could be convincing markets that tapering, once started, may still be subject to change.  While the Fed emphasized the open-ended nature of its bond purchases, it scaled back the amount it bought by $10 billion at each meeting, creating the perception that it was on a preset course even if that notion was taboo. The Fed announced its first reduction in December 2013 and ended buys the following October. Its policymakers keenly avoided the discussion of an end-date throughout the tapering process, even if markets inferred it and were eventually proven right.  The sources noted that adopting a similar strategy risked entrapping the ECB by making it difficult to deviate from a presumed schedule without generating undue market volatility.    The ECB declined to comment. The sources added that no decision has been made and the debate remains open, with new staff forecasts due in September expected to provide a key piece of the puzzle. Wages  How can I decide in September what we're going to do next June?  another source said.  It's got to be data-dependent and we need to preserve the flexibility.  Of particular importance for policymakers will be German wage negotiations around the start of next year and they are keen to have flexibility to respond, particularly if the results again disappoint. While growth is accelerating and unemployment is falling quicker than expected, wage growth is anemic, partly because unions tend to look at past inflation when tabling demands, making it difficult to escape a low inflation environment.  Next year's German wage deals will be very important,  a third source said.  I think unions are not aggressive enough in making their demands given rising corporate profitability.  The ECB's problem is that even as euro zone economic growth is on its best run in a decade, inflation is expected to remain weak, and well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, at least through 2019.  In a possible clue about the sort of move the ECB may contemplate, Executive Board member Benoit Coeure pointed to the bank's decision last December when it cut its asset buys by a quarter but extended the timetable by nine months.      We scaled back our asset purchases without undermining the support given to the economy,  Coeure said in a recent interview.  So, I would argue that we have already adjusted our monetary policy ... This adjustment has been done in a very careful way, as a number of factors continue to weigh on inflation.  If the ECB is confident its previous move was correct, it may again consider a one-off reduction with a term extension before revisiting the subject later.  Draghi argued earlier this month that with growth alone providing more accommodation, the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of stimulus unchanged.

The new airline, easyJet Europe, will be headquartered in Vienna. The budget airline must have a licence and an air operator's certificate (AOC) in an EU member to allow it to continue flying between and within EU countries after Brexit. The new airline licence in Austria will protect these flights regardless of what happens in negotiations over the status of flights between Britain and the EU after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019. EasyJet said it will re-register 110 planes to fly under the new AOC and it planned to complete this process before Britain leaves the EU. It has said the process will cost 10 million pounds ($13 million), mainly for the re-registering of aircraft.  The accreditation process is now well advanced and easyJet hopes to receive the AOC and licence in the near future,  easyJet said in a statement. The airline reports third-quarter results next Thursday. EasyJet is headquartered in Luton, 30 miles north of London, and said jobs there would be unaffected. The airline already has a Swiss licence and AOC. Lufthansa also selected an Austrian operating licence for its budget unit Eurowings. Lufthansa management drew criticism from German unions for the move which they viewed as a way of avoiding more expensive German labour contracts. EasyJet said it had selected Austria because of its strict implementation of European safety regulations and the fact that it should be able to handle large numbers of planes thanks to its experience with other major airlines. The move will create jobs in Vienna, easyJet said, though most of the roles at the new airline would go to people based in EU countries already. Austria welcomed the airline's decision.  The quality of the country won in competition with 27 other European countries, not tax dumping. The better one won, not the cheaper one,  Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said in a statement.  This is a victory that was heavily fought for, but which is all the more beautiful for Austria.  Brexit poses many challenges for the aviation industry, with Jet2.com owner Dart Group on Thursday saying it would alter its articles of incorporation to ensure shareholder rules on ownership of airlines were met post-Brexit. EasyJet said it was  confident that it will remain majority EU owned post Brexit.  Founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family, who account for 33 percent of easyJet's shares, hold Cypriot passports. The airline reiterated that it would continue to push for a deal between Britain and EU to enable flights to continue and keep the aviation market as open as possible. A spokeswoman for Theresa May said the decision was a commercial one for easyJet, and reiterated that the government would aim to get the best Brexit deal for business. $1 = 0.7714 pounds Reporting by Alistair Smout in London, Shadia Nasralla in Vienna and Victoria Bryan in Berlin; editing by Kate Holton and David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-easyjet-idUSL8N1K51JE"},

While ECB policy is seen firmly on hold, rate setters may debate removing a pledge to extend or expand asset buys if the outlook worsens, sources have told Reuters. Mario Draghi, Ecb President, June 27  As the economy continues to recover, a constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments – not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged.   Any adjustments to our stance have to be made gradually, and only when the improving dynamics that justify them appear sufficiently secure.   While there are still factors that are weighing on the path of inflation, at present they are mainly temporary factors that typically the central bank can look through.  Peter Praet, Chief Economist, July 6  Maintaining a steady hand continues to be critical to fostering a durable convergence of inflation toward our monetary policy aim.   We need to be persistent, because the baseline scenario for inflation going forward remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.   As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive. This, as in our plans, will reinforce accommodation and make sure that inflation convergence develops strong foundations.  Minutes of the June 7-8 Policy Meeting  While there were valid reasons at this juncture to retain the APP easing bias, it was noted that, as the economic expansion proceeded and if confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case for retaining this bias could be reviewed.   The Governing Council was well advised to adapt its forward guidance to the changing economic environment only very gradually.   It was cautioned that even small and incremental changes in the communication could be misperceived as signalling a more fundamental change in policy direction.  Benoit Coeure, Executive Board Member, July 7  The increase in long-term interest rates is the result of consolidating growth. Governments and financial players must prepare themselves for it.   As early as last December, we scaled back our asset purchases without undermining the support given to the economy. So, I would argue that we have already adjusted our monetary policy, and this was made possible by the continued improvement in the economic situation.   Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Executive Board Member, June 30  Although inflation is not yet on a stable path towards our objective, all the conditions are in place. It is just a question of time and patience. That is why monetary policy should already be making preparations for a return to a normal stance. And it should adapt its communication accordingly.

The 46-year-old performer, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was due to be arraigned in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, federal prosecutors said.  While earning millions from hits like 'X Gon' Give it to Ya,' DMX didn't give any of it to the IRS,  Joon Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a Twitter post. According to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, Simmons was charged with tax evasion, evasion of assessment of income tax liability, corruptly endeavoring to obstruct administration of IRS laws and the failure to file a U.S. individual income tax return. A lawyer for Simmons, Murray Richman, said by phone that Simmons plans to enter a not guilty plea at his arraignment on Friday. He said that while Simmons concentrated on music, he had been  charged over the failure of others to do what he hired them to do.

Prosecutors said Simmons took great pains to evade his tax obligations, such as maintaining a cash-only lifestyle and not having a personal bank account. FILE PHOTO: Earl Simmons, also known as the rapper DMX, was arrested on August 20, 2013, near midnight in South Carolina on a previous warrant for driving under a suspended license and a new charge of possession of marijuana.Greer Police Department/HandoutHe also deposited royalty checks into the bank accounts of his managers, who then gave him cash or used the money to pay his personal expenses, prosecutors said.  At one point, prosecutors said, he filed a false affidavit in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, listing his income as  unknown  for 2011 and 2012, and as $10,000 for 2013, when he received hundreds of thousands of dollars of income in each of those years. The rap star's arrest record includes charges of animal cruelty, reckless driving, drug possession, weapons charges and probation violations. He has had several felony convictions and has served prison time in Arizona. Simmons albums such as  It's Dark and Hell is Hot  and  Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood  feature song lyrics rife with violence and rage. He has also starred in the 1998 crime drama  Belly,  the 2000 action movie  Romeo Must Die  and the 2003 heist film  Cradle 2 The Grave.  Reporting by Eric M.

Lam was speaking in her first interview with the international media since she was sworn in as the city's new leader by Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1.  Hong Kong people are always very compassionate and so I share that compassion of many Hong Kong people by sending my condolences to the wife and the family of Mr Liu,  Lam, a devout Catholic, told a Reuters Newsmaker event in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have long branded Liu as a  subversive  so such comments are unusual and the only sympathetic remarks so far from a Beijing-backed leader regarding his death. Liu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his efforts to promote democracy in China, died on Thursday at the age of 61 of multiple organ failure while in detention. Liu was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power . Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It enjoys wide-ranging freedoms not granted in mainland China, a promise of full democracy at some future date, and an independent judiciary under a so-called  one country, two systems  formula. But the abduction by mainland agents of Hong Kong booksellers who had published critical books on China, and Beijing's efforts to disqualify democratically elected, pro-independence lawmakers in the local legislature, have rattled confidence in that arrangement. 'Anxieties and Perception' In a wide-ranging interview, Lam acknowledged concerns about certain  individual incidents  in the city. She said it was her duty to accurately reflect them to the central government in Beijing.  I would say there are worries, there are anxieties, there is a strong perception over individual isolated incidents, but unless you've got evidence to prove there are clear breaches then it will remain at the level of anxieties and perception,  Lam said, without elaborating. She did say, however, police were still investigating the booksellers' cases. Britain called the cases a  serious breach   of the Joint Declaration -- the 1984 treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong's return to China -- and said one of the booksellers, a British passport holder, had been removed from Hong Kong  under duress . Hong Kong's high court on Friday removed four opposition lawmakers from the city's legislative council for failing to sincerely take the oath of office, in a significant blow to the opposition that could weaken its one-third veto bloc in the 70-seat assembly. While the lawsuit had been initiated by her predecessor, Lam said she wouldn't intervene in the case  Building bridges still has to be done in a lawful way. I don’t think this CE (chief executive) or any government official should compromise on the rule of law just because we want to be friendly. But I’m sure the judicial process will go on.  Speaking about Hong Kong's financial sector, Lam said it has a lot of catching up to do, particularly given big strides in financial technology on the mainland, and needs stronger leadership. She also expressed concern over stock price manipulation in the territory. Xi's Harder Line Xi took what some saw as an explicitly harder line about Hong Kong's future during his visit marking the 20th anniversary of the financial hub's return from British to Chinese rule. Xi warned in a speech that any attempt to endanger Chinese sovereignty and security, challenge its power, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities would be acts that cross  the red line  and are  absolutely impermissible . Lam said she would seek to enact contentious national security laws, known as Article 23,  as soon as possible,  without giving a specific timetable, that would prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against China. A proposed blueprint for those laws in 2003, however, was seen as a grave threat to Hong Kong's autonomy, and drew a half-million protesters to the streets before it was finally shelved. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong's  one country, two systems arrangement  has come under considerable strain, as the city's opposition forces have agitated for full democracy and railed against creeping Chinese interference in various sectors including business, politics, media, law and education. The 60-year-old Lam has said she hopes to lead Hong Kong  towards new glory  in the next five years and heal divisions that have festered since the massive 2014 pro-democracy protests that blocked major roads in Hong Kong for 79 days. Lam also pledged to stand by the people of Hong Kong in protecting their rights.  If our core values are being undermined by whatever things happened both in Hong Kong or not in Hong Kong, then of course I have that duty.  At times, Lam, the mother of two grown sons, showed a lighter side, boasting that she slept soundly through the night when asked about the insomnia of leadership. She expressed hopes she could ease the pressures of Hong Kong's pressure cooker school system, saying parents should let their children  dream  - and acknowledging that was not a traditional Asian  Tiger Mum  thing to say.

GPIF said this month it had allocated 1 trillion yen ($8.9 billion) or 3 percent of its stocks portfolio to companies that have strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices using a new ESG index created by FTSE Russell.  Raising that allocation target to 10 percent based on the pension fund's updated financials, should see GPIF pour a total of 3.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) into ESG-related investments, in a big boost for ESG investing globally.  They have been very bold. They've said they are putting 3 percent of their investment into ESG related investments and they have said they will increase that to 10 percent over time,  Mark Makepeace, chief executive for FTSE Russell told Reuters during a trip to Tokyo on Friday.  I think that gives us opportunities to improve the ESG practices of companies in Japan,  he added. GPIF has selected FTSE Blossom Japan index, a new index compiled by FTSE Russell for the Japanese pension fund, as well as MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders index and MSCI Japan Empowering Women index. A spokesman for GPIF said on Friday the pension fund had not yet set a formal ESG allocation target, but confirmed that GPIF President Norihiro Takahashi had said publicly the fund was planning to raise its allocation to 10 percent without elaborating on the timeline. ESG investing is gaining momentum globally, especially in the United States and Europe, amid growing evidence companies with stronger environmental and governance practices deliver higher returns over a five- to 10-year investment horizon. GPIF's move is expected to prompt smaller Asian corporate and public pension funds, which have so far been slow to adopt ESG investments, to allocate more into such stocks.  GPIF is very influential not just in Japan but across the region and internationally,  said Makepeace.  I think the activities of GPIF will be very, very important. They are watched by other investors.

India's more than $150 billion software services sector faces headwinds in its biggest market, the United States, as clients hold back technology spending amid concerns about President Donald Trump's review of a visa program for highly-skilled workers. Net profit rose 1.4 percent to 34.8 billion rupees ($540 million) in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, just a tad above expectations. Infosys retained its annual revenue outlook at between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent growth on a constant currency basis. But Mumbai brokerage Emkay said in a client note that the company's failure to lift its revenue guidance indicated first-quarter pricing gains were not sustainable and profitability could see a  downtick  in the coming quarter on lower growth, wage hikes and rupee appreciation. After Trump targeted outsourcing firms, Infosys said in May it plans to hire 10,000 U.S. workers in the next two years - a move that will likely lead to higher labor costs. It is also due to give annual salary increases to employees this month.  We'll be announcing the compensation hikes and we are also ramping up the U.S. talent model,  Finance Chief M.D. Ranganath told reporters. The Indian rupee has also risen 5.4 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, adding to the woes of outsourcers who bill for the majority of their services in foreign currencies. But Infosys fared better than bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services which missed analysts' expectations on Thursday with a 6 percent drop in first-quarter profit. Shares in Infosys, valued at about $35 billion, ended 0.5 percent lower. Infosys has had a rocky year with some founders and former executives of the company publicly accusing its board of governance lapses and urging it to reward shareholders through a share buyback. The company plans to return about $2 billion to shareholders this financial year, but has yet to detail the manner of the payout. At end-June, Infosys had a record $6.1 billion cash balance, Ranganath said.  IT outsourcing firms are also facing pressure as traditional businesses such as routine infrastructure maintenance are seeing their margins squeezed as clients demand more work for less money, pushing the sector to develop cloud, data analytics and cyber security services. Infosys lost one client in its $100 million category during the quarter from the previous quarter, but total active clients rose by a net of 2 to 1,164.

A fresh round of selling could follow the July 29 expiry of the stock's lockup period, after which certain insider investors will be allowed to unload their shares.  FILE PHOTO - Traders look up at a screen that displays trading information for Snap Inc. on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. on May 11, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoSnapchat is popular with users under 30, but many on Wall Street have long been critical of Snap's lofty valuation and slowing growth. The company's current market value was about $18.3 billion.  Facebook, which once made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat, has made the camera central to its own apps and offers Snapchat-like features on its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. In June, Instagram said its Stories feature had 250 million users, compared with 166 million users for Snapchat at the end of the first quarter.  You have a one, two, three punch here: Slowing growth, advertisers are still favoring established platforms and a very, very threatening competitor,  said Philippe Collard, founder of management consulting firm Yabusame Partners, which specializes in the tech industry.   Probably, people are sitting on the sideline saying, 'What do I do with Snap, is it going to be another Twitter?'  Shares of Twitter, which went public in 2013, now trade about 30 percent below their IPO price.    Some big names took stakes in Snap during the first quarter, including billionaire George Soros' hedge fund, activist hedge fund Jana Partners, Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Daniel Och's Och-Ziff Capital Management.

It said it had bought the euros at an average rate of 7.4209 kuna per euro.     The kuna eased slightly after the intervention and was quoted at 7.4120 per euro at 1005 GMT, down from around 7.40 per euro where it was hovering before the central bank had stepped in.      We have not witnessed excessively strong firming pressures at the moment, but apparently the central bank is cautious and wants to send a message at what level it wishes to see the kuna at this point,  a dealer at a major local bank said.     A usually strong inflow of euros during the summer tourist season is now additionally increased by a liquidity loan worth 480 million euros recently struck by Agrokor, a highly indebted Croatian food group currently undergoing a restructuring process.                   I think the euros coming to the market because of Agrokor loan are a key factor now why the central bank wants primarily to act preemptively,  the dealer said.     This is the third central bank's intervention to buy euros since the beginning of June. In the first two interventions the central bank bought altogether 374 million euros.     The central bank keeps the kuna in a managed float regime against the euro, occasionally intervening to counter firming or easing pressures or sudden stronger rate movements. In the last few years the kuna has been mostly floating at between 7.35 and 7.70 kuna per euro.

Money flowed out of bonds for the 17th straight week, while equities drew inflows for the fifth straight week, global flow data from Bank of America Merrill-Lynch showed. But the appetite for risk was not universal, with strategists at the bank highlighting market participants didn't see eye to eye on the potential for markets to push further from current record highs.  Big divergence recent weeks between hedge fund positioning, market breadth and technicals (all becoming more bullish) versus flows and long-only positioning (turning bearish),  strategists at the bank wrote. They had last week predicted stocks could be headed for a big  Humpty Dumpty  fall in the autumn. Investment managers wary of missing a potential further leg-up in stocks have stayed on the reflation train, however. They've added 20 percent or more this year to emerging markets, financials and Euro zone equity ETFs, and sold quality, utilities and dividend funds, BAML's number-crunchers found. Breaking down the fixed income moves, high-yield bond funds saw the biggest outflows in 17 weeks as investors unwound bets that yields would rise fast on the back of monetary policy tightening across the developed world. Investment-grade bonds were on course for a record year of inflows as investors seeking safety piled into them for the 29th straight week, with $5.2 billion flowing into the funds.  Emerging market debt remained a popular alternative for investors hunting for yield. Funds tracking emerging market debt saw their 24th straight week of inflows. In equities a rotation away from  value -style stocks and into  growth   continued as U.S. growth funds enjoyed their biggest week of inflows on record. European equities, which have enjoyed renewed prominence this year as a cheaper alternative to U.S. equities, saw inflows resuming after their first outflows in 15 weeks last week.  U.S. stocks had their fourth straight week of outflows. The sector mix revealed investors' renewed trust in the strength of cyclical stocks, while they ditched defensive sectors like real estate, consumer goods and utilities which benefit when interest rates rise.

On Monday, the government is announcing second-quarter GDP data, and it was not clear if the new method would have any impact on that data.  The National Bureau of Statistics said the new method will take effect  from now on . It said full implementation is expected to be a  gradual process , as some proposed changes have not yet met the conditions to materialize, such as measures to reflect the development of non-profit organizations. The revision aims to accommodate  new changes  in China's economic activity and better align its calculation method with international standards, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a Q&A; published on its website. The last time China revised its GDP calculation method was in 2002. Some changes in calculations as part of the new framework have been announced previously. In 2016, China decided to add research and development spending to its gross domestic product figures.  This move increased the total of 2015 GDP by 1.3 percent to 68.55 trillion yuan ($10.3 trillion), but that year's growth rate was only marginally amended and basically remained 6.9 percent.     China's economic growth for 2017 is expected to be on a slowing trajectory to 6.6 percent, a Reuters poll showed, down from the 6.7 percent reported for 2016 - the slowest pace in 26 years. For the first quarter, China reported surprisingly solid 6.9 percent annual growth, buoyed by a gravity-defying property boom and higher government infrastructure spending which helped boost industrial output by the most in over two years.

Janine Raftopoulos, a spokeswoman for South African National Parks (SANParks), said a farmer found the three big cats eating one of his cows and proceeded to shoot one dead and wounded another one. Raftopoulos said rangers then went to the scene, tracked down the remaining lions and dispatched them. Initial reports said four lions had broken out but Raftopoulos said  the tracks point to only three and the farmer only saw three feeding on his cow.  Population pressures may be pushing the cats out of the park, which is the size of Israel, as their numbers swelled during a severe drought in 2015/16, which provided predators with a bonanza in dead and dying prey species.

Prices of sunflower seeds, sunflower oil producers' main raw material, have risen 9 percent since mid-May to 19,125 rubles ($319) per tonne, according to SovEcon agriculture consultancy.  Russia's Sunflower Oil and Fats Union, in a letter dated June 26, asked the Economy and Agriculture Ministries to raise the tariff to 16.5 percent, but not less than 100 euros ($114) per tonne, from the current 6.5 percent but not less than 9.5 euros per tonne.  With the aim of eliminating the existing disparity of export prices and critical risks for the (sunflower) oil and fat industry, I am asking you ... to consider the question of an urgent upgrade of the export duty on sunflower seeds,  Mikhail Maltsev, acting head of the union, said in the letter. The ministry said on Friday that it was considering the request. Russia, a major sunflower oil exporter, cut export duty on sunseeds last year to 6.5 percent, from 20 percent, in line with its terms of membership of the World Trade Organisation. It was unclear how much scope it had to push the tariff back up again. The reduction, along with Russian efforts to support its sunflower oil industry and exports, led to a fivefold increase in sunseed exports between last September and June this year, official data showed.  SovEcon agriculture consultancy said last month that Russian sunflower oil producers were worried by rising seed exports and had asked the government to impose additional measures to limit them.

The agency also affirmed the rating on Glenmark's USD200 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2021 at 'BB'. The revision in the Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Glenmark's free cash flow will be largely neutral over the next two years, and its credit ratios will not improve as previously forecast. Glenmark's free cash flow remained negative in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (FY17) as profitability was lower and cash taxes higher than Fitch expected. In Fitch's view, the high cash taxes and sustained working capital investments will curb free cash generation, even as profitability is likely to narrow after the end of the exclusivity period in 1QFY18 for Glenmark's generic version of Ezetimibe, which is used to treat high cholesterol. Glenmark's rating incorporates its geographically diversified profile, a demonstrated track record of regulatory compliance and a healthy product pipeline. Glenmark is smaller than other global generic drug makers, but it has achieved healthy growth rates in the US and India and benefits from its in-house R&D; capabilities, which support its novel drug development programme and generic business. KEY RATING DRIVERS Financial Profile to Remain Stable:  Glenmark's financial leverage, measured by adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR, improved to 2.0x in FY17 from 2.7x at end-FY16. This was because negative free cash flow and the resultant increase in debt were offset by the 44% increase in EBITDA following the launch of the generic version of Ezetimibe in December 2016 and growth in the base business. Fitch now expects Glenmark's EBITDAR margin to narrow to 18.5% by FY19 (FY17: 23%), after the six-month exclusivity period for Ezetimibe ended in 1QFY18. The downward revision to our forecasts also reflects the ongoing pressure on generic drug prices in the US. Fitch believes Glenmark's financial profile will remain well-positioned for its rating, with financial leverage of around 2.0x-2.3x and fixed-charge coverage of above 5.0x over the medium term, even though lower profitability, sustained high cash taxes and working capital investments will result in neutral free cash flow. Small but Diversified: Glenmark's revenue and operating EBITDAR are small compared with those of global major generic drugmakers, but the risk of its small size is counterbalanced by its good diversification in products and geographies. Scale and diversification are important for generic drug companies to maintain stable and durable margins. The company also has a strong competitive position in its core therapy areas of dermatology and respiratory. Robust Domestic Position: Glenmark is the 15th-largest player by value in the highly fragmented Indian market, with a market share of 2.2% in FY17. Glenmark has continued to strengthen its market positions in its focus areas of respiratory (fifth largest versus sixth in FY16), cardiovascular (seventh largest versus eight) and dermatology (second largest, unchanged). The Indian market continues to remain physician-driven and focused on branded generics. Pharmaceutical companies tend to compete through focused marketing efforts in certain therapies rather than using a volume-based strategy. Strong Product Pipeline: Glenmark received 17 abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) approvals (including tentative nods) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in FY17. The company has nearly 65 ANDAs in various stages of the approval process with the US FDA, 25 of which are Paragraph IV applications (implying a challenge to existing patents). In Fitch's view, Glenmark's healthy product pipeline will enable a steady flow of new product launches, particularly in the US, which will support sales growth and protect margins, amid ongoing pricing pressure in the generic pharmaceutical market. Strong Production Base: Glenmark has continued to remain compliant with the standards set by various regulators over the years; the company has successfully cleared all inspections with major regulatory agencies (such as US FDA and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). This has helped Glenmark to avoid any disruptions in its business as well as in getting new ANDA approvals in a timely manner. DERIVATION SUMMARY Glenmark's 'BB' rating reflects its smaller scale and diversification compared with large generic pharmaceutical companies such as Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited (BBB/Stable) and Mylan N.V. (BBB-/Stable). Large players like Teva and Mylan also benefit from their deeper and more-complex product pipelines, which mitigate the price erosion risk. Although similar in scale to Glenmark, Ache Laboratorios Farmaceuticos S.A. (BB+/ Negative) benefits from higher margins and a stronger financial profile although Brazil's Country Ceiling constrains its rating. Glenmark's bigger scale, diversified geographic presence and stronger regulatory track record supports its higher rating compared with Jubilant Pharma Limited (BB-/Stable). Glenmark's leverage compares well against that of larger peers such as Teva and Mylan, given their acquisitive focus. Nonetheless, Glenmark's weak free cash generation constrains its financial profile relative to peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Consolidated revenue to increase by 8% to 12% annually over FY18-FY20 - Average EBITDAR margin to reduce to about 18.5% by FY19, reflecting completion of the exclusivity period available to Ezetimibe by 1Q FY18 - Annual capex of INR7 billion-9 billion in FY18-FY20 - Annual dividend payout of up to 10% of net income RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Maintaining EBITDAR margin in excess of 21% - Sustained free cash flow generation - Financial leverage (adjusted net debt to EBITDAR) sustained at less than 1.5x (FY17: 2.0x) Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening of competitive position or any adverse US FDA action - Deterioration in financial leverage (adjusted net debt to EBITDAR) to more than 3.0x LIQUIDITY Robust Liquidity: Glenmark's readily available cash balance as of 31 March 2017 of INR10.6 billion was more than sufficient to meet INR1.9 billion of debt maturing in FY18 and the small FCF deficit. There are no material debt maturities before FY22.

Those courts, including an influential Washington appeals court and two appellate courts that ruled against Trump in cases involving his travel ban, all had an influx of fresh liberal blood under President Barack Obama.   Trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the Democrats’ control of those three (appellate) circuits,  said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. After eight years in office, Obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts. When he left the White House in January, nine of the 13 federal appeals courts had a majority of Democratic-appointed judges. The federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in the District of Columbia, often have the final say in major legal disputes. The conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court, which now includes Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, can overrule appeals court decisions, but hears only a small number of cases, which leaves lower court rulings in place most of the time.  The appeals courts can shape the interpretation of such issues as abortion, religious freedom, voting rights and race.  Appellate court judges serve lifetime terms, and so far Trump’s opportunities to appoint new ones have been mostly limited to courts that already lean conservative. Among the courts conservatives would most like to shift are the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, both of which ruled against Trump in cases challenging the Republican president's executive orders temporarily banning travel to the United States by people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The Supreme Court partially revived the ban last month. The ideological balance of those courts has provided some hope to Trump's legal opponents, including Democratic state attorneys general, who have already sued the administration over the travel ban and other issues.  Strategic attorneys general can likely chart a path through Democratic-leaning courts - making it harder on the Trump administration to pursue its agenda through executive action,  said Sarah Binder, a scholar the nonpartisan Brookings Institution think tank. Second Highest Court Thanks in part to efforts by the Republican-led Senate in the final two years of Obama's presidency to block the Democratic president's judicial appointments, Trump has 21 appeals court slots to fill, according to the federal judiciary's administrative office. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved two of Trump's appeals court nominees on Thursday. In some of the key courts, new vacancies in the near term are more likely to be in slots currently filled by Republican appointees, so Trump's early appointments will be unlikely to change the court balance. A case in point is the announcement this week by Republican appointee Janice Rogers Brown on the Washington appeals court that she plans to step down.  In Washington, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is often called the second-highest court in the land, in part because it hears a large number of cases concerning major government regulations on issues such as the environment and labor.  Democratic appointees hold a 7-4 advantage among the 11 active judges.  Of the Democratic appointees, Judge David Tatel is 75 and Judge Judith Rogers is 77. The next oldest is Merrick Garland at 64. Obama made four appointments to the court, the oldest of whom is 56. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is also stacked against Trump: out of 25 full-time judges, Democratic presidents appointed 18 and Republican presidents seven. The oldest Democratic appointee, liberal icon Stephen Reinhardt, is 86 years old. The 10 9th Circuit judges appointed by President Bill Clinton who still work full-time range in age from 63 to 72, and none have given any indication they plan to reduce their caseloads.  The court currently has four vacancies, but three of those seats are based in states - California, Oregon and Hawaii - with two Democratic senators who are likely to resist attempts to place extreme conservatives on the court. Those dynamics make it extremely unlikely that Trump will be able to significantly alter the 9th Circuit's orientation, Hellman said.  The Virginia-based 4th Circuit has a 10-5 majority of Democratic appointees and no current vacancies. The oldest Democratic appointee is Judge Robert King, who is 77. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, who has advised the White House on judicial nominations, is optimistic about Trump's long-term prospects. “It takes time to recalibrate the federal courts,” he said.    In the meantime, Leo said, every slot matters, since conservative judges on liberal-majority courts can offer critical dissents in important cases and serve a kind of signaling function to the Supreme Court.

The Finn, keeping up the momentum after winning in Austria, was nearly half a second faster than his closest non-Mercedes rival with the 2017 Formula One cars looking significantly quicker and the champions in ominous form. Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, who has had five retirements in the last seven races, and Australian Daniel Ricciardo were third and fourth respectively at an overcast Silvertone.  Mercedes look really strong but we look to be in the fight with Ferrari. At the moment we're battling Ferrari and not Mercedes,  commented Ricciardo, who has been on podium for five races in a row. Hamilton, who will be chasing his fifth British Grand Prix victory and fourth in a row on Sunday, was 0.078 off his team mate's best time of one minute 29.106 seconds. Bottas's time was quicker than Hamilton's 2016 pole position of 1:29.287. Ferrari's world championship leader Sebastian Vettel, who is 20 points clear of the Briton after nine of 20 races, was sixth quickest and behind team mate Kimi Raikkonen -- who was more than a second slower than Bottas.  Even on TV the cars look awesome,  said Red Bull principal Christian Horner.  I think the drivers are really enjoying that and it's just going to get quicker as the circuit rubbers in.  Vettel started the morning by trying out the new 'shield', the first driver to experience the transparent open canopy system designed to protect the head from flying debris and bouncing wheels. Governing body FIA has been focusing on that concept rather than a 'halo' cockpit protection system that was extensively tested last season to a mixed response from teams and drivers.  It's agreed to put it on the car for next year. It is a really accelerated programme as the decision was taken a couple of months ago,  Williams technical head Paddy Lowe told Sky Sports television.  We're very interested to hear the feedback from Sebastian, especially on visibility. I thought it looked pretty good.  We're worried about reflections but there may be solutions to that. We will be testing it on various cars over the coming months.  (Reporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by John O'Brien)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-britain-idUSL4N1K53LW"},

The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval in a bid to protect critical infrastructure, including power grids and hospitals. The move reflects pressure across Europe to limit takeovers by Chinese state-backed groups of prized European assets.

China's trade and business links with Germany and the European Union have brought real benefits to the peoples and companies of both sides and promoted economic growth, he added. China hopes that Germany and the EU can avoided being affected by protectionist tendencies, and not send a  confused, negative  message to the rest of the world, Geng said. The purchase last year of German robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) by Chinese company Midea (000333.SZ) raised concern that China was gaining too much access to key technologies while shielding its own companies from foreign takeovers. State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, China's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors.

Global Logistic Properties, Asia's No. 1 warehouse operator, surged as much as 23 percent to a record high after it agreed to be acquired by a Chinese private equity consortium backed by senior GLP executives for roughly S$16 billion ($11.65 billion).      Singapore's GDP expanded 0.4 percent in the April-June period from the previous quarter on an annualised and seasonally adjusted basis, helped by solid global demand for its tech products, but was lower than a median forecast of 1.1 percent in a Reuters poll.     Singapore shares closed 1.6 percent higher, posting their third straight weekly gain.     Among other Southeast Asian stock markets, the Philippines  ended 0.6 percent lower, dragged down by property and financial stocks. Property developer SM Prime Holdings fell 1.8 percent, while Ayala Corp and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co declined 2 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.     The Philippine stock index nearly hit the 8,000 resistance level in the previous session, so investors may be just trying to lock in some profits, said Charles Ang, an analyst with Manila-based COL Financial.     Philippine shares closed the week marginally lower after rising for two consecutive weeks.     Indonesian shares came off early falls to end the session flat. Unilever Indonesia, which fell as much as 1.7 percent, rose in last-minute buying to finish 0.2 percent higher.     Thai shares closed the week higher after two straight falls, while Vietnam ended 0.2 percent higher.         Malaysian shares closed slightly higher on Friday, but posted their fourth straight weekly decline. Genting Bhd  gained 3.4 percent, while Petronas Chemicals Group  and DiGi.Com fell 1.4 percent and 1.5  percent, respectively.     Meanwhile, investors are awaiting a host of U.S. economic indicators, including core inflation, retail sales and industrial production, for June later in the session for more insight into how the Federal Reserve might proceed with monetary policy tightening this year.

GLP, which is Asia's biggest warehouse operator and boasts a $41 billion portfolio of assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from rising demand logistics facilities driven by a boom in e-commerce from clients such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O). The winning bid of China's Hopu Investment Management, Hillhouse Capital Group, real estate developer Vanke Group (000002.SZ) (2202.HK) and the financial service investment arm of Bank of China was backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, which trumped an offer by a Warburg Pincus-led consortium - the only other short-listed bidder. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer.  GIC played hard to get a decent offer,  said a person with direct knowledge of the deal.  There's a good premium with very few strings attached.  Related CoverageVanke says deal to buy out GLP will help its logistics property businessLast year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and  limited conditionality , reducing  execution risk . GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday's jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review.    Booming Sector Investors including Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] have splashed more than $12 billion on the logistics sector in China since 2013, betting a surge in online shopping will spur demand for delivery and warehousing services. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom.   Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail,  said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield's Asia Pacific capital markets group.  To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges,  he said.  The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China's outbound M&A; volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing's crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment.

Big U.S. banks start reporting quarterly results on Friday and according to data from State Street, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the S&P; 500 Financials sector, has pulled in a net $662 million of inflows, bringing the year-to-date inflows to nearly $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, the Financial Select ETF is up 7.6 percent to $25.01.  There is good reason for investors to be optimistic about the financial sector,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  We just had two rounds of stress tests that every single bank passed with flying colors. In general, the banking industry is in very good shape right now,  he said. Shares in the biggest U.S. banks rose at the end of June after they unveiled buyback and dividend plans that topped analyst expectations after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved capital proposals in its annual stress test program. Some of the fund's top holdings, JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, report results on Friday and others, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp will post results next week. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 financial companies rose 7 percent, the third-best growth for a sector after energy and technology, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The financial earnings are going to probably be better-than-expected because we have seen a tick up in the yield curve, and that is going to be better for net interest income,  said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in Charleston, South Carolina. Longer-dated Treasury yields have jumped so far this month while shorter-dated yields have either inched higher or fallen, resulting in a so-called  steepening  of the yield curve. A steeper yield curve benefits bank profitability since it allows banks to borrow at lower short-term rates and lend at higher long-term rates.  Financials have managed to make money no matter what gets thrown at them. Regulations, zero interest rates, they still come through. So I think that we're going to see a positive surprise,  Cavanaugh said. Traders in the options market appear to expect the fund's shares to rise in the near term. For XLF options contracts expiring on July 21, which will cover results from the largest banks, there are 1.2 calls open for each open put. For contracts expiring after this date, the measure stands at 0.77 calls per open put, a significantly more defensive stance. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. Options on the SPDR S&P; Bank ETF and individual bank stocks including Bank of America Corp also show a similar bullish bias in near-term contracts. On Thursday, trading in XLF's options leaned toward bullish bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

Three of the top five worst-performing hedge funds in the first half of the year specialize in trading oil, directly or indirectly, according to a list compiled by HSBC. Two of those had led the performance charts in 2016.  The majority of funds came into the year with a bullish view driven by supply/demand fundamentals,  said Fred Ingham, who invests in hedge funds at Neuberger Berman, adding that the price had fallen since due partly to a focus on U.S. production. The oil market has been struggling to absorb a surplus of unused crude but when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 partners agreed late last year to cut output for the first time in eight years, bulls pushed the price up to a one-year high above $50 a barrel. But as this year has worn on, OPEC's failure to erase a multi-million-barrel overhang and shale oil's dominance have become apparent, stripping 15 percent off the crude price. Among the biggest casualties so far is the oil equities-focused AlphaGen Elnath Fund, part of Janus Henderson Investors-owned AlphaGen Capital, which ended 2016 as the best-performing fund with gains of 78 percent, the HSBC data showed. Six months on, however, and it is now the worst performer, nursing losses of 48 percent. The firm did not respond to requests for comment but Elnath fund manager Mark Gordon told Reuters last summer he thought the oil price had fallen too far and the market had no spare capacity globally.   I think the oil price will continue to go up because production globally is falling and that is not sustainable,  he said. Another to call the oil price wrongly in the first half of the year is high-profile trader Pierre Andurand, who shot to fame with his correct prediction on the slide in crude from record highs in 2008. His Andurand Commodities Fund lost 17 percent between January and June, giving back almost all of 2016's 22 percent gains. David Knott's Dorset Energy Fund lost 42 percent this year, having pocketed 66 percent last year.   Losses in oil have been sizeable this year for specialists like Andurand,  said one hedge fund investor, leading most to reduce their positions aggressively even though they remained bullish. U.S. hedge fund firm Elm Ridge Capital Partners, meanwhile, lost 23.67 percent year-to-date after gains of 25.5 percent in 2016.     A spokesman for Andurand declined to comment. Dorset and Elm Ridge did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Many so-called  macro  hedge funds, which bet more generally on macroeconomic trends, also lost money from oil over the past six months, said Philippe Ferreira, head of hedge funds research at Lyxor Asset Management.  Most ... multi-asset macro funds we track have lost money on oil so far this year because of bullish positions.  Among the losers so far is Conquest Capital Group's Star Fund, which has a roughly 10 percent exposure to energy. It had lost 3.1 percent in the six months to June 30 after gains of 17.1 percent last year, an investor letter showed. The average macro hedge fund is down 0.8 percent in the first six months of 2017, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed, compared with returns of 3.68 percent for the average hedge fund.

Seen by analysts as an assertion of Indonesian sovereignty, part of the renamed sea is claimed by China under its contentious maritime boundary, known as the 'nine-dash line', that encompasses most of the resource-rich sea.  Several Southeast Asian states dispute China's territorial claims and are competing with China to exploit the South China Sea's abundant hydrocarbon and fishing resources. China has raised the ante by deploying military assets on artificial islands constructed on shoals and reefs in disputed parts of the sea.  Indonesia insists it's a non-claimant state in the South China Sea dispute but has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area over the past 18 months.

Last week, Vietnam extended an Indian oil concession off its coast while a joint venture led by state-owned PetroVietnam commenced drilling further south. China has a territorial claim in both areas. Meanwhile, the director of the Philippines Energy Resource Development Bureau, Ismael Ocampo, said on Wednesday that the country could lift a suspension on oil and gas drilling on the Reed Bank by December. The underwater mountain, lying 85 nautical miles off the Philippines coast, is also claimed by China. Exploration activity was suspended in late 2014 as the Philippines sought an international ruling on China's territorial claim. The Philippines won the case in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague one year ago. China refused to recognize the decision. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who took office on June 30 last year, expressed reluctance about enforcing the decision at the time, as he sought deeper diplomatic and economic ties with China. However, the Philippines lately has become more assertive about its sovereignty.      More than two dozen oil, gas and coal blocks, including additional areas in disputed waters, may be offered during the December bidding, Ocampo said on Wednesday.

The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval in a bid to protect critical infrastructure, including power grids and hospitals. The move reflects pressure across Europe to limit takeovers by Chinese state-backed groups of prized European assets.  We are concerned about the relevant moves of Germany and Europe,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. China's trade and business links with Germany and the European Union have brought real benefits to the peoples and companies of both sides and promoted economic growth, he added. China hopes that Germany and the EU can avoided being affected by protectionist tendencies, and not send a  confused, negative  message to the rest of the world, Geng said. The purchase last year of German robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) by Chinese company Midea (000333.SZ) raised concern that China was gaining too much access to key technologies while shielding its own companies from foreign takeovers. State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, China's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors.

GLP, which is Asia's biggest warehouse operator and boasts a $41 billion portfolio of assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from rising demand logistics facilities driven by a boom in e-commerce from clients such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O). The winning bid of China's Hopu Investment Management, Hillhouse Capital Group, real estate developer Vanke Group (000002.SZ) (2202.HK) and the financial service investment arm of Bank of China was backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, which trumped an offer by a Warburg Pincus-led consortium - the only other short-listed bidder. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer.  GIC played hard to get a decent offer,  said a person with direct knowledge of the deal.  There's a good premium with very few strings attached.  Related CoverageVanke says deal to buy out GLP will help its logistics property businessLast year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and  limited conditionality , reducing  execution risk . GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday's jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review.    Booming Sector Investors including Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] have splashed more than $12 billion on the logistics sector in China since 2013, betting a surge in online shopping will spur demand for delivery and warehousing services. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom.   Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail,  said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield's Asia Pacific capital markets group.  To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges,  he said.  The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China's outbound M&A; volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing's crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment.

Gordon,Philippe Ferreira,Pierre Andurand,US,HEDGEFUNDS,OIL,Energy Markets,Funds,Western Europe,Crude Oil,Energy (Legacy),Corporate Events,Oil and Gas (TRBC),Hedge Funds,Government Borrowing Requirement,Equities Markets,Europe,United Kingdom,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC)","sector":"Markets","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Many of last year's most successful oil market bulls have seen their winnings dissolve in the first half of this year, as the crude price has wallowed below $50 a barrel despite output cuts by some of the world's largest producers. Three of the top five worst-performing hedge funds in the first half of the year specialize in trading oil, directly or indirectly, according to a list compiled by HSBC. Two of those had led the performance charts in 2016.  The majority of funds came into the year with a bullish view driven by supply/demand fundamentals,  said Fred Ingham, who invests in hedge funds at Neuberger Berman, adding that the price had fallen since due partly to a focus on U.S. production. The oil market has been struggling to absorb a surplus of unused crude but when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 partners agreed late last year to cut output for the first time in eight years, bulls pushed the price up to a one-year high above $50 a barrel. But as this year has worn on, OPEC's failure to erase a multi-million-barrel overhang and shale oil's dominance have become apparent, stripping 15 percent off the crude price. Among the biggest casualties so far is the oil equities-focused AlphaGen Elnath Fund, part of Janus Henderson Investors-owned AlphaGen Capital, which ended 2016 as the best-performing fund with gains of 78 percent, the HSBC data showed. Six months on, however, and it is now the worst performer, nursing losses of 48 percent. The firm did not respond to requests for comment but Elnath fund manager Mark Gordon told Reuters last summer he thought the oil price had fallen too far and the market had no spare capacity globally.   I think the oil price will continue to go up because production globally is falling and that is not sustainable,  he said. Another to call the oil price wrongly in the first half of the year is high-profile trader Pierre Andurand, who shot to fame with his correct prediction on the slide in crude from record highs in 2008. His Andurand Commodities Fund lost 17 percent between January and June, giving back almost all of 2016's 22 percent gains. David Knott's Dorset Energy Fund lost 42 percent this year, having pocketed 66 percent last year.   Losses in oil have been sizeable this year for specialists like Andurand,  said one hedge fund investor, leading most to reduce their positions aggressively even though they remained bullish. U.S. hedge fund firm Elm Ridge Capital Partners, meanwhile, lost 23.67 percent year-to-date after gains of 25.5 percent in 2016.     A spokesman for Andurand declined to comment. Dorset and Elm Ridge did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Many so-called  macro  hedge funds, which bet more generally on macroeconomic trends, also lost money from oil over the past six months, said Philippe Ferreira, head of hedge funds research at Lyxor Asset Management.  Most ... multi-asset macro funds we track have lost money on oil so far this year because of bullish positions.  Among the losers so far is Conquest Capital Group's Star Fund, which has a roughly 10 percent exposure to energy. It had lost 3.1 percent in the six months to June 30 after gains of 17.1 percent last year, an investor letter showed. The average macro hedge fund is down 0.8 percent in the first six months of 2017, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed, compared with returns of 3.68 percent for the average hedge fund.

Seen by analysts as an assertion of Indonesian sovereignty, part of the renamed sea is claimed by China under its contentious maritime boundary, known as the 'nine-dash line', that encompasses most of the resource-rich sea.  Several Southeast Asian states dispute China's territorial claims and are competing with China to exploit the South China Sea's abundant hydrocarbon and fishing resources. China has raised the ante by deploying military assets on artificial islands constructed on shoals and reefs in disputed parts of the sea.  Indonesia insists it's a non-claimant state in the South China Sea dispute but has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area over the past 18 months.

The firm has seen 70 percent of its market value wiped out since a profit warning and the exit of its CEO on Monday while its bondholders have braced for  painful  talks as a pile-up of receivables and debt spooked investors. The latest disclosure data from the UK's FCA shows that while some hedge funds have covered some bearish bets on the stock over the past few days, others have held on, or even raised them, suggesting they see further declines ahead. Carillion remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the UK. The difficulties investors are having in putting a price on Carillion shares was evident in volatile trading with the stock swinging between losses of as much as 10 percent to gains of 2 percent in the first two hours of trade. In its downgrade, JPMorgan said a further provision against receivables may be required, suggesting Carillion may face difficulties recovering money owed to it by its customers. Those views were echoed by analysts at Morgan Stanley who added that for now the balance sheet overshadows operating performance and debt reduction from a combination of asset sales, cost cutting and potential capital raising via fresh equity may be required. The company, which was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine, has said it is considering all options to cut debt. A profit warning over customer payments owed that it could no longer expect to be able to collect led to a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown, prompted its boss to quit and triggered worries about a rights issue The total number of Carillion shares sold short by hedge funds has declined slightly to 23.3 percent of outstanding shares from 25.5 percent, according to regulatory filings. Of the 19 funds with disclosed short positions before Carillion's profit warning, three - Marshall Wace Asia, Kontiki Capital Management and Kuvari Partners - have seen their positions fall below 0.5 percent, the level at which funds are required to disclose positions to the regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. Five more firms have cut their short positions, while four -- Man Group's AHL, Gladstone Capital, Henderson and funds run by BlackRock -- have added to bearish bets.

Under the explicit warning, the red-and-white Italian language sign goes on to say that  violators are subject to a syndrome of always feeling like a victim and the consequent reduction of your sense of humor and capacity to solve problems . A picture of the sign was posted on the Vatican Insider website and its presence on the pope's door confirmed to Reuters by its editor-in-chief Andrea Tornielli, an author who is close to Francis and has interviewed him several times. The sign is adorned with the international symbol for 'no' - a backslash in a circle. It adds:  The penalty is doubled if the violation take place in the presence of children. To get the best out of yourself, concentrate on your potential and not on your limitations.  Then the closing zinger:  Stop complaining and take steps to improve your life . The sign was given to the pope recently by Italian psychologist and self-help author Salvo Noe. Francis promised Noe he would put it up in his office for a laugh. Francis has had no shortage of complainers in the Vatican and in the Church since his election in 2013. He has tried to steer the 1.2 billion-member Church on a more inclusive and merciful path, angering conservatives who say he his sowing doctrinal confusion. One recent episode involved German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, a German whom the pope removed last month from his post as Vatican doctrinal chief at the end of a five-year term. Mueller, who disagrees with the pope on a number of issues, apparently expected his mandate to be renewed automatically.

The U.S. measures would initially hit Chinese entities considered  low-hanging fruit,  including smaller financial institutions and  shell  companies linked to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, said one of the officials, while declining to name the targets. It would leave larger Chinese banks untouched for now, the official said.  The timing and scope of the U.S. action will depend heavily on how China responds to pressure for tougher steps against North Korea when U.S. and Chinese officials meet for a high-level economic dialogue in Washington on Wednesday, the administration sources told Reuters. President Donald Trump and his top aides have signaled growing impatience with China over North Korea, especially since it last week test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile, which experts say could put all of Alaska in range for the first time. U.S. officials have also warned that China could face U.S. trade and economic pressure - something Trump has held in abeyance since taking office in January - unless it does more to restrain its neighbor. The so-called secondary sanctions now being considered are a way for the United States to apply targeted economic pressure on companies in countries with ties to North Korea by denying them access to the U.S. market and financial system. Word of the sanctions plan comes as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley seeks to overcome resistance from China and Russia to a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing stiffer international sanctions on Pyongyang. The targets now being weighed for sanctions would come from a list of firms numbering  substantially more than 10  that Trump shared with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit in April and which U.S. experts have continued to compile for review, according to one of the officials. The administration has yet to see what it considers a sufficient response from China.  The president is losing patience with China,  the official said, adding that there would be a  more aggressive approach to sanctioning Chinese entities ... in the not-too-distant future.  The White House declined comment. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China's opposition to unilateral sanctions outside the framework of the United Nations and that China has been fully enforcing U.N. resolutions. Getting China's help on passing U.N. resolutions and then putting unilateral sanctions on China was like  abandoning one's benefactor upon achieving one's goal , Geng added.  What China enforces is United Nations resolutions, not the domestic law of certain countries.         U.S. and U.N. sanctions have failed to deter North Korea from pursuing its nuclear and missile programs, and on Friday, it justified its ICBM test was an exercise of its legitimate right to self-defense. The North's KCNA news agency quoted an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman as denouncing U.S. efforts for a new U.N. resolution as a  racket  fabricated by the United States to evade its responsibility for having driven the North to  bolster its nuclear force.  FILE PHOTO: Flags of U.S. and China are placed for a meeting in Beijing, China June 30, 2017.Jason Lee Should the U.N. Security Council adopt another 'resolution on sanctions,' this will trigger corresponding measures,  KCNA cited the official as saying. It did not elaborate on the measures. Haley's Warning Though the sources stressed that no final decisions had been made, they said China, North Korea's main trading partner, was crucial to pressuring Pyongyang to prevent it from achieving the capability of striking the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. During a U.N. Security Council meeting last week, Haley threatened secondary sanctions if the council could not agree on new sanctions – though she did not cite China by name. In late June, Washington imposed secondary sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and accused a regional Chinese bank, the Bank of Dandong, of laundering money for Pyongyang.  Slideshow (2 Images)(((here))) Fresh U.S. sanctions would be aimed at sending a message to Beijing of Washington’s resolve to act further on its own. But they would stop short, at least for now, of the kind of broad “sectoral” sanctions Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, secured through unilateral and international action against Iran to pressure it into negotiations to curb its nuclear program. Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to Washington, said on Monday that secondary sanctions were  not acceptable.   Such actions are obstructing cooperation between China and the U.S. and lead to questions about the real intentions of the U.S. side,” according to a transcript of his remarks from the Chinese embassy. The threat of further secondary sanctions on Chinese companies could complicate next week’s U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, an important forum for narrowing differences between the world’s two biggest economies. While preparations for fresh sanctions are moving forward, tangible new steps by China could prompt Washington to put the measures on hold, the U.S. sources said. “They’d have to show they’re really serious,” the second official said. “We’re not going to be paralyzed into inaction.” Trump pledged repeatedly during his election campaign to get tough on Chinese trade practices deemed unfair to the United States, but his rhetoric softened after the friendlier-than-expected April summit with Xi. Shortly after their meeting, Trump said he had told Xi that China would get a better trade deal if it reined in North Korea. But in recent weeks, Trump has fired off tweets denouncing China's trade with North Korea and cast doubt on whether Beijing was doing enough to counter Pyongyang. Reflecting growing concern about North Korea on Capitol Hill, two members of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Republican Pat Toomey, announced on Wednesday they would soon introduce legislation for North Korea modeled on the Iran secondary sanctions laws passed by Congress.

Mohammed Ayub's body - his throat slit and hands tied behind his back - had been found dumped in a desolate corner of the camp for Rohingya Muslims who have fled neighboring Myanmar. Thirty-year-old Ayub was one of three Rohingya men whose bodies were found over the past few weeks. Aid workers and long-time residents say the incidents, along with the stabbing of a community leader, amount to the worst violence in the camps since the Rohingya began fleeing Buddhist-majority Myanmar more than a quarter of a century ago. Refugees, whose numbers have swelled since fighting late last year in Myanmar's Rakhine state, also report masked men roaming the dark streets of the two camps in Kutupalong at night. Bangladesh police and aid workers say a struggle for control of supplies to the camps is behind the violence.  They beat me and my sister and dragged him out of the house,  Ankis told Reuters, as her 7- and 3-year-old children slept by her on the newly cemented floor.  The kidnappers called me from his number and threatened to kill me too. I'm also getting threats in the name of al-Yaqin.  She was referring to the militant group Harakah al-Yaqin, or  Faith Movement , whose attacks on Myanmar border police posts in October prompted a security crackdown in which troops have been accused of murder and rape of Rohingya civilians. Police say it is unclear whether the insurgent group, which now wants to be known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, was involved in the violence in the camps or whether others were using its name to intimidate refugees. The group, whose leader spoke to Reuters in an interview in March, did not respond to an email seeking comment. Resource Gap More than 75,000 Rohingya have fled northwestern Rakhine state to Bangladesh over recent months, joining tens of thousands already there. Myanmar's military and government have denied almost all allegations of atrocities by security forces. While the government announced the end of its counterinsurgency operation in February, tensions in Myanmar have risen again in recent days after village administrators were murdered and troops killed three people while clearing a Rohingya militant camp. Noor Ankis, 25, whose husband Ayub, a leader of the unregistered makeshift camp in Kutupalong, was killed late last month, poses for a picture with her two children in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, July 9, 2017.Mohammad Ponir HossainThe population of the official and makeshift camps in Kutupalong, around 400 km (250 miles) southeast of Dhaka, has swelled to around 86,000, from 49,000, since the October exodus, according to a Bangladeshi government document seen by Reuters. While the nearly 14,000 refugees in the registered camp receive medical care and food from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the majority living in plastic-and-mud huts of the cramped makeshift camp are largely left to fend for themselves.  There's always that resources gap and that's the reason there is always tension between the registered refugees and those outside,  said Sanjukta Sahany, a senior official with the International Organization for Migration in Bangladesh that is charged with coordinating relief efforts by various UN agencies.  Post-influx the security situation has deteriorated.  Slideshow (3 Images)A recent cyclone and floods that put added strain on limited aid supplies have also made things worse, aid workers said. Shinji Kubo, UNHCR's Bangladesh boss, said he was pressing the local government to let his agency expand its role beyond the two registered camps in the country. Masked Men Ayub's wife, Ankis, said her husband had been involved in an ongoing dispute with drug users in the makeshift camp in Kutupalong, according to a police report seen by Reuters. He was kidnapped by a group of 20-25 machete-wielding men who barged into their shack on the night of June 14, she said. Reuters reported in February that Bangladesh blames the Rohingya influx for the soaring use of methamphetamine drug in the country. Ayub's body was recovered from a muddy wasteland between two hillocks in Kutupalong on June 25. The body of another man, Mohammed Selim, who was also abducted on June, had been found in a similar state at the same place a week earlier. Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and killing of Ayub, though the motive remained unclear, senior police officer Afruzul Haque Tutul said. In the camps, refugees remain fearful of the mysterious masked men who continue to be reported moving around at night.  I was sleeping with my two children and my wife when they called my name,  said a 30-year-old registered refugee, who was twice approached by groups of 10-12 men, though he did not open his door.  The one hour they waited outside my home was the longest one hour of my life.  Reporting by Krishna N.

The forint and the zloty strengthened by 0.1 percent by 0856 GMT, to multi-week highs, and the Czech crown  and the leu also firmed slightly.     Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated on Wednesday that the Fed's rate hikes could be gradual rather than fast.     That has increased risk appetite in global markets and has also taken pressure off government bonds in the European Union's eastern members.     Investors in this part of the world focus on the policy of the European Central Banks, which has shifted towards a more hawkish rhetoric, but also watch the Fed and U.S. long-term debt yields.     Poland's 10-year bond yield dropped 2 basis points to 3.31 percent.     Hungarian yields were flat, but the 10-year yield, after 30 basis point rise in the past three weeks to about 3.3 percent, may continue to retreat next week from current levels at 3.08 percent, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.      Of course, only if nothing changes. It hinges on economic data (in developed markets) and U.S. and European bond market developments,  the trader said, adding that the next key figures watched were U.S. inflation data due later on Friday.     Hungary has filed a shelf registration in Japan for Samurai and Uridashi bonds issues, the Reuters news service IFR said.       The region's assets are less vulnerable to developments in the dollar and in crude prices than other emerging markets due to closer links with the euro zone and less reliance on commodities.     Healthy economic growth and stability, including good current accounts helped by robust exports, have underpinned the region's currencies even though the region's central banks are unlikely to lift interest rates in the next quarters, except for Czechs.     Czech current account figures showed slightly higher than expected deficit for May on Friday, but they follow a big surplus in April.     Hungary's current account dynamics remains  very supportive  of the forint even though there is no monetary tightening in the horizon, and Poland's economic picture is evolving nicely, including the current account, Citigroup said in a note.     Romania and Poland are also due to release current account data on Friday.     Romania's central bank indicated in the minutes of its July 3 meeting that it was not worried over a widening of the current account deficit as industrial output continues to surge and foreign investments keep flow in.

The Dalai Lama is expected to address a human rights conference in the capital, Gaborone, on Aug. 17-19 and will also meet Botswana's president. China is a major investor in Botswana's economy. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing that the Dalai Lama wears the cloak of religion to engage in anti-China, separatist activities and China opposes any foreign official meeting him in any form.  We hope the relevant country can clearly recognize the essence of who the Dalai Lama is, earnestly respect China's core concerns, and make the correct decision on this issue,  Geng said. He did not elaborate. The Dalai Lama, who fled from Tibet into exile in India in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been at loggerheads with China, which brands him a dangerous separatist.  The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, says he seeks greater rights, including religious freedom and genuine autonomy for Tibet. Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China. It often retaliates by stopping high-level meetings or taking economic steps, like last year when it imposed new border fees following a visit by the Dalai Lama to Mongolia. Botswana's neighbor South Africa has denied a visa to the Buddhist monk three times since 2009 in what opposition parties there, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, say shows the extent of Beijing's influence over Pretoria. China's fast-growing demand for raw materials has made it one of the biggest investors in Africa and its largest trade partner. Chinese state-owned companies have been awarded contracts to build roads, dams, power stations and airports in Botswana.

The mission to arrest two al Qaeda-linked militants on the southern island of Mindanao went disastrously wrong when police Special Action Force commandos were ambushed and outnumbered by rebel gunmen, in what was the biggest crisis of Aquino's 2010-2016 presidency. Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said Aquino should be indicted because he allowed his suspended police chief, Alan Purisima, to be involved in the planning and execution of the January 2015 raid in Mamasapano, Maguindano province.  There is no gainsaying that President Aquino was fully aware that the Office of the Ombudsman had placed Purisima under preventive suspension at that time,  Carpio Morales said in a statement.  A public officer who is under preventive suspension in barred from performing any public functions and from meddling into the affairs of the government,  Carpio Morales said of Purisima, who was serving a suspension over corruption allegations. The Mamasapano massacre also dealt a blow to Aquino's vaunted peace efforts with separatists of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which had agreed to disarm in return for self-rule over predominantly Muslim parts of Mindanao. A bill to establish that was subsequently rejected by Congress and has, according to experts, contributed to mistrust,  disillusionment and insecurity in a region where Islamic State's ideology has started to gain traction. A revised bill is expected to be put to Congress in coming weeks. Aquino's spokeswoman, Abigail Valte, said the former president felt the full facts surrounding the incident had not been presented.  An initial reading shows that there may have been a misappreciation of some facts surrounding the incident, leading to some erroneous conclusions,  she said in a statement.  He will seek to clarify the same through a motion for reconsideration.

(Reuters) - The blast furnaces and slab casters at United States Steel Corp's Granite City Works have been idle for 18 months, and laid-off workers here are pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump imposing broad new restrictions on imported steel. Yet just across the Mississippi River, some manufacturers worry that new tariffs and curbs Trump is weighing under a  Section 232  national security review will raise their cost and make it harder to compete with foreign rivals.  The inherent conflict between suppliers and buyers is at the heart of a debate inside the administration that lobbyists and lawmakers say could delay or weaken any protections recommended by the U.S. Commerce Department. The review's findings, originally expected by the end of June, could be unveiled in the coming weeks. The Cold War-era law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense pits an iconic industry that has been struggling with imports for decades against those that have benefited from China flooding the world steel market with excess production. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1z) According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the libertarian Cato Institute, steel mills and steel product factories now employ about 140,000 people, compared to 6.5 million at steel-reliant manufacturers ranging from autos and appliances to machinery.    Hopes and Concerns In Granite City, where about 1,200 of the U.S. Steel plant's 1,800 workers remain laid off despite the recent restart of some  rolling mill operations, there is an air of keen anticipation.  We're waiting on the 232 to get us back to work,  said Chris Bragg, who was laid off in November 2015 when steel imports surged and oil prices cratered, slashing demand for the mill's main product, hot-rolled steel for oil and gas drilling pipe. The 46-year-old father of three has been working in home construction since then, making less than half of the $55,000 he earned in his last year working on U.S. Steel's basic oxygen furnace, which melts iron and alloys into steel.  There were few dinners out, no vacations and no high school graduation presents for Bragg's twin sons last year. TJ's Place, a bar across the street from a plant gate,  canceled its fish fries and taco nights and could close if more workers are not called back, said bartender Diane Valerius.  If that mill shuts down, this town is dead.   Idled steelworkers Reuters interviewed in this factory suburb see the  Section 232  probe as a key test of Trump's commitment to campaign promises to revive U.S. manufacturing and curb imports from China and South Korea.    I voted for Trump because the Democratic Party was going to kill the coal industry and the steel industry in one fell swoop,  said Bill Wiley, 50, a laid-off apprentice millwright.  Somebody has to stick up for us. We’re just asking for a level playing field.  Across the Mississippi in north St. Louis, factory managers at Bachman Machine Co worry new tariffs and curbs could raise steel prices, putting the 90-year-old maker of stamped steel auto parts at a disadvantage against Mexican suppliers.  Anything that is out of the norm in terms of a price change is going to be a negative factor for us. If we can't pass that on, then that hurts us,  said Jerry Ernsky, Bachman's head of sales and marketing.  The 100-employee company buys from steel distributors and often does not know the origin of the steel it uses to make parts for seats, airbags, door mechanisms and other components, Ernsky said. These are sold to larger auto suppliers such as Toyoda Gosei in Perryville, Missouri, and ultimately find their way to the U.S. assembly plants of Toyota, Honda, Ford and other automakers.  Historic building exterior at U.S. Steel Corp's Granite City Works in Granite City, Illinois, U.S. on July 5, 2017.David LawderKei Pang, chief executive of Ferguson, Missouri-based Nidec Motor Corp, the former Emerson Electric motors unit now owned by Japan's Nidec Corp, warned Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a letter that import curbs on certain electrical steels  would cause serious and material harm to our companies, our employees, and our customers.  AK Steel is the only remaining U.S. manufacturer of electrical steel, a specialty product with precise magnetic properties used in transformers and motors. It has argued that it needs protection because domestic supplies are needed to safeguard the U.S. electrical grid. Tubular Target  In similar public comments, U.S. Steel has called for  import restrictions on tubular goods for the oil and gas industry as a way of safeguarding U.S. energy independence, a critical national security goal. Foreign steelmakers now supply half the oil and gas drilling and extraction pipe used in the United States. Slideshow (8 Images)Direct imports from China were largely cut off by successful anti-dumping cases in recent years, only to be replaced by pipe imports from South Korea, which since April have been subject to increased duties. But as U.S. energy firms boost production, foreign-made steel pipes are still flooding into U.S. ports. Based on June import permit data, The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that imports of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are up 237 percent in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier.  Ross, the Commerce chief, has indicated he might support protection for U.S. makers of pipes and their suppliers. He told a congressional hearing in June that steel was a  genuine national security issue  and pointed out how a U.S. tubular mill made the body of the massive conventional bomb dropped on Islamic State militants in Afghanistan in April. The 79-year-old billionaire is best known for his work restructuring several bankrupt U.S. steel companies in the early 2000s, selling them to what is now Arcelor Mittal. He is formulating trade policy alongside U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer who represented U.S. Steel in anti-dumping cases. On the other side of the argument, steel users have enlisted dozens of industry trade groups to make the case against broad steel import restrictions. The American Petroleum Institute and 10 other oil and gas trade groups urged Commerce to narrowly define national security and  to consider the potential negative effects of U.S. tariffs or quotas or other measures that would raise the cost of steel inputs for the oil and natural gas industry.  It remains unclear what actions Ross will recommend, whether Trump will implement that.  U.S. Steel has not indicated how the Trump administration's review may alter its production plans, saying in a statement that it was  interested to review the results of the 232 investigation.  Idled workers say the uncertainty is gnawing at them.   There's nothing that Trump's done as of yet  for steelworkers, said Paul Morris, 55.  All we can do is sit back and wait.

The National Financial Work Conference is strictly closed-door, but its outcome will be widely watched.  At the inaugural conference in 1997, Beijing set up China's insurance regulator. The second in 2002 saw the creation of the banking regulator. China Investment Corp [CIC.UL], the sovereign wealth fund, was formed after the 2007 conference.  The most recent meeting in 2012 yielded no significant policy change as the country's top leadership went through a once-in-a-decade transition, with Xi Jinping taking Hu Jintao's place as the leader of the People's Republic of China.  Ahead of the once-every-five years congress of the Communist Party in autumn this year, stability of the economy and society is key, with Xi expected to further consolidate his hold on power. Economists say the meeting this weekend will likely focus on how the central bank can better coordinate with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to tackle weaknesses in the financial system. A Broader Mandate?    We can expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to be given more power to oversee and coordinate, given the growing amount of financial products that cross the boundaries of the three regulators,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.   This shift is positive as the PBOC is probably the best placed to do this since it had the broadest mandate of ensuring financial stability.  PBOC, CBRC, CSRC and CIRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Investors have long supported the idea of a unified body to oversee the various regulators that oversee the different parts of the financial system, though there is little sign that a super-merger is imminent.  In 2015, a poorly coordinated response to China's stock market crash not only did not help end the bloodshed, the government's competence came under scrutiny. Premier Li Keqiang openly criticized regulators for not responding sufficiently.  In March this year, CBRC's new chief Guo Shuqing said the banking regulator is collaborating with other regulators to create a framework to close loopholes in rules for cross-market financial products.  Different regulators, different laws, different rules have caused some chaos,  Guo said. Current Risks     Economists expect the meeting this weekend to set the tone of future financial regulations, but warn against expectations for major shifts in policy.       The core of the meeting is to defuse current risks, and the defusing itself shouldn't cause any systemic and regional risks,  said Zhang Ming, chief economist at Ping An Securities. China's top leadership has identified curtailing financial risks as a top priority this year after a sharp rise in overall leverage. The conference is expected to tackle China's $7.7 trillion shadow banking sector. The loosely regulated industry includes non-bank forms of credit such as trusts and wealth management products (WMPs). Earlier this year, PBOC included banks' off-the-balance-sheet WMPs in its examination of broad credit in its Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) for the first time, to give authorities a better sense of potential risks to the financial system.  Economist also say that further opening up China's financial sector will be on the meeting's agenda.

Non-oil domestic exports in June were expected to have risen 4.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in the survey of 10 economists. On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, non-oil domestic exports in June were seen down 2.1 percent, the poll found. Exports of electronics have remained solid this year and analysts say, are likely to continue to do so. Singapore narrowly avoided a recession, growing at 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the quarter before, saved by solid global demand for its tech products, data on Friday showed.

The move on indexes on Friday was more muted as investors hunkered down ahead of earnings reports from major U.S. banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) later in the day. The pan-European STOXX 600  index was flat in percentage terms by 0852 GMT (4:52 a.m. ET) while euro zone bluechips .STOXX50E were little changed.  In Europe, we're still not dealing with any higher interest rates, which should be benefiting the U.S. (banks) slightly in terms of net interest margin,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  That said we've still got the supportive QE helping, but yields are still low, which is not great for the banks.  Accendo Markets' van Dulken added that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had been very non-committal in her comments about both interest rates and the balance sheet. Firmer metals prices underpinned gains on mining stocks. Miners .SXPP were led higher by steel firms Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE), ArcelorMittal (MT.AS), and Tenaris (TENR.MI) which rose after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he was considering quotas and tariffs on Chinese steel dumping. Analysts at Barclays said that they remained positive on the European mining sector, which has gained just 4 percent so far this year after rallying more than 60 percent in 2016.  Chinese rates are falling, demand indicators across the economy appear healthy, industry capex discipline is holding, M&A; is generally off the agenda, and resulting strong cashflows are being utilised for balance sheet reconstruction and distributions to shareholders,  Barclays analysts said in a note. While a rise in bond yields has hit rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities .SX6P, banking stocks .SX7P have instead benefited and the sector was roughly flat as Swedish lender SEB (SEBa.ST) jumped around 2 percent after its second-quarter profit topped forecasts. Other Nordic stocks were also in focus as Norwegian insurer Gjensidige (GJFS.OL) slumped 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its second quarter results came in below forecasts.     It was joined by Swedish construction group Skanksa (SKAb.ST), which dropped nearly 5 percent after it warned that its second-quarter profit would be hit by project writedowns in the U.S. and Britain.

Italy's debt servicing industry is experiencing strong growth as the country's lenders face pressure from regulators to cut soured debts that rose to 349 billion euros due to a harsh recession that ended in 2014. By 0920 GMT shares in doBank traded at 10.27 euros each, up 14 percent from an IPO price of 9 euros. U.S. fund Fortress Investment Group, which remains doBank's majority shareholder, has pocketed 312 million from the IPO after placing a 44.3 percent stake on the market. The float could rise to nearly 50 percent if Fortress exercises an option to sell more shares. Fortress bought UCCMB, the bad loan manager of Italian bank UniCredit in 2015, and went on to merge it with rival Italfondiario to create industry leader doBank, which is estimated to manage 77 billion euros in gross bad loans.  We believe it to be an excellent investment given doBank's market positioning and the fact that bad loan management is a top priority for Italian banks - and therefore for the country - at this juncture,  said Gerardo Murano at ADB Corporate Advisory. Consultancy PWC estimates that Italian servicers managed up to 155 billion euros in bad bank debts last year. Roughly half of that is outsourced by banks, the rest by specialised investors which bought bad loan portfolios from lenders. Italy's Creval said late on Thursday it had closed the sale of 1.4 billion euros in gross bad debt.  We expect the share of bad loans managed by independent non-performing loan servicers will continue to rise in the near future, reaching around 200 billion euros by 2018,  PWC said. PWC also estimated that sales of bad debts by Italian banks could top 60 billion euros this year. Sales have been slow so far as, despite heavy writedowns in recent years, banks can only offload soured loans at a loss. When bidding for a bad loan portfolio, buyers typically team up with a service company. Some investors have followed in Fortress' steps and taken over a soured loan specialist. Earlier this year Bain Capital Credit bought Italian bad loan platform Aquileia Capital Services. Another U.S. fund, Varde Partners, took a 33 percent stake in independent servicer Guber in April. Collection activities vary on the type of loan. Personal loans are generally handled through phone and door-to-door collection. Recovering loans backed by collateral, such as real estate assets, is more complex, requiring at times a conversion of an unfinished property site.

The European Union, the world's main trader, also saw its trade increase with all its main partners, with a surge of exchanges with Russia despite economic sanctions on Moscow. The European Union statistics office Eurostat said on Friday the 19-country currency area in May exported goods worth 189.6 billion euros ($216.3 billion) to the rest of the world, an increase by 12.9 percent on the year.  Imports also grew yearly by 16.4 percent for a total volume of 168.1 billion euros, according to data not adjusted for seasonal factors.  Both figures were the second highest ever-recorded for the euro zone after the peak reached in March when exports were above 200 billion euros and imports stood at 176 billion euros. The faster growth of imports compared to exports slightly reduced the bloc's trade surplus which stood at 21.4 billion euros in May, lower than the 23.4 billion surplus recorded in May 2016. Commerce among the 19 euro zone states also increased by 15.3 percent in May on a yearly basis, for a volume of 162.4 billion euros of traded goods. The European Union as a whole also recorded a 15.9 percent surge of exports to the rest of the world in May year-on-year and a 17.2 percent increase of imports, Eurostat said. The 28-country bloc expanded its trade with all its main partners in the period between January and May, with exports to the United States rising on the year 6.6 percent and to China 20.3 percent, while imports increased respectively 4.0 and 6.8 percent. The highest increases were recorded with Russia, which overtook Switzerland as the third main source of imports for the EU. Despite western economic sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, EU exports to Russia grew 24.6 percent between January and May, driven by manufactured goods and machinery, while imports, composed principally of oil and gas, surged by 37.6 percent. As a result, EU trade deficit with Russia expanded in May to 29.5 billion euros from 18.9 billions the year earlier.

The move on indexes on Friday was more muted as investors hunkered down ahead of earnings reports from major U.S. banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) later in the day. The pan-European STOXX 600  index was flat in percentage terms by 0852 GMT (4:52 a.m. ET) while euro zone bluechips .STOXX50E were little changed.  In Europe, we're still not dealing with any higher interest rates, which should be benefiting the U.S. (banks) slightly in terms of net interest margin,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  That said we've still got the supportive QE helping, but yields are still low, which is not great for the banks.  Accendo Markets' van Dulken added that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had been very non-committal in her comments about both interest rates and the balance sheet. Firmer metals prices underpinned gains on mining stocks. Miners .SXPP were led higher by steel firms Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE), ArcelorMittal (MT.AS), and Tenaris (TENR.MI) which rose after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he was considering quotas and tariffs on Chinese steel dumping. Analysts at Barclays said that they remained positive on the European mining sector, which has gained just 4 percent so far this year after rallying more than 60 percent in 2016.  Chinese rates are falling, demand indicators across the economy appear healthy, industry capex discipline is holding, M&A; is generally off the agenda, and resulting strong cashflows are being utilised for balance sheet reconstruction and distributions to shareholders,  Barclays analysts said in a note. While a rise in bond yields has hit rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities .SX6P, banking stocks .SX7P have instead benefited and the sector was roughly flat as Swedish lender SEB (SEBa.ST) jumped around 2 percent after its second-quarter profit topped forecasts. Other Nordic stocks were also in focus as Norwegian insurer Gjensidige (GJFS.OL) slumped 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its second quarter results came in below forecasts.     It was joined by Swedish construction group Skanksa (SKAb.ST), which dropped nearly 5 percent after it warned that its second-quarter profit would be hit by project writedowns in the U.S. and Britain. [nL8N1K519B] European earnings get underway in earnest only later this month. Overall, analyst are calling for about 9 percent year-on-year earnings growth for top European firms, compared to about 8 percent for the U.S., according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent by 0840 GMT, in line with mid-caps. Blue-chips were set for a 0.7 percent weekly gain, their best performance since late May. Drugmaker AstraZeneca continued Thursday's slide, down 1.6 percent due to uncertainty around reports that CEO Soriot was preparing to leave the company. A spokeswoman said the company declined to comment on the media report. Retailer Tesco was among top gainers, tracking Europe-wide strength among retailers and consumer goods firms, which both gained 0.2 percent. Royal Mail shares fell 1.4 percent after it replaced its pension plan, giving employees a choice between defined benefit or contribution pension scheme after opposition from trade unions. Among mid-caps, Carillion saw some relief from heavy losses this week, rising 6 percent to the top of the mid-caps after the crisis-hit construction and support services contractor hired HSBC as joint financial adviser and corporate broker, amid speculation it is preparing a rights issue. It was still on track for a 70 percent drop in market value for the week. Property firm Derwent London was among top European gainers, after Exane BNP Paribas raised the stock to an 'outperform' rating, citing the firm's 'defensive' rents and strong pipeline. It expressed optimism over the prospects for a sector seen as particularly vulnerable to Brexit.  Values in the London office market have barely moves post-Brexit thanks to abundant investment market liquidity (particularly from Asia) and resilient take-up,  its analysts said in a note, adding firms have recycled capital, deleveraged and payed special dividends. Exane analysts forecast an average 8 percent decline in London office rents by 2019 -  a gradual weakening rather than a sharp correction , they said. Derwent peer NewRiver also gained 2 percent, after its first-quarter results showed 71 new lettings agreed, and occupancy remained high. Emerging markets-focused asset manager Ashmore fell after reporting a 5 percent rise in its fourth-quarter assets, boosted by new client cash. Despite the results being in line with forecasts, the shares fell 2.8 percent to the bottom of the mid-caps.  This was Ashmore's second consecutive quarter of inflows, marking the first time since 2013,  said UBS analysts.  That said, due to the increase in the GBP/USD rate during the quarter, the growth of assets under management measured in sterling was a more moderate 1.1 percent quarter-on-quarter.

The Italian-American automaker said it is recalling about 770,000 sport utility vehicles because of a wiring issue that may lead to inadvertent deployment of the driver-side air bag and is linked to reports of five related minor injuries, but no crashes. The company said wiring could chafe against pieces of steering-wheel trim, potentially causing a short-circuit and ultimately leading to an inadvertent air bag deployment. The issue could also cause unintended windshield wiper operation or inoperable switches. The recall covers 538,000 2011-2015 Dodge Journey vehicles in North America and 233,000 2011-2015 Fiat Freemont crossovers sold elsewhere. Dealers will inspect and replace the wiring, as needed and equip it with additional protective covering.

The company said hot ambient temperatures could lead to premature diode wear, may result in a burning odor or smoke, could impact the anti-lock braking system or lead to engine stalls. The company said it is aware of two potentially related accidents but no injuries. The recall covers 2011-2014 model year Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger cars and Dodge Durango SUVs and 2012-2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs. In October, Fiat Chrysler recalled about 86,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks, 3500, 4500 and 5500 chassis cabs from the 2007-2013 model years and 2011-2014 Dodge Charger Pursuit sedans for the same alternator issue.

The region's future growth and security - as well as the welfare of hundreds of millions of people - are at stake, said a new report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).   Countries in Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty - and disaster - if (climate change) mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented,  said Bambang Susantono, the ADB's vice-president for sustainable development.  The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which came into force last November, pledges to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.   Related CoverageFactbox: Floods, reef loss and migration: Asia's future on a hotter planetEarly and aggressive measures are needed to achieve that goal, the report said. If the world continues to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases as now, global mean temperature would increase by over 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with parts of Asia-Pacific seeing a rise of 6 degrees, it added.  Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern China could experience even hotter climates, with temperatures rising 8 degrees Celsius, it added. This would bring drastic changes in the region's weather, biodiversity, agriculture and fisheries, and drive migration as some parts become less habitable, said the report.  Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region, and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development,  the ADB said in a statement. Asia-Pacific is home to two-thirds of the world's population and nine out of 15 countries listed as most vulnerable to natural hazards globally. Millions of people in South Asia are already affected by rising temperatures, and despite impressive economic growth, United Nations' figures show one in 10 Asians still live in extreme poverty.  Investments to rapidly shift Asia's economy onto a low-carbon path must be a high priority because the coming decade is crucial to achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the report said.  Many countries in the region still rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy. The ADB said it would invest $4 billion by 2020 to promote renewable energy supplies and green growth across the region.

By not saying when its net bond purchases will fall to zero, the ECB hopes to underline that there is no preset course for its stimulus program, and that any changes remain dependent on economic data, with a special focus on wages, the sources added. They held up the Federal Reserve's exit from its asset buying in 2014 as a potential blueprint, noting the U.S. central bank's unwillingness to publicly target an end-date.  The Fed has done the most successful exit so it's the example for us to study,  said a source who asked not to be named.  The important thing is not to pre-commit and keep it very gradual.         ECB President Mario Draghi sent a shockwave through markets earlier this month when he opened the door to potential tweaks to the quantitative easing program. That left investors scrutinizing any potential clues to the bank's next move, which is expected to come at its Sept. 7 meeting. ECB policymakers also meet next Thursday.  Half of analysts polled by Reuters now expect the ECB to announce in September that it will gradually wind down its asset buying, a process known as tapering, while a quarter see a one-off reduction and another quarter expect no change. Related CoverageFactbox: Key quotes from ECB policymakers ahead of July 20 rate meetingSo far, the ECB has said its purchases are intended to run at their current pace until December 2017  or beyond, if necessary  and that there would be winding-down phase after that. The biggest challenge could be convincing markets that tapering, once started, may still be subject to change.  While the Fed emphasized the open-ended nature of its bond purchases, it scaled back the amount it bought by $10 billion at each meeting, creating the perception that it was on a preset course even if that notion was taboo. The Fed announced its first reduction in December 2013 and ended buys the following October. Its policymakers keenly avoided the discussion of an end-date throughout the tapering process, even if markets inferred it and were eventually proven right.  The sources noted that adopting a similar strategy risked entrapping the ECB by making it difficult to deviate from a presumed schedule without generating undue market volatility.    The ECB declined to comment. The sources added that no decision has been made and the debate remains open, with new staff forecasts due in September expected to provide a key piece of the puzzle. Wages  How can I decide in September what we're going to do next June?  another source said.  It's got to be data-dependent and we need to preserve the flexibility.  Of particular importance for policymakers will be German wage negotiations around the start of next year and they are keen to have flexibility to respond, particularly if the results again disappoint. While growth is accelerating and unemployment is falling quicker than expected, wage growth is anemic, partly because unions tend to look at past inflation when tabling demands, making it difficult to escape a low inflation environment.  Next year's German wage deals will be very important,  a third source said.  I think unions are not aggressive enough in making their demands given rising corporate profitability.  The ECB's problem is that even as euro zone economic growth is on its best run in a decade, inflation is expected to remain weak, and well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, at least through 2019.  In a possible clue about the sort of move the ECB may contemplate, Executive Board member Benoit Coeure pointed to the bank's decision last December when it cut its asset buys by a quarter but extended the timetable by nine months.      We scaled back our asset purchases without undermining the support given to the economy,  Coeure said in a recent interview.  So, I would argue that we have already adjusted our monetary policy ... This adjustment has been done in a very careful way, as a number of factors continue to weigh on inflation.  If the ECB is confident its previous move was correct, it may again consider a one-off reduction with a term extension before revisiting the subject later.  Draghi argued earlier this month that with growth alone providing more accommodation, the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of stimulus unchanged.

MSCI's emerging market index edged higher on the day to scale a new 26-month peak, poised for a near 4 percent gain over the week. The index was lifted by stellar gains across Asia, with heavyweight South Korea and the India bourse touching record highs, while others such as Hong Kong hovered around multi-month peaks. Currencies were mixed on the day against the dollar which retreated to a nine-month low earlier in the week following the remarks on rate hikes by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. However, most were on track for solid weekly gains. The South African rand and the Turkish lira - the two currencies most vulnerable to higher U.S. interest rates were on track to snap a three-week losing streak and strengthen 1.5 percent over the week. Russia's rouble was up 1.2 percent on the week, finding some support in oil prices  looking to end the week around 4 percent higher.  Global risk appetite has been good, most major stock markets are up over the week ... thanks to a mixture of Yellen and OK growth but not threatening growth,  said Paul Fage, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities. Adding to the chipper mood was Fitch Ratings, which early on Friday confirmed its A+ rating on China with a stable outlook, citing the strength of the external finances and the macroeconomic record of the world's second largest economy. But investors were also awaiting a host of U.S. economic indicators, including core inflation, retail sales and industrial production for June later in the session for more insight into how the Fed might proceed with monetary policy tightening this year.

Carillion, which had seen 70 percent wiped off its market value this week, is reviewing  all options  after it booked a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown on Monday against customer payments it no longer expected to be able to collect. Analysts believe Carillion might have to raise at least 500 million pounds via a share sale or that a debt-for-equity swap could be on the cards to shore up the balance sheet. Its average net borrowing in the first half of the year rose to 695 million pounds from 586.5 million over 2016. Shares bounced 9 percent to 60.65 pence by 0735 GMT, valuing the company at only about 250 million pounds. Carillion shares have been in freefall following the profit warning and exit of its chief executive at the start of the week. Its bondholders have braced for  painful  talks as a pile-up of receivables and debt spooked investors. HSBC, which has been part of Carillion's banking group in the past, joins Morgan Stanley and Stifel as Carillion's existing corporate brokers and Lazard as its financial adviser. A source said HSBC would complement Carillion's existing advisor line up.  With (HSBC) having a long-standing relationship with Carillion, they're quite supportive at this time,  the source said. HSBC, which was Carillion's adviser on its failed attempt to take over peer Balfour Beatty, relaunched its corporate broking in January 2013, and has since been targetting more mandates. Carillion was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine.

The National Financial Work Conference is strictly closed-door, but its outcome will be widely watched.  At the inaugural conference in 1997, Beijing set up China's insurance regulator. The second in 2002 saw the creation of the banking regulator. China Investment Corp [CIC.UL], the sovereign wealth fund, was formed after the 2007 conference.  The most recent meeting in 2012 yielded no significant policy change as the country's top leadership went through a once-in-a-decade transition, with Xi Jinping taking Hu Jintao's place as the leader of the People's Republic of China.  Ahead of the once-every-five years congress of the Communist Party in autumn this year, stability of the economy and society is key, with Xi expected to further consolidate his hold on power. Economists say the meeting this weekend will likely focus on how the central bank can better coordinate with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to tackle weaknesses in the financial system. A Broader Mandate?    We can expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to be given more power to oversee and coordinate, given the growing amount of financial products that cross the boundaries of the three regulators,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.   This shift is positive as the PBOC is probably the best placed to do this since it had the broadest mandate of ensuring financial stability.  PBOC, CBRC, CSRC and CIRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Investors have long supported the idea of a unified body to oversee the various regulators that oversee the different parts of the financial system, though there is little sign that a super-merger is imminent.  In 2015, a poorly coordinated response to China's stock market crash not only did not help end the bloodshed, the government's competence came under scrutiny. Premier Li Keqiang openly criticized regulators for not responding sufficiently.  In March this year, CBRC's new chief Guo Shuqing said the banking regulator is collaborating with other regulators to create a framework to close loopholes in rules for cross-market financial products.  Different regulators, different laws, different rules have caused some chaos,  Guo said. Current Risks     Economists expect the meeting this weekend to set the tone of future financial regulations, but warn against expectations for major shifts in policy.       The core of the meeting is to defuse current risks, and the defusing itself shouldn't cause any systemic and regional risks,  said Zhang Ming, chief economist at Ping An Securities. China's top leadership has identified curtailing financial risks as a top priority this year after a sharp rise in overall leverage. The conference is expected to tackle China's $7.7 trillion shadow banking sector. The loosely regulated industry includes non-bank forms of credit such as trusts and wealth management products (WMPs). Earlier this year, PBOC included banks' off-the-balance-sheet WMPs in its examination of broad credit in its Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) for the first time, to give authorities a better sense of potential risks to the financial system.  Economist also say that further opening up China's financial sector will be on the meeting's agenda.

India's imports of Middle Eastern crude oil shrunk in June to the smallest since October 2015 as the world's third-biggest importer tapped other sources amid OPEC supply cuts, ship tracking data available with Reuters showed. Middle East imports fell 7.6 percent in June from the previous month, partly driven by declines from Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as the production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) made more of a dent in supply. The cuts also drove up Middle East crude prices, prompting price-sensitive Indian buyers to seek substitutes from Russia and Latin America as the world remains awash with oil. Gulf crude accounted for about 58.5 percent of India's imports compared with about 66 percent in May, while the share of oil from Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia, including Russia, rose, according to ship tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts.  The choices have increased and crude is available at competitive prices,  said M. K. Surana, chairman of oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp.  There are high supplies of low-sulfur crude because Nigeria is exempted  from the OPEC cuts, he said. Even as OPEC and some non-OPEC producers cut output to shore up prices, global oil output in June is 1.2 million barrels per day above a year ago, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday in its latest monthly report. The weight of supplies has forced sellers to cut prices  allowing Indian refiners to snap up cargoes in the spot market.  Pricing pressure is playing a role, whoever has crude they want to dispose it as quickly as possible,  said A.K. Sharma, head of finance at Indian Oil Corp. The refiner last week bought the country's first crude cargo from the United States and increased imports of Russian Urals crude this year. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd could buy U.S. light crude in a tender on Friday as they are priced competitively against African oil, the company's head of refineries Ramachandran said. HPCL is evaluating U.S. crude for its refineries, Surana said. West Texas Intermediate oil prices are depressed relative to Middle East benchmark Dubai because of rising U.S. shale oil production and as the OPEC cuts have reduced the amount of Middle East medium, sour crude. This has made it feasible for India to buy heavier U.S. crude to replace Middle East supplies such as Iraq's Basra Light, IOC's Sharma said.

Ho was first charged last February after Macau's anti-corruption agency launched a criminal investigation against him.   Macau, the only place in China where nationals can legally gamble in casinos, has been trying to clean up its act after President Xi Jinping initiated a broad crackdown against corruption in 2014.

Ho and his lawyers have repeatedly stated that the investigation has been biased and that it was impossible for him to have committed the number of crimes he was charged with.  The case involved about 2,000 public contracts, which  prosecutors state were illegally awarded by the prosecution office and resulted in benefits to Ho and members of his family.

The resurgent Swiss master will be the main attraction on Centre Court as he faces Czech Tomas Berdych, but first up will be the battle of the big-hitters when Croatia's Marin Cilic slugs it out with American Sam Querrey.  Federer aside, it is a surprise group. It is the first time since 2003 that the semis have featured four men outside the top four in the world rankings. While Federer is seeded three, he is ranked fifth in the world, and has seen all his biggest rivals fall by the wayside this week. In his semi-final, the crowd, the bookmakers' odds and the form guide will all be in his favor.

The suspicion of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business and missteps by cabinet ministers have taken a toll on Abe, who until recently was favored to win a third three-year term as party leader, and hence, premier when his current term expires in September 2018. Support for Abe's government fell 15.2 points from a month earlier to 29.9 percent, according to a July 7-10 survey by Jiji news agency. The biggest reason cited for not backing the cabinet was a lack of trust in the prime minister. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the government would take the drop  sincerely as the voice of the people .  While aiming for economic recovery as our top priority, we want to strive to solve various problems in and outside Japan one by one in a steady manner,  Suga said. The survey is the latest to show Abe's support at the lowest since his return to office promising to revive the economy and bolster defenses.  Natuso Yamaguchi, leader of the junior partner in Abe's ruling coalition, the Komeito party, earlier on Friday urged the premier to focus on regaining public trust. Related CoverageJapanese government to take slide in support sincerely: spokesmanAbe is considering a wholesale shake-up of his cabinet on Aug. 3, replacing more than half of his 19 ministers while keeping key allies, media have reported.  The cabinet changes, however, may well have only limited impact on Abe's ratings, politicians and analysts said.  When support rates fall like this, it becomes a negative spiral,  said Nihon University political science professor Tomoaki Iwai.   All Abe can do is take a humble stance and keep apologizing. It will take time.  'Shock' Abe's first term as prime minister, in 2006-2007, ended in tatters when he quit abruptly after a year plagued by cabinet scandals and gaffes, a furor over lost public pension payments, a devastating election loss and ill health. Some experts said that for now, though, Abe's job looked safe.   I think this is a shock to the government,  said independent analyst Minoru Morita. But Abe's support is still above the single-digit level that forced some past leaders to resign.  There is the view that depending on his response, his ratings can recover,  Morita said. Suga said the goal of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of revising Japan's pacifist, post-war constitution remained unchanged.  Abe said in May he wanted to achieve his cherished dream of amending the U.S.-drafted charter - seen by many conservatives as a humiliating symbol of Japan's defeat in World War Two - by 2020. Achieving the goal that soon, however, looks increasingly tough in view of Abe's sagging popularity, a key LDP lawmaker told Reuters on Wednesday. Support for the LDP slipped to 21.1 percent, but the main opposition Democratic Party has failed to benefit. Instead, the percentage of voters who said they backed no party at all rose 4.5 points to 65.8 percent, the survey showed. additional reporting and writing by Linda Sieg; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-politics-idUSKBN19Z0KW"},

The June 18 letter addressed to the head of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is the most cohesive pushback yet from the industry against ambitious targets for so-called new energy vehicles in the world's biggest auto market. Keen to combat air pollution, China is planning to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025, with a staggered system of quotas beginning in 2018.  Beijing also sees the policy as a means to help the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines. The strict new rules plus planned harsh penalties for non-compliance, such as the cancellation of licenses to sell non- electric cars in China, has the potential to cause much pain for some automakers in the market.  This will hit the industry pretty hard, especially well-known companies,  said Liping Kang, senior manager at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, a Beijing-based think tank. Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last month that concessions would be made, the ministry later released draft regulations upholding the strict sales quotas.  The proposed rules' ambitious enforcement date is not possible to meet,  the letter from U.S., European, Japanese and Korean auto industry bodies said.   At a minimum, the mandate needs to be delayed a year and include additional flexibilities.   The ministry declined to comment. FILE PHOTO: People gather around the Nio EP9 electric car displayed, at the Shanghai Auto Show, during its media day, in Shanghai, China April 19, 2017.Aly Song/File PhotoThe targets demand firms sell electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate  credits  equivalent to 8 percent of total sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020. Equal Treatment The auto industry bodies also asked for China to reconsider some of the penalties for not achieving the quotas, such as plans to ban carmakers from importing and producing non-new energy vehicles altogether. FILE PHOTO - A sign is pictured on an electric car charging station at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland June 2, 2017.Denis BalibouseThey also called for equal treatment of Chinese and foreign makers. Currently foreign carmakers are excluded from getting full subsidies for new energy vehicles and batteries, leaving manufacturers such as Tesla (TSLA.O) at a disadvantage.   This preference for domestic automakers over import automakers undermines the environmental goals of the regulation, puts imports at a competitive disadvantage, and risks opening China up to international trade disputes,  the letter said. Chinese manufacturers are the biggest producers of electric vehicles worldwide, making 43 percent of the total last year, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co. The letter was signed by the American Automotive Policy Council, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association. European carmakers such as Daimler (DAIGn.DE) have responded to the Chinese proposals by announcing plans to ramp up local production of electric cars, while Tesla has said it is in talks with the Shanghai Municipal government to try to avoid a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles. Foreign manufacturers also want more credit given to plug-in hybrid cars, and for carmakers to be allowed to  bank  credits accrued from already sold cars as well as to  carry forward  credits into subsequent model years. The letter was first reported by Germany's WirtschaftsWoche magazine.

China's fiscal spending jumped 19.1 percent in June from a year earlier, quickening sharply from a 9.2 percent rise in May and signalling government efforts to cushion a gradual slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.  (Aluminium) prices are up on talk of further (smelting) capacity cuts in China ... We really will not know whether or not these cuts will materialize until later this year when they are supposed to start,  INTL FCStone said in a report.  There remains considerable 'wiggle room' for producers to evade production cuts and this could result in only a slight decline in overall output, or more likely, a more moderate pace in the rate of production growth compared to what we are currently seeing.  Fundamentals * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper had eased 0.1 percent to $5,869 a tonne by late afternoon in Asia, extending small losses from the previous session. Prices have failed at the $5,930-$5,970 band five times in the past fortnight, reflecting formidable chart-based resistance at this level. Support is seen at the 100-day moving average at $5,761 a tonne. * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper slipped 0.3 percent to 47,160 yuan ($6,955) a tonne. * OTHER METALS: Zinc and lead fell by around half a percent in London and by about 1.5 percent in Shanghai, weighed down by falls in steel prices. LME aluminium edged up by 0.3 percent. * U.S. ECONOMY: The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate increase this year. * CHINA ECONOMY: China posted stronger-than-expected June trade figures on Thursday, bolstered by firm global demand for Chinese goods and robust appetite for construction materials at home, but local curbs on lending could weigh on imports later this year. * ANTOFAGASTA: Workers at the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile, owned by Antofagasta Plc and Barrick Gold Corp , will resume talks with Antofagasta after voting to strike earlier this week, the union said on Thursday. * LME STORAGE: The LME is trying to revamp its digital metal storage system LMEshield, which registers material stored in non-exchange warehouses to guard against fraud, after scant uptake since it was launched over a year ago.

(Odea) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BB-', Short-Term IDRs of 'B' and a National Long-term Rating of 'A+'. The Outlook on Odea's Long-Term ratings is Stable. A full list of ratings is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS Odea's Long- and Short-Term IDRs and National Rating are driven by the bank's standalone creditworthiness, as reflected in the bank's Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb-'. The VR reflects Odea's limited franchise (ranked 11th by total assets among deposit-taking conventional banks) and heightened credit risk profile considering the bank's high share of foreign currency lending, some high-risk sectoral exposures and only moderate specific reserves coverage of non-performing loans. However, the VR also factors in Odea's generally improving financial metrics and reasonable funding profile in light of the predominance of customer deposits in the bank's funding base and limited wholesale funding reliance. Odea is rated three notches above its 74% owner, Bank Audi S.A.L. (Bank Audi, B-/Stable) whose own ratings are capped by the Lebanese sovereign rating (Bank Audi S.A.L. Group has 76.4% stake in Odea). No support is therefore factored into Odea's IDRs. At the same time, Fitch sees limited contagion risk for Odea from its parent based on i) Odea's low exposure to the Lebanese sovereign (equal to about 1% of total assets at end-1Q17)  ii) limited group funding (end-1Q17: subordinated debt and interbank funding sourced from Bank Audi Group were equal to a combined total of around 3% of total funding)  iii) Odea has not paid any dividends to date, while Bank Audi has contributed about USD1.2 billion in equity. Odea provides banking services to corporate, commercial, SME and retail customers in Turkey, with a majority of loans to the corporate and commercial segments. It accounted for a modest 1.5%, 1.6% and 2.1% of sector assets, loans and deposits, respectively at end-1Q17. Credit risk is heightened by above-sector-average foreign currency lending (equal to 53% of performing loans at end-1Q17 including foreign currency-indexed loans), high single-name borrower concentration and exposure to high-risk sectors such as project finance and construction. At the same time watch-list loans (end-1Q17: 7.4% of performing loans) have increased, as have watch-list restructured loans; at least some of which are likely to migrate to the non-performing loan (NPL) category as loans season in Fitch's view. However, Odea's headline NPL ratio (loans overdue 90 days) remains reasonable; it stood at 3% at end-1Q17 versus the sector average of 3.2%. Odea is endeavouring to reduce its level of foreign currency lending, which fell to 53% of gross loans at end-1Q17 from 56% at end-2016. However, it is likely to remain material considering the bank's high share of foreign currency deposits (65% of the deposit base at end-1Q17). Foreign currency lending is focused mainly on exporters, project finance and infrastructure lending. Energy sector project finance loans also relate mainly to renewable energy projects that benefit from a floor price, in US dollars, guaranteed by the government mitigating credit risk to some extent. Nevertheless, not all borrowers will be fully hedged in our view. Odea's level of specific reserves coverage of NPLs is also fairly weak and significantly below-sector-average (end-1Q17: 45% versus 78%) - albeit a moderate 71% after adjusting for available 'free provisions'. Management attributes the level of NPL reserves coverage to its lower retail loan exposure relative to the sector average and focus on collateralised commercial and corporate lending. Capitalisation is reasonable with a Fitch Core Captial (FCC) ratio of 12.6% at end-1Q17 and a total capital ratio (15.3%) comfortably above the recommended regulatory 12% threshold. Growth has been funded to date by capital injections and subordinated debt provided by shareholders following Odea's establishment in 2012. However, over the medium term the aim is to fund growth organically. It targets loan growth of a moderate 10% CAGR from 2017-2020 with return on equity (ROE) budgeted to rise to around 15% by 2020. Net NPLs relative to FCC remain manageable (13.2% at end-1Q17, or 7% adjusted for free provisions) while pre-impairment profit provides an additional buffer to absorb credit losses. Odea's performance has improved as it has scaled up its balance sheet and cost efficiency is strong. Its cost/assets ratio (end-1Q17: 1.9%) outperforms the sector average (2.1%) despite its small size, reflecting its focus on digital technology and small branch network. However, loan impairment charges remain fairly high (albeit lower relative to pre-impairment profit as the latter has increased) and funding costs are slightly above the sector average, reflecting Odea's strategy to fund loans primarily with customer deposits. Odea reported ROE of a modest 10.8% in 1Q17 (sector average: 18%), up from 7.8% in 2016. Customer deposits accounted for a high 85% of Odea's total funding at end-1Q17 and the bank's gross loans/customer deposits ratio (a low 92% end-1Q17) far outperforms the sector average (125%). Furthermore, wholesale funding (15% of total funding) relates largely to trade finance operations, accounting for much of the bank's short-term foreign currency liabilities maturing within one year. The remainder consists of long-term funding from international financial institutions. Consequently, and in light of the bank's adequate foreign currency liquidity, Fitch views refinancing risk as manageable. At end-1Q17 foreign currency liquid assets fully covered maturing liabilities due within one year. Nevertheless, foreign currency liquidity could come under pressure from a prolonged market closure. Odea's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's view that support from the Turkish state cannot be relied upon. This reflects the bank's lack of systemic importance in Turkey. Support from the bank's shareholder cannot be relied upon given the weak ability of Bank Audi to provide support based on its current rating (b-/Stable). RATING SENSITIVITIES The VR could be downgraded in case of significant deterioration in asset quality that put pressure on capital ratios and performance. A sharp tightening of liquidity could also result in pressure on the VR. Upside to the VR is limited in the near term, given the bank's rating limited record of operations, modest franchise and high credit risk profile in the challenging Turkish operating environment. In the medium term the VR could be upgraded as a result of the successful expansion of the bank's franchise without a corresponding increase in risk appetite or due to an improvement in the bank's credit risk profile resulting in better asset quality metrics.

During this time, the managements would look to finalise details such as the swap ratio, and seek the requisite approvals from various regulators overseeing the banking, insurance, and capital markets. Fitch believes regulatory approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be the biggest hurdle to the proposed merger. The RBI had previously taken the view that banks cannot undertake any business activity through a separate entity that can be done within the bank; and the proposed structure of having a non-bank financial institution alongside the bank could be a significant barrier to the merger. While the managements believe that the RBI's on-tap bank licensing guidelines issued in 2016 take a more considered view on this aspect, we believe the central bank has not fundamentally altered its stance. Shriram Transport's main business is used commercial vehicle financing, which is also undertaken by various other banks. In the event the merger proceeds, Fitch would review the final terms of the merger and assess the impact on the rating based on the final structure, the role of Shriram Transport within the larger IDFC Group and any potential synergies that Shriram Transport may derive from the merger. Any changes that materially alter or impact Shriram Transport's standalone profile could lead to a review of its rating. While it may be difficult to assess the impact of the merger now, the agency is cautious about the potential benefits for Shriram Transport, which has a unique business model, and a different customer base and distinct culture compared with IDFC Group, which transformed from an infrastructure finance company to a commercial bank in 2015. The proposed merger also includes the combination of various other Shriram Group entities with IDFC Group companies. Shriram City Union Finance, the group's consumer finance arm, would be merged with IDFC Bank, which would put IDFC Bank on a par with Shriram Transport in terms of loans. Shriram Group entities have significantly better valuations than IDFC Group entities, which makes the pricing crucial for the merger to proceed. The managements of the two sides have indicated that the merger, should it happen, will take at least 12 months to complete.

Ram Nath Kovind's ascent to the highest public office will be the first for a leader reared in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) or National Volunteers' Association, the ideological mentor of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates. Under India's constitution, the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues wield executive power and the president remains above the fray.  But the president has a key role during political crises, such as when a parliament election is inconclusive, by deciding which political party is in the best position to form a government. Some presidents, such as the current incumbent, Pranab Mukherjee, have tried to act as conscience-keepers, using their constitutional authority as the head of state to defend India's founding principles as a secular and diverse democracy. Kovind, 72, a low-caste Dalit politician who served as the government's lawyer in the Supreme Court as well as a  state governor, said he would uphold the dignity of the president's office.   Ever since I took over as governor, I have no political affiliation. The president of India is above politics,  he said, while filing his nomination last month. The BJP itself has been playing up Kovind's credentials as a candidate from the lowest Dalit caste in the Hindu social hierarchy which has been oppressed for centuries but is now being wooed by political parties for its votes.  But the opposition said Kovind's roots in the RSS, which has long espoused a Hindu India, remain a concern at a time when the Modi government is pursuing a partisan agenda and Hindu hardliners have whipped up an atmosphere of fear among the country's minorities. Meira Kumar, the opposition candidate put up by the centrist Congress and communist parties, said her candidacy aimed to fight the ideology Kovind represents.  This is an election to the country's highest office,  she said.  I respect Kovindji. My fight is not against him but the ideology he represents.  Kovind's victory is considered a certainty because the electoral college, consisting of members of both houses of the federal parliament and state assemblies across the country, is loaded in favor of the ruling BJP.  Voting concludes on Monday and votes will be counted on Thursday. Kovind's election will cap a series of top appointments Modi has made, strengthening the grip of the Hindu right on public offices, such as state chief ministers and governors, but also academic institutions and thinktanks.  In March, Modi picked Hindu hardliner Yogi Adityanath, who has been accused of inciting violence against India's Muslim minority, to lead the country's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh after his party won a landslide victory. He has supported strong measures for cow protection, and also said minority groups that oppose yoga should either leave the country or drown themselves in the sea. A long-time propagandist of the RSS runs the state of Haryana, neighboring Delhi and home to the global outsourcing industry, while more than half-a-dozen governors have had early training in the RSS drills and patriotic lessons held countrywide at dawn each day.  A background in the RSS, known for its service to the country, can only help those in public life, the editor of an RSS mouthpiece said.   A swayamsevak thinks about the motherland and unity of society. Anyone who is associated with this ideology should be widely respected,  said Hitesh Shankar, editor of Panchjanya.  Writing by Sanjeev Miglani,  Editing by Clarence Fernandez","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-president-idUSKBN19Z0RL"},

He struts confidently in front of the judges, unaware that his small-town accent and gauche demeanour put him at a serious disadvantage in the competition. The film exemplifies its protagonist. It is so blind to its faults and so engrossed in what it thinks is profundity that it doesn’t realise it is unintentionally hilarious. Slideshow (4 Images)There are some films that start off wrong but grow on you. Characters that seemed odd at first gradually fit into the tapestry of the movie, making them believable. But nothing like that happens in “Shab”, which unravels under the weight of its own pretentiousness as it hurtles towards its conclusion. Rohan (Ashish Bisht) is a small-town boy who wants to make it big as a model. He catches the eye of Sonal Modi (Raveena Tandon), a rich socialite who is on the lookout for a boy toy. Director Onir weaves a cast of characters around Rohan’s life - a gay restaurant owner, a melancholic Frenchman, and a troubled neighbour.  All these people are living double lives and are struggling to come to terms with their situation, but “Shab” is happy giving them lip service. The dialogue is theatrical, the acting mediocre and less said about the screenplay, the better.  Onir confines Delhi to one street - everyone visits one cafe, one hotel and constantly runs into one another. There are too many contrivances and very little genuine emotion for the film to work at any level. This feels like a college skit that mistakenly made it to the big screen.

The Financial Conduct Authority's proposals on Thursday would create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states and come as exchanges vie to win the Aramco initial public offering, which is set to be the largest ever.  But they met with criticism from British fund managers, who have already expressed concerns about Aramco's governance.  Investors believe a premium listed segment without these investor protections is not a premium segment and will not provide the protections that investors expect,  Chris Cummings, chief executive at the Investment Association said.  Reuters reported earlier this year that the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) was working on a new type of structure that would make the bourse more attractive for Aramco.  No decision has been made on the venue yet,  a source close to Aramco told Reuters following Thursday's proposals, which come as the government and City of London are trying to keep Britain's financial markets attractive to international investors and companies after it leaves the European Union. The FCA is proposing a new  premium  stock market listing category that will exempt companies controlled by sovereign states from certain requirements and also be available to companies listed in London using depositary receipts, financial instruments used to represent a foreign company's shares.  Companies including Russian state firms Gazprom (GZPRI.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) use depositary receipts on the LSE.   Related CoverageUK fund trade body says listing rule changes could hurt investor protection Refining the listing regime in this way would make UK markets more accessible whilst ensuring that the protections afforded by our premium listing regime are focused and proportionate,  FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said. But Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Corporate Governance Manager at Royal London Asset Management said this may reverse progress made on governance and protecting minority shareholders.   It looks like the FCA is consulting on amending the existing listing rules to accommodate the peculiarities of one company, which is not a very effective strategy for regulating the market as a whole,  Hamilton Claxton said.  The London Stock Exchange has made winning the listing of Aramco a priority, with the firm's chief executive Xavier Rolet joining Prime Minister Theresa May on a trip to Saudi Arabia in April. The pair met jointly with the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which will play a major role in the listing decision.  FILE PHOTO: Oil tanks seen at the Saudi Aramco headquarters during a media tour at Damam city November 11, 2007.Ali Jarekji/File PhotoThe FCA's Bailey told Reuters he had not discussed the proposal with the government.   It was not instigated by the government or the LSE which we regulate,  he said. The New York Stock Exchange, which is also competing for the Aramco listing, has not offered any such regulatory changes, a source familiar with talks between NYSE and Aramco said.  However, it already has certain features that would attract Aramco, including not setting any minimum requirement for the proportion of a company's stock that has to be listed.  London usually requires a  free float  of at least a quarter of a company's shares, although under the proposals a sovereign-backed company could circumvent this if it issued depository receipts representing a small proportion of the overall firm.  Bridging the Gulf Under the plans, sovereign-controlled companies will be able to get a  premium  listing without complying with certain rules on related party transactions and controlling shareholders. The changes are likely to make London more attractive to state-controlled companies as several Gulf countries, including Oman and Abu Dhabi, are considering listing oil assets.  This is a clever solution to the dilemma of Aramco, which does not meet the general requirements regarding free-float and corporate governance,  Edward Bibko, head of capital markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa at law firm Baker McKenzie, said.  At present companies which do not meet Britain's  premium  listing requirements must take a standard listing which is seen as second best as it has lower corporate governance requirements and does not qualify for entry into most stock indices. The FCA said sovereign owners were different  in both their motivations and their nature  from private ones so it was legitimate to grant them an exemption from some of the requirements for private companies.    We believe that investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership,  it said in the consultation document.  The FCA has set a deadline of Oct 13 for comment on the proposals, which are part of a wider review it is undertaking into Britain's listing rules but were brought forward because it said it thought there was a gap in its current rules.

The pound has recovered from its losses after Britain's election in June as a number of BoE policymakers have spoken out in favour of reversing a rate cut delivered in the wake of the Brexit vote last year. Investors are split over the Bank's stance on rates, but say arguments for a hike are increasing given economic data has held steady in the face of inflation that is nearly 1 percent over the Bank's 2 percent target. While British workers saw their pay fall further behind inflation in the three months to May, wages rose marginally more than has been expected, data showed. Sterling was up 0.1 percent at $1.2954 by 0812 GMT. It was 0.1 percent lower at 88.13 pence per euro.  Unemployment is lower, wages have shown solid gains over the past three months and more workers are being added to the market, implying we are not yet at the end of this cycle,  said Jordan Rochester, currency strategist with Nomura, who has called for a BoE rate hike as soon as August.  Overall, though, so far the economy has held up well 'despite Brexit', and this is why a removal of 'emergency stimulus' should not be regarded as entirely implausible.  But political uncertainty was also on investors' minds in a week that saw the British government published legislation that would sever the UK's political, financial and legal ties to the EU. Ratings agency Moody's said this week that Britain's creditworthiness was under pressure following the Brexit vote, and the ongoing uncertainty over the outcome of two years of negotiations Britain will have with Brussels. The government also fleshed out its negotiating stance with the EU, publishing three position papers saying Britain would quit nuclear body Euratom and leave the jursidiction of the European Court of Justice.  On the whole, I think caution is certainly warranted -political uncertainty persists if anything,  said Credit Agricole's Valentin Marinov.  (The BoE) is a supportive factor for the pound but in the big scheme of things it's not a game changer ... We believe the better strategy is to sell the rally in any of the pound crosses.

The government left its overall forecast for gross domestic product growth unchanged in fiscal 2017, which started in April, due to an expected decline in inventories and slightly slower growth in fiscal spending. The government also expects consumer prices to rise 1.1 percent this fiscal year and 1.3 percent in fiscal 2018, highlighting a very slow build up in inflationary pressure. The forecasts, which Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet will use to compile next fiscal year's budget, show the economy is likely to continue expanding comfortably unless there is a sudden and large external shock. Consumer spending is forecast to rise 0.9 percent in fiscal 2017, according to forecasts that the government's top advisory panel approved after a meeting on Friday. That is more than the previous forecast for 0.8 percent growth released in January. Housing investment is expected to rise 0.8 percent this fiscal year, well above the previous estimate of 0.1 percent growth as the Bank of Japan's quantitative easing sparks a revival in property development. The government expects capital expenditure to rise 3.6 percent in fiscal 2017, more than its previous estimate for a 3.4 percent increase. Gross domestic product is expected to expand by 1.4 percent in fiscal 2018, but this does not take into account the size of fiscal spending because next fiscal year's budget has yet to be decided. In fiscal 2017 overall consumer prices are expected to rise 1.1 percent, unchanged from the government's previous forecast in January. In fiscal 2018 consumer prices are seen rising 1.3 percent, underlying the difficult in achieving the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target. The BOJ is set to slash its consumer inflation forecast for the year ending in March 2018 to around 1.0 percent at a policy meeting ending July 20 from its current 1.4 percent estimate made in April, sources tell Reuters. The central bank is also seen cutting next fiscal year's inflation forecast to 1.5 percent or below, from the current projection of 1.7 percent, they said. Depending on how big the cut in next year's forecast will be, the BOJ may push back the timing for hitting its target from the current estimate of  around fiscal 2018,  the sources said.

30 percent, with a 15-percent limit for a non-strategic investor. A foreign bank can own 10 percent and a non-bank investor that is not a strategic investor can own 5 percent.     The government allows a foreign strategic investor to own 20 percent in a Vietnamese bank.     In April 2015, the government said it would issue a decree soon to allow foreigners to own more than 30 percent of a Vietnamese bank.       No further decision has been made since.     The banking system includes 51 foreign bank branches, two joint venture banks, 16 financial firms and 11 financial leasing companies. There are also nearly 50 foreign bank representative offices.         Vietnam, with a population of nearly 93 million, had issued 101.94 million bank cards at the end of March 2016, up 2.4 percent from the end of 2015, SBV data showed.     Vietnam allowed nine mergers and acquisitions in 2015 as part of the country's banking sector reform that started in early 2012.

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.7462 percent, nearly 6 basis points lower that the previous day's closing average rate.     On Friday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 100 million yuan into money markets through seven-day reverse bond repurchase agreements. Traders said the injection helped to compensate for the 280 billion yuan of reverse repos maturing this week.     For the week, the PBOC drained a net 70 billion yuan compared with a net drain of 250 billion yuan a week earlier.      Money market liquidity is fine, but it's important to consider banks' tax payments and reserve requirement contributions next week,  said David Qu, market economist at ANZ in Shanghai. With these factors set to drain between 800 billion and 1 trillion yuan from the markets next week, the PBOC wants to inject money first, he said.     On Tuesday, the PBOC resumed open market operations after a 12-session hiatus during which it had cited  relatively high  or  appropriate  liquidity levels in the banking system.     Traders also pointed to an ongoing National Financial Work Conference as a factor contributing to that relatively loose liquidity. The five-yearly meeting, which ends Saturday, will cover topics including financial regulatory reforms and financial safety.      We think the PBOC would maintain a loose atmosphere before and during the meeting, until new policies are made. Then we expect tightening,  said a Shanghai-based trader.     The seven-day Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) fell to 2.8030 percent on Friday, down 1.5 basis points from the previous close, but up 1.7 basis points from last Friday's close.     The one-day or overnight rate stood at 2.6028 percent, down nearly 2 basis points from last Friday, and the 14-day repo stood at 3.4413 percent, up more than 4 basis points from last Friday's close.     The spread of the five-year credit default swap rate on Chinese sovereign debt fell 8.4 percent from last Friday's close, to 66.92.

The government left its overall forecast for gross domestic product growth unchanged in fiscal 2017, which started in April, due to an expected decline in inventories and slightly slower growth in fiscal spending. The government also expects consumer prices to rise 1.1 percent this fiscal year and 1.3 percent in fiscal 2018, highlighting a very slow build up in inflationary pressure. The forecasts, which Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet will use to compile next fiscal year's budget, show the economy is likely to continue expanding comfortably unless there is a sudden and large external shock. Consumer spending is forecast to rise 0.9 percent in fiscal 2017, according to forecasts that the government's top advisory panel approved after a meeting on Friday. That is more than the previous forecast for 0.8 percent growth released in January. Housing investment is expected to rise 0.8 percent this fiscal year, well above the previous estimate of 0.1 percent growth as the Bank of Japan's quantitative easing sparks a revival in property development. The government expects capital expenditure to rise 3.6 percent in fiscal 2017, more than its previous estimate for a 3.4 percent increase. Gross domestic product is expected to expand by 1.4 percent in fiscal 2018, but this does not take into account the size of fiscal spending because next fiscal year's budget has yet to be decided. In fiscal 2017 overall consumer prices are expected to rise 1.1 percent, unchanged from the government's previous forecast in January. In fiscal 2018 consumer prices are seen rising 1.3 percent, underlying the difficult in achieving the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target. The BOJ is set to slash its consumer inflation forecast for the year ending in March 2018 to around 1.0 percent at a policy meeting ending July 20 from its current 1.4 percent estimate made in April, sources tell Reuters. The central bank is also seen cutting next fiscal year's inflation forecast to 1.5 percent or below, from the current projection of 1.7 percent, they said. Depending on how big the cut in next year's forecast will be, the BOJ may push back the timing for hitting its target from the current estimate of  around fiscal 2018,  the sources said.

Lam was speaking in her first interview with the international media since she was sworn in as the city's new leader by Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1.  Hong Kong people are always very compassionate and so I share that compassion of many Hong Kong people by sending my condolence to the wife and the family of Mr. Liu,  said Lam. Liu Xiaobo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his efforts to promote democracy in China, died on Thursday at the age of 61 of multiple organ failure. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and enjoys wide-ranging freedoms not granted in mainland China and an independent judiciary under a so-called  one country, two systems  arrangement. But the abduction by mainland agents of Hong Kong booksellers, and Beijing's efforts to disqualify democratically elected, pro-independence lawmakers in the local legislature, have rattled confidence in that arrangement. In a wide-ranging interview, Lam acknowledged concerns about certain  individual incidents  in the city, and said it was her duty to accurately reflect them to the central government in Beijing.  I would say there are worries, there are anxieties, there is a strong perception over individual isolated incidents, but unless you've got evidence to prove there are clear breaches then it will remain at the level of anxieties and perception,  Lam said, without elaborating. Britain called the bookseller incident a  serious breach  of the Joint Declaration -- the 1984 treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong's 1997 return to China -- and said one of them, Lee Bo, had been removed from Hong Kong  under duress . Hong Kong's high court on Friday removed four opposition lawmakers from the city's legislative assembly for failing to sincerely take the oath of office in a significant blow to the opposition. Lam said she wouldn't intervene in the case. Xi's Harder Line Xi took what some saw as an explicitly harder line about Hong Kong's future during his visit marking the 20th anniversary of the financial hub's return from British to Chinese rule. Xi warned in a speech that any attempt to endanger Chinese sovereignty and security, challenge its power, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities would be acts that cross  the red line  and are  absolutely impermissible . Lam, however, pledged to stand up for Hong Kong's core values if they were undermined, and stand by the people of Hong Kong in protecting their rights. Hong Kong was also promised universal suffrage as an  ultimate aim  but Beijing has so far resisted granting a direct vote for a city leader with open nominations of candidates. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong's  one country, two systems arrangement  has come under considerable strain, as the city's opposition forces have agitated for full democracy and railed against creeping Chinese interference in various sectors including business, politics, media, law and education. The 60-year-old Lam, a devout Catholic, has said she hopes to lead Hong Kong  towards new glory  in the next five years and to heal unprecedented social divisions that have continued to fester since the massive 2014 pro-democracy Occupy protests that blocked major roads in Hong Kong for 79 days.

In his proposed class-action complaint, Michael Brave is seeking to recoup  significant  shareholder losses stemming from Arconic's failure prior to the June 14 blaze to properly disclose its use of  highly flammable  Reynobond PE panels. The shareholder lawsuit filed in the federal court in Manhattan, where Arconic is based, may be the first in the United States tied to the fire that gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower, in London's North Kensington section. Arconic's share price fell 21 percent between June 14 and June 27, the day after the company once known as Alcoa said it would stop selling the panels for use in high-rises. That decline reduced Arconic's market value by more than $2.5 billion, according to Reuters data. Arconic declined to comment on the lawsuit. Brave also named former Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld and current Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Giacobbe as defendants. Extensive damage is seen to the Grenfell Tower block which was destroyed in a disastrous fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017.Hannah McKayThe complaint seeks to allow Arconic shareholders from Feb. 28 to June 26 to sue as a group. Brave said shareholders were deceived by Arconic's inadequate disclosures regarding the cladding panels, and that their use significantly increased the risk of property damage, injury or death in buildings containing them. FILE PHOTO: Firefighters use a hydraulic lift to inspect the Grenfell Tower block that was destroyed by fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017.Hannah McKay/File PhotoHe said Arconic's public statements were  materially false and misleading at all relevant times,  and that Kleinfeld and Giacobbe should also be held liable for their contents. It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States over unexpected stock price declines that they believe could have been averted. Shares of Arconic closed Thursday up 26 cents at $24.45. They had closed at $21.84 on June 27.

The centrist Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan advocated late on Thursday a go-slow approach on further hikes which chimed with Fed chair Janet Yellen's comments that the central bank rate would not go  all that much further . These cautious comments have taken the sting out of a sell-off in the bloc's bond market that has been gathering steam over the past few weeks on rising expectations that the European Central Bank is set to wind down its asset purchase programme. A Reuters poll of economists released on Friday showed that the ECB is likely to wait until September before announcing a shift away from its ultra-easy policy, while a move at the July meeting next week is seen as too close to call.  They (Fed comments) add to our conviction that no further Fed hike should be expected for the rest of the year, which should prove reassuring for markets concerned about excessive tightening risk globally,  Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. Money markets pricing suggests less than a 50 percent chance of a hike over the next year, according to CME's FedWatch tool. The fall in euro zone yields tracked a move lower in U.S. equivalents which came after Kaplan - who is usually fairly centre-ground on monetary policy - made his comments late on Thursday. Doves and Hawks: A look at where U.S. Fed officials stand on interest rate hikes here The bloc's benchmark German 10-year yield fell some 3 basis points when European trading started on Friday to 0.50 percent, moving away from an 18-month high hit earlier this week of 0.583 percent. All other euro zone yields were down around 3 bps on the day. The final major event of the week for investors is U.S. inflation data due to be released later on Friday, although expectations remain muted. The core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month.

Bush and Bill Clinton told a forum in Dallas on Thursday that they were able to forge mutual bonds of respect and friendship because the other had been gracious in victory and respectful of presidential power. The two did not mention President Donald Trump once during a nearly hour-long discussion where they traded quips and insights. But they offered indirect references that many in the crowd of about 300 people at the George W. Bush Presidential Library took to be references to the current president.  He (Clinton) was humble in victory, which is very important in dealing with other people,  Bush said at the event to mark a graduation at the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a partnership among the Bush, Clinton, Lyndon Johnson and George H.W. Bush presidential centers. Clinton said:  If you want to be president, realize it’s about the people, not about you.   You want to be able to say 'things were better off when I quit, kid’s had a better future, things were coming together.' You don’t want to say, ‘God, look at all the people I beat.'  Current President Trump has come under criticism from Democrats who have said he fires off excessive and unwarranted criticism against his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama and the person he beat in the election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Republican Bush said while in office he sought Democrat Clinton's advice. Clinton said when he left office he told incoming President Bush that he would offer him help and treat him with respect.

The discount paid for the cargoes, to be delivered in the second-half August to the port of Mailiao, marked the lowest price paid by Formosa since December, as the market struggles with surplus supplies.

Before this, Formosa, like other end users in eastern Asia, bought naphtha on a formula that was fully priced off Platts assessments.

It is broadly a U.S. dollar-negative market as latest comments from Yellen and others suggest that interest rates will rise very gently and that is supportive for high-yielding currencies for now,  said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London. The Aussie and sterling were among the best performing currencies, especially against the Japanese yen. Against the yen, the Australian dollar rose 0.23 percent and sterling climbed 0.31 percent, with a relatively upbeat outlook from Fitch Ratings on China also supporting risk sentiment. Major market gauges of asset volatility, such as the Merrill Lynch Option volatility estimate and VIX, drifted lower on Friday, providing a boost to carry trades. The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen , has stalled towards the end of this week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback. That view was further reinforced by other U.S. policymakers such as Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kalpan on Thursday, though analysts were wary of kicking the dollar lower before U.S. inflation data. Signs of a pick-up in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar. However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month. The euro was little changed at $1.1407, unable to find much lift even as Germany's 10-year bond yield climbed back above the 0.50 percent threshold overnight. That followed a report that the European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase programme will be gradually wound down next year.

The move on indexes on Friday was more muted as investors hunkered down ahead of earnings reports from major US banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup later in the day. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.1 percent while euro zone bluechips were little changed. Firmer metals prices underpinned gains on mining stocks. Miners were led higher by steel firms ArcelorMittal , Outokumpu and Norsk Hydro which rose after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he was considering quotas and tariffs on Chinese steel dumping. While a rise in bond yields has hit rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities, banking stocks have instead benefited and the sector was roughly flat as Swedish lender SEB jumped 2.4 percent after its second-quarter profit topped forecasts. Swedish construction group Skanksa was the worst performer on the STOXX 600, down more than 4 percent after it warned that its second-quarter profit would be hit by project writedowns in the U.S. and Britain. European earnings get underway in earnest only later this month.

Royal Mail, the postal service privatised in 2013, said in April it would close its defined benefit pension scheme at the end of March 2018, after a review found it would need to more than double annual contributions to over 1 billion pounds to keep the plan running. It said it expected the overall cost of the new pension scheme proposal to be funded within its current 400 million pound ($518 million) annual pension contribution.  Royal Mail believes that the risk to the company of the proposed Defined Benefit cash balance scheme would be materially lower than under the current Plan and is a manageable risk for us,  it said. Royal Mail said it held extensive talks with its unions, Unite/CMA and the Communications Workers Union (CWU), on a sustainable and affordable solution for retirement benefits. The CWU has opposed Royal Mail's move to close the scheme and saying it would result in employees in the plan losing on average up to a third of their future pensions. Around 90,000 Royal Mail workers are in the scheme, whose closure to new members in 2008 resulted in about 40,000 workers joining a less generous defined contribution plan. Royal Mail one of only a few major companies to still have staff in a defined benefit scheme, a type of pension that pays out according to workers' final salary and length of service. British companies are facing increasing costs to fund pensions as people live longer and investment returns on bonds have fallen and are expected to remain low. $1 = 0.7716 pounds Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru, editing by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/royal-mail-pensions-idUSL4N1K52PF"},

The poll of 20 economist also found the Bank of Japan will keep its monetary policy settings unchanged when it meets on Wednesday and Thursday next week, reflecting the gradual uptick in growth.  Enjoying a tail wind from a weaker yen, exports are predicted to rise 9.5 percent year-on-year last month, the same poll showed, after a 14.9 percent jump in May - the fastest growth rate in more than two years, . Imports are forecast for a 14.6 percent rise from a year ago, up for a sixth straight month, boosted by higher oil prices and solid domestic demand. The poll tipped a resulting surplus at 484.7 billion yen ($4.27 billion), versus a trade deficit of 203.4 billion yen in May.  A weak yen boosted exports' value. They kept their solid trend but the momentum has slightly slowed compared with late last fiscal year,  said Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute. Saito said Japanese exports will benefit from rising demand in key foreign markets. The finance ministry will announce the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday.) The same poll found the BOJ will keep its short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target around zero percent at the July 19-20 review. Japan and much of the export-reliant Asian economies have benefited from an upturn in global demand since late 2017　giving policy makers hope that growth will continue to pick up over the next few quarters.  Sources have told Reuters the central bank is set to raise its economic growth forecasts but cut its rosy inflation outlook next week, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialing back its massive stimulus program. Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on solid exports and private consumption. But core consumer prices in May rose just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, some distance from the BOJ's 2 percent target.

Total assets in the quarter to the end of June were $58.7 billion, it said in a statement, with net inflows of $1.2 billion and a positive investment performance of $1.6 billion. The company said it had seen net inflows into its blended debt, corporate debt, equities and alternatives strategies, but a net outflow from local currency after one large institutional investor chose to redeem. Performance was positive across fixed income and equities, with a particularly strong performance in local currency and external debt, it said, although gains were flat in multi-asset, alternatives and in its liquidity and overlay strategies.  Emerging Markets asset prices have started to reflect the resilient fundamentals of the underlying economies and investor activity levels are responding,  Chief Executive Mark Coombs said in the statement.  Looking ahead, there is substantial absolute and relative value still available in Emerging Markets and investor allocations have much further to run from their significantly underweight levels.  Shares in Ashmore were flat in early deals, in line with the mid-cap index.  This marks the second consecutive quarter of positive net flows highlighting improving investor sentiments towards EM debt products,  Morgan Stanley analyst Anil Sharma said in a note.  Longer term, institutional portfolio allocations to EM debt remain at low levels and we would expect this to change, which presents a tailwind for Ashmore,  he added, flagging an 'equal-weight' rating on the stock and 385 pence price target.

Investors are increasingly ditching speculative trading, and putting money in firms that generate predictable incomes. Companies reaping the benefits of an uptick in global demand have found favour. China posted stronger-than-expected June trade figures on Thursday, bolstered by firm global demand for Chinese goods and robust appetite for construction materials at home. In a Reuters poll of 65 economists, China's economic growth was forecast to reach 6.6 percent this year, topping the government's target of around 6.5 percent. For the week, bank stocks far outperformed the broader market, advancing 5.1 percent, thanks to improved profitability in those lenders amid largely stable economic growth.

By Saad  Sayeed and Drazen Jorgic ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday for the first time explicitly dismissed a report from a corruption investigation that raised questions about the source of his family's wealth, rejecting it as slander. Sharif, 67, serving his third term as prime minister, faces opposition calls to step down but he was defiant in his condemnation of the report that alleges his family's income from business was not large enough to explain its wealth. A Joint Investigation Team (JIT), set up by the Supreme Court to investigate corruption allegations that surfaced following the Panama Papers leak, also accused his children, including heir apparent Maryam Sharif, of signing falsified documents about ownership of off-shore companies.  The JIT report about our family businesses is the sum of hypotheses, accusations and slander,  Sharif said in a statement after meeting his cabinet. The investigation team, which included officials from a military intelligence agency, presented its report to the Supreme Court on Monday. Copies of it were then leaked to the media, prompting a chorus of demands from political parties that he resign from office.  Nawaz's authority is completely eroded,  Shah Mehmood Qureshi, vice chairman of the opposition PTI party, told Reuters.   There is no legal, moral or political justification for him to continue.  Pakistan has for decades been plagued by pervasive graft, and by rivalry between the military and civilian politicians. FILE PHOTO: Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif gestures as she speaks to media after appearing before a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) who is investigating Sharif family's wealth in Islamabad, Pakistan July 5, 2017.Faisal Mahmood/File PhotoWorries Hit Stocks Sharif's term expires in June 2018 and elections are expected two months later. If he were forced to step down, his ruling PML-N party could appoint a new leader as prime minister until the polls. Nevertheless, worries generated by the 254-page report has sent stocks tumbling amid fears of chaos after several years of relative stability and accelerating economic growth. The economy expanded by 5.3 percent last fiscal year - its fastest in a decade. Big infrastructure investment by China has boosted growth while confidence has been buoyed by a decline in militant attacks. After years of electricity shortages and cuts, power outages have also been reduced but not eradicated.  Projects amounting to billions are being installed here but no wrongdoing has been proven,  Sharif said. Sharif said the economic progress made since his election in 2013 showed the government was on the right track and any disruption would only hurt progress.  We will not let darkness once again prevail in our towns and factories,  he said. Sharif, the son of an industrialist, will have his fate decided by the Supreme Court, which could disqualify him or order a trial. Sharif was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s.  But he later fell out with an army chief and was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile.  Our family has gained nothing from the politics, in fact it has lost a lot,  Sharif said.

Maryam Nawaz Sharif, 43, has in recent years gained greater influence within Sharif's inner circle, and is credited with steering him to embrace more pro-women and liberal causes in a deeply conservative nation of 200 million people. Her feisty social media persona and combative tweets in defense of her father have often pitted her against Sharif's rivals. Now those opponents sense an opportunity to scupper any plans to build a Sharif dynasty around her after a Supreme Court-appointed panel accused her of committing a criminal offense in a 254-page report leaked to the media this week.  It nips her career in the bud,  Sherry Rehman, vice president of the opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP), told Reuters.  It does kill any aspirations for the dynasty - through her at any rate.  The Joint Investigations Team (JIT) set up by the court alleges the Sharif family's wealth does not match their income, and accused Maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy posh London flats. Maryam, also known as Maryam Safdar,  rejected  the report and tweeted to her 3.5 million followers that  every contradiction will not only be contested but decimated  in the Supreme Court.  Her 67-year-old father, serving a third stint as prime minister, faces widespread calls to resign but his allies say the report is biased and inaccurate. Maryam did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Maryam and her brothers were named last year in the Panama Papers leak as owners of offshore companies used to buy luxury flats in London, prompting opposition politician Imran Khan to threaten mass protests unless the Supreme Court investigated. Khan, a former cricket star who leads Pakistan's third party, has been one of her harshest critics and recently called her a  princess , tapping into opposition anger that she appears to wield power within the government without holding any office. Related CoveragePakistan PM Sharif rejects graft report as 'slander'Liberal Influence Maryam's allies say the opposition targets her because she poses a threat: a telegenic young politician who will boost the Sharif  brand  and prolong the family's rule. Dynastic politics have a long tradition in Pakistan. Sharif's brother Shehbaz governs Punjab, the country's biggest province, and the opposition PPP is headed by Bilawal Bhutto, whose slain mother Benazir and grandfather Zulfikar, who was hanged, both served as prime ministers. Maryam rose to prominence in politics when she helped manage her father's re-election campaign in 2013, courting the youth vote that Khan was connecting with in ever-greater numbers. FILE PHOTO: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan addresses attendees during the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, September 30, 2015.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoThough she does not hold an official position within the government, members of the ruling PML-N party say she was instrumental in implementing a health program offering free medical care for the poor at government hospitals, a loan scheme for youths, and the upgrading of primary schools in Islamabad.  She has a policy mind,  said Musadik Malik, Maryam's friend and spokesman for Sharif.  Wherever she finds the policy space (on women, youth, minority issues), she pushes the envelope.  One senior government source said Maryam influenced Sharif to push ahead with a bill to tackle 'honor killings' - the killing by relatives of women thought to have brought shame on their families - that was opposed by many elements of his conservative voter base.  The bill was delayed for years and to muster wider support for its passage Maryam helped organize a screening at Prime Minister's House of a grim Oscar-winning documentary,  Girl in the River , about an attempted honor killing in Pakistan. Sharif later said  there is no honor in honor killings , to raised eyebrows in conservative circles.

No Benazir Bhutto  Ismail added Maryam has Sharif's ear by virtue of being his daughter, but has not been involved in government policy in economics or other areas outside her interests.  In next five years she will hopefully play an increasing role in policy,  he added.  If the Supreme Court disqualifies Sharif over the latest allegations, his 65-year-old brother is seen as one of the favorites to take over. But long-term Maryam is tipped as a future leader, with party insiders hoping she could emulate the late Benazir Bhutto and become a force within Pakistani politics for decades. Maryam's critics bristle at such comparisons.  (Benazir) earned her stripes the hard, painful way through jails and exiles and torture. Not in the lap of looted luxury,  said the PPP's Rehman. The Sharifs are disputing the allegations in the JIT report, but Maryam may face an investigation by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).  The senior government source said NAB investigations tend to last many years - Sharif has an active case against him dating back to 1999 - and NAB's conviction rates were notoriously low.   This is not the end for Maryam,  he said.  Not even close.

Hyperloop One, the Los-Angeles-based company developing the technology, is gearing up to send a 28-foot-long (8.5 meter-long) pod gliding across a set of tracks in a test run in Nevada in the next few weeks, spokeswoman Marcy Simon said.  Hyperloop One is working to develop a technical vision proposed by Musk, the founder of rocket maker SpaceX and electric car company Tesla Motors. In 2013, he suggested sending pods with passengers through giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Hyperloop aims to achieve speeds of 250 miles per hour (402 km per hour) in its upcoming phase of testing.

A Hyperloop One sled on wheels for the first time coasted above a track using electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation, Simon said.  It levitated for 5.3 seconds in a vacuum-sealed tube and reached speeds of 70 mph (113 kph), the company said in a statement. By comparison, another test by Hyperloop One that made national headlines last year was done on an open-air track, not in the tube, a key to achieving high speeds.

Support for Abe has plummeted to its lowest since he surged back to power in 2012 with a conservative agenda of restoring traditional values and loosening constraints on the military that centers on revising the U.S.-drafted post-war constitution. Abe also promised to reboot the economy with his  Abenomics  recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, spending and reforms. But his popularity has been battered by suspicions of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business. Many voters also feel that he and aides have grown arrogant given the ruling bloc's huge parliamentary majorities, weak opposition and lack of strong rivals in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).  I want him to remember our original intentions,  said Komeito party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi, recalling how the coalition struggled to regain trust after losing power for three years from 2009.   What is vital is to make sincere efforts to respond steadily to the people's expectations,  he told Reuters in an interview. Abe has promised to focus on the economy, but is also sticking to his target of revising the post-war, U.S.-drafted constitution by 2020 to legitimize the military, known as the Self-Defense Forces (SDF).  Amending pacifist Article 9 is a divisive issue in Japan and would raise concerns in China and South Korea, where memories of Japan's past military aggression run deep. Cautious on Constitution Abe's proposal would retain the two clauses of Article 9 that renounce the right to wage war and ban maintenance of air, land and sea forces, while adding a clause legitimizing the SDF.  People are not calling for a change in the constitution as something that hinders their livelihoods,  Yamaguchi said, adding more debate in parliament was needed. Voters' priorities are the economy and the social welfare system, he said. Amendments need the approval of two-thirds of both chambers and a majority in a referendum. The Komeito party has traditionally been cautious about revising Article 9 and Yamaguchi said there was not yet a consensus. Although allied with the LDP in parliament, the Komeito joined with popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's newly formed Tokyo Citizens First party to win big in a July 2 Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election, handing the LDP a historic defeat. Speculation abounds that Tokyo Citizens First will go national and provide a platform for Koike to become Japan's first female prime minister, but Yamaguchi said the Komeito did not have a similar national level tie-up in mind. Asked his advice for Abe, Yamaguchi said it was vital to remember that voter support for the ruling camp was less firm than it appeared, despite past election wins.  The number of seats won can exceed true support levels. We should not be spoiled by this. The opposition Democratic Party is weak and as the flip side, we have support. But we shouldn't depend on that,  he said.   We got spoiled, but we shouldn't be.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu also opens the door for more refugees and deals Trump a fresh courtroom defeat in a long back-and-forth over an executive order that has gone all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state of Hawaii had asked Watson to narrowly interpret a Supreme Court ruling that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The Supreme Court last month said the ban could take effect, but that anyone from the six countries with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The Trump administration then interpreted that opinion to allow spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings into the country, but barred grandparents and other family members, in a measure Trump called necessary to prevent attacks.  Watson harshly criticized the government's definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense  in a  ruling that changes the way the ban can now be implemented.  Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents. Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members,  he wrote. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Trump's order is a pretext for illegal discrimination, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement.  Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough,  Chin said. Chin had asked Watson for an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. Hawaii and refugee groups also had argued that resettlement agencies have a  bona fide  relationship with the refugees they help, sometimes over the course of years. The Justice Department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law. Watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the U.S. because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.   'Bona fide' does not get any more 'bona fide' than that,  Watson said.  Melanie Nezer, vice president of global refugee advocacy group HIAS, said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of  50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.   We are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members,  said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. More than 24,000 additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the U.S. under Watson's order, she estimated.  Watson did not grant everything the state of Hawaii sought, however. He rejected a request to categorically exempt all Iraqis refugee applicants who believe they are at risk due to their work for the U.S. government since March, 2003, as interpreters and translators, for instance. Watson also refused a blanket exemption for those eligible to apply to a refugee program aimed at protecting certain children at risk in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of his order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

Countries that fail to comply with the new protocols or take steps to do so within 50 days could face travel sanctions.  The cable, sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday,  is a summary of a worldwide review of vetting procedures that was required under U.S. President Donald Trump’s revised March 6 executive order that temporarily banned U.S. travel by most citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries. The memo lays out a series of standards the United States will require of other countries, including that they issue, or have active plans to issue, electronic passports and regularly report lost and stolen passports to INTERPOL.  It also directs nations to provide  any other identity information  requested by Washington for U.S. visa applicants, including biometric or biographic details. The cable sets out requirements for countries to provide data on individuals it knows or has grounds to believe are terrorists as well as criminal record information.  Further, countries are asked not to block the transfer of information about U.S.-bound travelers to the U.S. government and not to designate people for travel watchlists based solely on their political or religious beliefs.  This is the first time that the U.S. Government is setting standards for the information that is required from all countries specifically in support of immigration and traveler vetting,  the cable said.  The cable can be read here: (reut.rs/2untHTl). The new requirements are the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration says it is taking to better protect the United States from terrorist attack.     However, former officials said much of the information sought is routinely shared between countries, including examples of passports and additional details about particular travelers that may present security concerns.  Some U.S. allies may worry about privacy protections if Washington is seen as seeking information beyond what is already shared, said John Sandweg, a former senior Homeland Security Department official now with the firm Frontier Solutions. Staff demonstrate the flow of passengers as they queue to X-ray shoes, mobile phone and bags at the security gates at Cointrin airport in Geneva, Switzerland, November 24, 2016.Denis Balibouse I don’t think you can ignore the political aspects of the unpopularity of the current administration. That puts political pressure to stand up to the administration,  he said. The cable lays out risk factors the U.S. government will consider when evaluating a country. Some of these are controversial and could be difficult for countries to prove to U.S. satisfaction, including ensuring  that they are not and do not have the potential to become a terrorist safe haven.  Countries are also expected to agree to take back citizens ordered removed from the United States. If they do not provide the information requested, or come up with an adequate plan to, countries could end up on a list to be submitted to Trump for possible sanction, including barring  categories  of their citizens from entering the United States. The real worries for countries may not come until the results of this review are known, said Leon Rodriguez, the former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  Once they start making decisions I think that is where there is going to be a lot of anxiety,  he said, saying delays in visa processing for nations that do not pose much of a threat could start to hurt  ordinary business and personal travel.  The most controversial of Trump's immigration-related moves are two executive orders, challenged in federal court, which impose a temporary ban on travel to the United States for most citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  While the orders were initially blocked from being enforced, the Supreme Court on June 26 allowed the ban to go into effect for people from the six nations with no strong ties to the United States.  The cable requires countries to act quickly, but stressed that the United States would work with foreign nations to assess if they meet the standards and, if not, to come up with a plan to help them do so. The cable asks that U.S. diplomats  underscore that while it is not our goal to impose a ban on immigration benefits, including visas, for citizens of any country, these standards are designed to mitigate risk, and failure to make progress could lead to security measures by the USG, including a presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain categories of foreign nationals of non-compliant countries.  The cable says the U.S. government has made a preliminary determination that some countries do not meet the new standards and that others are  at risk  of not meeting them. It does not name these, listing them in a separate, classified cable. The State Department declined comment on the cable, saying it would not discuss internal communications.  The U.S. government’s national security screening and vetting procedures for visitors are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States,  said a U.S. State Department official on condition of anonymity.

Turkey, which had believed the age of military coups was behind it, once again witnessed tanks on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. Before the night was through, nearly 300 were killed, more than a thousand were injured, Turkey’s parliament was bombed.  Yet when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan emerged triumphant the next day declaring the failed coup “a gift from God,” it was clear to everybody that he would use the crisis to expand the witch hunt of political enemies already underway. Had the coup succeeded, Turkey would have almost certainly fallen into civil war between Erdoğan loyalists and the new military regime; instead, it is now stumbling toward something approaching dictatorship.   Precisely because the Turkish government has been so intent on utilizing the July 15, 2016 coup attempt as a means of consolidating control and punishing political enemies, we know little about how the coup was planned. Turkey’s government was quick to lay blame on the followers of Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, onetime allies whom the government has seen as its primary enemy ever since Gülenists in the security services attempted to engineer Erdoğan’s demise by leaking a series of embarrassing tapes in December, 2013. Gülenists certainly played a large role in the coup, though the evidence is strong that it was implemented by a broader coalition of officers.  The tapestry of stories that the government has spun after the coup and the lack of independent investigation mean that we will likely never know the whole truth of what transpired or why. The array of participants, however, was broad enough, and the coup itself undertaken with so little recognition of the realities of contemporary Turkey, that the whole effort felt desperate and last ditch. In a sense, the coup itself is evidence of just how broken Turkish democracy and Turkish institutions had become.   For years, Erdoğan had engaged in a slow-moving revolution to transform Turkish society and cement his ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) hold on power. In the wake of the coup, however, this revolution has entered a ruthless new phase, a reign of terror which finds new enemies to root out nearly every day. Turkey has detained more than a hundred thousand and arrested over 50,000 on suspicion of coup involvement. There are numerous, though unconfirmed reports of alleged Gülenists being “disappeared.” Reports of torture, largely eradicated by the end of the 2000s, are once again widespread. Prisons are grossly overcrowded and abuse of prisoners rampant. The Turkish government has spent little time determining whether followers of Gülen are actually guilty of any crime; mere affiliation was sufficient.  Almost immediately, any critic of the government became suspect. Prosecutors have targeted academics, human rights activists, and individuals who had the bad luck to open a savings account at a bank affiliated with the Gülen movement. From abroad, the purge may seem absurd: those investigated include Senator Chuck Schumer and former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara. But for those in Turkey the sheer absurdity of the accusations heightens the atmosphere of fear. Even Ahmet Şık, a journalist who was once jailed for writing a book critical of Fethullah Gülen, is now in pre-trial detention, accused of supporting “terror.” Turkish citizens returning from abroad routinely clear their social media and dispose of dollar bills before entering the country because the government claims that Fethullah Gülen dispensed dollar bills to his followers in the prelude to the coup attempt.  The coup has radically accelerated the consolidation of the government’s control over almost every element of society. State institutions, particularly the security services and the judiciary, have seen the dismissal of over 100,000 civil servants. The purge is not limited to state organizations. In addition to the approximately 150 journalists who have been jailed, more than 100 media outlets have been closed. Hundreds of civil society organizations have also been shut down. Meanwhile over 1,000 businesses owned by accused Gülenists, (now termed the Fethullahist Terror Organization or FETÖ) have been confiscated. Whatever the costs the purge might have for Turkey’s long-term economic prospects, the coup has served as a boon for AKP supporters. Pro-AKP media regularly touts new job openings for teachers or police. Meanwhile, billions of dollars of private capital has been transferred to government hands, which, in turn, enrich business leaders allied with the AKP.   In April, Erdoğan won a referendum which grants him the presidential system he long desired and legalizes many of the powers he has already claimed for himself. Yet, even with the full power of the state supporting the “yes” vote in the referendum and with strong evidence of vote rigging, the referendum won only a bare majority. Even as Turkey’s political opposition shows new signs of vigor, the likelihood that elections will ever again be fairly contested is increasingly remote.   Erdoğan’s reputation as a “man of the people” and as a democrat are foundational not only to his legitimacy, but also, it would seem, to his own self-perception. The coup, for his supporters and for himself, represents the ultimate validation of that image. The downward trajectory of Turkey in this past year points in another direction, however. As much as he fancies himself a democrat, Erdoğan’s rule is increasingly reliant on repression. Had the coup succeeded, Turkey might well have become another Syria. Instead, it appears to be becoming another Egypt.

The spot rupee was trading at 153.70/75 per dollar 0618 GMT, slightly weaker from Thursday's close of 153.65/70.  There is some off-market importer demand. We do not see much importer demand because it is an off season. The rupee would have slightly appreciated if not for the central bank's dollar buying,  said a currency dealer, asking not to be named. Central bank officials were not immediately available for comments. But on Wednesday, Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told Reuters that the central bank has completely stopped defending the rupee unlike in the past. Weerasinghe in an interview with Reuters said the central bank has only been buying dollars since February, and not sold any at all. He said the central bank does not see any pressure on the rupee and the currency is determined through market-driven demand and supply. Weerasinghe added if the monetary authority does not intervene and buy, probably the rupee will appreciate and the central bank is  buying and preventing certain appreciation . The market has priced in further depreciation due to the central bank's no-intervention policy, dealers said. The rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped providing support for the currency at a time when the island nation faces a balance of payments crunch. It has fallen around 2.6 percent so far this year. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50. Dealers said they expected seasonal demand for dollars to pick up from August. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet the reserve target set by the International Monetary Fund under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme.

The 800,000-Serbian dinar ($7,600) grant under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's cross-border stimulus program, for  poorer, ethnic Hungarian regions in central Europe, enabled Kracsun to buy expensive welding machinery which would otherwise have been beyond his means. More than one million ethnic Hungarians live in neighboring Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere, descendants of Hungarians who found themselves outside their homeland when the country's borders were redrawn at the end of World War One. With a parliamentary election in April 2018 drawing closer, 54-year-old Orban is expanding his political arsenal to include ethnic Hungarians like Kracsun through grants and heavily-subsidized loans to small businesses.  As a first step, Orban gave these ethnic Hungarians citizenship after a 2010 landslide, followed by voting rights. That helped Orban eke out a two-thirds parliamentary majority at the last election in 2014 as such voters overwhelmingly backed him.  Our workload has doubled,  thanks to the new machinery purchased after receiving the grant, Kracsun said in the shade of his rudimentary workshop.   We have not had such an opportunity in this country or this region so far,  Kracsun said, adding that he intended to support Orban's ruling right-wing Fidesz party next April because of the measures he was taking to support voters outside Hungary.  They take care of us. It is a good feeling. We have always felt Hungarian, regardless of the border.  That sentiment was widespread in Vojvodina, a northern region in Serbia and home to about a 200,000-strong Hungarian community. Most of the ethnic Hungarians Reuters interviewed for this story and who were grant recipients plan to vote for Orban  next year. Template for Romania Latest opinion polls show Orban's Fidesz party is a clear favorite to retain power in 2018. Political analysts said  ethnic Hungarian voters could help Orban regain the two-thirds majority he has since lost.  It is in the government's interest to have these sympathetic voters turn up at the election in the largest possible numbers,  said Attila Tibor Nagy, an analyst at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis think-tank. A two-thirds parliamentary majority enabled Orban to rewrite the constitution and pass major laws without support from other parties. The government in Budapest estimates ethnic Hungarian votes could sway two out of 199 seats in parliament. Of an 8.25 million-strong electorate, nearly 290,000 ethnic Hungarians are registered to vote, their ranks having increased since the last election. Orban's three-year, 50-billion-forint ($185 million) stimulus plan in Vojvodina could also be a template for a bigger program in fellow European Union member Romania, home to the region's largest ethnic Hungarian community. Once a grant has been successfully applied for, it is disbursed through a local foundation linked to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, which says the main goals of the scheme are to support local families and small businesses and to help ethnic Hungarians stay where they are.  People Decide  Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians have moved to western Europe in search of higher-paid jobs over the past years and the latest census figures showed a fall in the number of ethnic Hungarians living in Serbia as well. Welders are seen working on an iron structure at a workshop in Cantavir, Serbia, July 6, 2017, a grant received from the Hungarian government enabled the company to buy new machinery, boosting the amount of work he can take on.Bernadett Szabo This program is obviously part of the broader strategic concept launched seven years ago and I think this will continue,  Deputy Secretary of State Peter Kiss-Parciu said.  I am sure this will motivate people to take a more active role in the matters of the Hungarian community,  Kiss-Parciu said, when asked whether the funds could be a boon for Orban at the election, adding:  As to how people vote, that is for them to decide.  Sitting on Hungary's southern border, Vojvodina is among Serbia's more developed regions, but even so, living standards languish below those in a neighboring poor region of Hungary. Vojvodina, through which the Danube river flows, is the breadbasket of Serbia providing much of its grain and makes up about one quarter of its territory. The capital Novi Sad was heavily bombed in 1999 when NATO intervened to halt killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb forces.   Daniel Ferencz, a beekeeper in the town of Backo Petrovo Selo, surrounded by lush forests and dazzling sunflower fields, received a grant of about 860,000 Serbian dinars, which he used to buy swarms of bees, 50 hives and a honey-bottling machine. Slideshow (13 Images)Ferencz, 34, said the financial support convinced him he could make a living at home instead of moving elsewhere.  It is an uplifting feeling,  he said near a colorful row of hives.  It is good to be a Hungarian here because no one else has ever provided similar support.  For others, like Nikoletta Futo, 22, and her husband, who have a three-year-old daughter and triplet sons turning two in November, the 1.2-million-dinar grant also made the difference between staying and leaving the area. Using the grant and some savings, they were able to buy a bigger house on the outskirts of Kanjiza, just across the Hungarian border in Serbia.  We used to live in a smaller house with two rooms, but the six of us had to share a single room there,  said Futo, with her daughter, Nora, sitting on her lap. Low Interest Rates In the next phase of the program, Hungarian OTP Bank's tiny Serbian unit will provide loans to Hungarian small businesses for projects worth over half a million euros each in agriculture and industry. Nearly three dozen such projects are being assessed, Kiss-Parciu said, adding government subsidies will allow companies to borrow at 1-2 percent interest, far below the Serbian base rate, which at 4 percent is the highest in the region. Deputy Chief Executive Laszlo Wolf told Reuters that OTP was looking to boost its low market share in Serbia and Romania, possibly through acquisitions. OTP declined further comment on its Serbian expansion plans. Officials in Belgrade were not available to comment about the grants and loans for this story but have not criticized Orban's stimulus plan. Then Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is now president, said at a joint government meeting in November  relations between Serbia and Hungary have never been better. But not everyone is so happy. Hungary's Socialists, trailing far behind in the polls, say Orban is using Hungarians across the border as political tools, also criticizing his stimulus program for what they see as a lack of transparency. And, early last month, Serbian tabloid Kurir, a Vucic critic, ran a headline reading:  Orban takes over Vojvodina.

U.S. consumer prices in June are forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent from a year earlier.     The dollar index was down 0.01 percent at 95.720 at 0548 GMT.     Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in her address to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, further reiterated her dovish stance on tightening, citing falling inflation as an influential factor.      We have a risk off situation in the perception of a dovish Fed. This means that the EM carry trade will go on and risk assets should not be too hard hit,  said Saktiandi Supaat, head of FX research at Maybank in Singapore.     Most Asian currencies were subdued with the exception of the Thai baht, which rose 0.2 percent, and the Philippine peso, down 0.3 percent in intraday trade.     The Indian rupee was up marginally ahead of wholesale price inflation and forex reserves data due later on Friday.     Wholesale price inflation is expected to have slowed last month to 1.60 percent from 2.17 percent in May, a Reuters poll showed.     The Singapore dollar trimmed losses from earlier in the day.      The city-state's economy expanded a seasonally adjusted and annualised 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the first, narrowly dodging a recession helped by solid global demand for its tech products.     In the coming week, investors will be focused on the start of the U.S. earnings season. Markets expect S&P; 500 companies to report second-quarter earnings growth of 7.8 percent.          PHILIPPINE PESO     The Philippine peso was down 0.2 percent, on-track to post its fifth straight weekly loss.       Philippine Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said on Friday he is not worried about the weakening peso because the country has enough buffers and a steady source of foreign exchange inflows.     A Reuters poll showed that bearish positions in the Philippine peso increased to their largest since late March after the currency fell to 11-year lows earlier in the week, partly due to a widening trade balance.           THAI BAHT     Bucking the trend, the Thai baht was up 0.2 percent,  heavy on expectations that U.S. rate hikes will be gradual and will not significantly slow inflows into Thai assets,  said May Bank's Saktiandi.     Risk-on sentiments today could see greater inflows and support the baht intraday, he added.

The Nikkei index finished up 0.1 percent at 20,118.86 and a robust 1 percent higher for the week, though investors grew cautious ahead of a long holiday weekend. Weighing on the Nikkei, market giant Fast Retailing Co , the owner of clothing chain Uniqlo, saw its shares skid 4.6 percent after it reported a quarterly operating profit of 49.9 billion yen ($440.07 million) for the three months through May late Thursday. That fell short of a 52.85 billion yen Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate based on estimates of six analysts. The broader Topix added 0.4 percent to 1,625.48, for a 1.1 percent rise for the week. The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 also added 0.4 percent, to 14,472.36, marking a 1.1 percent weekly gain.  Fast Retailing's performance pushed the Nikkei down and limited its gains, but overall market sentiment was stable,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Major U.S. indexes marked modest gains overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up to a record close, as investors warily awaited earnings and U.S. inflation data. The U.S. quarterly earnings season revs up on Friday with big U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all reporting results. The U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent increase the previous month.  The U.S. CPI figures will come out later, so the market is waiting for this,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  Ahead of a three-day weekend in Japan, investors have no incentive to extend their positions,  he said. Markets in Japan will be closed for a holiday on Monday and will resume trading on Tuesday. Shares of industrial materials maker JSR Corp rose 2.9 percent. The company's operating profit is estimated to have surged to 10 billion yen in the April-June quarter from 5.6 billion yen a year earlier, business daily Nikkei reported. Shares of Japanese recruitment company Persol Holdings Co added 0.3 percent. It made a A$778 million ($600 million) takeover bid for Australian recruiter Programmed Maintenance Services Ltd PRG.AX, the target company said on Friday.

The benchmark BSE index also retreated, falling below the 32,000 mark it breached for the first time on Thursday. But both indexes were up around 2 percent each for the week, their biggest weekly gains since mid-March. Top Indian software services exporter TCS fell as much as 2.9 percent after the company on Thursday reported a 6 percent fall in consolidated quarterly net profit, missing estimates as a stronger rupee hit revenue. Investors booked profits in financial stocks such as ICICI Bank Ltd, down as much as 1.1 percent after two straight sessions of gains. Yes Bank Ltd slid as much as 1.4 percent after gaining for five consecutive sessions.  At higher levels, you will find some kind of profit-booking. Broadly, the undertone is positive,  said Siddharth Sedani, head and vice president, equity advisory at Anand Rathi. The broader NSE index was down 0.24 percent at 9,867.90 as of 0624 GMT, after earlier hitting an all-time high of 9,913.3. The benchmark BSE index was 0.17 percent lower at 31,981.91 after earlier touching a record high of 32,109.75. Infosys Ltd rose as much as 3 percent after the IT firm reported quarterly profit above expectations.

Ltd.'s (BBB-/Stable) USD450 million 3.875% senior notes due 2022 a final rating of 'BBB-'. The notes are rated at the same level as Longfor's senior unsecured rating as they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 5 July 2017. China-based Longfor's ratings are supported by its established homebuilding operations, which have been generating healthy cash flow that the company has used to expand its investment property (IP) business. The IP business is likely to generate around CNY2.5 billion-3.0 billion in rental revenue a year in 2017-2018 (2016: CNY1.9 billion). KEY RATING DRIVERS Established, Diversified Homebuilder: Longfor has built a defensive business covering over 20 Tier 1 and 2 cities in China. In 2016, around 31% of its 41.5 million square metres (sq m) of land bank was in western China, where Longfor is a leading player, with a strong brand name in key cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu. Longfor's expansion outside western China has reduced contracted sales from the region to 22% of total sales in 2016 from 41% in 2013. Early Mover in Land Replenishment: Longfor added land in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Suzhou in 2015, before prices ran up in 2016. This head start in land replenishment is likely to support contracted sales growth for the next two years and improve its profitability. These cities, which accounted for 49% of the gross floor area (GFA) Longfor acquired in 2015, made up over 45% of its 2016 contracted sales and over 25% of its GFA sold. In addition, Longfor replenished land in Beijing and Hangzhou in 1H16, but not in Shanghai, Nanjing or Suzhou, as land prices in these cities had risen rapidly. Longfor is focused on acquiring land in cities with lagging growth, such as Jinan and Qingdao, which accounted for around 25.4% of Longfor's total GFA acquired in 2016. Quality IP Portfolio: Fitch expects Longfor to continue to expand its IP portfolio in 2017-2019. Longfor's urban retail malls in prime locations in Chongqing, Chengdu, Beijing and Hangzhou made up over 80% of its IP portfolio, with the rest made up of community malls that are part of its large residential projects. Fitch estimates the GFA of Longfor's retail malls increased by CAGR of 34.7% to 1.9 million sq m over 2011-2016, and we expect this to increase to 2.5 million-2.7 million sq m by 2017-2018. Its IP revenue increased to CNY1.9 billion in 2016 from only CNY0.4 billion in 2011. Longfor has maintained a high occupancy rate of over 95% for the past four years in spite of the expansion, and we forecast the occupancy rate at 93% over 2017-2019. Positive Operating Cash Flow: Fitch expects Longfor to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations (CFO) in 2017 and 2018, extending a trend that started in 2012. The continued positive CFO will support the gradual expansion of its homebuilding and IP businesses. Longfor typically adds two to three new malls a year for its IP business, which was the key contributor of its negative free cash flow. Fitch estimates that Longfor maintained neutral operating cash flow for its homebuilding business segment between 2012 and 2016, even though it more than doubled its contracted sales. Healthy Financials: We expect Longfor's business profile to continue strengthening. Contracted sales in 1H17 was CNY93 billion, which is significantly above Fitch's forecast, and compared with CNY88 billion in 2016 and CNY54 billion in 2015. Fitch forecasts Longfor's recurring rental revenue to rise by 20% to around CNY2.3 billion in 2017. Fitch expects Longfor's leverage, as measured by net debt to adjusted inventory (including IP valued at higher of cost or 5% yield), of 31% in 2016 to be little changed for the next 12-18 months, while its total contracted sales to total debt should improve from 1.5x in 2016. Access to Low-Cost Funding: Longfor has access to diversified funding sources and strong access to both domestic and offshore bond markets and banks. Its average cost of borrowing fell to 4.9% in 2016 from 6.7% in 2012 after the company refinanced its offshore debt, which also extended the offshore debt's average maturity. Fitch expects Longfor's interest costs to remain low, with management's focus on maintaining ample liquidity and ready access to various funding channels helping to support its ratings. Constrained by IP Expansion: Longfor's rental revenue of CNY1.9 billion for 2016 was still insufficient to cover its cash investments in this segment of CNY3 billion-5 billion. This was, however, an improvement from 2014, when its rental income was CNY876 million and its cash investment in IP was CNY3.8 billion. The scale of its IP business is still small and accounted for less than 15% of its total EBITDA, leaving the company reliant on its homebuilding operation to support its IP expansion and resulting in persistent negative free cash flow for this segment. DERIVATION SUMMARY Longfor has had stable and healthy positive CFO since 2012. The continued positive CFO will support the gradual expansion of its homebuilding and IP businesses. It is well-positioned among its peers. Its 2016 contracted sales of CNY88 billion is comparable with peers rated 'BBB-' to 'BB+', and its EBITDA margin of 22% in 2015-2016 is comparable with 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers, such as China Resources Land Ltd (BBB+/Stable) and China Vanke Co., Ltd. (BBB+/Stable). Longfor's leverage of around 30%-32% is comparable with that of Shimao Property Holdings Limited (BBB-/Stable). No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect Longfor's rating. Operating environment risks make it difficult for companies in this sector to be rated above 'BBB+'. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: -Investment property income reaches CNY2.5 billion-3.0 billion in 2017-2018 -Contracted sales by GFA to decrease by 0%-6% over 2017-2019 -Average selling price for contracted sales to increase by 2% for 2017-2019 -EBITDA margin of around 22%-23% in 2017-2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) sustained above 40% - Contracted sales/total debt sustained below 1.0x - EBITDA margin sustained below 22% - Sustained weakening of cash flow from operations Developments that may individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: -Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) sustained below 30% -The company's investment property operation stabilises at a larger scale and generates substantially higher recurring income. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Longfor had CNY17 billion of cash, of which CNY0.1 billion was restricted, at end-2016. The company has made opportunistic early repayment for most of its US dollar debt financing in the past. Fitch expects the group to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations during 2016-2018 due to its diversified funding channels and flexible land acquisition strategy.

Shares of midcap poultry specialist Venky's, part of a group that also owns British football club Blackburn Rovers, have risen around 440 percent this year fuelled in part by a campaign against beef consumption. Although the Supreme Court on July 11 suspended a recent government ban on cattle slaughter, the country's rising middle class will remain hungry for the birds.  Graphic: Venky’s has significantly outperformed all the major indices: reut.rs/2tORCJI Cows are sacred in Hinduism. New Delhi's ban played to the hardline supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his nationalist government but implementing it would be an economic drag. India's leather industry is a supplier to international brands and hires millions of people. Last year the country exported almost $4 billion of buffalo meat, but  cow protectors  argue beef from cows slips into this market. Banned or not, an increase in violence around this emotive issue has led to a number of high profile lynchings of people suspected of consuming and slaughtering cows. And so Indians with reasonable disposable incomes may look elsewhere for protein. In office canteens, chicken is the default non-vegetarian option. Pork is not eaten by practicing Muslims, the largest religious minority. Mutton and fish are more expensive.  India’s consumption of processed chicken meat is rising by as much as 20 percent a year, the USDA says. And appetite has room to grow. The average Indian consumed a mere 1.7 kilograms of poultry in 2015, according to the OECD. That compares with around 6.6 kilograms for Indonesia and 11.6 kilograms for China, where incomes are much higher.  Venky's is one of the only pure plays on this trend, although there are other factors underpinning the company's recent outperformance. For example, almost 80 percent of poultry production costs come from feed ingredients like maize and soya, prices for which have fallen after last year's good monsoon.  Despite a huge run-up in Venky’s price, the company still trades at a multiple of around 26 times current net income, compared to 24 times for the Nifty Midcap Index. Analysts at Kotak forecast a 42 percent compound annual rate of growth in earnings through to 2019. With or without cow protectors, India will be in a flap about chicken.

Licensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Tremfya, or guselkumab, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Guselkumab would be the first antibody developed by Morphosys to make it to the market and bring in royalties for the group. Morphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer. The company will receive a milestone payment in connection with the approval of guselkumab, it said late on Thursday, without being more specific. Berenberg analysts said in April that while royalties expected from guselkumab were moderate, they believed the drug could deliver peak sales of 3.2 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in 2030, making it worth 23 euros per share in their valuation. Shares in Morphosys were up 11 percent in pre-market trade on Friday according to brokerage Lang & Schwarz after closing at 62.44 euros on Thursday. $1 = 0.8769 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/morphosys-psoriasis-idUSL8N1K50P8"},

The deal is set to be Asia's largest buyout by a private equity group.  After an extensive evaluation of all final proposals received, the Special Committee decided on the proposed Scheme, which we believe is compelling and value-enhancing for all shareholders,  Seek Ngee Huat, chairman of GLP's Board said in a statement. The Chinese group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price. China's Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group were supported by GLP CEO Ming Mei in their bid, which trumped an offer by a Warburg Pincus-backed consortium. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. GLP is currently 37 percent owned by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. GIC said it is supportive of the transaction.

Improving economic growth in Europe and hints from ECB policymakers have helped shape expectations for a shift, probably in the form of an announcement that it will taper its asset purchases, even though the inflation outlook doesn't point to a need for a change. German bund yields and the euro have pushed higher in recent weeks, a trend expected to extend over the coming year, according to a clutch of separate Reuters polls of fund managers, fixed-income strategists and currency analysts over the past few weeks. Euro zone economic growth is expected to remain strong but steady through to the end of 2018, the latest Reuters poll of over 75 economists showed. But analysts trimmed inflation expectations for this year slightly compared with a month ago. The ECB's most likely course of action in September is to announce a tapering of its 60 billion euros of monthly asset purchases, probably starting in early 2018, according to the poll.  Our base case scenario is that they (the ECB) will not spell out the details in September, but they will really give a very clear hint that the tapering will come,  said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING.  They are facing the same problem that so many other central banks are, namely, a cyclical upswing in growth without any inflationary pressure. The challenge for the ECB is also how to move towards tapering without creating a taper tantrum.  A little over one-quarter of the economists polled said the ECB will not announce any change in September. A similar proportion of economists predict an extension to its quantitative easing program beyond December, but with a reduction in the amount of monthly asset purchases. (For a graphic on expectations for ECB September meeting: reut.rs/2umDrx2)  The balance on whether they will adjust their policy in September or October will be decided by their tone in July,  said Claus Vistesen, economist at Pantheon. At the July meeting, only slightly more than half of the sample - 56 percent - said the ECB will not make any changes to its guidance on monetary policy. Over a quarter of the respondents said the ECB will drop its QE easing bias with regard to size only and the remaining said the central bank will scale back its asset purchases program in its entirety. (For a graphic on expectations for ECB July meeting: reut.rs/2tNgPV7) The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the ECB was likely to signal in September that its bond-buying scheme will be gradually wound down next year. ECB chief Mario Draghi could give the next clue on the plans in late August, it said. The Reuters poll suggested the ECB is unlikely to raise interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2018. Then, the central bank is expected to take its deposit rate higher by 10 basis points from the current -0.4 percent. Medians showed gross domestic product would grow 0.4 percent each quarter from now until end-2018 in the euro zone, and at a similar pace in the biggest economies of the region - Germany and France. However, inflation expectations remain weak. Euro zone inflation is expected to average 1.5 percent this year and next and is not expected to reach the ECB's target of just below 2 percent until at least 2020. Polling was conducted July 10-13, before a newspaper report based on ECB sources that suggested September was the most likely time for the ECB to signal it will wind down its 2.3 trillion euro asset purchase program. The shift in expectations come at a time when the ECB's peers are also veering away from the many years of ultra-loose policy that has prevailed since the financial crisis. On Tuesday, the Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in seven years in a decision that was first thought to yield no move - by roughly the same percentage of economists - only for several to change their minds in the days beforehand.

No change to text.) * Navalny says he and supporters under severe pressure * Says he has 125,000 volunteers, 60 election offices * Demands to be allowed to run against Putin next year * Vows to organise more anti-Kremlin protests By Svetlana Reiter and Andrew Osborn MOSCOW, July 13 (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny complains his wife and two children are being tracked by the security services, but says he's not afraid to challenge Vladimir Putin for the presidency whatever the risks. Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer who has organised the biggest anti-Kremlin protests in years, hopes to run against Putin in a presidential election in March and told Reuters he planned to call for more big anti-government demonstrations.  My mood is generally really positive,  said Navalny.  I have 125,000 volunteers, people turn out to demonstrate, they are detained, campaign literature is confiscated. (But) I see that people support us.  Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years and remains highly popular according to opinion polls, has yet to confirm whether he will run for what would be a fourth term, but is widely expected to do so - and to win.  I constantly hear that it's impossible to change anything and that there is this 86 percent (which supports Putin). But I don't see this 86 percent,  Navalny said in an interview in his office overlooking a grey Moscow suburb.  In an authoritarian country, such a number is not relevant. There will be an election campaign, people will see an alternative, and this 86 percent will crumble.  Previous opposition contenders have struggled to get their message across in a tightly-controlled media landscape where state TV hews closely to the Kremlin line and either ignores or denigrates rivals. They faced a particular challenge in areas of the vast Russian Federation far from Moscow and St Petersburg. Navalny, who has used the Internet to try to tap into public anger over official corruption, is battling to even be allowed to take part in the election after the Central Election Commission said a suspended conviction for embezzlement he describes as politically-motivated disqualified him. He has been jailed twice in recent months for his role in organising anti-government protests, had a caustic liquid thrown in his eyes by an assailant, and investigators have raided his Moscow election headquarters. Police have also confiscated copies of his campaign newspaper and hundreds of his supporters have been detained at protests and election events.  How many times can you be afraid?  quipped Navalny, whose sprawling offices inside a business centre buzz with young people working on laptops, as well as allies broadcasting from a small studio to his online TV channel.  The Kremlin's strategy is to prevent our activities. That's because the only reason for Putin's support is because nobody else is carrying out any other (political) activity.  His investigations into the high-rolling lifestyles of top government officials have riled the authorities and Navalny says his own family is now under constant pressure. Navalny has a 9-year-old boy and a 15-year-old daughter.  The security services are following us,  said Navalny.  They follow my children, my wife and me. Cars are constantly passing by. I don't even pay attention to it any more, but Yulia (his wife) is really bothered by it.  Some opposition activists left the country after opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin walls in 2015. Oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on fraud charges in 2003, after expressing political ambitions, and imprisoned until 2013 when he was allowed to go abroad. Since being temporarily blinded in one eye in the caustic liquid attack, Navalny sometimes appears with a bodyguard. The FSB security service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics Among Navalny's pledges: To depoliticise the judiciary, to champion a free media, to promote free market economics, to legalise personal handguns and to introduce a visa regime for visitors from Central Asia and the South Caucasus. He told Reuters he would be willing to organise  an honest referendum  in Crimea which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to see which country its residents wanted to be part of. The way Moscow had seized it, he said, was illegal. But he also said he thought the Crimea problem, which has soured relations with the West and triggered sanctions against the Kremlin, looked  intractable  and could poison relations for years ahead. Critics have accused him of harbouring dangerous nationalist tendencies with one fellow activist suggesting he was a Kremlin stooge designed to create the illusion of political competition. Navalny says he has no time for such  ridiculous  conspiracy theories and that his immigration policies are in line with  normal  European practice. Dressed casually in jeans and a white shirt, Navalny said he was certain the authorities would relent and allow him to run in next year's election.  I have no doubt I will take part in the election and that we will achieve our goal,  he said. One opinion poll earlier this year put his support as low as 1 percent. Navalny, however, points to the Moscow mayoral election in 2013 when he came from a low base to place second with almost one third of the vote. He said he was using 125,000 volunteers and 60 election offices across Russia in a campaign designed to force authorities to allow him to run. If he were barred from the election, he said, the ballot could not be regarded as fair. He said he would deploy an army of volunteers as poll observers to ensure the 2018 vote was fair. Top officials right up to President Putin are careful never to mention Navalny's name in public, even when asked direct questions about him. Putin, when asked at the G20 in Hamburg earlier this month why he refused to pronounce Navalny's name publicly, said he wasn't interested in a dialogue with people out to promote themselves and again didn't mention Navalny by name.  I understand the rules of the political games pretty well and what they (the Kremlin) do and what I must do,  Navalny said.  We are conducting a real campaign which nobody else is doing. We are changing the political landscape.  (Editing by Ralph Boulton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-politics-navalny-idUSL8N1K44Z9"},

The 800,000-Serbian dinar ($7,600) grant under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's cross-border stimulus program, for  poorer, ethnic Hungarian regions in central Europe, enabled Kracsun to buy expensive welding machinery which would otherwise have been beyond his means. More than one million ethnic Hungarians live in neighboring Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere, descendants of Hungarians who found themselves outside their homeland when the country's borders were redrawn at the end of World War One. With a parliamentary election in April 2018 drawing closer, 54-year-old Orban is expanding his political arsenal to include ethnic Hungarians like Kracsun through grants and heavily-subsidized loans to small businesses.  As a first step, Orban gave these ethnic Hungarians citizenship after a 2010 landslide, followed by voting rights. That helped Orban eke out a two-thirds parliamentary majority at the last election in 2014 as such voters overwhelmingly backed him.  Our workload has doubled,  thanks to the new machinery purchased after receiving the grant, Kracsun said in the shade of his rudimentary workshop.   We have not had such an opportunity in this country or this region so far,  Kracsun said, adding that he intended to support Orban's ruling right-wing Fidesz party next April because of the measures he was taking to support voters outside Hungary.  They take care of us. It is a good feeling. We have always felt Hungarian, regardless of the border.  That sentiment was widespread in Vojvodina, a northern region in Serbia and home to about a 200,000-strong Hungarian community. Most of the ethnic Hungarians Reuters interviewed for this story and who were grant recipients plan to vote for Orban  next year. Template for Romania Latest opinion polls show Orban's Fidesz party is a clear favorite to retain power in 2018. Political analysts said  ethnic Hungarian voters could help Orban regain the two-thirds majority he has since lost.  It is in the government's interest to have these sympathetic voters turn up at the election in the largest possible numbers,  said Attila Tibor Nagy, an analyst at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis think-tank. A two-thirds parliamentary majority enabled Orban to rewrite the constitution and pass major laws without support from other parties. The government in Budapest estimates ethnic Hungarian votes could sway two out of 199 seats in parliament. Of an 8.25 million-strong electorate, nearly 290,000 ethnic Hungarians are registered to vote, their ranks having increased since the last election. Orban's three-year, 50-billion-forint ($185 million) stimulus plan in Vojvodina could also be a template for a bigger program in fellow European Union member Romania, home to the region's largest ethnic Hungarian community. Once a grant has been successfully applied for, it is disbursed through a local foundation linked to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, which says the main goals of the scheme are to support local families and small businesses and to help ethnic Hungarians stay where they are.  People Decide  Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians have moved to western Europe in search of higher-paid jobs over the past years and the latest census figures showed a fall in the number of ethnic Hungarians living in Serbia as well. Welders are seen working on an iron structure at a workshop in Cantavir, Serbia, July 6, 2017, a grant received from the Hungarian government enabled the company to buy new machinery, boosting the amount of work he can take on.Bernadett Szabo This program is obviously part of the broader strategic concept launched seven years ago and I think this will continue,  Deputy Secretary of State Peter Kiss-Parciu said.  I am sure this will motivate people to take a more active role in the matters of the Hungarian community,  Kiss-Parciu said, when asked whether the funds could be a boon for Orban at the election, adding:  As to how people vote, that is for them to decide.  Sitting on Hungary's southern border, Vojvodina is among Serbia's more developed regions, but even so, living standards languish below those in a neighboring poor region of Hungary. Vojvodina, through which the Danube river flows, is the breadbasket of Serbia providing much of its grain and makes up about one quarter of its territory. The capital Novi Sad was heavily bombed in 1999 when NATO intervened to halt killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb forces.   Daniel Ferencz, a beekeeper in the town of Backo Petrovo Selo, surrounded by lush forests and dazzling sunflower fields, received a grant of about 860,000 Serbian dinars, which he used to buy swarms of bees, 50 hives and a honey-bottling machine. Slideshow (13 Images)Ferencz, 34, said the financial support convinced him he could make a living at home instead of moving elsewhere.  It is an uplifting feeling,  he said near a colorful row of hives.  It is good to be a Hungarian here because no one else has ever provided similar support.  For others, like Nikoletta Futo, 22, and her husband, who have a three-year-old daughter and triplet sons turning two in November, the 1.2-million-dinar grant also made the difference between staying and leaving the area. Using the grant and some savings, they were able to buy a bigger house on the outskirts of Kanjiza, just across the Hungarian border in Serbia.  We used to live in a smaller house with two rooms, but the six of us had to share a single room there,  said Futo, with her daughter, Nora, sitting on her lap. Low Interest Rates In the next phase of the program, Hungarian OTP Bank's tiny Serbian unit will provide loans to Hungarian small businesses for projects worth over half a million euros each in agriculture and industry. Nearly three dozen such projects are being assessed, Kiss-Parciu said, adding government subsidies will allow companies to borrow at 1-2 percent interest, far below the Serbian base rate, which at 4 percent is the highest in the region. Deputy Chief Executive Laszlo Wolf told Reuters that OTP was looking to boost its low market share in Serbia and Romania, possibly through acquisitions. OTP declined further comment on its Serbian expansion plans. Officials in Belgrade were not available to comment about the grants and loans for this story but have not criticized Orban's stimulus plan. Then Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is now president, said at a joint government meeting in November  relations between Serbia and Hungary have never been better. But not everyone is so happy. Hungary's Socialists, trailing far behind in the polls, say Orban is using Hungarians across the border as political tools, also criticizing his stimulus program for what they see as a lack of transparency. And, early last month, Serbian tabloid Kurir, a Vucic critic, ran a headline reading:  Orban takes over Vojvodina.

European stocks are set for a flat to higher open, with spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Germany's DAX to open little changed, Britain's FTSE 100 to start the day up 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 to rise 0.2 percent. The MSCI World Index was almost 0.1 percent higher on Friday, just a whisker below an all-time intraday high hit earlier. It is on track to end the week 1.6 percent higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.2 percent to its highest level in two years. It's set for a 3.1 percent gain for the week, its biggest since mid-March. Japan's Nikkei added 0.2 percent, poised for a weekly rise of 1.05 percent. Chinese shares reversed earlier losses, with the CSI 300 index rising 0.2 percent and the Shanghai Composite flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose almost 0.1 percent. Wall Street edged higher on Thursday, with the major indexes up between 0.1 and 0.2 percent, as stocks basked in comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that the central bank's rate hikes could be gradual, given persistently low inflation despite an improving economy. Expectations that S&P; 500 companies will report second-quarter earnings growth of 7.8 percent also supported stocks. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will report results on Friday.  The U.S. profit reporting season looks likely to be a key market driver over the next couple of weeks,  Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note.  Full valuations suggest that the market is yet again going into this reporting season anticipating results to outperform consensus analyst expectations.  In Asia, markets are also expecting strong earnings, particularly for many of the export-reliant firms benefiting from an upturn in global demand. The dollar pulled up 0.2 percent to 113.42 yen on Friday, narrowing losses for the week to 0.4 percent. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was steady at 95.715, on track for a 0.3 percent weekly decline. The dollar was supported by data showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. Investors are awaiting a host of U.S. economic indicators, including core inflation, retail sales and industrial production for June later in the session for more insight into how the Fed might proceed with monetary policy tightening this year.  After their June rate hike, the Fed is seen watching inflation trends carefully before tightening policy again. So market interest towards inflation data is very high and the dollar is likely to move widely in either direction,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. For now, markets appear to be shrugging off the revelation by U.S. President Donald Trump's son this week that he'd met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign after being told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. But political concerns in the U.S. may once again vex investors, as a revised Senate plan to dismantle Obamacare drew criticism from both Republican and Democratic senators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was forced two weeks ago to scrap a planned vote on an earlier version, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1407 on Friday, after inching down 0.1 percent overnight, and is set to end the week flat. The European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its bond-buying scheme will be gradually wound down next year and ECB chief Mario Draghi could give the next clue on the plans in late August, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday. The Canadian dollar remained near its strongest in over a year after the Bank of Canada this week raised interest rates for the first time since 2010, with further tightening expected this year. The loonie was marginally weaker on Friday at C$1.2731 to the dollar but is up 1.1 percent this week. In commodities, oil was mostly steady as high fuel inventories despite supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tussled with data that showed a jump in China's oil imports in the first half of 2017. U.S. crude was unchanged at $46.08 a barrel, after rising 1.3 percent on Thursday. It is poised for a 4.2 percent gain this week. Global benchmark Brent was also little changed at $48.43 following Thursday's 1.4 percent jump, and is headed for a 3.7 percent gain this week. Gold was steady at $1,217.47 an ounce, heading for a 0.4 percent gain for the week.

Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments.  We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,  Robert Hackl, Sprint's senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years.  Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors' plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices.  Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.   It's about lowering the cost for the consumer,  he said.  What's in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.  The company, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network.   Considering that they're more in an M&A; mindset, they need a growing company,  Entner said, of Sprint executives.  Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.

Adani's proposed Carmichael mine in Queensland state has faced years of delays amid opposition from environment groups who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef, leading some banks to rule out any role in funding.     The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), a federal agency, said on Friday that it has selected five projects out of 124 loan applications for due diligence. It did not name the projects and declined to provide further detail. However, a source with direct knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters that Carmichael was one of those five.  An Adani spokesman in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adani is hoping to receive a concessional loan of around A$900 million ($700 million) from NAIF to help build a 380 km (236 mile) rail link into its controversial Carmichael project located in the remote Galilee Basin.  The 247,000 square-km (95,000 square mile) expanse in the central outback is touted as having the potential to become Australia's largest coal-producing region. Adani, a business group with interests in power and ports, has said the project would not threaten the reef. Of the $4 billion required for the first phase, Adani will have to raise about $2.5 billion in debt, the company said in March, adding it had already invested $3.3 billion in the project. Slides from a presentation made by NAIF chief executive Laurie Walker in Brisbane on Thursday show due diligence is the penultimate stage of the body assessing a loan proposal.  Sydney-listed Genex Power Ltd said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that its solar and pumped hydro project in North Queensland was also in the due diligence phase. NAIF said the five projects in due diligence were among 50 loan applications that remain under active consideration from the total 124.

Central government spending rose 10.2 percent in June from a year earlier while local government spending soared 20.3 percent, the finance ministry said on Friday. The pick-up in fiscal spending was mainly due to faster funding allocation to guarantee the key expenditure needs under a drive to make fiscal policy more  active and effective  this year, the ministry said in a statement on its website. Government spending in the first six months of the year rose 15.8 percent from a year earlier, the ministry said. China's economic growth is expected to have cooled to 6.8 percent in the second quarter as Beijing tightens the screws on financial risks, a Reuters poll showed, in a sign the world's second-biggest economy is set for a further slowdown over the coming quarters. Government-led stimulus has been a major driver of economic growth over the past years, but the pump-priming has also been accompanied by runaway credit growth and has created a mountain of debt. China has kept its budget deficit at 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2017, the same as last year, and pledged to clamp down on risks associated with local government debt. China's fiscal revenues increased 8.9 percent in June from a year earlier, also quickening from May's 3.7 percent rise, the ministry said. Fiscal revenue in the first half rose 9.8 percent from a year earlier. Faster fiscal revenues reflected China's steady economic growth, rising producer prices and improving corporate profits, the ministry said.

She directed her first feature film, “A Death In The Gunj”, last year and is now back with a role in Alankrita Shrivastava’s “Lipstick Under My Burkha”. Sen Sharma, who plays a Muslim mother who is desperate to break the shackles of her conservative existence, spoke to Reuters about the film, why a female perspective is important in movies and whether she thinks she will sit behind the camera again.  Q: How did you come to be a part of “Lipstick Under My Burkha”? A: I knew (director) Alankrita from earlier on because we had common friends. I heard she was writing this film and when I read the script, I loved it. It was very well thought-out and felt like a recounting of lived experiences even though she could not have lived these four lives. It felt like an intimate glance at the lives of these four women, and we don’t see that very often in our cinema. Q: We see Bollywood films about the bond between men but hardly anything that showcases sisterhood… A: The discrimination that women face cuts across nationality, caste or class and age. It doesn’t matter where you live or how much money you have, women have always been dictated to about what they should wear and how they should behave. That is what we have in common with these characters and women across the world. Also, I think we don’t get to see the lives of older women (in our films). We see women in their late teens or early 20s, which is such a small section of society. There are so many more complex stories to tell. Shireen Aslam, the woman I play in the film, is in her 30s and has three children. That kind of context is not seen very often in films. She’s not a shrill feminist – she has to pick her battles. These are her givens and she has to see how she can achieve her goals in finding loopholes. It is a very interesting way of trying to reclaim agency. Q: A lot of the conversation around the success of the new “Wonder Woman” film revolved around the female gaze and the politics of how women are portrayed in films. Do you think the female perspective matters? A: I think the female gaze is important because we cannot have just one perspective on anything. We have been seeing cinema from a male perspective for a very long time and there are things which are given, which are allowed and things which are normalised, like harassment or stalking - not just in films, but in ads or music videos. We haven’t seen as much from a female perspective. But one of the most important things in feminism is choice. And because women should have choice, we cannot force them to be feminists. They can choose to be regressive if they want. Therefore, it is not incumbent on women to make feminist films or films about women, but there should be a lot more women film-makers, regardless.  Q: Do you find it difficult to accept roles that don’t conform to your views on feminism or gender? A: As a working actor, I don’t have a lot of choice. There was a time when I got varied film offers. But nowadays, I don’t get a lot interesting characters to play at all. Q: Why is that? A: So many things (Sighs). It could be that I have been around for longer and am older. It could be that we are not interested in telling stories about women in their 30s. Some films follow a certain formula. If you see films which have been successful over the last 10 years, the women in them have been in their 20s. “The Dirty Picture” and “English Vinglish” are two I can think of. But there are very few good roles for women in their 30s. Q: Are you looking to direct again? A: I would like to, but I hope I find something that I feel strongly about as I did about Shutu and McCluskieganj. I don’t want to make just anything. I also want to do some interesting acting work, so I hope I get that. Many times, one does get interesting work, but it is also work that doesn’t get funded because one sure-shot way to get funding is to take a big star… People who fund films have to be able to take risks, even if they are smaller risks. And audiences have to go out and watch these films. Otherwise we cannot make them.

The CSI300 index fell 0.1 percent, to 3,683.99 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,212.46 points. The start-up board index ChiNext slid 1.2 percent to a five-week low, as many stocks that have seen fast growth have forecast sharp drops in mid-year earnings. The index is poised to have its worst week since mid-December.  We do not see any reason why investors shall plow money in growth stocks for now, given expectations of dim results at these firms amid tight liquidity conditions,  said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities. Yan said that a crisis at tech company Leshi Internet Information, a listed unit of the struggling Chinese conglomerate LeEco, could exacerbate fears over start-ups. The market value of Leshi Internet Information could fall around $2.5 billion should its shares resume trading, showed estimates from three mutual fund investors. There was scant market reaction to news that Fitch maintained its A+ rating on China with a stable outlook, citing the strength of the country's external finances and macroeconomic record. In a Reuters poll of 65 economists, China's economic growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent this year, topping the government's target of around 6.5 percent. The defensive consumer and healthcare sectors led declines in the morning. Shares in Wangsu Science & Technology and Guangdong Wens Foodstuff both slumped more than 6 percent, after forecasting sharp declines in earnings for the first half.

Adani's proposed Carmichael mine in Queensland state has faced years of delays amid opposition from environment groups who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef, leading some banks to rule out any role in funding.     The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), a federal agency, said on Friday that it has selected five projects out of 124 loan applications for due diligence. It did not name the projects and declined to provide further detail. However, a source with direct knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters that Carmichael was one of those five.  An Adani spokesman in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adani is hoping to receive a concessional loan of around A$900 million ($700 million) from NAIF to help build a 380 km (236 mile) rail link into its controversial Carmichael project located in the remote Galilee Basin.  The 247,000 square-km (95,000 square mile) expanse in the central outback is touted as having the potential to become Australia's largest coal-producing region. Adani, a business group with interests in power and ports, has said the project would not threaten the reef. Of the $4 billion required for the first phase, Adani will have to raise about $2.5 billion in debt, the company said in March, adding it had already invested $3.3 billion in the project. Slides from a presentation made by NAIF chief executive Laurie Walker in Brisbane on Thursday show due diligence is the penultimate stage of the body assessing a loan proposal.  Sydney-listed Genex Power Ltd said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that its solar and pumped hydro project in North Queensland was also in the due diligence phase. NAIF said the five projects in due diligence were among 50 loan applications that remain under active consideration from the total 124.

President Michel Temer is charged with corruption and is likely to face at least two more graft charges in the coming weeks. He can only be tried by the Supreme Court if two-thirds of the lower house of Congress vote to allow it. Temer, who replaced Dilma Rousseff last August after she was ousted by the Senate, is expected to survive the first vote, which is set for Aug. 2. But it is increasingly likely he could lose votes on subsequent charges, key lawmakers in Temer's coalition and opposition have told Reuters in recent days. If that happens, Temer would be suspended for 180 days, replaced temporarily by Maia, 47. If Temer is convicted by the top court, Maia could serve out the remainder of his term, which runs through the end of 2018, by winning an indirect election in Congress, where he would likely face little competition. Maia was born in Chile when his father, Cesar, later a three-time mayor of Rio de Janeiro, was a communist in exile during Brazil's 1964-85 military regime. A college dropout, Maia worked in banks before starting his political career in 1997. The soft-spoken speaker still pledges allegiance to Temer, but behind the scenes he has sought to reassure investors and executives of his priorities, sources with knowledge of the meetings told Reuters. With Maia as president, the bulk of Temer's reform agenda would stay on track, including a proposed overhaul of the social security system, and the economic team led by Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles would remain, according to the speaker's confidants in Congress. Maia's press representatives declined an interview request and dismissed reports of his meetings as media speculation. The speaker's market-friendly reputation has been bolstered by his leadership of the center-right Democrats Party, which argues for reducing the state's role in the economy, cutting bureaucratic burdens on business and lowering taxes.  We have nothing against an eventual presidency of Rodrigo Maia,  said Alencar Burti, president of ACSP, the main retail association in Brazil's richest state, Sao Paulo.  As long as the president is replaced following the rules mandated by the constitution, we will give our full support for the new leader to keep current economic policy and approve the reforms.  Key Support Maia also has received public endorsement from key lawmakers such as Senator Tasso Jereissati, head of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Brazil's third largest party, the PSDB, is in Temer's coalition for now but leaders have openly debated a departure, opening the door for smaller parties to follow. Maia has won the respect of colleagues in the lower house as a good listener who freely admits when he is wrong about an issue or simply does not understand it. After keeping a low profile about graft allegations facing Temer for more than a month, Maia has become more assertive on social media of late. This week he defied Temer's proposal to tweak a labor reform bill by presidential decree. Allies say he needs to be very careful. Any hasty move to ascend to power could be interpreted by members of the coalition as an unseemly betrayal of Temer, a long-time ally.  He will have to make sure he does not jump the gun,  said Betinho Gomes, a PSDB lawmaker who will vote to suspend Temer. As Maia gets closer to the presidency, his past is coming under greater public scrutiny. Like Temer and dozens of fellow lawmakers, Maia appeared in a list of politicians accused by executives from engineering group Odebrecht SA of receiving millions of reais in illegal campaign financing. He has not been charged with a crime and denies any wrongdoing.     If he becomes president, the investigation into him would be suspended until he leaves office and he would be able to seek re-election for four more years in October 2018. Maia is far from a household name in Brazil. In 2012 he won just 3 percent of the vote in the Rio mayoral race.     His political skills have never faced a task as tough as steering Brazil out of the current crisis, said Ricardo Ismael, a political scientist at Catholic University of Rio.   Rodrigo is being forced to become a mature politician,  Ismael said.  He will need to be surrounded by good aides.

Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments.  We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,  Robert Hackl, Sprint's senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years.  Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors' plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices.  Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.   It's about lowering the cost for the consumer,  he said.  What's in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.  The company, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network.

With talks due to start next month between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mexican officials have stressed the need to craft a new deal that would strengthen the region against competitors, particularly in Asia. Trump has threatened to ditch NAFTA if he cannot rework it to the benefit of the United States, arguing it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. Mexican officials say a revamped NAFTA must further integrate the region and are awaiting U.S. negotiating objectives, due to be published on or around Sunday. They point to sectors like autos, where U.S. inputs make up some 40 percent of the value of products imported into the United States from Mexico, while Chinese exports contain only 4 percent, according to the U.S. Center for Automotive Research.   If we integrate further and make Mexico more competitive versus China ... even if our exports rise, U.S. jobs will rise, because when we export (to the United States), they're exporting too (via U.S. content),  said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who led the initial NAFTA negotiations for Mexico. However, mindful that Trump needs to be able to claim a more obvious win from the shake-up, they are also looking at rules governing how much of a product is made in the region. NAFTA rules of origin stipulate that to qualify for tariff-free access, some products need to be sourced to a certain degree regionally. Cars, a recurring point of attack for Trump, must meet a threshold of 62.5 percent. Because raising that threshold would not automatically benefit U.S. workers - firms could just expand capacity in Mexico - Trump's trade team want to have some national content rules within the regional framework, Mexican officials say. 'A Tricky Issue' FILE PHOTO: Employees work at a wire harness and cable assembly manufacturing company that exports to the U.S., in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, April 27, 2017.Jose Luis Gonzalez/File PhotoMoises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is coordinating the private sector's role in the renegotiation, said they may explore domestic content rules on certain products.  It'll be a tricky issue, and we'll have to see case by case,  he said. Kalach declined to say what goods might be eligible. In May, he said a revamped NAFTA might source more work for future product lines from the region. The Mexican electronics industry wants to increase regional production of some components to reduce reliance on Asia, said Cesar Castro, vice president of electronics industry group Canieti. Slideshow (2 Images)About 70 percent of content in electronic goods exported by Mexico to the United States is sourced from Asia, he said, highlighting products that would have a big slice of Chinese content even if manufactured by U.S. companies. To boost North American output, Canieti is considering a proposal that could see regional content in certain products raised from 5 percent to 50 percent over 10 years, Castro said. Bargaining Chips If Mexico's arguments fall flat, however, and Trump threatens to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods, the sizeable U.S. surplus in services with Mexico could end up as a bargaining chip. That could complement Mexican efforts to target the big U.S. agricultural surplus with Mexico, which the Trump administration is already feeling pressure to preserve. Mexico could insist companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) build servers in the country, said a former Mexican official familiar with discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity.  As the U.S.'s second biggest market, it's clear we can hit back,  said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister.  (Services are worth) more and more every day.

Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the  worst trade deal ever  in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America's favor.  But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports.   Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers.    Infographic ID: '2tNMtlc'      Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,  said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado.  Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork.  Mexico became even more crucial after Trump's pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers' hopes of free access to more markets.  Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration's goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer's list.  Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump's inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump's ear.   Our first ask is to do no harm,  said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group.  Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August.  Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association, Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land O'Lakes, Inc., Tyson Foods(TSN.N), Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company North America, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and others.  For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA  would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.   Quadrupling Exports  FILE PHOTO - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer speaks during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, U.S. on May 15, 2017.Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoAnnual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA.  Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers' case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices.  Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture's cause in NAFTA and beyond.   He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,  Roberts said.  I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it's going to make life much more difficult in farm country,  Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June.  In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the  tremendous growth  in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA.  Slideshow (4 Images) Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,  they warned.  Trump's pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers.   What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state's low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said.  Storm Over Sunny Slope  Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers' angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer's Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA.   If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,  said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion.  While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico's ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump's  America First  mantra.   The common comment is: 'why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?'  said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council.  The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,  he said.  It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.  Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that.   I think President Trump is a negotiator,  he said.  I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.

The ruling by Judge Richard Concepcion, which triggered jeers from the couple's supporters during a public hearing that stretched over two days, marked the second time he has mandated jail time for an ex-president since a massive graft scandal in neighboring Brazil rippled into Peru. Prosecutor German Juarez cited testimony from former executives of Brazilian builder Odebrecht - at the center of the graft scandal - to accuse Humala and his wife, Nadine Heredia, of taking $3 million that allegedly stems from corruption.Juarez also accused the couple of taking illegally-obtained cash from late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.  Here's a president who rose to the presidency and governed us with an electoral campaign built on illicit money. That’s serious because it morally wounds society,  Juarez said. Humala, a mild-mannered former military officer who governed Peru from 2011 to 2016, turned himself in with Heredia, the co-founder of his nationalist party, immediately after the ruling. Both denied wrongdoing and called their pre-trial detention unfair.  This confirms abuse of power, which we will face in defense of our rights and the rights of all,  Humala said on social network Twitter, as television showed images of the couple walking into a building of holding cells, escorted by police. The ruling came a day after former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for graft and dealt a further blow to the left in Latin America. Unlike Humala, Lula will remain free on appeal. Humala recast himself as a more moderate leftist like Lula to win the 2011 election, following an unsuccessful 2006 presidential bid as an ally of Chavez. He ended his five-year term with low approval ratings last year, despite backing private investment and starting social programs for the poor. Humala's downfall jolted Peru's political system, though he is not expected to run for office again. Rightwing groups celebrated his downfall, while leftists urged prosecutors to investigate Odebrecht's links to conservative politicians. Centrist ex-president Alejandro Toledo, believed to be in the United States, refused to turn himself in this year, after Concepcion ordered him jailed before a trial over allegations of having taken a $20-million bribe from Odebrecht. Toledo and Humala rose to power on the support of those who once believed they would counter the graft and autocratic rule of the 1990-2000 government of then president Alberto Fujimori. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has said he might pardon the rightwing Fujimori, who is now serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations and corruption, in a quest for better ties with Fujimori's supporters in Congress.

The measures will be the first in an expected wave of global  legislation as pressure mounts on technology companies to provide such access after several terror suspects used encrypted applications ahead of attacks.  Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown radicals since 2014 and authorities have said they have thwarted several plots, although Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said law enforcement needed more help.  We need to ensure the internet is not used as a dark place for bad people to hide their criminal activities from the law,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.  The reality is, however, that these encrypted messaging applications and voice applications are being used obviously by all of us, but they're also being used by people who seek to do us harm.  Australia's proposal will require device manufacturers and technology companies to help its law enforcement agencies intercept and read messages sent by suspects. The proposal, to be introduced when parliament resumes in August, could be adopted within months, lawmakers have said.  But the plan sets the scene for a clash between Australia's government and some of the world's biggest technology companies. Apple, which declined a request by Reuters to comment on the proposal, has previously resisted sharing such information, citing privacy concerns.  Facebook also rejected the need to introduce the new law, insisting it already had a system in place to work alongside security agencies, while the new legislation could not be implemented on an individual basis.  Weakening encrypted systems for them would mean weakening it for everyone,  said Antonia Sanda, a spokeswoman for Facebook.     While Australia is poised to become the first country to adopt laws on encrypted messages, other nations have said they will introduce similar laws. Several European nations, including France and Britain, have committed to new laws requiring access to encrypted messages, a key issue in this month's talks among the  Five Eyes  intelligence-sharing network.

When being tried in 2009 on charges of inciting subversion of state power for helping write Charter 08 - a pro-democracy manifesto calling for an end to one-party rule - Liu reaffirmed:  I have no enemies and no hatred.   He was sentenced to 11 years in prison that same year, drawing protests from the United States, many European governments and rights groups, which condemned the stiff sentence and called for his early release.  Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Liu, 61, died on Thursday of multiple organ failure, the government of the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang said. He was being treated in a hospital there, having been admitted in June after being diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer. His wife, Liu Xia, had told Reuters previously her husband wanted to dedicate the Nobel prize to those who died in the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.   He said this prize should go to all the victims of June 4,  Liu Xia said, after she was allowed to visit him in jail following the announcement of the prize.    He felt sad, quite upset. He cried. He felt it was hard to deal with.  Liu Xia had been living under house arrest since her husband won the Nobel prize, but was allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She suffers from depression.  She was allowed to be with him in the hospital where he spent his last days. Charter 08 Liu had been a thorn in Beijing's side since 1989, when he helped negotiate a deal to allow protesters to leave Tiananmen Square before troops and tanks rolled in.   Using the law to promote rights can only have a limited impact when the judiciary is not independent,  Liu told Reuters in 2006, when he was under house arrest, in comments typical of those that have angered the government. Charter 08 alarmed the Communist Party more for the 350 signatures - dignitaries from all walks of life – he collected than its content, political analysts said.  The manifesto was modeled on the Charter 77 petition that became a rallying call for the human rights movement in communist Czechoslovakia in 1977. Bao Tong, the most senior Chinese official jailed over the Tiananmen protests, said almost all of the Charter 08 content was already in China's constitution, including free speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association and assembly.  There was nothing subversive,  he wrote in an essay emailed to Reuters on Friday. Bao was once the most trusted aide to Zhao Ziyang who was sacked as Communist Party chief for sympathizing with student protesters and opposing the 1989 crackdown. Liu had ceaselessly campaigned for the rights of the Tiananmen Mothers of victims of the crackdown. He was much better known abroad than at home due to a government ban on internet and state media discussion of the Tiananmen protests, and of him, aside from the occasional editorial condemning him. Liu was considered a moderate by fellow dissidents and international rights groups. But they say the Communist Party is insecure and paranoid, fearing anyone or anything it perceives as a threat to stability. In 2003, Liu wrote an essay, calling for the embalmed corpse of Chairman Mao Zedong to be removed from a mausoleum on Tiananmen Square. Mao is still a demigod to many in China. Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Thorbjoern Jagland looks down at the Nobel certificate and medal on the empty chair where this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo would have sat, as a portrait of Liu is seen in the background, during the ceremony at Oslo City Hall December 10, 2010.Heiko Junge/Scanpix Norway/PoolOver the years, Liu won numerous human rights and free speech awards, including from Reporters Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Hong Kong's Human Rights Press Awards. His books have been published in Germany, Japan, the United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hero to Some, Traitor to Others A hero to many in the West, Liu was branded a traitor by Chinese nationalists. He had come under fire from nationalists for his comments in a 2006 interview with Hong Kong's now-defunct Open magazine in which he said China would  need 300 years of colonization for it to become like what Hong Kong is today . The government considered him a criminal.  For Liu Xiaobo, whatever the United States says or does is right, and whatever the Communist Party says or does is wrong,  a source with ties to the leadership said. Slideshow (7 Images) It's too absolute,  said the source, who declined to be identified. Liu's critics were suspicious of the motives of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, noting that Liu praised the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.  He had also been taken to task domestically because non-government organizations he headed received funding from the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy. The third of five boys, Liu was born in Changchun, capital of the northeastern province of Jilin, on Dec. 28, 1955.  His father, Liu Ling, taught Chinese literature at Northeast Normal University. His mother worked at a kindergarten affiliated with the university.  In 1970, at age 15, Liu was with his parents when they were sent to a labor camp in the region of Inner Mongolia at the height of the Cultural Revolution. Liu worked briefly as a plasterer at a state-owned construction company in Changchun in 1976. After the Cultural Revolution, China resumed national university entrance examinations which Liu passed. He earned his bachelor's degree in Chinese literature from Jilin University and obtained his master's and doctorate degrees from Beijing Normal University. Past Incarcerations Liu had been in and out of prison and labor camps four times, excluding brief periods of house arrest ahead of politically sensitive anniversaries. His first brush with incarceration came after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, when he spent 18 months at the notorious Qincheng penitentiary for political prisoners. Liu was charged with counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, but a Beijing court exempted him from criminal action because he had negotiated with martial-law troops for student protesters to leave the square before tanks rolled in. Police held him without charge on the outskirts of Beijing between May 1995 and January 1996, for drafting and circulating a petition calling for democracy and rule of law in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. Liu Xiaobo married Liu Xia in 1997, during his three years of  re-education  at a labor camp in the northeastern city of Dalian. China abolished the extrajudicial administrative form of punishment in 2013.

The measures will be the first in an expected wave of global  legislation as pressure mounts on technology companies to provide such access after several terror suspects used encrypted applications ahead of attacks.  Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown radicals since 2014 and authorities have said they have thwarted several plots, although Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said law enforcement needed more help.  We need to ensure the internet is not used as a dark place for bad people to hide their criminal activities from the law,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.  The reality is, however, that these encrypted messaging applications and voice applications are being used obviously by all of us, but they're also being used by people who seek to do us harm.  Australia's proposal will require device manufacturers and technology companies to help its law enforcement agencies intercept and read messages sent by suspects. The proposal, to be introduced when parliament resumes in August, could be adopted within months, lawmakers have said.  But the plan sets the scene for a clash between Australia's government and some of the world's biggest technology companies. Apple, which declined a request by Reuters to comment on the proposal, has previously resisted sharing such information, citing privacy concerns.  Facebook also rejected the need to introduce the new law, insisting it already had a system in place to work alongside security agencies, while the new legislation could not be implemented on an individual basis.  Weakening encrypted systems for them would mean weakening it for everyone,  said Antonia Sanda, a spokeswoman for Facebook.     While Australia is poised to become the first country to adopt laws on encrypted messages, other nations have said they will introduce similar laws. Several European nations, including France and Britain, have committed to new laws requiring access to encrypted messages, a key issue in this month's talks among the  Five Eyes  intelligence-sharing network.

Questions about Ikaika Erik Kang's state of mind and the possibility of entrapment were raised by defense lawyer Birney Bervar in remarks to reporters after his client was ordered to remain in jail without bond. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Mansfield in Honolulu ruled after a brief hearing that Kang, 34, posed a flight risk and a danger to the public if released pending further proceedings. The defense did not object to his continued incarceration. Bervar said after the ruling he told his client:  You're going to stay in for now, and we're going to get you evaluated and see what's going on.  He said he believed Kang was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or some other mental problem that the Army failed to address properly after Kang returned from deployments to Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2014. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit, Kang was reprimanded several times dating back to 2011 for threatening fellow service members and expressing extremist views while on duty. The Army referred the matter to the FBI in 2016. Kang soon became the target of what the FBI described in its affidavit as an elaborate sting operation employing several undercover agents and other  confidential human sources  who posed as Islamic State operatives and sympathizers. A photograph with a redacted date, and entered into federal court July 13, 2017 as an exhibit to support the government's motion to keep U.S. Army Sergeant Ikaika Erik Kang in detention without bond, shows what is described as Kang kissing the Islamic State Flag and putting it up to his forehead. Kang is charged with trying to provide material support to Islamic State extremists. the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii/Handout via REUTERS It looks to me like they've exploited his mental illness and thrown gasoline on the fire of his mental illness to get him to commit a crime that they could arrest him for,  Bervar said. Asked if he was suggesting a case of entrapment, Bervar said:  It sounds pretty close to that, doesn't it?  Bervar said he would seek a  full mental health evaluation  for his client. The government, in support of its motion to keep Kang detained without bond, entered several photographs said to show Kang demonstrating military combat tactics.  Two other images purport to show him kissing and then holding to his forehead a folded flag of Islamic State, also known as ISIS, the militant organization that had seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. He is shown in a third photo holding up an unfurled ISIS flag. Kang, an air traffic control specialist with extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, was arrested by the FBI on Saturday following a year-long undercover investigation. The FBI said he swore allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made training videos for the extremist group and purchased a drone aircraft intended to help ISIS fighters in the Middle East evade enemy tanks in battle. Kang is also accused of trying to furnish ISIS with classified and other sensitive military documents that would have assisted the group in its combat tactics.

Zinke said in a statement that, after taking input from the public, he would recommend to President Donald Trump that  no modifications  should be made to the Hanford Reach monument in Washington and the Craters of the Moon monument in Idaho.  When the president and I began the monument review process we absolutely realized that not all monuments are the same and that not all monuments would require modifications,  Zinke said. In April, Trump ordered the Interior Department to review 27 national monuments established by his predecessors since 1996 to determine if they could be reduced in size, or lose their protected status to open up the areas for mining, drilling or other development. That executive order has drawn fire from environmental and conservation groups who fear it is the first step toward rolling back decades of wilderness preservation. The public and other stakeholders had until July 10 to weigh in on the reviews, and environmental advocates said this week more than 2.5 million people had commented on the order. Hanford Reach, located in southeastern Washington along one of the last un-dammed segments of the Columbia River, received monument status in 2000 under President Bill Clinton. Craters of the Moon, a vast area of volcanic lava fields in central Idaho, was established in the 1920s and was expanded by Clinton in 2000. Zinke did not provide details about how he reached the decision, instead extolling the virtues of the two sites.  As a former geologist, I realize Craters of the Moon is a living timeline of the geologic history of our land on the Great Rift,  he said. Hanford was home to  some of the most well-preserved remnants of human history in the area,  he said. Craig Gehrke, director of the Idaho chapter of the Wilderness Society, an environmental advocacy organization, said in a statement that protecting Craters of the Moon was a  no-brainer.   But no monument is safe while the proverbial dragnet is being cast over all others,  he said. A full report on the reviews is set to be released next month.
