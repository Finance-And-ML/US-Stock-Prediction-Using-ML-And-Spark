PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Elvis Andrus got the Texas Rangers' scoring started on Friday night, and nine innings later he closed out an unlikely win as Texas rallied for two runs in the ninth and one in the 10th for a 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Shin-Soo Choo had the big hit in between, a two-run homer in the ninth that helped the Rangers (46-50) end a five-game losing streak.  It was a tremendous ballgame tonight for us,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  I think there were five innings with three up, three down. Late, a couple of tremendous at-bats from (Joey) Gallo and Choo to give us an opportunity to win a baseball game.  Jonathan Lucroy led off the 10th with a walk from Brad Boxberger (2-1), advanced on a sacrifice bunt and flyout, then scored when Andrus beat the throw to first on a ground ball deep to third base. Rangers reliever Alex Claudio (2-0) got the win after pitching the final two innings. The Rays got a leadoff single in the 10th, but Adeiny Hechavarria bunted into a 2-6-3 double play and pinch-hitter Trevor Plouffe lined out to left to end the game. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at RaysTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchThe Rays (51-46) had been 44-1 this season when leading after eight innings. Starter Alex Cobb got a rare chance to pitch into the ninth but lost a two-run lead on Choo's home run to send the game to extra innings.  I had the confidence for him to go back out there and get three more outs for us,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said of sticking with Cobb.  No slight to anybody in the bullpen.  Three of the Rays' first four hits off Rangers starter Yu Darvish were solo home runs, good enough for a 3-1 lead heading into the ninth. Brad Miller tied the score in the fourth inning with his fourth homer of the season, Corey Dickerson gave the Rays the lead in the sixth with his 18th, and Mallex Smith added an insurance run in the eighth with his second home run of the season.  I can't say enough about Yu Darvish tonight and how he threw the baseball,  Banister said.  Even though he did give up the three home runs ... tremendous performance by him.  Cobb had been dominant of late. He had allowed one earned run in 15 1/3 innings in his previous two starts, and has lasted at least seven innings in five of his last six outings. At 96 pitches with a 3-1 lead, Cobb came back out for the ninth and a chance at the Rays' first complete game since May 2016. It took only three pitches to spoil a gem -- a double to Gallo, then a two-run homer to left by Choo, his 14th home run of the season, to tie the score at 3 and end Cobb's night. He had allowed only three hits and one run in the first eight innings.  There is no doubt that is a very, very tough loss,  Cash said. Rays closer Alex Colome took over for Cobb and got out of the ninth with the score tied. Cobb and Darvish both settled for solid no-decisions, with matching lines of eight innings, five hits and three runs allowed. Darvish struck out 12, matching his total from his last start against the Rays in September. For five innings, Darvish and Cobb were locked in a pitchers' duel, each allowing just one run and two hits and largely keeping batters in check. The Rangers struck early, as Andrus hit a solo home run as the second batter of the game for a 1-0 lead. Cobb continued his strong pitching of late, holding the Rangers to one hit in the next four innings. Darvish, who came in with a 4-0 career record and 1.07 ERA against the Rays, dominated early. He didn't allow a hit until Dickerson's high chopper back to the mound for an infield single in the third inning. Miller hit a solo home run in the fourth to tie the score, but Darvish had seven strikeouts in his first 11 outs. Rays right fielder Steven Souza did not start the game. He was listed as day to day with a left hip strain after sliding awkwardly and leaving Wednesday's game. Shane Peterson, hitting .260 in limited action, got the start in right field instead, hitting eighth in the batting order. Souza entered the game as a pinch hitter in the ninth and singled to left field. NOTES: Rays OF Corey Dickerson's home run was his first in 91 at-bats, going back nearly a month to June 24. ... Two members of the Rays' bullpen for the first half of the season are now free agents. RHP Jumbo Diaz cleared waivers and elected free agency, and the Rays released RHP Danny Farquhar from Triple-A Durham. ...

Nola's ERA in July is just 1.61, allowing two earned runs or fewer in every start this month. His manager couldn't be happier with his progression.  Nola was outstanding,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's been working on that changeup all year and it's really one of his better pitches. He used all of his pitches, he spotted his fastball in and out and changed speeds extremely well.  Nola (7-6) struck out nine and, at one point, fanned eight of nine batters, something he was unaware of.  I didn't even know,  Nola said after the win.  I guess I felt pretty good. I was just trying to get early outs and it was kind of hot at the beginning of the game and I just wanted to get in and out.  Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at PhilliesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchThe Brewers have scored just 12 runs in their season-long six-game losing streak, and manager Craig Counsell knows that's just not going to cut it.  (Nola) was good tonight, I know that,  Counsell said.  He's tough on our right-handers for sure, so I think that was the story tonight, certainly. We're going to have tough matchups and you have to produce runs against those tough matchups. You're not going to win games scoring one run, not very often.  With Nola clinging to a one-run lead in the bottom of the sixth inning, the Phillies went to work against the Brewers' bullpen. In relief of starter Matt Garza (4-5), right-hander Carlos Torres gave up four earned runs on two walks and four hits, including Tommy Joseph's two-run double off the center-field fence to give the Phillies a 6-1 advantage. The Phillies got on the board early against Garza when Cesar Hernandez drew a leadoff walk and Freddy Galvis smashed a two-run homer, his 11th of the season, over the right-field wall to open the scoring in the bottom of the first inning. The Brewers were able to limit the early damage and get out of the inning after Nick Williams was called out on a bang-bang play at first base and Hernan Perez made a sliding catch in left field to rob Maikel Franco of a base hit. Brett Phillips answered for the Brewers in the top of the second with a two-out solo shot, his second home run of the year, on the first pitch he saw from Nola to cut the deficit in half. Philadelphia left the bases loaded in the bottom of the second after Hernandez and Galvis grounded out and struck out, respectively. Milwaukee threatened in the top of the sixth inning with runners on first and second, but Nola got Travis Shaw to ground out to first to end the inning.  Tonight was a night where we didn't get much going,  Counsell said.  A couple two-out rallies, but first inning might've been out best shot and we didn't produce much, we didn't put them under pressure that often.  All-Star setup man Pat Neshek relieved Nola in the eighth and pitched his 22nd scoreless inning at home in as many attempts this. Right-hander Hector Neris finished up in the ninth. Howie Kendrick returned from the disabled list for the Phillies and reached base on a pinch-hit single in the bottom of the eighth. In the second game of the series, Philadelphia will send right-hander Jeremy Hellickson (6-5, 4.44 ERA) to the mound to face Milwaukee's lefty Brent Suter (1-1, 3.09) as the Brewers look to snap the season-worst losing streak.

Aung San Suu Kyi came to power last year after a landslide in the landmark 2015 elections.  She does not oversee the police or the military, which ruled the country for decades and retains its powerful position under a constitution drafted by the former junta. Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee told a news conference at the conclusion of her 12-day visit that she faced  increasing restrictions  on her access. Lee said the government, citing security concerns, had prevented her from visiting parts of the northeast where the military is accused of abuses against civilians in its conflict with ethnic rebels.  She was also not allowed to visit three journalists detained last month by the army and charged with contacting a rebel group, despite the site of their detention being a popular tourist spot, the human rights envoy said. Myanmar regularly blocks monitors and journalists from travelling to areas near the conflicts citing concerns over safety. Security officials say monitoring prominent people is a normal part of their work. Lee said it was  unacceptable  that people meeting her were watched and even followed by agents she suspected to be from the police Special Branch that once stalked political opponents during almost half a century of dictatorship. Birth Certificates   I have to say I am disappointed to see the tactics applied by the previous government still being used,  she said. U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Situation in Myanmar Yanghee Lee speaks during a news conference in Yangon, Myanmar July 21, 2017.Soe Zeya Tun In the previous times, human rights defenders, journalists and civilians were followed, monitored and surveyed and questioned. That's still going on,  Lee added. Suu Kyi's office did not directly address the issues of access or surveillance, but said it was  disappointed  with Lee's end of mission statement, which  contains many sweeping allegations and a number of factual errors .  We had hoped that the Special Rapporteur's statement would reflect the difficulties of resolving the problems that are a legacy of decades of internal conflict, isolation and underdevelopment,  it said in a statement released early on Saturday.  Myanmar is also refusing entry to a separate U.N. fact-finding mission appointed by the Human Rights Council in Geneva to look into allegations of abuses by the security forces. The panel has a special focus on the western state of Rakhine, where the army led an operation late last year in response to attacks by militants caused an estimated 75,000 people Rohingya Muslims flee across the border to Bangladesh. About 1.1 million Rohingya - who many in Myanmar view as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh - live are denied citizenship and face restrictions on their movements in Rakhine. Lee visited the state and credited Myanmar for attempts to implement some recommendations made in March by a advisory panel led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, including the issuing of birth certificates to 20,000 children not previously registered.  Buddhist officials in Muslim-majority areas have in the past refused to draw up such documents for Rohingya newborns. However, Lee said:  The general situation for the Rohingya has hardly improved since my last visit in January and has become further complicated in the north of Rakhine.  Continued alleged abuses by security forces and killings by suspected Rohingya militants of those perceived to be working with the government left many Rohingya  terrified and often caught between violence on both sides , she said.

The New Zealand Defense Force mobilized additional troops overnight on Friday, bringing its total deployment to at least a dozen trucks and 140 personnel to provide emergency services and help rescue those trapped by rising flood waters.  Christchurch declared a state of emergency after the Heathcote River burst its banks and flooded southern parts of the city on Saturday morning, becoming the fourth area to do so after a severe weather event which has lashed the south island over the past 24 hours, causing widespread flooding.  Local media reports that about 1,500 people in settlements further north were told to leave their homes as water levels rose overnight, while more than 100 homes were evacuated outside of Dunedin, the south island's second largest city. Emergency services are now focused on the Taieri River near Dunedin, after predictions it would rise to near-record levels on Saturday. In addition to Christchurch and Dunedin, states of emergency are ongoing in Timaru and Otago. New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English took to social media to address the nation on Saturday.   My thoughts are with those affected by the weather events in the South Island. Please follow official advice and take care of each other,  the prime minister said on Twitter.  The country's weather bureau said rivers in affected areas remained at very high levels on Saturday morning, after some areas were hit with more than 200 millimeters (7.8 inches) of rain in 24 hours.  It predicted that rain should gradually ease throughout the day, however it said cold temperatures and blizzard-like conditions could affect those at higher levels.

While not a surprise, Spicer's departure was abrupt and accompanied other changes in Trump's media and legal teams, as an investigation of possible ties between his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election widened. After six months in power and still without a major legislative win, Trump shuffled some of his closest staff, parting ways with Spicer after naming Anthony Scaramucci as the new White House communications director. Spicer had been communications director as well as press secretary following the resignation of Mike Dubke as director early last month. A Republican close to the White House told Reuters that Trump settled on Scaramucci, 53, a political supporter and former Goldman Sachs banker, for the head media job on Thursday and met with him on Friday morning to formally offer it to him. A White House official briefed on what happened next said Spicer was told of Scaramucci's hiring and Trump urged Spicer to stay on. But Spicer, 45, said he did not want to stay on under the terms and conditions described to him and quit. A source close to the White House said: “Basically Donald Trump likes Scaramucci on TV and saw the communications director job as a way to ... make him a top TV surrogate.  The source said Trump wanted Spicer to be press secretary and do much of the communications director's work as well,  with Scaramucci holding the ceremonial title with no responsibility. And that was the real challenge.” At an early afternoon briefing, Scaramucci, in his debut before the White House press corps, named Sarah Sanders as the new press secretary. She had been Spicer's deputy. Known by insiders as  Mooch,  the new communications director is a Harvard Law School-educated Long Islander who founded a hedge fund after leaving Goldman, and sold it to join the Trump administration.

I am grateful for Sean's work on behalf of my administration and the American people,  Trump said in a statement.  I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look at his great television ratings.  Spicer will stay on the job through August. From the start, Spicer invited controversy, attacking the media in his first appearance as press secretary for reporting what he called inaccurate crowd numbers at Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Outgoing White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer waves as he walks into the White House in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2017.Carlos Barria This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,  he said, an assertion that quickly drew scorn. In a Twitter post on Friday, Spicer wrote,  It's been an honor & privilege to serve @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & this amazing country. I will continue my service through August.  Easter Bunny Before Trump tapped him for the job of press secretary, Spicer was the Republican National Committee's spokesman. He had previously worked in the administration of former President George W. Bush. During that time, he dressed up in an Easter Bunny costume for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Spicer and other Trump aides shook up White House dealings with the media, including cutting back daily televised news briefings and replacing them with audio briefings only.

The ship is going in the right direction. I like the team. Let me rephrase that: I love the team,  he said. Trump Turmoil  Separately, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possible Trump-Russia ties, has asked White House officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, a source with knowledge of the request said on Friday. The spokesman for Trump's outside legal team, Mark Corallo, resigned. His departure came amid media reports that the role of Marc Kasowitz, who had been leading the team, was being reduced. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions brushed off sharp criticism from Trump, saying he loved his job and planned to stay in it. Trump took a broad swipe at his administration's top law officers this week in a New York Times interview, saying he would not have appointed Sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself. White House unrest was not limited to communications and legal staff, said two officials familiar with the situation. Trump has ignored the recommendations of national security adviser H.R. McMaster and his senior director for Russia, Fiona Hill, on dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said McMaster is frustrated by continuing debate about sending more U.S. forces to Afghanistan. One official said tension persists between McMaster and chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and chief speechwriter Stephen Miller.

The New Zealand Defense Force mobilized additional troops overnight on Friday, bringing its total deployment to at least a dozen trucks and 140 personnel to provide emergency services and help rescue those trapped by rising flood waters.  Christchurch declared a state of emergency after the Heathcote River burst its banks and flooded southern parts of the city on Saturday morning, becoming the fourth area to do so after a severe weather event which has lashed the south island over the past 24 hours, causing widespread flooding.  Local media reports that about 1,500 people in settlements further north were told to leave their homes as water levels rose overnight, while more than 100 homes were evacuated outside of Dunedin, the south island's second largest city. Emergency services are now focused on the Taieri River near Dunedin, after predictions it would rise to near-record levels on Saturday. In addition to Christchurch and Dunedin, states of emergency are ongoing in Timaru and Otago. New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English took to social media to address the nation on Saturday.   My thoughts are with those affected by the weather events in the South Island. Please follow official advice and take care of each other,  the prime minister said on Twitter.  The country's weather bureau said rivers in affected areas remained at very high levels on Saturday morning, after some areas were hit with more than 200 millimeters (7.8 inches) of rain in 24 hours.

(Reuters) - Former CIA director John Brennan on Friday criticized as  disgraceful  President Donald Trump's efforts to play down U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump's administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last year's U.S. presidential election and possible ties with his campaign team. Speaking one day before his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg earlier this month, Trump said he suspected Russian interference in the election but that no one knows for sure.  These types of comments are just disgraceful ... and the person who said them should be ashamed of himself,  said Brennan, CIA chief under former President Barack Obama, at the Aspen Security Forum. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and several U.S. congressional committees are investigating whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trump's campaign to try to swing the race in his favor over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials have said, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said that  his campaign did not collude with Russia. Brennan said he was disappointed by the president's handling of security issues in his first six months in office. “I must say there are disappointments that I see in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing on the international stage that I think pose serious questions about how he is keeping safe our national security,” Brennan said. Speaking at the same event in Aspen, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, was also critical of Trump's administration. Asked if Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser, should have his security clearance canceled for initially failing to list on a disclosure form contacts he had with Russians, Clapper said it should be suspended pending a review. “I do think the appropriate thing here is take a pause and at least suspend a clearance until you've had the opportunity to investigate and then decide whether the clearance should be restored or not,  Clapper told the same panel. Brennan and Clapper also criticized Trump's remarks in a tweet earlier this year about U.S. spy agencies in which he accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany.  “That (tweet) was a terrible insulting affront not to me or John. We get paid the big bucks to take that. But I’m talking about the rank and file, the people in the trenches, men and women, the patriots in the intelligence community and that was completely inappropriate,” said Clapper.

Special counsel Robert Mueller sent a document preservation request to the White House, saying the June 2016 meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had at Trump Tower in New York is relevant to his investigation, the source said on Friday. The White House counsel's office relayed the request, a routine part of the early phase of any investigation, to other members of the White House staff on Wednesday, the source said.

Moscow has denied it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the November 2016 vote in Trump's favor.

The counsel is looking for any indication that the president knew the meeting his son had was planned and might have suggested topics for discussion, the source said. Mueller would also be inquiring into whether Trump was briefed on the meeting afterward, as well as what was discussed, the source said. Mueller would be interested, the source said, in topics such as any discussion of U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, possible Russian investments in the United States or elsewhere, or a possible lifting of a Russian ban on Americans adopting Russian children.

Russia's ambassador to Washington was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing current and former U.S. officials. Sessions, who was a U.S. senator at the time and is now the attorney general, initially failed to disclose the contacts with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and then said they were not about the campaign. Under pressure over having not disclosed the meetings with Kislyak, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March. The recusal angered Trump, who said in a New York Times interview this week that he would not have chosen Sessions for attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself.

The Washington Post and The New York Times on Thursday cited unidentified people familiar with the strategy. A Trump attorney contacted by Reuters, John Dowd, denied the reports and praised Mueller.  We think he's a straight, honest guy,  Dowd said. Dowd said communications with Mueller were productive and  we have confidence he’s going to do the right thing.  Another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, told the Times that addressing possible conflicts of interest in Mueller's team would be appropriate but declined to comment on specifics. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway referred on Friday to reports that members of Mueller's team have made donations to the Democratic Party.  People should know what folks’ paths and motivations and political motivations are,  she said in a Fox News interview. According to the Post, Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the Russia probe. Trump's lawyers have been discussing the president’s pardoning powers, a second person told the newspaper. Dowd dismissed the pardon report as nonsense.  It's just not true,  he said. Separately, the spokesman for Trump's legal team, Mark Corallo, confirmed his resignation on Friday. And lead attorney Marc Kasowitz will take on a reduced role on the outside legal team, according to media reports. Other recent changes included the hiring of veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb to a White House job to handle responses to the Russia probe.

Well, it's only Friday, so I wouldn't put the cart before the horse, but to get that first win I think would be really special, no matter where it is,  said Piller, who is No. 25 in the Rolex World Rankings. Thompson started on the back side and bogeyed her third hole before a run of three straight birdies and five of the next six to finish the front nine. She began her second nine with a bogey before adding three straight birdies en route to her 65.  It's definitely been a bit of an up-and-down year, but I've been playing some great golf,  Thompson said, whose 36-hole total was the second lowest of her career.

The top court has warned that the naming of the alternate judges is illegal, and they could be jailed.

U.S. refineries are processing record volumes of crude while domestic gasoline consumption appears to be holding steady at the same level as 2016 which threatened to flood the market with excess fuel. But low domestic gasoline prices at the start of the summer driving season have encouraged the diversion of tanker shipments from Europe and incentivized U.S. refiners to boost their own exports. The United States was a small net exporter of gasoline in the four weeks to July 14, compared with net imports of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the same point in 2016 and 411,000 bpd in 2015. U.S. gasoline imports are running around 240,000 bpd below year-ago levels, while exports are up by almost 230,000 bpd, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (tmsnrt.rs/2ueeZwN). The shift in the net trade position helped clear excess inventories that built up earlier in the year and had been weighing on gasoline prices. On June 9, U.S. refiners, importers and fuel blenders reported gasoline stocks of 242 million barrels, almost 5 million barrels higher than in 2016 and 28 million barrels over the 10-year average. Stocks were equivalent to around 26 days of implied domestic consumption compared with 25 days at the same point in 2016. By July 14, five weeks later, stocks had fallen to 231 million barrels, almost 10 million barrels below 2016 levels and only 15 million barrels above the 10-year average. Gasoline stocks had been reduced to just 24 days of implied domestic consumption compared with almost 25 in 2016. Aided by lower prices, the United States has traded its way out of an impending gasoline glut with increased exports to markets in Latin America and European shipments diverted to West Africa and Latin America. Hedge funds and other money managers seem to have anticipated a fall in gasoline prices needed to clear excess inventories and may have accelerated the rebalancing process. Hedge funds established a rare net short position in gasoline by early May of almost 21 million barrels and then a similar-sized net short position again by late June. Since then, hedge fund managers have closed many short positions, as gasoline stocks have fallen to more normal levels. Hedge fund short positions in U.S. gasoline declined from 70 million barrels in early May and 68 million barrels in late June to just 45 million barrels on July 11. By July 11, hedge funds had re-established a net long position in U.S. gasoline futures and options equivalent to almost 7 million barrels, anticipating a further increase in prices now that the glut has been cleared.

A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters that Ambassador Sergei Kislyak's accounts of two conversations with Sessions, then a U.S. senator and key foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump, were intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing automatically inappropriate about Sessions, then a U.S. senator as well as a Trump supporter, discussing policy matters or even Trump's thinking about them with a foreign diplomat.  The question is whether he crossed the line and discussed classified information or talked about deals like lifting sanctions if the Russians were interested in investing in the U.S. or had dirt on Secretary Clinton,  said a second official familiar with the intercepts, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.  His memory is another matter.  Sessions at first failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.  As Attorney General, he recused himself in March from matters connected to an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign following his admission that he had talked to the Russian envoy. Sessions has denied discussing campaign issues with Russian officials and has said that he only met Kislyak in his role of U.S. senator. The Post cited one U.S. official as saying that Sessions  provided “misleading” statements that are “contradicted by other evidence.”  The newspaper reported that a former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had “substantive” discussions on matters including Trump’s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration. The Washington Post cited a Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, as saying: “Obviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me.”  The Post said that Sessions did not discuss interference in the election. Trump said in a New York Times interview on Wednesday that he was disappointed by Sessions' move to recuse himself, but a White House spokeswoman said on Thursday that the president still had confidence in Sessions  or he would not be the attorney general.

The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation's crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency. Sanctions prohibiting any transaction in U.S. currency by Venezuela's state-run oil firm, PDVSA, are among the toughest of various oil-related measures under discussion at the White House, the two sources told Reuters. The administration aims to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro into aborting plans for a controversial new congress that critics say would cement him as a dictator.  Venezuela's oil-based economy is in the grip of a brutal recession and a local currency crash, and Maduro has faced months of anti-government unrest that has claimed the lives of about 100 people. Sanctions on dollar transactions would make it even harder for Maduro's government to secure cash for debt payments and finance imports of basic goods. The White House declined to comment on the sanctions under consideration. PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. measures under discussion are similar to those that were imposed against Iran over its nuclear program - which halved Iran's oil exports and prevented top crude buyers from paying for Iranian oil.  The measures were seen as among the most effective economic sanctions ever imposed and paved the way for a deal that curbed Tehran's nuclear activity. Measures on financial transactions would give President Donald Trump's administration the power to escalate pressure on Venezuela by threatening punishment of any U.S. firm doing business with PDVSA or U.S. banks processing any of its transactions in dollars.  The financial restrictions have been  raised repeatedly  in recent discussions about options for actions against Maduro's government, said the senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The administration is also discussing a ban on U.S. oil imports from Venezuela, but no final decisions have been reached, the official said.  Sanctions on dollar transactions could be more punitive than an import ban because they would make it much more difficult for any refiner or trader to buy Venezuelan oil - not just customers in the United States. The impact of sanctions on PDVSA would ripple across oil markets, forcing refiners to buy alternative supplies. The U.S. could use crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to blunt the impact of any short-term supply shortage, the policy adviser told Reuters.  The United States bought 780,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan crude and refined products in the first four months of 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration, nearly 8 percent of total imports. PDVSA is a major supplier to Valero Energy (VLO.N), Phillips 66 (PSX.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and PBF Energy (PBF.N). PDVSA's refining unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, last month was the second largest recipient of Venezuelan crude. It is unclear how Citgo, being wholly owned by Venezuela, would be impacted by U.S. sanctions. Citgo operates three refineries, pipelines and a fuel distribution network in the United States. The threat of sanctions against Venezuela was a key reason for talks this week between PDVSA and Rosneft, Russia's leading state-owned oil firm, which is already under U.S. sanctions. The negotiations in Moscow, reported by Reuters earlier this week, focused on a proposed swap of Rosneft's collateral stake in Citgo for a host of other Venezuelan oil assets - a move to avoid legal complications. Barter Deals Create Cash Crunch The White House said earlier this week that Trump's administration could take what it called  strong and swift economic actions  against Venezuela as soon as July 30. Other options under consideration by Washington include putting more Venezuelan officials and PDVSA executives on its sanctions list, the two sources told Reuters. Maduro intends to create a superbody called the constituent assembly this year that would have the power to rewrite the country's constitution. It would supersede other institutions and replace the democratically elected National Assembly.  Maduro has decried what he calls  imperialist meddling  by U.S. officials. Several governments in Latin America also have called on Maduro to abandon the assembly plan. But officials in neighboring countries also expressed concern that U.S. economic sanctions would trigger famine in Venezuela, which is already reeling from shortages of food and medicine. PDVSA's cash flow has plummeted in recent years, in part due to the Venezuelan government's deals to barter its oil to other nations in exchange for fuels, services and loans. Chinese and Russian entities currently take about 40 percent of all PDVSA's exports as repayment for more than $50 billion in loans to Venezuela and its oil company in the last decade, according to a Reuters analysis of its sales. PDVSA also barters with Caribbean nations, Indian refiner Reliance (RELI.NS) and its unit Citgo. Almost all of PDVSA's cash-paying customers are in the United States and India, and the preferred currency for oil transactions worldwide is the U.S. dollar. PDVSA currently collects most payments from oil exports using China's Citic Bank (601998.SS), but customers making dollar transfers require a correspondent bank in the United States to guarantee the money arrives in China. The Venezuelan oil firm has been struggling to find correspondent banks in the United States since Citibank a year ago suspended providing that service. It would have even fewer options to collect dollars if the sanctions are levied. The company could seek payment in euros through European bank accounts, or use other non-dollar denominated transactions. But the European Union could also take similar measures to prevent transactions in euros, following the lead of the United States. Sanction Threat Rattles u.s. Refiners The crude import ban has been strongly opposed by oil companies and crude processors because of the impact it could have on the refining sector, especially on the U.S. Gulf Coast.   Administration officials have heard from U.S. refiners on the hardships an import ban could have on their businesses and  are now measuring its potential impact on prices, market movement, [and] inventories,  the policy adviser to the White House told Reuters. Phillips 66 - the third largest buyer of Venezuelan crude in the United States this year - said on Thursday that the administration should  carefully consider  sanctions that would affect U.S. refiners and not prevent the sale of Venezuelan crude elsewhere.  Valero did not respond to a request for comment. Chevron declined to comment.  Chet Thompson, chief executive of trade group American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), has been calling and writing White House officials, urging they consider something other than an Venezuelan oil import ban. Some refineries get up to half their supply from Venezuela, he said in an interview Friday.   It's not easily replaced,  he said, adding that the sanctions also may not have their intended effect.  Venezuela,  he said,  will just sell it to someone else.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Warsaw and cities across Poland for candle-lit vigils to protest against the draft bill, as the Senate debated it late into the night. Some protesters carried Polish and European Union flags, chanting  Free Courts . To become law, the proposal still has to be signed by President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. The eurosceptic PiS argues new rules are needed to make the judiciary accountable and efficient. But the opposition and judges groups in Poland as well as critics in Brussels say the legislation is a new step by the Polish government towards authoritarianism. The United States, Poland's most important ally in NATO, issued a statement urging Poland to ensure any changes respect the constitution.  We urge all sides to ensure that any judicial reform does not violate Poland's constitution or international legal obligations and respects the principles of judicial independence and separation of powers,  it said in a statement. An opinion poll for private television TVN showed on Friday that 55 percent of respondents said Duda should veto the overhaul of the judiciary, while 29 percent wanted him to sign it. Since coming into power in 2015, the PiS has sought to tighten government influence over courts, and brought prosecutors and state media under direct government control. It has also introduced restrictions on public gatherings and made it harder for some non-governmental organisations to function.  We believe that Poland is slowly but systematically turning into a penal institution,  opposition senator Jan Rulewski, a veteran activist of the anti-communism movement, said during the debate, dressed in a prison uniform. The PiS remains broadly popular among its electorate, despite an upswelling of protest in recent days as it rushed the judiciary overhaul through parliament. With the economy growing robustly and unemployment at record lows, the party's nationalist rhetoric infused with Catholic piety resonates strongly among Poland's conservative voters.  Foreign Meddling  The government of the EU's biggest eastern member state has so far dismissed criticism, saying the changes would ensure state institutions serve all Poles, not just the  elites . On Wednesday, the EU gave Poland a week to shelve the judicial reforms that Brussels says would put courts under direct government control. If the PiS government does not back down, Poland could face fines and even a suspension of its voting rights, although other eurosceptic EU governments, notably Hungary, are likely to veto strict punishments. Senior Czech judges denounced the judicial overhaul in Poland as an attack on the rule of law on Friday. The PiS has offered some concessions on demand from the president, but has presented criticism from abroad as unacceptable meddling in the domestic affairs of the country, which overthrew communism in 1989 and joined the EU in 2004.  We will not give into pressure. We will not be intimidated by Polish and foreign defenders of the interests of the elite,  Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said in an address on state television. While Polish assets have been largely unfazed by the political turmoil earlier this week, the zloty fell over 1 percent against the euro on Friday, underperforming all of the region's other currencies.

The raids are set to begin on Sunday and continue through Wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The teenagers targeted will be 16- and 17-years-old. The raids represent a sharp departure from practices during the presidency of Barack Obama. Under Obama, minors could be targeted for deportation if they had been convicted of crimes, but were not arrested simply for suspected gang activity or membership. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that a person can be identified as a gang member if they meet two or more criteria, including having gang tattoos, frequenting an area notorious for gangs and wearing gang apparel.   The agency said it does not comment on plans for future law enforcement operations, but that it focuses on individuals who pose a threat to national security and public safety.  The memo instructing field offices to prepare for the raids was dated June 30. A Department of Homeland Security official speaking on background confirmed on Friday the raids were still scheduled to take place, though ICE could still change its plans.   Trump, who campaigned on the promise of tough immigration enforcement, has made deporting gang members, especially those belonging to the El Salvador-based Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a top priority.       You have a gang called MS-13. They don't like to shoot people. They like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe,  Trump said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa last month. In a May speech, the president promised the gang would be  gone from our streets very soon, believe me.  'This Is Troubling' Although children can be deported like adults, U.S. immigration law considers minors arriving at the border without a parent or guardian particularly vulnerable and gives them additional protections.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Field Office Director Jorge Field (R), 53, and Field Office Director David Marin arrest a man in San Clemente, California, U.S., May 11, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMinors apprehended entering the country without a guardian are placed in custody arrangements by U.S. Health and Human Services, often with a family member living in the United States.  Law enforcement agencies maintain databases of individuals suspected of having gang affiliations, but the lists have come under fire from civil rights groups. Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, said the databases often contain inaccurate information.  Slideshow (2 Images) This is troubling on several levels,  Hincapie said.  For one, the gang databases in places like California are rife with errors. We have seen babies labeled as potential gang members.  Immigration lawyer David Leopold of Ulmer & Berne said innocent children could be swept up in the raids.  In many cases, children don’t freely decide to join a gang. They are threatened by older gang members and forced to get a gang tattoo if they live in a certain neighborhood,  he said. The raids planned for next week will also target parents who crossed the border illegally with their children and have been ordered deported by a judge, and immigrants who entered the country as children without guardians and have since turned 18, according to the memo. The document directs field offices to identify people in their areas that meet the criteria.  The Obama administration targeted those two groups in 2016 raids that sought to deter a surge of illegal border crossings by families and minors that began in 2014. Obama, however, directed immigration agents to prioritize for deportation only those who had committed serious crimes or had recently entered the country.

Spieth, who encountered the worst of the weather in both  rounds, stands at six under-par 134 with compatriot Matt Kuchar, two strokes behind after his very solid 71. As well as Kuchar, the Texan is also being chased by England's Ian Poulter and another American, U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, both three shots back. Rory McIlroy refused to get bogged down by his first-round nightmare as he put himself in the frame with a fine round of 68 earlier in the day, moving to five shots off the lead.  But brimming with confidence and clearly able to adjust to the conditions, the 23-year-old Spieth looks well capable of winning a third major, to add to his 2015 Masters and U.S. Open triumphs. His round featured four bogeys, three birdies and an eagle -- the latter coming on the 15th hole.

Slideshow (3 Images)Koepke navigated through the challenging weather with 16 pars and two bogeys. McIlroy made three birdies on his opening six holes on Friday. The Northern Irishman had bogeyed five of those holes on Thursday before recovering to end the opening day on one over-par, and he was able to carry his good work into his second round. But bogeys on the 13th and 15th holes undid some of his progress up the leaderboard, although a birdie on the 17th allowed him to end the day on a high note. Scotland's Richie Ramsay followed up his first round 68 with a solid even-par 70 on Friday to leave him four strokes off the lead. The best second round score came from American Zach Johnson, the 2015 winner, who shot 66. Five-times major tournament winner Phil Mickelson missed the cut after a triple bogey on the par-four third made life difficult for the left-hander who shot 77.

I do think the first inning had an impact on him. Fulmer will say it didn't, but it kind of wears on you when it's that hot.  RF Andrew Romine made his first career start in right field. He had made three appearances in right, a total of 5 1/3 innings. Romine has started at every position this year except catcher and pitcher. The last Tiger to do that was Shane Halter, a former Royal, in 2000. 2B Ian Kinsler went 7-for-20 with three doubles and two triples in the four games. He had a two-run double Thursday. The last Tiger with more than five extra-base hits during a four-game road series was Chris Shelton, who had six, April 6-9, 2006 at Texas.

Collins reeled off six consecutive birdies from the 11th hole, and walked to the 17th tee needing one more to record only the 10th sub-60 round on the PGA Tour. He almost made a hole-in-one at the 200-yard par-three 17th, his ball landing in front of the pin and grazing the edge of the cup as it rolled past, before trickling 12 feet beyond. But he missed a 12-foot birdie putt and then drove into rough at the par-four 18th at the Robert Trent Jones Trail Grand National course in Opelika and could not get his approach anywhere near the hole.  It was an awesome day,” Collins told PGATour.com after posting a 15-under 127 total for a four-stroke halfway lead over fellow Americans Grayson Murray and Cameron Tringale.  I gave (shooting 59) a run. I’m not too disappointed at all about 60.  You’ve got to make a lot of putts to shoot rounds like that. You’ve got to hit it well too and I did both of those. It’s a nice breath of fresh air ...to be in this situation come the weekend.” Collins, 38, is making the 180th start of his PGA Tour career, with a third place his best finish. Coming off 11 missed cuts in his past 12 starts, he seemed an unlikely candidate to shoot 60.  It’s been a struggle this year up until this point but to see myself in this situation is nice and I’m really looking forward to the weekend,” he said. “I’ve gained a little bit of confidence ball-striking wise and I’ve gained in confidence with the putter... “It’s a grind with the heat and a tough course if you’re not striking the ball well. You’ve just got to hang in there and plug along.” Jim Furyk has the lowest ever score on tour, a 58, and there have been eight rounds of 59.

Three Israelis were stabbed to death in a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, hours after three Palestinians were killed in violence prompted by Israel's installation of metal detectors at entry points to the Noble Sanctuary-Temple Mount compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the suspension of all official contact with Israel until it removed the metal detectors. He gave no details, but current contacts are largely limited to security cooperation.  I declare the suspension of all contacts with the Israeli side on all levels until it cancels its measures at al Aqsa mosque and preserves the status quo,  Abbas said in a brief televised speech. The three Israelis stabbed to death and a fourth who was wounded were from the fenced-in West Bank settlement of Neve Tsuf. Israeli media said the three dead were all members of the same family, two men aged 60 and 40 and a woman of 40. The wounded woman, 68, was hospitalised with stab wounds to her back, Israeli media said. A still photo carried by Israeli television showed a kitchen floor completely red with blood. The family had sat down to a traditional Friday evening meal when the attack occurred, according to Israel Radio.  The Israeli army and media said the assailant slipped into the settlement under cover of darkness to carry out his attack. Related CoverageThree Israelis stabbed to death in West Bank settlementIsrael Radio identified him as a 19-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Khobar near Ramallah. It said he was shot, but his condition was not initially known. Palestinian-Israeli Clashes Near Shrine Earlier, Palestinian worshippers clashed with Israeli security forces. Tensions had mounted for days as Palestinians hurled rocks and Israeli police used stun grenades after the detectors were placed outside the sacred venue, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Mohammed Sharaf, 17, and Mohammad Hassan Abu Ghannam, age unknown, died of gunshot wounds in two neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem somewhat away from the epicentre of tension in the walled Old City. It reported a third Palestinian fatality, Mohammed Lafi, 18, later. A Palestinian protester stands next to burning tyres during clashes with Israeli troops near Qalandiya checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah July 21, 2017.Mohamad TorokmanIt was not immediately clear who fired the shots, with unconfirmed media reports that an Israeli settler was responsible in Sharaf's death. Israel decided to install the metal detectors at the entry point to the shrine in Jerusalem's walled Old City on Sunday, after the killing of two Israeli policemen on July 14. The shrine includes the al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam, and the golden Dome of the Rock. It was also the site of an ancient Jewish temple, the holiest place in Judaism. Despite international pressure to remove the metal detectors, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet decided in Friday's early hours to keep them in place, saying they were needed to prevent arms being smuggled into the shrine. Slideshow (16 Images)In protest, thousands of worshippers gathered for Friday prayers at various entrances to the sacred compound, which sits on a marble and stone plateau in the Old City. They refused to enter, preferring to pray outside, in some cases filling the narrow alleyways of the Old City's Muslim quarter.   We reject Israeli restrictions at the Aqsa Mosque,  said Jerusalem's senior Muslim cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammad Hussein. Muslim leaders and Palestinian political factions had urged the faithful to gather for a  day of rage  on Friday against the new security policies, which they see as changing delicate agreements that have governed the holy site for decades. Israeli police mobilised extra units and erected barriers to carry out checks at entrances to the Old City. Access to the shrine for Muslims was limited to men over 50 but open to women of all ages. Roadblocks were in place on approach roads to Jerusalem to stop buses carrying Muslims to the site. At one location near the Old City, stone throwers did try to break through a police line, and police used stun grenades to drive them back. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said four officers were injured in the sporadic clashes and the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said at least 377 protesters had been hurt, some suffering from tear gas inhalation. The hilltop compound has long been a source of religious friction. Since Israel captured and annexed the Old City, including the compound, in the 1967 Middle East war, it has also become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism.  This is our place of prayer, we have sovereignty here,  Salaam said. On Thursday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to press for the removal of the metal detectors. Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East, appealed for calm and the White House called for a resolution. Jordan, the custodian of the holy site, has also been involved in mediation efforts. But Netanyahu's 11-member security cabinet opted in a late-night meeting to retain the metal detectors to ensure no weapons were smuggled in, a week after three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen in the vicinity of the complex.

Trump urged Iran to return Robert Levinson, an American former law enforcement officer who disappeared more than 10 years ago in Iran, and demanded that Tehran release businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer. The statement capped a week of rhetoric against Tehran. On Tuesday, Washington slapped new economic sanctions against Iran over its ballistic missile program and said Tehran's  malign activities  in the Middle East undercut any  positive contributions  coming from the 2015 nuclear accord. Those measures signaled that the Trump administration was seeking to put more pressure on Iran while keeping in place an agreement between Tehran and six world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Friday's statement said Trump and his administration were  redoubling efforts  to bring back all Americans unjustly detained abroad. An Iranian court sentenced 46-year-old Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi to 10 years in prison each on charges of spying and cooperating with the United States. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps detained Siamak in October 2015 while he was visiting family in Tehran, relatives said. The IRGC arrested the father, a former Iranian provincial governor and former UNICEF official in February last year, family members said. Levinson, a former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and for the Drug Enforcement Administration, disappeared in Iran in 2007 and the U.S. government has a $5 million reward for information leading to his safe return. An Iranian court sentenced Xiyue Wang, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen graduate student from Princeton University, to 10 years in jail on spying charges, Iran's judiciary spokesman said on Sunday.  Iran is responsible for the care and wellbeing of every United States citizen in its custody,  the White House said in the statement. Separately, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Oman's foreign affairs minister, Yusuf bin Alawi on Friday. Washington has in the past sought Oman's mediation to help in securing the release of detained Americans abroad. Last year American prisoners held captive by Yemen Houthi rebels were released after Omani mediation. Oman also paid bail that ultimately helped in the release of three American hikers in 2010 and 2011.

The documents show that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, successfully represented the FSB's interests in a legal wrangle over ownership of an upscale property in northwest Moscow between 2005 and 2013. The FSB, successor to the Soviet-era KGB service, was headed by Vladimir Putin before he became Russian president. There is no suggestion that Veselnitskaya is an employee of the Russian government or intelligence services, and she has denied having anything to do with the Kremlin. But the fact she represented the FSB in a court case may raise questions among some U.S. politicians. The Obama administration last year sanctioned the FSB for what it said was its role in hacking the election, something Russia flatly denies. Charles Grassley, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has raised concerns about why Veselnitskaya gained entry into the United States. Veselnitskaya represented a Russian client accused by U.S. prosecutors of money laundering in a case that was settled in May this year after four years.  Veselnitskaya did not reply to emailed Reuters questions about her work for the FSB. But she later posted a link to it on her Facebook page on Friday.  Is it all your proof? You disappointed me,  she wrote in a post.  Dig in court databases again! You'll be surprised to find among my clients Russian businessmen... as well as citizens and companies that had to defend themselves from accusations from the state...   Veselnitskaya added that she also had U.S. citizens as clients. The FSB did not respond to a request for comment.     Reuters could not find a record of when and by whom the lawsuit - which dates back to at least 2003 - was first lodged. But appeal documents show that Rosimushchestvo, Russia's federal government property agency, was involved. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya speaks during an interview in Moscow, Russia November 8, 2016.Kommersant Photo/Yury MartyanovVeselnitskaya and her firm Kamerton Consulting represented  military unit 55002  in the property dispute, the documents show. A public list of Russian legal entities shows the FSB, Russia's domestic intelligence agency, founded the military unit whose legal address is behind the FSB's own headquarters. Reuters was unable to establish if Veselnitskaya did any other work for the FSB or confirm who now occupies the building at the center of the case. 'Mass Hysteria' Over Meeting President Donald Trump's eldest son eagerly agreed in June 2016 to meet Veselnitskaya, a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails released by Trump Jr. Slideshow (2 Images)Veselnitskaya has said she is a private lawyer and has never obtained damaging information about Clinton. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, has said she had  nothing whatsoever to do with us.  Veselnitskaya has also said she is ready to testify to the U.S. Congress to dispel what she called  mass hysteria  about the meeting with Trump Jr. The case in which Veselnitskaya represented the FSB was complex; appeals courts at least twice ruled in favor of private companies which the FSB wanted to evict.   The FSB took over the disputed office building in mid-2008, a person who worked for Atos-Component, a firm that was evicted as a result, told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. The building was privatized after the 1991 Soviet collapse, but the Russian government said in the lawsuit in which Veselnitskaya represented the FSB that the building had been illegally sold to private firms. The businesses were listed in the court documents, but many of them no longer exist and those that do are little-known firms in the electric components business. Elektronintorg, an electronic components supplier, said on its website that it now occupied the building. Elektronintorg is owned by state conglomerate Rostec, run by Sergei Chemezov, who, like Putin, worked for the KGB and served with him in East Germany. When contacted by phone, an unnamed Elektronintorg employee said he was not obliged to speak to Reuters. Rostec, responding to a request for comment, said that Elektronintorg only had a legal address in the building but that its staff were based elsewhere.  When asked which organization was located there, an unidentified man who answered a speakerphone at the main entrance laughed and said:  Congratulations. Ask the city administration.

Paul DeJong's bases-loaded, two-base hit delivered the go-ahead runs while nine straight batters scored in a decisive eighth inning in the Cardinals' 11-4 come-from-behind victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.  I've never been a part of something like that -- to score nine runs with no outs,  said DeJong, who slugged a ground-rule double into the center-field ivy.  I think that really made a statement for us in game one and we've got two more games left that we've got to get.  The victory snapped the Cardinals' two-game losing streak and also ended a six-game winning run by the Cubs. DeJong (1-for-5) doubled off Cubs reliever Hector Rondon to score Tommy Pham and Dexter Fowler for a 5-3 lead with none out. Rondon then gave up an RBI single to Randal Grichuk to make it 6-3. Carl Edwards Jr. (3-2), who started the inning and loaded the bases, took the loss. Reliever Justin Grimm entered and gave up the rest of the scoring, including a two-run double to Carson Kelly, a one-run single to Matt Carpenter and a two-run base hit to Pham. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at CubsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch We had a bad inning pitching,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  That's the third time in a week here at this ballpark if you go prior before the break. A seven, a nine and a 10 in one inning. I've not seen that since rookie ball, that's crazy stuff.  Right-hander Matt Bowman (2-3) worked one-third of an inning in the seventh for the win for the Cardinals (47-49). St. Louis starter Carlos Martinez allowed three runs (two earned) on 10 hits over 6 2/3 innings.  My sinker was really working today, I was finally -- in comparison to last game -- I really had control of it,  Martinez said through a translator.  So it was really working well for me. I was also throwing really hard, which also helped.  The Cubs (49-46) opened a five-game homestand as Ben Zobrist had three hits, Kyle Schwarber had two hits and Willson Contreras homered. Fowler went 3-for-4 to lead the Cardinals while Carpenter, Pham and Grichuk each had two hits. Cubs starter Jake Arrieta scattered two runs on five hits but received a no-decision. He held an opponent to six or fewer hits for the 12th straight start.  We swung the bats well against Martinez, took what he was giving us and had some great at-bats and I kept us in the game,  Arrieta said.  That was it until the eighth when it got out of hand.  The Cubs led 2-0 in the first as Contreras clubbed his 14th home run, scoring Zobrist in the process. Grichuk marked his return from the 10-day disabled list with a two-out, solo homer in the second inning that trimmed the Cubs lead to 2-1. St. Louis forced a 2-2 tie in the third when Fowler doubled home Pham with two out. Anthony Rizzo's one-out single down the first base line brought home Jason Heyward from second for a 3-2 Cubs lead. Arrieta, pulled for a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, struck out six and walked none while throwing 97 pitches on a hot, humid afternoon. Martinez left for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh and was replaced by left-hander Zach Duke, making his season debut after being called up from the 60-day disabled list on the heels of Tommy John surgery following the 2016 season. Duke faced two batters and threw six pitches, including a line drive from Rizzo for an out. After Edwards loaded the bases, Rondon entered and walked Jedd Gyorko to bring in Carpenter with the tying run before the two-run ground-rule double to DeJong.  When you get going, you keep going,  said Kelly, who was called up from Triple-A Memphis on Friday and inserted into the lineup when starter Yadier Molina was a late scratch.  You've just got to ride it.  NOTES: The Cardinals made a series of personnel moves prior to Friday's game, including a trade that sent LHP Marco Gonzales to Seattle for OF prospect Tyler O'Neill. St. Louis also designated C Eric Fryer for assignment, recalled C Carson Kelly from Triple-A Memphis, activated OF Randal Grichuk from the 10-day disabled list and LHP Zach Duke from the 60-day disabled list. ... The Chicago stop is the finale of a 10-game road trip for the Cardinals that included stops in Pittsburgh and at the New York Mets. ... St. Louis sends RHP Adam Wainwright (11-5, 5.08 ERA) against Chicago LHP Jon Lester (6-6, 4.07 ERA) in Saturday's middle game. ... Cubs 3B Kris Bryant sat out Friday's game after suffering a left pinkie finger sprain on Wednesday. He's also likely to miss Saturday. ... The Cubs began an 18-game stretch of game without a trip to the airport with three games against the Cardinals, a four-game home-and-home series with the White Sox, three in Milwaukee and a six-game homestand through Aug. 20.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-cubs-writethru-idUSMTZED7LGO3VAT"},

The executives said on Thursday the company would soon open a facility in Palo Alto, California, that would eventually be staffed by  several hundred  engineers. Lyft engineers will collaborate there with autonomous vehicle experts from other companies to build self-driving systems.  We are putting down the accelerator significantly on investment on this,  Raj Kapoor, chief strategy officer for Lyft, told reporters at its San Francisco headquarters. The move marks a striking strategy change for Lyft, which said previously it would leave the building of self-driving systems to others while allowing partners to test their autonomous cars in Lyft's ride-hailing network. Lyft previously announced partnerships with Alphabet's self-driving division, Waymo, technology company Nutonomy, and automakers General Motors Co and Jaguar Land Rover. Lyft's new effort could put it in direct competition with some of those partners. The company, which will not be manufacturing the actual cars, offered no time line for its self-driving ambitions. Executives said Lyft would share data from its self-driving efforts with other companies joining the collaboration. Lyft does not have a permit to test autonomous cars in California, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. The company plans to launch a pilot with Nutonomy in Boston by year-end.  Recruiters for Lyft wait for the opening of a job fair in Golden, Colorado, June 7, 2017.Rick WilkingBuilding autonomous driving systems is a complicated and expensive endeavor, and brings a new layer of complexity to Lyft. Unlike its far larger rival, Uber Technologies Inc, which has tackled everything from food delivery to flying cars, and expanded overseas, Lyft has operated strictly as a ride service for people in the United States. Lyft's 700,000 drivers complete more than 200 million rides and 1.2 billion miles (1.9 billion km) a year in the 350 cities where it operates, which executives said gave the company detailed knowledge of traffic patterns, bridges, construction and other roadway data critical for building autonomous systems.  The one thing that is very, very key is the scale that we have,  said Luc Vincent, vice president of engineering.  None of those miles have been driven with autonomous technology, experts point out, meaning Lyft will be starting from scratch in a business where Waymo, Tesla and Uber have been operating for years.   It does still take a lot to do this, even if there is lots off-the-shelf technology, to engineer them together and create systems and put them in a vehicle,  said Jeremy Carlson, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit. Lyft's new push comes as Uber is facing a lawsuit from Waymo over alleged theft of trade secrets relating to self-driving technology designs. Lyft in April raised $600 million in new funding. The company has begun preparations for an initial public offering, sources close to the company told Reuters.

Frontier Airlines was fined $400,000 for violating oversales and disability rules, American Airlines $250,000 for failing to make timely refunds to passengers, and Delta Air Lines $200,000 for filing inaccurate baggage reports, the department said in a statement. Delta failed to properly report all baggage claims from 2012 through 2015 and told the Transportation Department that if it had reported all claims it would have likely fallen from fourth to fifth in rankings among carriers for fewest baggage claims in 2012 and 2013. Delta said in a statement it was notified last year its damaged bag policy was not compliant with the department’s published guidelines and it immediately updated its policy. Frontier  failed to seek volunteers before bumping passengers involuntarily, failed to provide bumped passengers the required written notice describing their rights, and failed to provide proper compensation to passengers in a timely manner  the Transportation Department said. It reviewed more than 200 complaints.  Frontier remains committed to complying with DOT rules,  the airline said in a statement, adding it updated procedures  that were not effective  and  taken steps including, introducing a new reporting system.  It must also  add a new quality assurance management position by Sept. 1. American Airlines failed to process a  significant number  of refunds in a timely fashion in 2015, the department said. The company said Friday it  is committed to providing timely refunds to our customers.  American said it  took proactive steps to address refund delays some customers experienced in 2015 due to a systems integration issue after the merger with US Airways, including investments to improve processing times.  Airline bumping practices have drawn more scrutiny following video of a passenger being dragged off a United Airlines flight in April. This and other incidents have been broadcast on social media, prompting congressional hearings with airline executives that raised questions about customer service and airline cost-cutting. Southwest Airlines Co said in April it would end overbooking, while United announced policy changes, including boosting compensation for overbooked passengers to up to $10,000. Legislation unveiled in Congress in June would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. Another measure before Congress would require new rules for airlines promptly to refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive the service.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-airlines-fines-idUSL1N1KC1RD"},

Grupo Biotoscana SA, a Colombia-based pharmaceutical firm, and shareholders raised 1.34 billion reais ($426.7 million) in a Friday IPO. Three days earlier, the IPO of Brazil's biggest diversified retailer Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA fetched 5.12 billion reais. That marked the busiest week for local equity offerings since April 25, 2013, when the IPOs of insurer BB Seguridade Participações SA (BBSE3.SA) and loyalty program Smiles SA raised 12.6 billion reais. Brazilian stocks .BVSP and its currency BRBY have outperformed Latin American peers in recent weeks as President Michel Temer's plan to revamp labor regulations cleared Congress before its winter break, suggesting resilient lawmaker support for his reform agenda despite the nation's political crisis.  With the labor reform approved and Congress in recess, there's a window of opportunity for companies looking to seize on demand for Brazilian equities,  said one fund manager who participated in the Carrefour listing.   This week's successful transactions spell good news for reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and renewable power firm Omega Geração SA, whose shares are scheduled to debut on the São Paulo Stock Exchange in coming weeks. Extending the current wave of offerings hinges, at least in part, on Temer's ability to garner support for an ambitious pension code reform when Congress returns in August, bankers said. Bankers said companies seeking to tap local equity markets needed to balance risks and returns as Brazil slowly emerges from recession against the backdrop of escalating corruption allegations against Temer. Uncertainty has kept many foreign investors - traditionally the main buyers of Brazilian IPOs - on the sidelines.

The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business.  It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts. GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio.   It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything,  said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to  hold  after Friday's results. Related CoverageGE incoming CEO Flannery to update 2018 outlook in NovemberIncoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook.  Still, the stock could be in  in a state of limbo  until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. GE's cash flow was below expectations and also weighed on the stock, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones.  People want to get the answers sooner  to Flannery's review.

GE faced a  slow-growth, volatile environment  in the quarter, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in his final earnings release before his Aug. 1 retirement. Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009. Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom (ALSO.PA), merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston. Flannery said he is  in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses.  He also is  taking a hard look at our corporate spending  to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors. GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will  meet or exceed  its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management. GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division.  Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue. Net profit slumped 59 percent to $1.34 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $3.30 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings fell 45 percent to 28 cents a share, compared with estimates for 25 cents.

Grupo Biotoscana SA, a Colombia-based pharmaceutical firm, and shareholders raised 1.34 billion reais ($426.7 million) in a Friday IPO. Three days earlier, the IPO of Brazil's biggest diversified retailer Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA fetched 5.12 billion reais. That marked the busiest week for local equity offerings since April 25, 2013, when the IPOs of insurer BB Seguridade Participações SA (BBSE3.SA) and loyalty program Smiles SA raised 12.6 billion reais. Brazilian stocks .BVSP and its currency BRBY have outperformed Latin American peers in recent weeks as President Michel Temer's plan to revamp labor regulations cleared Congress before its winter break, suggesting resilient lawmaker support for his reform agenda despite the nation's political crisis.  With the labor reform approved and Congress in recess, there's a window of opportunity for companies looking to seize on demand for Brazilian equities,  said one fund manager who participated in the Carrefour listing.   This week's successful transactions spell good news for reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and renewable power firm Omega Geração SA, whose shares are scheduled to debut on the São Paulo Stock Exchange in coming weeks. Extending the current wave of offerings hinges, at least in part, on Temer's ability to garner support for an ambitious pension code reform when Congress returns in August, bankers said. Bankers said companies seeking to tap local equity markets needed to balance risks and returns as Brazil slowly emerges from recession against the backdrop of escalating corruption allegations against Temer.

It was designated in 2000 by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Colorado's Republican U.S. senator, Cory Gardner, and Republican U.S. Representative Scott Tipton, whose congressional district includes the monument, both applauded Zinke's decision. President Donald Trump ordered the Interior Department in April to evaluate 27 national monuments created since 1996 with an eye toward rescinding or shrinking some of them, part of an effort to open more public lands to mining, oil and gas drilling and other development. A final report on the national monument review is expected in August.          The review also fits in with a larger Trump initiative to reverse many of the environmental protections implemented by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, that Trump, a Republican, has criticized as hobbling economic growth. All 27 monuments were designated by executive decree under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which gives presidents authority to preserve federal lands of natural, cultural or scientific significance without congressional action.

Bitcoin's miners have signaled their support for the so-called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91, avoiding a split of bitcoin into two blockchains. The miners represent a network of computer operators who secure the blockchain or a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions BIP 91 is the first step toward a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin through a software called SegWit2x. On Friday, the support for BIP 91 reached nearly 100 percent, exceeding the required threshold of 80 percent, according to analysts and market participants.  Some investors have warmed to bitcoin, wooed by its explosive performance and potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a means to store value. Demand for bitcoin has grown in eight years to a market capitalization of more than $40 billion.  But fears about the bitcoin split dampened demand for bitcoin in recent weeks. After hitting record high near $3,000, bitcoin dropped as low $1,830 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. On Friday, it traded at $2,647. The software upgrade attempts to address the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.  BIP 91 unleashes the next wave of innovation because it has been a little bit stagnant of late for bitcoin,  said Rob Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a digital coin focused on privacy and security. Before BIP 91's endorsement, some bitcoin investors feared it could split into two independent currencies because core developers of the network and the miners each wanted different ways to increase bitcoin's scale. A compromise between the two groups has been reached through SegWit2x.    Bitcoin now has a clear run to add features that allow for faster transactions with lower costs,  said Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare. The upgrade to bitcoin's network will not occur until autumn, said Viglione, because several things need to happen before the new software is activated. Market participants have complained about the delay in transactions.  Analysts say a single bitcoin transaction costs on average 83 U.S. cents to execute, which means micropayments are not feasible on the network.

More than half the revenue of top European firms is generated outside the euro zone, according to Thomson Reuters data, meaning a strengthening euro has an adverse impact on those revenues once they are brought home. As European earnings season kicks off in earnest over the coming week, the extent to which the euro's rise is hurting companies that get revenue outside the euro zone will be a key area of focus for investors. (To view a graphic on European profits vs the trade-weighted euro, click reut.rs/2uhsufd) 2/ Vix View Skewed To judge by the CBOE's Volatility Index, investors are not too concerned about a major pullback in world stocks. The VIX  fear gauge  this week closed below 10 for a record-breaking five consecutive days. However, as Wells Fargo Asset Management highlighted in a note, the CBOE SKEW index is pretty high in historical terms, indicating investors are buying protection against a fall in the S&P; 500, so they may be fearful of bigger drops. (For a graphic on VIX  fear gauge  at record lows but skew betrays investor worries, click reut.rs/2vFKwWc) 3/ the Fed and the Spread The U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on July 26 is, by market metrics, a foregone conclusion: no change to the target fed funds rate of 1-1.25 percent. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, prospects for another rate increase don't come within range until the Fed's mid-December meeting and even then the chances are still less than 2 to 1. With no news conference following the coming week's decision, ferreting out whether the optimism expressed by Chair Janet Yellen on June 14 on the U.S. economy remains intact will be harder. The flattening of the yield curve between 2- and 10-year notes signals investors see less optimism and slower economic growth ahead. The spread, at less than 100 basis points, is just about a dozen bps from its narrowest in 10 years. Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital, says U.S. economic activity outside of the labor market is not falling apart, but the bloom is certainly off the rose when it comes to growth. The dollar index's near 8 percent drop indicates disappointment in the lack of economic stimulus from Washington and the prospects of tighter monetary conditions, albeit slowly, in the euro zone. (For a graphic on Fed Funds Rate, 2-10 Yr Treasury Spread, and the U.S. dollar index, click reut.rs/2tuC1jX) 4/ Japan's Conundrum The Bank of Japan has again pushed back the timing for when it expects to reach its inflation target. New inflation and unemployment readings are due in the coming week and will remind the BOJ of its difficulties it faces. On some measures, Japan's labor market has been the tightest since the 1970s, but prices are not budging. Tracking data over the past half century suggests inflation picks up when unemployment approaches 2 percent. The modern economy has higher labor participation and more temporary contracts, mind you, but that does little to resolve the BOJ's conundrum. (For a graphic on Japan unemployment and inflation, click reut.rs/2tsU22b) 5/ if You've Got It... Cash-rich European companies are showing the strongest year-on-year growth in capital spending plans in the world. This is the latest sign of renewed optimism in the region, which has benefited from a return of investor flows, spurred by a rebound in growth and a brighter outlook for company earnings. Consequently capex plans are set to be closely watched by investors as the earnings season gets under way next week.

{"news_time":"2017-07-21 18:46:00","news_title":"Small-cap rally could shrink on earnings, tax reform hurdles","keywords":"United States,Dan Suzuki,David Aurelio,Donald Trump,Lori Calvasina,Steven DeSanctis,Russell,Russell 2000,US,USA,STOCKS,WEEKAHEAD,Americas,Major News,Graphics,Equities Markets,Market Reports,Reports,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism is souring around small-cap stocks for some investors, with a host of factors conspiring to up-end gains that have taken them to record highs. Small-caps, which led the market's rally just after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, are facing weak earnings forecasts, little progress on tax reform and recent outflows.  We have downside risk here. Earnings numbers aren't great, and valuations are ... pretty rich,  said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies.  Investors had expected the administration of Republican Trump, with his promises of aggressive tax cuts and a healthier U.S. economy, would be a boon for small-caps, which tend to be more domestically focused. Republicans so far have been unable to push through bills to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the first leg of the Trump agenda. That has raised doubts about the likelihood of any tax reform this year. Small-caps have higher effective tax rates - about 32 percent versus 26 percent for large-caps, a note from Nuveen Asset Management showed. The performance of both the Russell 2000 , a widely used gauge for small-caps, and the small-cap S&P; 600 .SPCY has lagged that of large-caps so far this year, but the Russell is up 20.3 percent since the election compared with a gain of 15.3 percent for the S&P; 500 .SPX. Related CoverageTake Five: World market themes for the week aheadAll three indexes hit record highs in recent sessions, just as the earnings reporting period was getting under way. But analysts estimate earnings for S&P; 600 companies declined 8.3 percent in the second quarter, dragged down by projected drops in consumer discretionary, energy and health care results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue is expected to have risen slightly in the quarter. Among consumer companies, weakness in apparel, accessories and luxury goods and other retailers is expected to have hurt results, said David Aurelio, Thomson Reuters senior research analyst. In the small-cap energy sector, services and equipment companies continue to be affected by project cutbacks by larger companies. The small-cap outlook is in contrast to expectations for another quarter of strong profit growth for the S&P; 500 and a sharp year-over-year jump in large-cap energy.  Small-cap earnings growth has been trailing large-caps for the last four years, and that continues to be the case in the first half of this year,  said Dan Suzuki, senior U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. That does not bode well for valuation metrics for small-caps, which the bank calls  the most expensive segment of an expensive market.  The Russell 2000 is trading at about 26 times forward earnings as per Thomson Reuters Datastream data, above a median of about 21. The S&P; 500 trades at about 17.3 times, also above its median. While analysts expect small-cap earnings to rebound in the second half of the year, some strategists said those lofty expectations are not likely to hold since U.S. economic growth remains sluggish. Large-caps have benefited from recent weakness in the U.S. dollar .DXY, which makes foreign currency earnings for U.S. companies worth more in dollars.  This may explain why mid- and large-caps have seen a stronger bounce in earnings revisions than small-caps recently,  Lori Calvasina, Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a research note. Recent fund data also shows a weakening trend. According to Lipper, U.S.-based small-cap funds have recorded five straight weeks of withdrawals. At the same time, technical momentum indicators are trailing the Russell 2000's recent push to new highs, a possible warning that its foray into record territory is on less than firm footing.  We're in a longer period of underperformance,  Suzuki said.

Damache was indicted in 2011 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of attempted identity theft to facilitate an act of international terrorism.     Damache is believed to have conspired with Colleen LaRose, a Pennsylvania woman known as Jihad Jane, to recruit people to carry out terror attacks in Europe and Asia.  In 2011 LaRose pleaded guilty in a U.S. court of conspiring with Damache to try to kill Swedish artist Lars Vilks, whose depiction of the Prophet Mohammed with a dog's body sparked Muslim protests. The transfer of Damache to U.S. federal court represents the first time President Donald Trump's administration has brought a foreign terror suspect to face trial in the United States. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a radio interview that he would advise Trump to send newly captured terrorism suspects to prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba rather than to a civilian court to be prosecuted by the Justice Department. Justice Department officials declined to say why the government had decided to bring Damache to the United States rather than to Guantanamo. A spokesman, Ian Prior, said only that the United States has  consistently used the extradition process to obtain indicted fugitives who are overseas, so that they can stand trial in our federal courts.  David Cole, national legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said his organization welcomed the announcement.  Prosecuting terrorism cases in federal courts is the right thing to do,  he said in a statement.  We have long argued that our courts can handle terrorism cases, and they have a record of doing just that.  Damache, an Algerian also known by the online username Black Flag, was arrested in 2010 in Ireland, where he had lived for a decade. He was released after an Irish judge rejected a U.S. request to extradite him and arrested again in Spain in 2015.

Bitcoin's miners have signaled their support for the so-called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91, avoiding a split of bitcoin into two blockchains. The miners represent a network of computer operators who secure the blockchain or a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions BIP 91 is the first step toward a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin through a software called SegWit2x. On Friday, the support for BIP 91 reached nearly 100 percent, exceeding the required threshold of 80 percent, according to analysts and market participants.  Some investors have warmed to bitcoin, wooed by its explosive performance and potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a means to store value. Demand for bitcoin has grown in eight years to a market capitalization of more than $40 billion.  But fears about the bitcoin split dampened demand for bitcoin in recent weeks. After hitting record high near $3,000, bitcoin dropped as low $1,830 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. On Friday, it traded at $2,647. The software upgrade attempts to address the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.  BIP 91 unleashes the next wave of innovation because it has been a little bit stagnant of late for bitcoin,  said Rob Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a digital coin focused on privacy and security. Before BIP 91's endorsement, some bitcoin investors feared it could split into two independent currencies because core developers of the network and the miners each wanted different ways to increase bitcoin's scale. A compromise between the two groups has been reached through SegWit2x.    Bitcoin now has a clear run to add features that allow for faster transactions with lower costs,  said Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare. The upgrade to bitcoin's network will not occur until autumn, said Viglione, because several things need to happen before the new software is activated. Market participants have complained about the delay in transactions.  Analysts say a single bitcoin transaction costs on average 83 U.S. cents to execute, which means micropayments are not feasible on the network. The network is also limited to roughly seven transactions per second. In comparison, Visa on average handles 2,000 transactions per second.

The regulators, who comprise the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and MetLife both asked earlier this month for another pause in the long-running case in which the country's largest life insurer has challenged the federal government's decision to label it as  too big to fail.  The appeals court has not yet said whether it will grant an abeyance. More than a year ago, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the council's designation of MetLife as  systemically important,  which signifies that it could devastate the financial system if it failed and which triggers stricter oversight. Collyer said the label was  arbitrary and capricious.  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama immediately appealed. Republican President Donald Trump, however, has expressed skepticism about the designation process, and the FSOC has ordered the Treasury Department to review both. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the council, also has said its work should be evaluated. Both sides of the lawsuit have said the appeals court should put the case on pause until Mnuchin finishes his review. In May, the court granted a 60-day abeyance, which expired this month. Only two other insurers - Prudential Insurance (PRU.N) and American International Group (AIG.N) - still carry the  systemically important  label. According to the Treasury notice, the council will also receive an update on the designation of one of the insurance companies and discuss Mnuchin's recent recommendations to change a rule on proprietary trading, commonly called the Volcker Rule, in next week's executive session. In a June report Mnuchin suggested easing up on the Volcker rule, which restricts banks' ability to place speculative market bets. On Friday, banking regulators said they would review how the rule is being carried out to ensure that foreign funds are properly exempted.

(Reuters) - A U.S. decision to halt a CIA program equipping and training certain rebel groups fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was not done as a concession to Assad ally Russia, a top U.S. general said on Friday. Earlier this week a U.S. official said the decision was part of an effort by the Trump administration to improve relations with Russia, which along with Iranian-supported groups has largely succeeded in preserving Assad's government in the six-year-long civil war.  It was, I think, based on an assessment on the nature of the program, what we're trying to accomplish, the viability of it going forward,  U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of the Special Operations Command, told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. The decision was  absolutely not a sop to the Russians,  Thomas said.  Thomas, offering the first on-the-record commentary on the matter by a U.S. official, described it as a  tough, tough decision.  He noted some critics thought the rebels had no chance of removing Assad from power. Related CoverageU.S. general told Syria's YPG: 'You have got to change your brand'The CIA program began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then-President Barack Obama to oust Assad, but produced little success. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo ended the program after consulting with lower ranking officials and before Trump's July 7 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany, officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. It was not part of U.S.-Russian negotiations on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, the officials said. A downside of the CIA program was that some armed and trained rebels defected to Islamic State and other radical groups, and some members of the previous administration favored abandoning the program. Thomas also acknowledged criticism that the program might not have been strong enough, but stopped short of doing so himself.   Before assuming office in January, Trump suggested he could end support for Free Syrian Army groups and give priority to the fight against Islamic State. Thomas is closely tied to a separate effort by the U.S. military to train, arm and support other Syrian fighters battling Islamic State in Syria. U.S. special operations and other conventional forces are advising Kurdish YPG militia and other rebels fighting to  retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State. The U.S. is carrying out daily air strikes to help the advance. Thomas said the U.S. military has come close to killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in recent years. In at least one case, he blamed a media leak for ruining a promising lead.  There were points in time when we were particularly close to him,  the general said.

(Reuters) - One of America's most senior generals said on Friday he instructed the Kurdish YPG militia to change its  brand  a day or so before it unveiled an alliance with Syrian Arabs in 2015 under the name Syrian Democratic Forces. The recounting by U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, the head of Special Operations Command, offered a glimpse into the mechanics that preceded a major rampup in U.S. support to the Kurdish fighters despite fierce opposition from NATO ally Turkey. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of PKK militants waging an insurgency on Turkish soil, and has sharply criticized U.S. support to the group, which has increased over time. Thomas said he made the Turkish concerns known to the YPG back in 2015.  We literally played back to them: 'You have got to change your brand. What do you want to call yourselves besides the YPG?' With about a day's notice they declared that they are the Syrian Democratic Forces.    I thought it was a stroke of brilliance to put democracy in there somewhere. But it gave them a little bit of credibility.  Thomas was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, an annual conference bringing together government and military national security leaders and experts. Thomas then described the evolution of the group, which suffered heavy losses in early battles against Islamic State but kept fighting and growing in strength and numbers under the SDF banner.  Tensions between the YPG and Turkey have persisted, in turn  straining ties between Washington and Ankara. Turkey has sought assurances from the United States that arms being provided to defeat Islamic State militants will not later be turned against Turkey. The YPG now controls vast stretches of land along the border northeast of Aleppo and a pocket of territory to its northwest.   In between, Turkish-backed factions have taken over territory to keep Kurdish forces from linking up. Earlier this month, the head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a  declaration of war.   Turkish-backed rebels clashed with Kurdish fighters on Monday around the village of Ain Daqna and the nearby Menagh air base north of Aleppo. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last month left open the possibility of longer-term assistance to Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, saying the United States may need to supply them weapons and equipment even after the capture of Islamic State's Syria stronghold of Raqqa. Thomas also acknowledged that possibility. But he said perceived links between YPG and PKK create problems.  They got to work on their own branding. If they continue to keep linkage to their past product - the PKK linkage, specifically - the relationship is fraught with challenges,  he said.

Only about 50 ocelots remain in the United States, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The sources said CBP officials had informed them CBP would rely on exemptions provided to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the Real ID Act, a law created on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, so they can start building the section of wall without waiting for the years-long environmental study. Environmental impact studies are generally required under federal law whenever a proposal is made to build on public lands, including national forests, wildlife refuges and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  The Real ID Act also allows the secretary of Homeland Security to exempt CBP from adhering to the Endangered Species Act, which the sources said would otherwise make the wall's construction inside the refuge impossible due to the presence of the ocelots. The sources asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz declined to comment on the sources' assertion directly. He said in emails to Reuters that plans for constructing the wall were still uncertain and that the wall's construction depended upon whether Congress authorizes Trump's proposed 2018 budget.  He added, however, that a government contractor has already begun testing soil samples on land near the refuge and that CBP got an official waiver for permission to do so.   CBP, like all other federal agencies, may rely on Categorical Exclusions to achieve NEPA compliance for routine agency activities, like the soil sampling, that have minimal to no environmental impact,  he said. Environmental studies are mandates under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Texas Observer first reported on July 14 that the CBP was testing soil in Santa Ana.  Congress is expected to take up the 2018 budget in September. The sources said CBP hopes to start building the wall before the end of 2017. The CBP's Acting Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said in testimony to Congress on June 13 the agency's activities building the wall would include  environmental planning.  Private industry advocates have said National Environmental Policy Act requirements for impact studies take too long. Mining industry executives want the Trump administration to help shorten the process.

Good profits for feedlots in June allowed them to buy more calves for fattening for sale to packing plants, said analysts.      They said an increasing number of cattle in parts of the northern Plains were entering feedyards as drought grips the  region.     On Monday, Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures        deferred contracts may open lower - largely based on  Friday's report on placement outcome, the analysts said.     USDA's report showed June placements at 1.770 million head, up from 1.525 million a year earlier and above the average forecast of 1.618 million. It was the most for the month since 1.95 million in 2006.     The government put the feedlot cattle supply as of July 1 at 10.821 million head, up 4.5 percent from 10.356 million a year ago. Analysts, on average, forecast a 2.9 percent gain.     USDA said the number of cattle sold to packers, or marketings, were up 4.0 percent in June from a year ago, to 1.989 million head.     Analysts had projected an increase of 4.7 percent from 1.912 million last year.     Worsening drought in the upper Plains resulted in more cattle taken off grazing land, contributing to larger-than-anticipated June placements, said U.S. Commodities analyst Don Roose.     He said ramped up beef demand was needed to compensate for increased cattle supplies ahead.     Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) director Jim Robb attributed June's cattle placement surge to feedlot profitability, which encouraged them to pull in more animals from a broad region of the country - including areas stricken by drought.     LMIC calculated that feedlots in June, on average, made a profit of $210 per steer sold to meat companies versus a roughly $80 loss a year earlier.     On Friday the government simultaneously issued the semi-annual cattle inventory report. It showed the July 1 U.S. cattle herd at 102.6 million head, up from 98.2 million two years ago.                  USDA did not publish the July 2016 cattle inventory data due to budgetary issues.     The report suggests the herd continues to expand, said Robb. He added that the second half of 2017 would be more critical than the first half, in terms of the rate of expansion, because of the drought and more heifers entering feedlots.

The versatile Norwegian, riding for the African-based Dimension Data team, was part of a nine-man lead group speeding towards a roundabout 2.5km from the finish line of the 222km trek from Embrun on stage 19. While seven of them veered left, the long way round, Boasson Hagen and Sunweb's German rider Nikias Arndt swerved to the right -- instantly catapulting themselves clear of their pursuers. Boasson Hagen, a class act who won two stages for Team Sky in 2011 but who had suffered torment this year with two runners-up finishes and two third places, then outclassed Arndt to take the victory by a comfortable five seconds.

Britain's Froome now looks almost certain to stand on the Paris podium in the yellow jersey for the third year in a row after suffering no mishaps on a hot and sweaty 222km ride out of the Alps into Provence. The 32-year-old maintained his 23-second lead over Romain Bardet ahead of Saturday's penultimate stage -- a time trial around the streets of the port city of Marseille. While Froome just wanted a relatively relaxing day in the saddle on what was this year's longest stage featuring three categorized climbs, Norway's Boasson Hagen had a score to settle -- aiming to rid himself of the unwanted 'nearly-man' jersey. The versatile rider had finished runner-up in two stages and third in two more this year.

Slideshow (2 Images)Sky's white train followed sport director Nicolas Portal's brief to the tee, allowing the escapees 10 minutes grace to avoid what could have been a risky massed bunch finish. Barring a crash in Marseille, where Froome will be a favorite, he will claim a fourth Tour title in five years. However, he is still not relaxing.  It's still all to race for, there's still only 30 seconds between the top three,  Froome said.  It had been full gas for two days in the Alps so grateful it was a less crazy stage today and we could sit on the wheels a bit and recover some energy ahead of tomorrow's time trial.

Damache was indicted in 2011 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of attempted identity theft to facilitate an act of international terrorism. Damache is believed to have conspired with Colleen LaRose, a Pennsylvania woman known as Jihad Jane, to recruit people to carry out terror attacks in Europe and Asia. In 2011 LaRose pleaded guilty in a U.S. court of conspiring with Damache to try to kill Swedish artist Lars Vilks, whose depiction of the Prophet Mohammed with a dog's body sparked Muslim protests. The transfer of Damache to U.S. federal court represents the first time President Donald Trump's administration has brought a foreign terror suspect to face trial in the United States. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a radio interview that he would advise Trump to send newly captured terrorism suspects to prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba rather than to a civilian court to be prosecuted by the Justice Department. Justice Department officials were not immediately available to comment on why Damache had been brought to the United States for prosecution. David Cole, national legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said his organization welcomed the announcement.  Prosecuting terrorism cases in federal courts is the right thing to do,  he said in a statement.  We have long argued that our courts can handle terrorism cases, and they have a record of doing just that.

The quota will increase gradually to reach 42,000 in the fourth year, representing a $700 million market.  We will no longer have to pay tariffs so our cars can enter the Colombian market. More industry and more jobs for Argentina,  Production Minister Francisco Cabrera said on Twitter on Friday. On Friday, Colombia's Trade, Industry and Tourism Ministry said in a statement that Colombia could export 42,000 vehicles tariff-free to Argentina and up to 50,000 to Brazil. It added that the deal will allow it to send 31,000 tonnes of tariff-free agrochemicals to Argentina, representing some $434 million. Mercosur is also looking to ink a trade deal with the European Union and increase trade links with the Pacific Alliance, which includes Colombia as well as Chile, Mexico and Peru.

While widely seen as symbolic, the move raises the specter of the development of a parallel state. The top court has warned that the naming of the alternate judges is illegal, and they could be jailed.  Undeterred, opposition lawmakers swore in the 13 new judges and 20 substitute judges in a public plaza to combat what they say is oil-rich Venezuela's slide into dictatorship under Maduro.  We're not backing down, Venezuela will have a Supreme Court of Justice and institutions at the service of the people and not at the service of whatever government is in power,  said opposition legislator Carlos Berrizbeitia during the ceremony, where the appointed justices were applauded and cheered on with shouts of  Bravo!       Critics hold that the current Supreme Court justices were named illegally by the ruling Socialist Party and rushed in before the opposition took over the legislature in January 2016.  They're pirate magistrates named on the fly,  said opposition legislator Juan Requesens in a video streamed live on the Periscope service, which the opposition often uses given limited coverage of their activities on local television channels.  Related CoverageMercosur urges end to violence in Venezuela's 'humanitarian crisis'In a statement broadcast on state television later on Friday, the Supreme Court blasted the alternative judges who were named by the legislature.   They're undertaking crimes against the independence and security of the nation, in particular, in terms of crimes of treason and against the powers of the nation and states,  said Juan Jose Mendoza, the president of the top court's constitutional chamber.

Rather, the move was part of the opposition coalition campaign to pressure unpopular Maduro to hold a presidential election and abandon a new congress they fear would cement dictatorship. It followed nearly four months of violent street protests, an unofficial plebiscite against him last weekend and a national strike on Thursday. Around 100 people have died in unrest that kicked off in early April, thousands have been arrested, and hundreds injured.  Slideshow (14 Images)Two young men and one teenage boy died in disturbances related to Thursday's strike, according to authorities. Over 360 people were arrested across the country on Thursday, according to the rights group Penal Forum. Venezuela's second-largest city, Maracaibo, suffered looting and fires during the stoppage, according to local reports that have not been confirmed by authorities.  The opposition is vying to stop Maduro's plan to on July 30 create a controversial super-legislature with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions.  Maduro faces widespread pressure from abroad to abort the assembly, including from U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Monday he would take  strong and swift economic actions  if the Venezuelan leader went ahead with his plans. Regional pressure is also rising. South America's Mercosur trade bloc called for an end to violence in Venezuela in a joint statement on Friday. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay called on Venezuela to release political prisoners and offered to facilitate talks between Maduro and the opposition.

Nury Chavarria, who moved to the United States in 1993 to seek asylum from political turmoil and violence at home, had been ordered by immigration officials to leave for Guatemala by Thursday, said Sidd Sinha, an attorney at Formica Williams, the New Haven, Connecticut law firm representing her, by phone on Friday. Instead the 43-year-old housekeeper took sanctuary at Iglesia De Dios Pentecostal in New Haven. Churches have historically offered sanctuary to refugees, making them immune from arrest. While that no longer has legal effect, the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement spokesman Khaalid Walls said in a statement on Friday that the agency avoids making arrests at  sensitive locations  such as places of worship, schools and hospitals without prior approval from a supervisor.  We have opened the doors of our congregation to serve Ms. Chavarria as a sanctuary church,  Pastor Héctor Otero of the church said at a press conference on Thursday. Chavarria is a single mother of four U.S.-born children aged 9 to 21, who have birthright citizenship. Her eldest has cerebral palsy. Chavarria was allowed to voluntarily depart after a review of her case in 1998, but has stayed on illegally since 1999, Walls said. She has been granted stays of removal on humanitarian grounds as she has raised her children. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, who met with Chavarria at the church on Thursday, tweeted on Friday,  #NuryChavarria is a mother and has no criminal record. She is welcome in our state.  New Haven is one of hundreds of U.S. cities, counties and states that have declared themselves sanctuaries that refuse to cooperate with Trump's efforts to deport millions of immigrants. In the first months after his election in November, arrests have risen, but actual deportations have fallen by 12 percent compared with the same period under President Barack Obama. The two Democratic U.S. senators representing Connecticut, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, have written letters to Immigration Customs Enforcement urging a review of Chavarria's latest application for a stay of removal. At a press conference on Friday at the church where Chavarria was staying, Blumenthal called her situation  a symptom of Trump's cold and callous immigration policies that lack all sense of reason and rationality.  New York immigration attorney Glen Raj said by phone that U.S. immigration agencies are very rarely persuaded by communities and state governments to revoke a deportation order.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/connecticut-immigration-idUSL1N1KC1P5"},

The FTC is probing a complaint brought by the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which looked at some 1,000 products on Amazon's website in June and found that Amazon put reference prices, or list prices, on about 46 percent of them. An analysis found that in 61 percent of products with reference prices, Amazon's reference prices were higher than it had sold the same product in the previous 90 days, Consumer Watchdog said in a letter to the FTC dated July 6. Following receipt of the letter, the agency made informal inquiries about the allegations, according to a source who spoke on background to preserve business relationships.  Related CoverageAmazon spent $3.2 million in second quarter on Washington lobbying effortThe FTC declined comment for this story. It was not known if the agency would open a formal probe into the allegations. Amazon closed up slightly for the day at $1,028.70. Amazon said in a statement that Consumer Watchdog's study was  deeply flawed.  The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol The conclusions the Consumer Watchdog group reached are flat out wrong,  Amazon said.  We validate the reference prices provided by manufacturers, vendors and sellers against actual prices recently found across Amazon and other retailers.  The review of Amazon's discount pricing is an indication the FTC is taking a serious look at the e-commerce company's agreement to buy Whole Foods, a deal that critics say could give Amazon an unfair advantage.   Consumer Watchdog argued that the deceptive list prices make Amazon prices look like a bargain, and asked the FTC to stop Amazon from buying Whole Foods while the deceptive discounting is occurring.  The FTC plays a dual role of probing charges of deceptive advertising and assessing mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law. Amazon said in June that it would buy the premium grocer for $13.7 billion. The FTC's  Guide Against Deceptive Pricing  warns against using a  fictitious  or  inflated  list price for the purpose of making the price charged look like a bargain. Amazon settled similar allegations with Canada's Competition Bureau in January. It paid a fine of C$1 million ($756,658.60) as part of the settlement. Amazon ran afoul of the FTC in 2014 for making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as  Pet Shop Story  and  Ice Age Village  on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. It has been ordered to reimburse parents for the charges.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized a  Geographical Travel Restriction  on Americans to forbid them from entering North Korea, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.  Once in effect, U.S. passports will be invalid for travel to, through and in North Korea, and individuals will be required to obtain a passport with a special validation in order to travel to or within North Korea,  Nauert said. The move was due to  mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement,  she said. Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American was sentenced last year to 15 years hard labor in North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda sign while on a tourist visit. He returned to the United States in a coma on June 13 after being released on humanitarian grounds and died June 19.  The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. North Korea has said through its state media that Warmbier's death was  a mystery  and dismissed accusations that he had died as a result of torture and beating in captivity. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, a Canadian pastor and three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work. Japan says North Korea has also detained at least several dozen of its nationals. It was not known how many Americans were currently in North Korea and the State Department said it was not its practice to give numbers of U.S. citizens living in or travelling to a particular country. U.S. officials say North Korea will become the only country in the world Americans are banned from visiting. The department said it plans to publish a notice in the Federal Register next week, starting a 30-day clock before the restriction takes effect, Nauert said.

North Korea allows foreign tourists to visit but their travel is strictly limited. Hundreds of Americans are among the roughly 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea each year, according to U.S. Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina. This year, Wilson introduced a bill with Democratic Representative Adam Schiff to ban Americans from travelling to North Korea as tourists, following the detention of at least 17 U.S. citizens in the past decade. FILE PHOTO: A guide wearing a traditional dress speaks to visitors at the Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, North Korea May 4, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoAnthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former U.S. Treasury official, said the State Department action was important as it would limit North Korea's ability to use detained Americans as bargaining chips with Washington as it has in the past. Tom Bodkin, managing director of the UK-based adventure travel company, Secret Compass, said the travel ban was  a bit of a shame.   Travel between different cultures breaks down the preconceptions that you have about different cultures and breaks down the stereotypes that you have,  he said.  Secret Compass has brought three Americans among the 19 people it took to North Korea since launching tours there last fall, he said. U.S. Army veteran Brian Sayler, 40, who traveled to North Korea for six days in May, said he opposed the pending ban.  “We’re telling our own people, essentially, you can’t go where you want to go, I don’t really understand it,” said Sayler, a resident of West Pittston, Pennsylvania, who works as a police officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs. North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead. North Korea this month test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts believe has the range to reach  Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

The Congressional Budget Office said last month that Congress would need to raise the debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid a default. Investors are concerned that efforts to raise the debt ceiling will come down to the wire as disagreements among Republicans on healthcare legislation show a lack of consensus among lawmakers.  I think that the healthcare bill is the catalyst for it this week,  said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. “You can see a very significant discount for October bills.  Discord over healthcare is also pushing back budget negotiations with legislators due to take recess in August, which will delay activity until they return in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly urged lawmakers to act soon on raising the debt ceiling, and not to hold it hostage to other issues. But some influential congressional Republicans, including Representative Bill Huizenga, argue the debt ceiling should not be segregated from the wider debate about overall government spending.   Congressman Huizenga wants to see forward progress on spending reforms,  his office said in a statement.  With Republicans in control of all three levers of government that influence the process, we should take every opportunity, including the debt ceiling, to rein in and prioritize federal spending.  Yields on three-month Treasury bills US3MT=RR, which are due to mature on Oct. 19, rose to 1.16 percent on Friday, near the highest levels since October 2008, and more than the 1.10 percent yields paid on six-month debt US6MT=RR. Longer-dated debt normally pays higher returns than shorter-dated bills, with an inversion in the yield curve reflecting that investors are concerned with being repaid in October. The three-month yields saw their largest weekly increase since March 3 on Friday, having jumped from 1.03 percent on July 14. Investors may also be avoiding October maturities due to the early notice that it is the most likely month that the government will run out of funds. “I think the main reason the market’s starting to price in some debt ceiling risk is that we don’t normally have a fairly accurate estimate of the ‘X date’ this far out,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. The early October timeframe has extra credence as large federal outlays are due on Oct. 2, Goldberg said. Funding markets are not yet reflecting concern about the debt limit as a large portion of the market is overnight loans, though if no resolution is reached by October that is likely to change. When negotiations over raising the debt ceiling came down to the wire in October 2013 investors pulled cash from the repo market on concern about receiving debt maturing that month as collateral, adding to pressure on bond yields.

In his first speech since four Arab countries severed ties with Doha, a defiant Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said life was continuing as normal despite what he described as an unjust  siege . Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties and imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and supporting terrorism, which the emir denied.  Qatar is fighting terrorism relentlessly and without compromise, and the international community recognises this,  Sheikh Tamim said in the televised speech. He spoke hours after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was satisfied with Qatar's efforts to implement an agreement aimed at combating terror financing, and urged the four states to lift their  land blockade . It also comes days before Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who had supported Qatar in the crisis, was due to visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to resolve the rift. Related CoverageQatar's emir says life normal in his country despite 'siege'Earlier this month during a round of shuttle diplomacy,  Tillerson signed a deal with Qatar to fight terrorism financing, part of efforts led by Kuwait to try to resolve the most serious rift in the Western-allied Gulf in decades. An official comment from the four Arab countries had yet to be issued, but a Saudi royal court advisor described it as a piece of literary work written by a school student.  Had it been written by a student in middle school he would have flunked,  Saud al-Qahtani wrote on his Twitter account. Commentators hosted by the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television also denounced the speech.  This is a speech of obstinacy which sends messages that Qatar will not stop supporting terrorism,  said Ali al-Naimi, editor of an online news website published in the UAE.  Previously Planned  Campaign  The crisis revolves around allegations that Qatar supports Islamist militant groups, including in Syria and Libya, and hosts members of the Muslim Brotherhood. It began after a speech in late May by Sheikh Tamim appeared on the state news agency's website, which Doha said he had never made and indicated the website had been hacked from one of its neighbours, indicating the UAE. The Washington Post, citing U.S. intelligence officials, last week reported that the United Arab Emirates had arranged for Qatari government social media and news sites to be hacked in order to post the fiery but false quotes. The UAE denied any involvement. Sheikh Tamim described the sanctions as a campaign that had been pre-planned against Qatar, calling it an act of aggression against Doha's foreign policy.  Its planners planted statements to mislead public opinion and the countries of the world,  he said. Sheikh Tamim vowed to withstand the sanctions and said he had instructed the Qatari government that Qataris should become more self-reliant and called for the economy to be opened up to foreign investments.  The time has come for us to spare the people from the political differences between the governments,  he said, urging dialogue.  ... Any solution must respect the sovereignty and will of each state.

(NYSE: AAT). A full list of Fitch's current ratings for AAT follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and Stable Outlook are based on AAT's credit strengths, which include a portfolio focus on high barrier-to-entry U.S. West Coast markets that Fitch expects will result in growing cash flow in excess of fixed charges. Other strengths include appropriate leverage for the 'BBB' rating achieved through organic de-levering, good unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt and a long management track record. While most REITs tend to eschew property type diversification, AAT has aggregated a portfolio of retail, office, multifamily and mixed use assets in markets that have historically demonstrated strong property-level fundamentals. Further, AAT's retail and office segments have outperformed the company's public office and retail REIT peers due to sustained demand for AAT's properties, combined with limited supply. Credit concerns include the company's exposure to below-investment grade and unrated tenants, including the largest retail tenant, Kmart, which represented 6.6% of retail rent and 2.8% of total rent in 1Q2017. High Barrier-to-Entry West Coast Focus: At March 31, 2017, AAT's portfolio included 104 retail buildings (11 properties) totalling 3.1 million square feet, 28 office buildings (seven properties) totaling 2.7 million square feet as well as 1,579 multifamily units (seven properties) and Waikiki Beach Walk, a retail/hotel mixed-use property in Honolulu. The company's core markets include Southern California (32% of 1Q2017 cash NOI), Hawaii (21%), Northern California (17%), Oregon (13%) and Washington (9%). Fitch has a more favorable view of companies that own properties in high-barrier-entry markets such as San Francisco than in other markets, due to consistently strong asset liquidity and leveragability. Growing Fixed Charge Coverage: Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the 2.5x to 3.0x range over the next several years as AAT continues to refinance higher coupon debt with lower cost unsecured notes. Other drivers of improving fixed charge coverage should be positive releasing spreads that should drive same-store NOI growth and the lease up of in-process development. Appropriate Leverage: AAT's leverage for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 was 5.8x, an improvement compared to 6.5x and 6.6x for the years ended Dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Fitch expects leverage to sustain around 6.0x over the next 12 to 24 months, primarily due to organic EBITDA growth and cash flow from development, as opposed to via de-levering equity offerings. This level is appropriate for the 'BBB' rating. In Fitch's stress case, leverage would be in the 6.5 to 7.0x range, which would be on the weaker end for a 'BBB' rating and could result in negative rating action. Reported metrics may be weaker due to the timing effects of acquisitions, dispositions and debt issuance. Transition to Unsecured Funding Profile: As of March 31, 2017, the company's implied value of unencumbered assets (defined as unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) covered net unsecured debt by 2.6x. Fitch projects that unencumbered asset coverage should remain in the 2.5x to 3.0x range through 2018, which is strong for the rating. A meaningful portion of the unencumbered properties (including Waikele) are subject to a tax protection agreement that may limit the company's willingness and/or ability to sell certain assets. As such, realizing value from these properties may be limited to the mortgage market. Long Management Track Record and Development Discipline: The company's CEO and Chairman founded the company's predecessor, American Assets, Inc. in 1967, and the company's Chief Financial Officer has been with the company and its predecessor since 1998. AAT has successfully overseen development and re-development projects over the past several years including the redevelopments of Del Monte Center in Monterrey and Carmel Mountain Plaza in San Diego, and the development of Waikiki Beach Walk in Honolulu. As of March 31, 2017, the development pipeline included one in-process development (the Torrey Point office project in San Diego, which took 17 years to obtain entitlements and permits for construction) and four pipeline projects. Cost-to-complete development totalled $21.6 million as of March 31, 2017, representing only 1% of undepreciated assets. Property Type Diversification: AAT's portfolio strategy runs counter to those of the largest REITs in all major sectors that have eschewed property type diversification in the name of specialization. The argument in favor of focused REITs is predicated on the view that specialization provides opportunities for operational outperformance and that optimal portfolio allocations and diversification can be achieved more efficiently at the shareholder's portfolio level. Significant Lease Expirations Through 2018: Including expiring leases and leases with tenant renewal options, AAT has approximately 30% of its annualized base rent expiring between now and the end of 2018 including over one third of its retail square footage. The majority of the 2017-2018 lease expirations are in the retail and office sectors, which historically have had renewal rates in the low 90% range and low 80% range, respectively, mitigating renewal risk. Exposure to Select Weak Credit Tenants: AAT is materially exposed to below investment grade rated and unrated tenants, and its largest tenant was salesforce.com, representing 7.9% of 1Q2017 annualized base rent. Salesforce.com has a growing presence in San Francisco, and Fitch expects it will to continue leasing at AAT's The Landmark at One Market with significant rent bumps on upcoming lease expirations. The largest retail tenant, Kmart Corporation (rated 'CC' by Fitch), represented 2.8% of total rent in 1Q2017, and the top 10 retail and office tenants represented 10.8% and 22.8% of annualized based rent, respectively. DERIVATION SUMMARY AAT's diversified portfolio across multiple property types leaves the company with no true peer. Federal Realty Investment Trust ('A-'/Outlook Stable) is a comparable given its development capability and its focus on both retail shopping centers and mixed use assets in coastal urban markets. Federal Realty's sector-leading SSNOI growth and leasing spreads, and demonstrated access to multiple forms of capital justify its higher rating. AAT's high barrier to entry markets and the company's development capabilities also lend comparison to a number of property sector focused REITs including Boston Properties ('BBB+'/Outlook Stable), and Regency Centers ('BBB+'/Outlook Stable), a nationwide owner and developer of high quality shopping centers; both of these companies have more developed capital structures and demonstrated capital access and are more diversified by geography, property and tenant base than AAT. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for AAT include: --3% same-store NOI growth through 2018; --G&A; to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --Development expenditures of approximately $30 million in 2017-2018 annually with development yields ranging from 6.75% to 8.75%; --No acquisitions or dispositions; --Secured debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds; --Recurring capital expenditures to remain around 20% of recurring operating EBITDA through 2018; --No equity issuance and an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 75% through 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or Rating Outlook: --Continued access to the unsecured debt markets, in particular execution of public unsecured debt offerings; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 5.5x for several quarters (leverage was 5.8x for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and Fitch expects it will sustain around 6.0x over the next 12 - 24 months); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.5x for several quarters. The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.5x for several quarters; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.0x for several quarters. LIQUIDITY AAT's organic liquidity is moderate as its AFFO payout ratio was 74.3% in 2016, compared to 73.8% in 2015 and 74.7% in 2014. This payout ratio is consistent with the broader equity REIT universe. Based on the current payout ratio, AAT retains approximately $20 million annually in organic liquidity. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates American Assets Trust as follows: American Assets Trust, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; American Assets Trust, L.P. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --$250 million unsecured credit facility 'BBB'; --$100 million unsecured term loan A 'BBB'; --$100 million unsecured term loan B 'BBB'; --$50 million unsecured term loan C 'BBB'; --$700 million unsecured notes 'BBB'; Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB' rating to AAT's $100 million, senior guaranteed notes, series F private placement due July 19, 2024.

The Congressional Budget Office said last month that Congress would need to raise the debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid a default. Investors are concerned that efforts to raise the debt ceiling will come down to the wire as disagreements among Republicans on healthcare legislation show a lack of consensus among lawmakers.  I think that the healthcare bill is the catalyst for it this week,  said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. “You can see a very significant discount for October bills.  Discord over healthcare is also pushing back budget negotiations with legislators due to take recess in August, which will delay activity until they return in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly urged lawmakers to act soon on raising the debt ceiling, and not to hold it hostage to other issues. But some influential congressional Republicans, including Representative Bill Huizenga, argue the debt ceiling should not be segregated from the wider debate about overall government spending.   Congressman Huizenga wants to see forward progress on spending reforms,  his office said in a statement.  With Republicans in control of all three levers of government that influence the process, we should take every opportunity, including the debt ceiling, to rein in and prioritize federal spending.  Yields on three-month Treasury bills US3MT=RR, which are due to mature on Oct. 19, rose to 1.16 percent on Friday, near the highest levels since October 2008, and more than the 1.10 percent yields paid on six-month debt US6MT=RR. Longer-dated debt normally pays higher returns than shorter-dated bills, with an inversion in the yield curve reflecting that investors are concerned with being repaid in October. The three-month yields saw their largest weekly increase since March 3 on Friday, having jumped from 1.03 percent on July 14. Investors may also be avoiding October maturities due to the early notice that it is the most likely month that the government will run out of funds. “I think the main reason the market’s starting to price in some debt ceiling risk is that we don’t normally have a fairly accurate estimate of the ‘X date’ this far out,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. The early October timeframe has extra credence as large federal outlays are due on Oct. 2, Goldberg said. Funding markets are not yet reflecting concern about the debt limit as a large portion of the market is overnight loans, though if no resolution is reached by October that is likely to change. When negotiations over raising the debt ceiling came down to the wire in October 2013 investors pulled cash from the repo market on concern about receiving debt maturing that month as collateral, adding to pressure on bond yields.

In his first speech since four Arab countries severed ties with Doha, a defiant Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said life was continuing as normal despite what he described as an unjust  siege . Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties and imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and supporting terrorism, which the emir denied.  Qatar is fighting terrorism relentlessly and without compromise, and the international community recognises this,  Sheikh Tamim said in the televised speech. He spoke hours after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was satisfied with Qatar's efforts to implement an agreement aimed at combating terror financing, and urged the four states to lift their  land blockade . It also comes days before Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who had supported Qatar in the crisis, was due to visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to resolve the rift. Related CoverageQatar's emir says life normal in his country despite 'siege'Earlier this month during a round of shuttle diplomacy,  Tillerson signed a deal with Qatar to fight terrorism financing, part of efforts led by Kuwait to try to resolve the most serious rift in the Western-allied Gulf in decades. An official comment from the four Arab countries had yet to be issued, but a Saudi royal court advisor described it as a piece of literary work written by a school student.  Had it been written by a student in middle school he would have flunked,  Saud al-Qahtani wrote on his Twitter account. Commentators hosted by the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television also denounced the speech.  This is a speech of obstinacy which sends messages that Qatar will not stop supporting terrorism,  said Ali al-Naimi, editor of an online news website published in the UAE.  Previously Planned  Campaign  The crisis revolves around allegations that Qatar supports Islamist militant groups, including in Syria and Libya, and hosts members of the Muslim Brotherhood. It began after a speech in late May by Sheikh Tamim appeared on the state news agency's website, which Doha said he had never made and indicated the website had been hacked from one of its neighbours, indicating the UAE. The Washington Post, citing U.S. intelligence officials, last week reported that the United Arab Emirates had arranged for Qatari government social media and news sites to be hacked in order to post the fiery but false quotes. The UAE denied any involvement. Sheikh Tamim described the sanctions as a campaign that had been pre-planned against Qatar, calling it an act of aggression against Doha's foreign policy.  Its planners planted statements to mislead public opinion and the countries of the world,  he said. Sheikh Tamim vowed to withstand the sanctions and said he had instructed the Qatari government that Qataris should become more self-reliant and called for the economy to be opened up to foreign investments.  The time has come for us to spare the people from the political differences between the governments,  he said, urging dialogue.  ... Any solution must respect the sovereignty and will of each state.

NETUSDALL=  This negative positioning reflects a change in sentiment surrounding the path of the dollar,  said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.  There has been quite a bit of uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy going forward, mainly because of the generally weaker economic performance, as well as high uncertainty regarding policy initiatives by the new administration,  she said. The greenback hit its lowest in more than a year against a basket of major rivals on Friday, a day after the European Central Bank's chief abstained from talking down the euro, while obstacles to U.S. President Donald Trump's policy agenda also weighed. .DXY Investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign are viewed as obstacles to the administration's pro-growth agenda and negative for the dollar.

Trump outside counsel John Dowd told my Reuters colleague Karen Freifeld that the Post's  stuff on pardons is nonsense,  Dowd said.  It's just a smear job on the president. It’s not true.”  That said, the Post story raises a couple of interesting questions. Can a U.S. president pardon himself prospectively? And if constitutional law allows a prospective self-pardon, what are the implications for ongoing investigations of the president's conduct?  Mueller is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Moscow has denied interference in the U.S. election, and President Trump has said his campaign did not collude.  The U.S. Constitution does not specifically prohibit presidents from pardoning themselves before they’re formally accused of wrongdoing (a person need not be charged to be pardoned). So if President Trump, who has not been implicated in wrongdoing, were to decide to grant himself a pass from any prospective prosecution, he would not be violating the letter of the Constitution.  But he would be stretching the bounds of presidential power as they’ve never been tested before – and, more importantly, legal experts told me, Trump probably would not be able to halt Justice Department and congressional investigations simply by pardoning himself and any allies known to be under scrutiny.  In fact, attempting to use pardons to obviate the special counsel investigation could backfire, said Walter Dellinger, who wrote about prospective presidential pardons as a top official in the Clinton Justice Department in 1995. Pardons themselves might raise questions about obstructing justice, Dellinger said. Prospective pardons would also remove Fifth Amendment obstacles to congressional testimony from those who received them, since you can't assert a right against self-incrimination if you aren't facing criminal consequences.  No court in the U.S. has ever had to decide whether a president has the authority to pardon himself because no president has ever done so. Before Trump, the only previous president known to have contemplated a pardon for himself was Richard Nixon as he faced possible obstruction of justice charges from the Watergate special prosecutor.  Nixon asked his Justice Department whether a self-pardon was legal. Justice lawyers issued a memo opinion in 1974 advising that it was not. The DOJ memo said that under the age-old legal maxim that no one can be the judge of his own case, even the president of the United States cannot pardon himself.  The 1974 Justice Department memo is the first, last and only official word on a U.S. president’s power to pardon himself, according to Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt, who has been thinking and writing about presidential self-pardons since he was a Yale Law student in the 1990s. The issue has simply never come before a U.S. court, even tangentially.  In fact, the mere discussion of the legality of presidential self-pardons leads to a rabbithole of unanswered hypotheticals, such as whether a sitting president can be indicted or prosecuted, said law professor Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas. It’s not clear, Levinson said, whether a special counsel could go to court to challenge a presidential self-pardon if the special counsel can’t prosecute the president while he’s in office. “It’s just a conundrum,” Levinson said.  Kalt, who has become a mini-celebrity since the Trump self-pardon news broke, told me that in the vacuum of precedent, both proponents and opponents of self-pardons have legitimate arguments. He said he believes the stronger argument is against the legality of presidents pardoning themselves. According to Kalt, the primary argument that presidents can pardon themselves is that the Constitution doesn't say they can't.  But three factors, he said, weigh against legality: the traditional meaning of the word pardon, which implies one person giving and another receiving; the legal principle against serving as one’s own judge, as cited in the Nixon memo; and the text of the U.S. Constitution.  Here’s why. Article II of the Constitution authorizes the president to “grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” That language, Kalt said, gives presidents immense power. We’ve seen presidents, for instance, issue pardons to people who haven’t been charged with any crime, most famously when President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon before Nixon was charged with obstructing justice. Presidents can also pardon people whose identities are unknown, as when President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to all Vietnam draft evaders.  But the words of the Constitution do not give the president unlimited pardon powers. Kalt looked back to James Madison’s notes from the 1787 Constitutional Convention and found that the framers discussed whether treason ought to be excluded from the president’s pardon powers in case the president were a traitor. The drafters, according to Kalt, concluded that if the president were a traitor, “he can be impeached and prosecuted” under the language they adopted.  Outside of that context, Kalt said in a May 2017 Foreign Policy analysis, self-pardons “never came up, which is a very telling omission in a discussion about criminal presidents abusing the pardon power,” he wrote. “It apparently went without saying — literally — that self-pardons are not possible.”  Constitutional language brings me to my second point. The pardons clause, as you probably noticed, explicitly says that presidents cannot grant pardons from “cases of impeachment.” That clause, said former Clinton Justice official Dellinger, could give special counsel Mueller a mandate to continue investigating the Trump campaign even if the president were legally entitled prospectively to pardon himself and everyone else under Mueller’s scrutiny for possible violations of federal criminal laws.  Dellinger drew an analogy to Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who did not charge President Bill Clinton with crimes but prepared a report that served as the basis for articles of impeachment against the president. “The pardon clause expressly does not apply to impeachment,” Dellinger said. “That’s the same reason Starr kept going.” (I can imagine the Trump team countering Dellinger's point with the argument that grand juries are convened to investigate crimes, not politics, and if the president has prospectively pardoned every potential target, the grand jury must be dismissed.)  If Trump were to pardon himself prospectively – and particularly if he were to attempt to use that pardon as a rationale to end Mueller’s investigation prematurely – the FBI and Congress could end up investigating whether the president’s motives, and the motives of Justice Department officials who implemented his orders, were proper.  “It would be obstruction of justice for any officials to order an end to the investigation for an improper purpose,” said Dellinger, who pointed out that FBI investigations like the Mueller probe have their own momentum and are very hard to shut down.  Moreover, said law professor Levinson, a presidential self-pardon is “irrelevant” to congressional investigators. The Senate Intelligence Committee, he said, seems to be engaged in a serious attempt to find out whether Russia influenced the 2016 election. The committee has a right to demand the same records Mueller is looking at, he said.  And if the president issues blanket prospective pardons, including one for himself, Levinson predicted that “the political pressure will become unbearable.”  Presidential pardons do not carry an implication of guilt. Presidents have exonerated people who steadfastly maintained their innocence even as they accepted the pardon. If President Trump were to pardon himself, he’d be conceding nothing about his criminal liability in the Russia investigation.  But given the questionable legality of the maneuver and the likelihood that probes would continue and even intensify, it’s hard to see what a self-pardon would accomplish for the president. Trump has obviously broken political norms at a dizzying rate. The convention against pardoning himself is one he should think hard about leaving intact.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-selfpardon-idUSKBN1A62PR"},

Nury Chavarria, who moved to the United States in 1993 to seek asylum from political turmoil and violence at home, had been ordered by immigration officials to leave for Guatemala by Thursday, said Sidd Sinha, an attorney at Formica Williams, the New Haven, Connecticut law firm representing her, by phone on Friday.  Instead the 43-year-old housekeeper took sanctuary at Iglesia De Dios Pentecostal in New Haven. Churches have historically offered sanctuary to refugees, making them immune from arrest. While that no longer has legal effect, the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement spokesman Khaalid Walls said in a statement on Friday that the agency avoids making arrests at  sensitive locations  such as places of worship, schools and hospitals without prior approval from a supervisor.  We have opened the doors of our congregation to serve Ms. Chavarria as a sanctuary church,  Pastor Héctor Otero of the church said at a press conference on Thursday.  Chavarria is a single mother of four U.S.-born children aged 9 to 21, who have birthright citizenship. Her eldest has cerebral palsy. Chavarria was allowed to voluntarily depart after a review of her case in 1998, but has stayed on illegally since 1999, Walls said. She has been granted stays of removal on humanitarian grounds as she has raised her children. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, who met with Chavarria at the church on Thursday, tweeted on Friday,  #NuryChavarria is a mother and has no criminal record. She is welcome in our state.  New Haven is one of hundreds of U.S. cities, counties and states that have declared themselves sanctuaries that refuse to cooperate with Trump's efforts to deport millions of immigrants. In the first months after his election in November, arrests have risen, but actual deportations have fallen by 12 percent compared with the same period under President Barack Obama. The two Democratic U.S. senators representing Connecticut, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, have written letters to  Immigration Customs Enforcement urging a review of Chavarria's latest application for a stay of removal. At a press conference on Friday at the church where Chavarria was staying, Blumenthal called her situation  a symptom of Trump's cold and callous immigration policies that lack all sense of reason and rationality.  New York immigration attorney Glen Raj said by phone that U.S. immigration agencies are very rarely persuaded by communities and state governments to revoke a deportation order.

Researchers found that around 4 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish women without three well-known mutations in their BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have other mutations that may increase their risk for breast cancer. The well-known mutations are called  founders  since they've been inherited from the women's ancestors in Europe. Lead author Mary-Claire King and colleagues write in JAMA Oncology that those mutations are responsible for about 10 percent of invasive breast cancers among Ashkenazi Jewish women. According to the National Cancer Institute, between 1 in 400 and 1 in 800 people in the general U.S. population has one of these founders mutations - but that number increases to about 1 in 40 among Ashkenazi Jews. In women who don't carry one of those mutations, the risk of having another mutation that increases their risk of breast cancer is unknown, King's team writes. For the new study, the researchers analyzed blood samples collected between 1996 and 2000 from 1,007 Ashkenazi Jewish women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were being treated at one of 12 cancer centers near New York City. Genetic testing showed 903 women did not have those founder mutations in their BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. But seven of these women - nearly 1 percent - had a different mutation in those genes and 31 women - nearly 3.5 percent - had mutations in other genes that might have increased their risk for breast cancer. The researchers point out that about half of the women with these genetic mutations did not have a family history of breast cancer. So, making genetic counseling available only to women with a family history of breast cancer might miss about half of the women with mutations. Ashkenazi Jewish women who have not been tested for genetic mutations tied to an increased risk of breast cancer should be offered testing for all mutations, they write.  Given that complete sequencing of all breast cancer genes is now straightforward and inexpensive, its use as the primary testing tool offers a uniform approach for women of all ancestries and precludes the need to consider additional testing for Ashkenazi Jewish women with negative results for only BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder allies,  they add. The hope is that such testing would allows healthcare providers to prevent cancer or find it early, said Leigha Senter, a licensed genetics counselor at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus.  That is a clear pathway to action,  said Senter, who wasn't involved in the new study. She said a positive finding could lead to women getting more screenings, for example.  If we’re going to look for the founding mutations, it’s no more difficult to look for these other mutations,  said Senter. She cautioned that some of these other mutations don't increase the risk of breast cancer to the same extent as the founder mutations, however. Senter said women should be proactive and tell their doctors about any history of breast cancer on either side of their family. Additionally, she said, it's important to keep checking on the current screening recommendations.

Washington made its case to Myanmar’s de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the army chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing during a visit to the country this week by the U.S. special envoy for North Korea. U.S. Ambassador Joseph Yun's trip to Myanmar underlined continuing U.S. worries over North Korean links that date back to Myanmar’s decades of military rule, according to a senior State Department official on Friday.  It was an opportunity to message that any engagement with North Korea, particularly military engagement, is counterproductive to trying to end this threat that North Korea poses to the region and to the globe,” the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to specify what kind of military cooperation had continued between North Korea and Myanmar. There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Myanmar's embassy in Washington. The official said U.S. sanctions leveled this year against the Myanmar army's procurement body were meant to “reflect long-standing concerns” about the military's dealings with Pyongyang. Myanmar insists that arms deals and other military relations with North Korea stopped before Myanmar's transition to a nominally civilian government in 2011. Myanmar’s military was believed in the past to have imported North Korean-made weapons and North Korean personnel also worked in Myanmar, two former U.S. officials said. Any residual ties may be unfinished business between the two armies dating back to Myanmar's previous military-led government, one of the former officials said, adding there was no indication of a  nuclear component to the relationship.  Relying on Diplomacy The State Department official did not rule out the possibility of imposing further North Korea-related measures   on Myanmar, saying: “If a situation becomes so egregious and serious for our national security interests, there are a variety of tools, including sanctions.” For now, though, Washington was relying mostly on diplomacy with Myanmar, a resource-rich and strategically placed country that Washington wants to keep out of China's orbit. He stressed, however, that it would be difficult to proceed toward full normalization of U.S. relations with Myanmar until Washington was convinced of a halt to ties with North Korea. Yun's trip followed North Korea's test on July 4 of an intercontinental ballistic missile that Pyongyang says can carry a large nuclear warhead, and which experts believe can reach Alaska.  As Yun arrived in Yangon for talks on Monday, Kyaw Zeya, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, insisted Myanmar no longer had military ties with Pyongyang and was complying with U.N. resolutions banning such links.  It's normal relations between the two countries,  he told reporters. “As I understand, there's no such relations between military to military. Definitely not.  The State Department official told Reuters that Myanmar authorities did not explicitly deny that some vestiges of the previous North Korea relationship remained but said “those ties are not what they were in the past.” Myanmar's former ruling junta, which, like North Korea, was widely shunned by the outside world over its suppression of human rights, was known to have ties to Pyongyang. This included sending missile experts and material for arms production to Myanmar. Myanmar's Directorate of Defence Industries (DDI) was sanctioned in March under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. The DDI was previously sanctioned in 2012 and accused of materially assisting North Korea but had fallen off the sanctions list in October after the Obama administration dropped most measures against Myanmar in recognition of a successful political transition.

GE (GE.N) shares fell 2.9 percent to $25.91 and hit their lowest level since October 2015. The company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and said its full year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts. Peers in the industrial sector .SLPRCI, such as Caterpillar (CAT.N) and 3M (MMM.N), also fell. But Honeywell (HON.N) touched a record high and ended up 1.0 percent at $136.35 after it raised the low-end of its profit forecast.  We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today,  said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.  GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market, too.  The S&P; 500 energy sector .SPNY fell more than 1 percent as oil prices lost nearly 3 percent, after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the cartel's pledge to curb output. The S&P; 500 technology sector .SPLRCT slipped after posting two consecutive record closing highs. The Nasdaq Composite was on track to cap a 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at a record high on Thursday. Tech continues to be the best performing S&P; sector this year despite concerns over stretched valuations.

Analysts expect S&P; 500 earnings to have climbed 9.6 percent year-over-year, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 31.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,580.07, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.91 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,472.54 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.25 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,387.75. The S&P; and the Nasdaq rose for a third straight week. Capital One (COF.N) reported a profit beat, helped by growth in card loans and net interest income. Its shares rose 8.6 to $87.94, it's biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Visa (V.N) rose 1.5 percent to $99.60. The world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast.  What's important is the directionality of earnings, and earnings are going up.

That’s either in harmony with retail investors’ legendary ability to pick the top or a canny bet on global reflation. Since the great financial crisis the broad global trend has been for mutual and exchange-traded fund investors to load up on bonds while trimming equities. Globally, funds held in equities vehicles went from above 90 percent of the whole in 2007 to about 70 percent now. And while that figure for U.S. funds bottomed at about 60 percent in 2010 and is now at 67 percent, equity funds have suffered net outflows for the majority of the last few years, except for a spike in inflows after the 2016 U.S. election. This 'de-equitisation,' driven partly by battle-scarred individuals and partly by a large move into long-term debt by pension funds seeking to hedge long-term obligations, has been expensive. Over the past five years, the S&P; 500 has returned 13.4 percent per annum, against just 2.3 percent for 10-year Treasuries. But now, what started as a mild trend in the U.S. of upping equity exposure seems to be going global, perhaps as the last bears capitulate in the face of a low-volatility march higher in equity markets. There is also the fact that major central banks are signaling they may at last start to run down their own multi-trillion-dollar portfolios of bonds. “We find increasing evidence that the de-equitisation process, by which the weight of equity holdings in portfolios diminishes over time and is substituted by debt, has finally come to an end,” Alain Bokobza of Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients. “The main driver for re-equitisation could be gradually rising bond yields (Make reflation great again). Rising bond yields imply losses on existing bond portfolios (underweight bonds) and, when bond yields move higher, the risk budget of investors tends to increase (overweight equity).  In Europe, as bond yields bottomed, the equity share of fund holdings has crept higher this year, from a low below 60 percent in mid-2016 to about 65 percent now. Net flows to European equity funds have turned positive and assets, which decreased for about 18 months to January, have grown rapidly, indeed at a rate not seen since the bottoming of equity markets in 2009. Canny Bet or History Repeats? There is no question that a return to equity fund flows over bonds would have a significant market impact. A 10-percentage-point re-weighting into equities implies a global flow of $2.3 trillion. That compares with a cumulative net inflow into bond funds of almost $1.8 trillion since 2007. That inflow, notably, happened alongside massive official buying of bonds by central banks seeking to engineer a reflation. Those same central banks now seem ready to reverse course. The ECB is expected to announce its plans for tapering its bond portfolio sometime in the next several months, though it is currently committed to buying 60 billion euros a month until at least December. The Federal Reserve too is widely expected to start to allow its $4.5 trillion stock of bonds to dwindle, perhaps by the end of the year if not sooner. If that comes to pass it will surely change the relative attractions of stock and bonds. Longer-term Treasuries have already become more volatile than the almost comatose S&P; 500. But though central banks say they want to taper, the facts on inflation are a bit more stubborn. U.S. inflation is heading further below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, and in the euro zone core inflation remains stuck at about only 1 percent. That does not sound like an equity-friendly reflation. There is also the possibility that equity market volatility follows bond market volatility higher as central banks sell bonds, especially if tapering comes alongside mixed economic news, as it is very likely to do. And while funds, especially ETFs, are widely held by institutions, it is a lot easier to see the intuitive sense of selling bonds with rates this low than buying stocks with prices this high. In the run-up to both the dotcom bust and the great financial crisis retail investors did what they do best: buy what has just gone up in price. A rebalancing of fund portfolios towards stocks may just happen, but it may, once again, prove a reliable sell signal.

Trump's 2018 budget proposal calls for 32 miles (51 km) of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, where the 2,000-acre Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge is located. The area near the southern tip of Texas is home to 400 species of birds as well as a dwindling population of federally protected ocelots. Only about 50 ocelots remain in the United States, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The sources said CBP officials had informed them CBP would rely on exemptions provided to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the Real ID Act, a law created on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, so they can start building the section of wall without waiting for the years-long environmental study. Environmental impact studies are generally required under federal law whenever a proposal is made to build on public lands, including national forests, wildlife refuges and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Real ID Act also allows the secretary of Homeland Security to exempt CBP from adhering to the Endangered Species Act, which the sources said would otherwise make the wall's construction inside the refuge impossible due to the presence of the ocelots. The sources asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz declined to comment on the sources' assertion directly. He said in emails to Reuters that plans for constructing the wall were still uncertain and that the wall's construction depended upon whether Congress authorizes Trump's proposed 2018 budget. He added, however, that a government contractor has already begun testing soil samples on land near the refuge and that CBP got an official waiver for permission to do so. He said all federal agencies can get exemptions from environmental study requirements for  routine agency activities, like the soil sampling, that have minimal to no environmental impact.  The Texas Observer first reported on July 14 that the CBP was testing soil in Santa Ana. Congress is expected to take up the 2018 budget in September. The sources said CBP hopes to start building the wall before the end of 2017. The CBP's Acting Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said in testimony to Congress on June 13 the agency's activities building the wall would include  environmental planning.  Private industry advocates have said National Environmental Policy Act requirements for impact studies take too long.

This 'de-equitisation,' driven partly by battle-scarred individuals and partly by a large move into long-term debt by pension funds seeking to hedge long-term obligations, has been expensive. Over the past five years, the S&P; 500 has returned 13.4 percent per annum, against just 2.3 percent for 10-year Treasuries. But now, what started as a mild trend in the U.S. of upping equity exposure seems to be going global, perhaps as the last bears capitulate in the face of a low-volatility march higher in equity markets. There is also the fact that major central banks are signaling they may at last start to run down their own multi-trillion-dollar portfolios of bonds. “We find increasing evidence that the de-equitisation process, by which the weight of equity holdings in portfolios diminishes over time and is substituted by debt, has finally come to an end,” Alain Bokobza of Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients. “The main driver for re-equitisation could be gradually rising bond yields (Make reflation great again). Rising bond yields imply losses on existing bond portfolios (underweight bonds) and, when bond yields move higher, the risk budget of investors tends to increase (overweight equity).  In Europe, as bond yields bottomed, the equity share of fund holdings has crept higher this year, from a low below 60 percent in mid-2016 to about 65 percent now. Net flows to European equity funds have turned positive and assets, which decreased for about 18 months to January, have grown rapidly, indeed at a rate not seen since the bottoming of equity markets in 2009. Canny Bet or History Repeats? There is no question that a return to equity fund flows over bonds would have a significant market impact. A 10-percentage-point re-weighting into equities implies a global flow of $2.3 trillion. That compares with a cumulative net inflow into bond funds of almost $1.8 trillion since 2007. That inflow, notably, happened alongside massive official buying of bonds by central banks seeking to engineer a reflation. Those same central banks now seem ready to reverse course. The ECB is expected to announce its plans for tapering its bond portfolio sometime in the next several months, though it is currently committed to buying 60 billion euros a month until at least December. The Federal Reserve too is widely expected to start to allow its $4.5 trillion stock of bonds to dwindle, perhaps by the end of the year if not sooner. If that comes to pass it will surely change the relative attractions of stock and bonds. Longer-term Treasuries have already become more volatile than the almost comatose S&P; 500. But though central banks say they want to taper, the facts on inflation are a bit more stubborn. U.S. inflation is heading further below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, and in the euro zone core inflation remains stuck at about only 1 percent. That does not sound like an equity-friendly reflation. There is also the possibility that equity market volatility follows bond market volatility higher as central banks sell bonds, especially if tapering comes alongside mixed economic news, as it is very likely to do. And while funds, especially ETFs, are widely held by institutions, it is a lot easier to see the intuitive sense of selling bonds with rates this low than buying stocks with prices this high. In the run-up to both the dotcom bust and the great financial crisis retail investors did what they do best: buy what has just gone up in price. A rebalancing of fund portfolios towards stocks may just happen, but it may, once again, prove a reliable sell signal.

(Bimbo) has no rating impact as it will not materially affect the company's financial position and will slightly improve its diversification. The transaction is valued at USD650 million and will be financed with proceeds from its current committed long-term revolving credit facility. Fitch views this acquisition as manageable for Bimbo's credit quality. On a pro forma basis, considering an annual EBITDA contribution from East Balt Bakeries of around USD70 million, Fitch projects that by year-end 2017 Bimbo's total debt adjusted for rents-to-EBITDAR will approximate to 3.6x, while its total adjusted net debt-to-EBITDAR will be around 3.4x. These leverage metrics do not deviate materially from our previous estimates of 3.4x and 3.2x, respectively. In addition, Fitch anticipates these ratios will gradually strengthen towards 3.2x and 3.0x, respectively, by year-end 2018. Fitch considers the acquisition of East Balt Bakeries as positive for Bimbo as it will provide diversification in the food service industry and expand its current operational footprint. East Balt Bakeries is a global leader in the food service industry that produces and sells baked goods mainly to Quick Service Restaurants. It generates annual sales of around USD420 million and operates 21 bakeries in 11 countries across the U.S., Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. East Balt Bakeries' sales and EBITDA will approximately account for 3% and 5%, respectively, of Bimbo's consolidated figures. Bimbo's 'BBB' ratings reflect its solid business position as a global leader within the bakery industry, supported by a portfolio of well-known brands and extensive distribution network among the main markets in which it participates. Its ratings also incorporate the company's credit profile with stable leverage metrics, ample liquidity and positive FCF generation across the business cycle. Fitch currently rates Bimbo as follows: --Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Long-Term Local Currency IDR at 'BBB'; --National Long-term Rating at 'AA+(mex)'; --USD800 million senior notes due 2020 at 'BBB'; --USD800 million senior notes due 2022 at 'BBB'; --USD800 million senior notes due 2024 at 'BBB'; --USD500 million senior notes due 2044 at 'BBB'; --Local Certificados Bursatiles Issuances at 'AA+(mex)'.

The eight-times Olympic sprinting champion was slow out of the blocks, just as he was in his last race in Ostrava last month, and never managed to put a big gap between him and the field. He won in 9.95 seconds, three hundredths of a second ahead of American Isiah Young. South Africa's Akani Simbine was third in 10.02. Before the meeting, the Jamaican went to Germany to have treatment for back issues that have troubled him for years. It was his last outing before next month's world championships in London where he will race in the 100 meters and 4x100m relay.  It was good, I'm going into right direction, still a lot of work to do,  said Bolt, who is scheduled to retire after the world championships.   I'm always here for the fans, and of course I will miss the vibe around the track. Mixed emotions always -- happy for my career, sad that it is ending. Sub 10 is always good.

The lawmakers asked that the review include consideration of what effect the $13.7 billion deal could have on access to healthy foods in so-called food deserts where residents may have limited access to fresh groceries.  While we do not oppose the merger at this time, we are concerned about what this merger could mean for African-American communities across the country already suffering from a lack of affordable healthy food choices from grocers,  the letter said on Thursday. The letter was signed by U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and 11 other Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker. Amazon and Whole Foods hope to expand access to fresh food, said Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of policy, in a letter to Fudge, also on Thursday.  We agree with you that access to food is an important issue for the country, and we share your goal of improving that access,  Huseman said in the letter. Amazon has lobbied to be able to accept food stamps online and is participating in a pilot program.  We deliver low-cost, healthy food to zip codes across the country that before Amazon had limited access to a large selection of high quality foods,  Huseman wrote to Fudge. Fudge's letter was made public by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in the United States. Fudge's office confirmed she had sent the letter. Amazon's plan announced in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and hurt employment. Still, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. The letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the UFCW union. “Political concerns about Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods are growing for good reason,” UFCW President Marc Perrone said on Friday. “Amazon’s monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard-working men and women at Whole Foods, it’s also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.  Amazon has sought to dispute that it would monopolize the grocery industry. Wal-Mart Stores Inc currently controls the largest market share.  We also do not plan job reductions as part of the acquisition, which if approved would result in a company with a combined less than 3 percent of national grocery sales,” Huseman wrote.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-amazoncom-whole-foods-review-idUSL1N1KC1LQ"},

The special counsel, Robert Mueller, sent a document preservation request to the White House, saying the June 2016 meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had in Trump Tower in New York is relevant to his investigation, the source said on Friday. The White House counsel’s office relayed the request, a routine part of the early phase of any investigation, to other members of the White House staff on Wednesday, the source said. News earlier this month of the meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer he was told had damaging information about his father's presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaign's dealings with Moscow. The Republican president has defended his son's meeting as simple politics. Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department in May, is probing alleged Russian interference in the election and potential collusion by Trump's campaign, an issue that has engulfed the six-month-old administration. Trump has long expressed frustration with a probe that he has called a political witch hunt, and has denied any collusion. Moscow has denied it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the November 2016 vote in Trump's favor. Document requests of the type sent by Mueller generally cover emails, text messages, voicemails, notes or records. The counsel is looking for any indication that the president knew the meeting his son had was planned and might have suggested topics for discussion, the source said. He would also be inquiring into whether Trump was briefed on the meeting afterward, as well as what was discussed, the source said. Mueller would be interested, the source said, in topics such as any discussion of U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, possible Russian investments in the United States or elsewhere, or a possible lifting of a Russian prohibition on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. Russia imposed the adoption ban to retaliate for the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on Russian individuals to punish Russia for human rights violations. Ways of Limiting Probe Mueller's document preservation request comes amid newspaper reports that Trump's lawyers are reviewing ways to limit or undermine the special counsel. The Washington Post and The New York Times on Thursday cited unidentified people familiar with the strategy. A Trump attorney contacted by Reuters, John Dowd, denied the reports and praised Mueller.  We think he's a straight, honest guy,  Dowd said. Dowd said communications with Mueller were productive and  we have confidence he’s going to do the right thing.  Another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, told the Times that addressing possible conflicts of interest in Mueller's team would be appropriate but declined to comment on specifics. Senior White House advisor Kellyanne Conway referred on Friday to reports that members of Mueller's team have made donations to the Democratic Party.  People should know what folks’ paths and motivations and political motivations are,  she said in a Fox News interview. According to the Post, Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the Russia probe. Trump's lawyers have been discussing the president’s pardoning powers, a second person told the newspaper. Dowd dismissed the pardon report as nonsense.  It's just not true,  he said. In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump suggested the special counsel's remit should be limited, warning Mueller against investigating his and his family's finances, which he said are unrelated to the Russia investigation. The Republican president also hinted at possible conflicts of interest involving Mueller. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence panel, said in a statement,  Mueller has the authority to investigate anything that arises from his investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, including financial links.  His committee is one of several congressional panels investigating the Russia matter alongside Mueller's probe. Separately, the spokesman for Trump's legal team, Mark Corallo, confirmed his resignation on Friday. Lead attorney Marc Kasowitz will take on a reduced role on the outside legal team, according to media reports. Other recent changes included the hiring of veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb to a White House job to handle responses to the Russia probe.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index lost 81.51 points, or 0.53 percent, to close at 15,183.13. For the week, it edged 0.05 percent higher. Oil prices slid after a report from consultancy Petro-Logistics predicted higher OPEC production for July, renewing fears of oversupply in the market. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd shed 2.4 percent to C$37.25, Suncor Energy Inc fell 1 percent to C$38.42, and the energy group retreated 1.4 percent overall. However, shares of Encana Corp advanced 1.4 percent to C$12.34 after the natural gas producer reported a quarterly profit that topped expectations. Stubbornly low oil prices have weighed on the commodity-rich Canadian market, making it one of the worst-performing major global indexes so far this year. Elvis Picardo, a portfolio manager at HollisWealth, a division of Scotia Capital, said energy names are looking attractive from a valuation perspective for long-term investors, while a recent pullback in yield-producing utilities, telecoms and real estate investment trusts provides an opportunity to build a defensive position. Utilities and telecoms were the only two of the index's 10 main groups to end higher on Friday.  We think we are probably in the eighth or possibly ninth inning of this global bull market,  Picardo said.  Our strategy at this point is one of caution and value orientation.  The TSX's financials group, which accounts for more than a third of the index's weight, lost 0.5 percent. Industrials, an export-dependent sector grappling with a recent appreciation in the Canadian currency, fell 0.7 percent. Canadian retail sales posted their third healthy increase in a row in May, according to data on Friday, a sign of strength that analysts said boosts the case for another interest rate hike this year despite data showing persistently weak inflation.

The name of the whistleblower was not disclosed.  We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members,  wrote Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick in an emailed statement to Reuters.  This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case. We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter.  Wells Fargo was fined last year for opening up to 2.1 million customer accounts without their knowledge over several years to meet aggressive sales targets. The revelation damaged the bank's reputation, spurred investors to sell its shares for several weeks and led to the resignation of its chief executive last year. Despite news reports and lawsuits claiming the bank had retaliated against whistleblowers, an investigative report by the bank's board of directors released on April 10 said  based on a limited review completed to date,  outside law firm Shearman & Sterling had  not identified a pattern of retaliation  against employees in Wells Fargo's branch banking unit who complained about sales pressure or practices. In a different case, the Department of Labor in April ordered Wells Fargo to reinstate a whistleblower, though that former staffer's concerns related to bank, mail and wire fraud -things that were not at issue in the sales practices scandal.

Months of very hard work by agency staff have produced a solid, commonsense plan that will help the agency respond to a new economic environment,  said Rick Metsger, a board member of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which oversees the country's nearly 6,000 credit unions. Since at least 2011 the number of credit unions, non-profit financial cooperatives that are owned and controlled by members, has consistently shrunk each year. At the same time, the unions' membership, asset levels, and loans have grown, data from the Credit Union National Association, a trade group, showed. The result is a more concentrated system dominated by fewer, but larger, institutions than in the past. Like banks, the unions take deposits and provide loans. The regulator, currently functioning with only two board members, must position itself  to meet the changing demands  while  promoting efficiency and effectiveness,  NCUA Chairman Mark McWatters said in a statement. The NCUA plans to close its Albany, New York, and Atlanta, Georgia office, and cancel four of its five leased facilities.  It will also  eliminate agency offices with overlapping functions and improve functions such as examination reporting, records management, and procurement,  according to the announcement, as it banks on a reduction in workers by attrition.  The plan also foresees restructuring the examination and insurance office into specialized working groups. Full details, along with projected cost savings, will be posted in the fall. Earlier this week, the agency's chief financial officer said in a report to the board it was on track to cut spending by $5.8 million this year, with a little more than half of those savings coming from reductions in compensations, a hiring freeze, and employee turnover and attrition.

After battling for 3,390 km around France, slogging up the climbs of the Jura, the Pyrenees, Massif central and finally the Alps, Froome has emerged 23 seconds clear of his closest rival and admits that the yellow jersey is now his to lose. Saturday's individual time trial -- a discipline at which the 32-year-old Froome usually excels -- around the streets of Marseille should be routine for the Team Sky rider. Barring a crash or a mechanical failure he will emerge into the Stade Velodrome with the yellow jersey secured for a third successive year, and his fourth in total, before Sunday's traditional Champagne ride into Paris.  Certainly, at this point, it's my race to lose,  Froome said after an incident-free day rolling along at the front of the peloton on Friday's stage 19, behind a breakaway group from which Edvald Boasson Hagen claimed a solo victory.  I have to make sure I do everything right, follow the right processes and hopefully not have a bad day. I've got the legs, and hopefully everything else will be all right.  Three-times Tour champion Greg LeMond backed up Froome's analysis. FILE PHOTO: Team Sky rider Chris Froome of Britain wears the race leader's yellow jersey as he speeds downhill during the 110.5-km (68.6 miles) 20th stage of the 102nd Tour de France cycling race from Modane to Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps mountains, France.Stefano Rellandini/File Photo Froome has to have a hiccup to lose that race,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, told Reuters.  You never know what can happen. A flat tyre, a broken wheel; it happens... you can get nervous and you make a mistake.  Froome's nearest challenger for the yellow jersey is Frenchman Romain Bardet, who he beat by 39 seconds in the Tour's opening time trial in Duesseldorf. Colombian Rigoberto Uran, who trails by 29 seconds going into the Marseille time trial, is probably the man most likely to benefit from any problems Froome encounters. Uran, like the Briton, is capable of a scorching time trial, even if he did struggle in the Duesseldorf rain three weeks ago. Froome has time in the bank but that can pose a conundrum: whether to attack or defend?  It's definitely a fast course, there's a small climb out the back of Marseille. I think it suits me well,  he said.  It's quite a power time trial. I have to treat it like any other time trial. I won't take any big risks like in Duesseldorf, but when I can push, I will push.  Froome's rivals, on the other hand, have to go for broke and hope for the best.  I would rather be in my position than having to make up time. That gives me a lot of confidence,  he said.

In a statement, Quality Care said it had delivered a notice of default to HCR ManorCare, its main tenant, regarding the missed payment, which Quality Care said triggers immediate payment of $265 million in additional overdue rent.  HCR ManorCare spokeswoman Julie Beckert declined to comment on the threat of receivership. U.S. nursing homes have struggled to reconcile a tumultuous, low-margin business with declining reimbursements and increasing costs for medical supplies, insurance, aging buildings and litigation. To protect their investments, lenders and landlords of distressed healthcare operators can ask the courts to appoint a receiver to take control of the business in the event of a default. In the case of Toledo, Ohio-based HCR ManorCare, Quality Care said the default allows it  to terminate the master lease, appoint receivers or exercise other remedies with respect to any and all leased properties.   Quality Care, one of the largest U.S. healthcare landlords, last month said it was seeking up to $500 million to acquire HCR ManorCare. On Friday it said it remains in talks with the skilled nursing home operator about the default and other matters.  HCR ManorCare -- which also operates assisted living facilities, memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics and home health care agencies across the country -- confirmed ongoing discussions with its landlord. In addition, HCR ManorCare received a $550 million loan from Centerbridge Partners this week to repay an existing term loan and outstanding loans, Beckert told Reuters in an e-mail. Quality Care Properties was spun off from HCP Inc (HCP.N), a large healthcare real estate investment trust, in 2016 as HCR ManorCare was in decline. Private equity firm Carlyle Group bought HCR ManorCare in a 2007 leveraged buyout for $6.3 billion and sold the properties to HCP for $6.1 billion in 2010.

Speculators were net long 8,043 Canadian dollar contracts as of July 18, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. In the prior week, they were net short 8,604 contracts and bearish bets had set a record high in May.      There is still plenty of room for the Canadian dollar longs to pile in,  said Adam Button, currency analyst at ForexLive.  Despite a Canadian dollar rally, it is by no means a crowded trade.      Retail sales rose by 0.6 percent in May from April, a sign of strength that analysts said boosts the case for another interest rate hike from the Bank of Canada despite data showing persistently weak inflation.                  Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to a 20-month low of 1.0 percent in June, although core measures showed signs of strength.     The Bank of Canada last week raised its key rate to 0.75 percent, the first increase since September 2010. Chances of a second hike in October climbed above 70 percent from a roughly two-thirds chance before the economic reports, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                Still, Canada's bond market is signaling the Bank of Canada will not reach its 2 percent inflation target anytime soon. That suggests the central bank is unlikely to pull off more than one more rate hike even as money markets see further tightening into 2018.                  At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2538 to the greenback, or 79.76 U.S. cents, up 0.4 percent.     The currency touched its strongest level since early May 2016 at C$1.2522. For the week, Canada's dollar rose 0.9 percent.       The Canadian dollar is running on fumes at this point,  Button said.  The past week has been more about U.S. dollar weakness than Canadian dollar strength.      The loonie rose even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell. U.S. crude        prices settled 2.5 percent lower at $45.77 a barrel.           Canadian government bond prices were little changed across much of the yield curve.     The 10-year             was flat to yield 1.882 percent. But the gap between the 10-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 2.7 basis points to a spread of -35.7 basis points, its narrowest since June 2016.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized a  Geographical Travel Restriction  on Americans to forbid them from entering North Korea, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.  Once in effect, U.S. passports will be invalid for travel to, through and in North Korea, and individuals will be required to obtain a passport with a special validation in order to travel to or within North Korea,  Nauert said. The move was due to  mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement,  she said. Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American was sentenced last year to 15 years hard labor in North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda sign while on a tourist visit. He returned to the United States in a coma on June 13 after being released on humanitarian grounds and died June 19.  The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. North Korea has said through its state media that Warmbier's death was  a mystery  and dismissed accusations that he had died as a result of torture and beating in captivity. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, a Canadian pastor and three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work. Japan says North Korea has also detained at least several dozen of its nationals. It was not known how many Americans were currently in North Korea and the State Department said it was not its practice to give numbers of U.S. citizens living in or travelling to a particular country. U.S. officials say North Korea will become the only country in the world Americans are banned from visiting. The department said it plans to publish a notice in the Federal Register next week, starting a 30-day clock before the restriction takes effect, Nauert said.

North Korea allows foreign tourists to visit but their travel is strictly limited. Hundreds of Americans are among the roughly 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea each year, according to U.S. Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina. This year, Wilson introduced a bill with Democratic Representative Adam Schiff to ban Americans from travelling to North Korea as tourists, following the detention of at least 17 U.S. citizens in the past decade. FILE PHOTO: A guide wearing a traditional dress speaks to visitors at the Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, North Korea May 4, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoAnthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former U.S. Treasury official, said the State Department action was important as it would limit North Korea's ability to use detained Americans as bargaining chips with Washington as it has in the past. Tom Bodkin, managing director of the UK-based adventure travel company, Secret Compass, said the travel ban was  a bit of a shame.   Travel between different cultures breaks down the preconceptions that you have about different cultures and breaks down the stereotypes that you have,  he said.  Secret Compass has brought three Americans among the 19 people it took to North Korea since launching tours there last fall, he said. U.S. Army veteran Brian Sayler, 40, who traveled to North Korea for six days in May, said he opposed the pending ban.  “We’re telling our own people, essentially, you can’t go where you want to go, I don’t really understand it,” said Sayler, a resident of West Pittston, Pennsylvania, who works as a police officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs. North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead. North Korea this month test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts believe has the range to reach  Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

In a statement, Quality Care said it had delivered a notice of default to HCR ManorCare, its main tenant, regarding the missed payment, which Quality Care said triggers immediate payment of $265 million in additional overdue rent.  HCR ManorCare spokeswoman Julie Beckert declined to comment on the threat of receivership. U.S. nursing homes have struggled to reconcile a tumultuous, low-margin business with declining reimbursements and increasing costs for medical supplies, insurance, aging buildings and litigation. To protect their investments, lenders and landlords of distressed healthcare operators can ask the courts to appoint a receiver to take control of the business in the event of a default. In the case of Toledo, Ohio-based HCR ManorCare, Quality Care said the default allows it  to terminate the master lease, appoint receivers or exercise other remedies with respect to any and all leased properties.   Quality Care, one of the largest U.S. healthcare landlords, last month said it was seeking up to $500 million to acquire HCR ManorCare. On Friday it said it remains in talks with the skilled nursing home operator about the default and other matters.  HCR ManorCare -- which also operates assisted living facilities, memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics and home health care agencies across the country -- confirmed ongoing discussions with its landlord. In addition, HCR ManorCare received a $550 million loan from Centerbridge Partners this week to repay an existing term loan and outstanding loans, Beckert told Reuters in an e-mail.

Gains in the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries pointed to moves into safe-haven assets rather than stocks, which are considered riskier. Oil prices slid more than 2 percent. The euro built on sharp gains from a day earlier, rising to near two-year highs against the dollar and undermining European stocks, with Germany's DAX .GDAXI equity index falling 1.7 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down.  The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro ... certainly gave the green light for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.  MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.19 percent, falling after 10 days of gains. U.S. stock indexes ended marginally lower, pulling back from record high levels reached earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 31.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,580.07, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.91 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,472.54 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.25 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,387.75. General Electric (GE.N) shares dropped 2.9 percent after the industrial conglomerate's profit report.

Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Nissan Motor Co agreed to recall 515,394 2007-2011 Versa cars after Takata declared 2.7 million vehicles to have potentially defective inflators. Ford spokesman John Cangany said the automaker will file a petition requesting  to continue testing and analyzing our inflators.  The NHTSA said the petition will seek an exemption from the recall because Ford believes the issue is inconsequential. Ford said the issue covers 2.5 million vehicles, including the 2007-11 Ranger, 2006-12 Fusion and Lincoln MKZ, 2006-11 Mercury Milan, and 2007-10 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. Ford previously said it covered about 2.2 million vehicles. Last week, the NHTSA said that new testing prompted Takata to declare inflators defective in Ford, Nissan and Mazda Motor Corp vehicles in some driver-side air bags built from 2012 through 2015. The NHTSA said in a statement on Friday that  testing data shows that the propellant in this inflator is degrading and on the path towards potential ruptures in the future. There are no reported ruptures in the real-world or in testing.  Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators. Nissan said last week it would recall 627,000 Versa cars from the 2007-12 model years, including 515,000 in the United States  out of an abundance of caution.  Nissan said testing of 895 inflators showed no ruptures, while one  exhibited an elevated internal pressure.  Takata said the inflators potentially could rupture  after several years of exposure to high absolute humidity.  Mazda said last week the issue impacts just 6,000 of 2007-09 B-series trucks that were built under a previous Ford partnership. The company said on Friday that it also plans to file a petition to avoid a recall. Ford shares fell 1.5 percent on Friday to close at $11.53. The automakers have 30 days to submit their petitions, and the NHTSA will then take public comment before making a decision. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest-ever auto-safety recall, covering 17 automakers. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ford-takata-idUSL1N1KC1HE"},

Gains in the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries pointed to moves into safe-haven assets rather than stocks, which are considered riskier. Oil prices slid more than 2 percent. The euro built on sharp gains from a day earlier, rising to near two-year highs against the dollar and undermining European stocks, with Germany's DAX .GDAXI equity index falling 1.7 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down.  The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro ... certainly gave the green light for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.

GE (GE.N) shares fell 2.9 percent to $25.91 and hit their lowest level since October 2015. The company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and said its full year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts. Peers in the industrial sector .SLPRCI, such as Caterpillar (CAT.N) and 3M (MMM.N), also fell. But Honeywell (HON.N) touched a record high and ended up 1.0 percent at $136.35 after it raised the low-end of its profit forecast.  We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today,  said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.  GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market, too.  The S&P; 500 energy sector .SPNY fell more than 1 percent as oil prices lost nearly 3 percent, after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the cartel's pledge to curb output. The S&P; 500 technology sector .SPLRCT slipped after posting two consecutive record closing highs. The Nasdaq Composite was on track to cap a 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at a record high on Thursday.

The S&P; and the Nasdaq rose for a third straight week. Capital One (COF.N) reported a profit beat, helped by growth in card loans and net interest income. Its shares rose 8.6 to $87.94, it's biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Visa (V.N) rose 1.5 percent to $99.60. The world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast.  What's important is the directionality of earnings, and earnings are going up.

The logo of Ford is pictured at the 38th Bangkok International Motor Show in Bangkok, Thailand March 28, 2017.Athit PerawongmethaNissan said last week it would recall 627,000 Versa cars from the 2007-12 model years, including 515,000 in the United States  out of an abundance of caution.  Nissan said testing of 895 inflators showed no ruptures, while one  exhibited an elevated internal pressure.  Takata said the inflators potentially could rupture  after several years of exposure to high absolute humidity.  Mazda said last week the issue impacts just 6,000 of 2007-09 B-series trucks that were built under a previous Ford partnership. The company said on Friday that it also plans to file a petition to avoid a recall. Ford shares fell 1.5 percent on Friday to close at $11.53. The automakers have 30 days to submit their petitions, and the NHTSA will then take public comment before making a decision.  More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest-ever auto-safety recall, covering 17 automakers.  Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June.

Only 7 percent of smokers picked up a prescription for a smoking cessation drug during the 90 days following their heart attacks, researchers found.  These medications are being underused,  said lead author Dr. Neha Pagidipati, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.  Now we need to understand why.  About 735,000 people in the United States have heart attacks each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Smoking is a major cause of cardiovascular disease. The CDC says one in three deaths from cardiovascular disease can be blamed on smoking. Pagidipati and colleagues write in JAMA Cardiology that despite the increased risk, just over half of people stop smoking in the year after a heart attack. Along with nicotine replacement therapies like gum and patches, people trying to quit cigarettes can use medications such as bupropion and varenicline.  What we didn’t know is how often are these medication being used in patients who recently had a heart attack,  Pagidipati told Reuters Health. For the new study, researchers analyzed data on 9,193 smokers who had a heart attack between 2007 and 2013. All were at least 65 years old. Overall, 97 percent of patients were counseled during their hospital stay about smoking cessation, but only 7 percent ended up picking up medications to help achieve that goal within 90 days.  It suggests somewhere in there is a break in the link,  said Pagidipati.  Now we need to go back and figure out where is the problem.  Of those who did pick up a prescription, about 53 percent used varenicline and about 47 percent used bupropion. But only about 37 percent of those taking bupropion and only about 20 percent of those taking varenicline used them for the recommended 12 weeks. About half of the patients using bupropion took the drug for less than 6.2 weeks. Similarly, about half of the patients on varenicline used it for less than 4.3 weeks. Pagidipati said it's not clear whether doctors are not prescribing the medications or patients aren't filling their prescriptions due to fear of side effects or cost. The drugs are powerful tools, she said. She urges people to ask their healthcare providers as soon as possible about how to stop smoking.  There are a lot of things that can be done,  said Pagidipati.  It’s absolutely imperative that they speak to their providers.

The issue ratings on Marche's senior unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'BBB'. The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect Marche's low debt and contingent liabilities, solid liquidity amid sound operating performance, including a balanced healthcare sector, and the administration's proactive management. KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Debt, Good Liquidity: Under Fitch's central scenario Marche's direct debt will remain at a low 30% of current revenue in 2017-2018, below the EUR1 billion threshold. Based on the region's 2016 preliminary accounts, direct debt amounted to EUR921 million, including outstanding EUR406 million bullet bonds, of which EUR272 million is accrued under the sinking fund. The region also has EUR28 million loans charged to the state. Marche has 80% its bonds and loans at fixed interest rates, which results in debt service requirements absorbing less than 3% of current revenue. Fitch expects Marche's liquidity to remain sound in 2017-2019, broadly in line with the region's average cash balance of nearly EUR400 million in 2016. Solid Budgetary Performance: The region retains a solid capacity to manage risks associated with a normal economic cycle given its prudent budgetary management, low revenue volatility and legal tax-raising capacity. Under Fitch's rating case scenario, Marche is expected to post a stable medium- term operating balance of around EUR180 million (or 5% of revenue), due primarily to tight cost control and expectations of stable funds from the national healthcare equalisation system (Fondo Sanitario Nazionale). This will ensure predictable debt servicing with a debt payback ratio of less than 10 years, approximately matching the average life of the region's debt. Despite an investment plan of around EUR700 million over 2017-2019, Fitch expects Marche to maintain balanced funding through a prudent combination of debt and non-debt resources. Proactive Management: The administration has continued to demonstrate its commitment to preserving the region's stable operating performance by maintaining a balanced budget, including on the healthcare sector, which absorbs 80% of the budget. The regional administration focuses on enhancing economic development through tax relief and upgrades of infrastructure such as roads and new hospitals. Neutral Institutional Framework: Marche's profile is constrained by Italy's ratings (BBB/Stable). This reflects the cap at the sovereign rating for ordinary statute regions, as they lack the financial autonomy that can isolate their finances from the national government and make them eligible for a rating higher than the sovereign's. As with other Italian regions, Marche benefits from national state aid, such as transfers and support in case of unpredictable events such as last year's earthquake, but remains subject to Italy's consolidation efforts through making contributions to the national government to balance the national accounts, with repeated revenue curtailments. Modest Economic Recovery: Located at the centre of Italy, Marche is a medium-to-large region and has an estimated population of 1.5 million inhabitants and a GDP of about EUR40 billion. After a mild recovery in 2015, which was lower than the 0.8% national average, Fitch's expectations of muted regional GDP growth in 2017 may be affected by the recent earthquake impacting parts of Marche's territory. The economy is driven by traditional industry activities (mainly furniture and mechanics), while textiles and shoes continue to suffer from declining exports. Unemployment, albeit growing, is still below the national average (10.6% in 2016 versus 9.9% in 2015) but may add pressure to the regional tax base. RATING SENSITIVITIES Marche's ratings would be downgraded if the sovereign rating is downgraded. A negative rating action may also result if operating performance deteriorates to levels such that Marche is unable to cover most of its debt servicing requirements. Conversely, given the sovereign cap, a revision of Italy's Outlook to Positive could lead to a similar rating action on Marche, provided the region continues to perform in line with Fitch's projections.

The affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation of gradually strengthening fiscal performance and a balanced budget, driven by increasing and stable allocations from the state, subject to the region meeting cost savings and investment objectives. The affirmation also factors in moderate direct risk and sound liquidity, while taking into account Sicily's weak economic fundamentals. The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation of no major adverse changes to the region's credit fundamentals over the medium term. KEY RATING DRIVERS Towards a Balanced Budget Fitch expects Sicily's operating margin to gradually improve towards 5% of operating revenue by 2019-2020, net of pass-through and extraordinary items, from 2% in 2015-2016 and an average of -3% in 2011-2014. The improvement is driven by a bilateral agreement signed with the national government in 2016, according to which net state funding will progressively increase to EUR1.7 billion annually from 2017. This is subject to a number of objectives, including cost savings and increasing investments, being met. The healthcare sector, accounting for nearly two thirds of operating revenue as calculated by Fitch, or around EUR9 billion, remained balanced in 2016, alleviating the burden on the regional budget, although cost savings failed to be met. Moderate Direct Risk Sicily's stock of debt amounted to EUR8 billion at end-2016 (EUR8.2 billion in 2015), corresponding to half of operating revenue, when including EUR2.5 billion subsidised loans to pay down commercial healthcare liabilities and EUR135 million loans charged to the national government. Fitch forecasts net overall risk, including public sector entities' (PSEs) debt and guarantees, to remain around EUR8 billion in 2017-2019, or below 55% of the regional budget. Fitch expects the operating balance to fully cover interest and principal payment in the medium term, which the agency forecasts to represent a low 3.6% of operating revenue. Sicily's liquidity remained satisfactory at EUR724 million at end-2016, without drawing on its credit lines; this liquidity buffers cover 1.5x debt servicing requirements. Improving Economy With a GDP per capita at about 65% of Italy's and an unemployment rate twice the national average (22% versus 11%) at end-2016, Sicily's economy remains one of the weaker regions in Italy. However, from 2015-2016 GRP showed signs of a recovery. In 2016 positive trends in the tertiary sector, in particular tourism, more than offset industry output stagnation and declining exports (down 17%, except for agriculture and food), leaving regional revenue little changed. As part of Sicily's commitment to the agreement with the national government, Fitch expects regional capital spending to reach up to EUR10 billion during the 2014-2020 planning period, backed by capital transfers and EU funds. This should support a 0.5% recovery in GDP, and together with services and expected export recovery, help strengthen the regional tax base over the medium term, despite a significant shadow economy and some corruption preventing full efficient use of available resources. Neutral Institutional Framework Despite its autonomous status, Sicily continues to contribute to Italy's efforts to balance the national accounts. On the other hand, the national government supports regional efforts to cut spending and improve investments, through the provision of additional resources from 2016 in its revised agreement with Sicily. Moreover, subsidised loans and state-charged debt underpin substantial support from the national government. Challenging Management The fund balance deficit, as calculated by Fitch, shrank less than expected in 2016 to EUR3.5 billion due to restated provisions aimed at ensuring an adequate buffer against possible adverse future events. Annual fund balance deficit recovery accounts for about EUR200 million until 2045, partially neutralising the reprieve from increasing allocations from the national government. Fitch will monitor the recovery plan implementation and the region's constant cash flow sustainability. After strengthening constitutional relations with the state in 2016, the regional administration is committed to streamlining its rigid cost structure dominated by healthcare expenses, interest payments and wages (more than 80% of total), while revitalising the regional economy to support revenue. RATING SENSITIVITIES Failure to stabilise the operating balance at 3% of revenue, to at least largely cover debt-servicing requirements or unexpected growth of debt towards 75% of operating revenue could lead to a downgrade, especially if the economy remains sluggish. A downgrade of Italy would also lead to a downgrade of the region. Conversely, a sovereign upgrade could result in the same action on Sicily provided the regional operating margin strengthens towards 10%, and Sicily achieves an overall balanced budget and current surplus matching principal repayment over the medium term.

The speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in two major NYMEX and ICE markets by 36,267 contracts to 238,673 in the week to July 18, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed. Money managers raised their gross long positions to the highest level since late April, the data showed, while gross short positions dropped to the lowest level since early June. U.S. oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped by about 3 percent and averaged $45.92 per barrel during the period.  Inventories fell 7.6 million barrels in the week to July 7, the biggest weekly plunge in 10 months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported last week. The supply response from producers has also shown signs of bullishness. On Friday, data showed U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a second week since January. In addition, robust demand from China helped support prices. China imported 8.55 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in the first half of this year, up 13.8 percent from the same period in 2016, making it the world's biggest crude importer, ahead of the United States. Also propping up prices was data showing Saudi Arabia's crude oil exports in May fell to 6.924 million barrels per day from 7.006 million bpd in April.  However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its oil production jumped in June, and it forecast world demand for its crude will decline next year as rivals pump more, pointing to a market surplus in 2018 despite an OPEC-led effort to cut output. Among refined products, net long futures and options in U.S. gasoline rose to the highest level since April 25 amid strong domestic demand and signs of increased export demand to Latin America.  Gasoline stocks fell by 4.4 million barrels last week, a fifth straight week of declines.

Researchers examined data from 49 previously published studies with a total of 1,863 people who did muscle-building workouts like weightlifting. Participants who boosted their protein intake - whether from foods or from supplements like bars, powders and shakes - added more lean muscle mass and got stronger muscles than exercisers who didn’t add extra protein to their diets.  However, increasing daily protein consumption beyond more than 1.6 grams for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight didn’t appear to have any added benefit.  “Performing resistance exercise is an effective way to maintain or increase lean muscle mass,” said lead study author Robert Morton of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  “Protein supplementation is sufficient and necessary to augment increases in muscle mass and strength during periods of resistance training,” Morton said by email.  Added protein didn’t help older adults as much as younger people, however.  Also, the benefits of extra protein were more pronounced for newer exercisers than for people with lots of previous experience with resistance training.  All of the studies included in the research review had healthy adults performing resistance exercises at least twice a week. For each study, participants were randomly selected to stick to their usual diets or add extra protein.  Across all these studies, people adding protein to their diets consumed an extra 4 grams to 106 grams daily. Overall, the most common source of added protein was whey protein supplements, followed by supplement blends.  Ten studies gave people added protein with milk, and another seven examined adding protein with whole foods like beef and yogurt.  One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have enough data on older adults to determine how much added protein might help these individuals build lean muscle mass, which typically declines with age. Researchers also didn’t look at what happens when dieters get added protein.  “It has been difficult to cultivate one simple message, quantifying how much protein, what types of protein and whether messages should differ among different populations of people,” said Kelsey Mangano, a nutrition researcher at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell who wasn’t involved in the study.  Still, the findings offer fresh insight into the amount of protein some people might add to their diets to get additional benefits from muscle-building workouts, Mangano said by email.  The results might not apply to people who don’t do resistance training at least twice a week, said Dr. Mingyang Song of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.  Adding protein also isn’t risk-free, Song said by email. It can lead to digestive problems and damage the kidneys, and there’s also some concern that it may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  “It may result in an imbalanced diet,” Song said. “Thus, a healthy, whole-food based diet should be consumed.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uijHt7 British Journal of Sports Medicine, online July 11, 2017.

The National Long-Term Rating has been affirmed at 'AA+(nga)', with a Stable Outlook. The ratings on Lagos' medium-term note (MTN) programme as well as senior unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'B+'/AA+(nga)'. The affirmation reflects the state's weak socio-economic indicators by international standards. It also reflects Fitch's expectations of resilient operating performance in the medium term, adequate transparency compared with national standards and satisfactory debt metrics. The Negative Outlook on the IDRs reflects that of Nigeria (B+/Negative). KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Institutional Framework: A constitutional equalisation system enacted through the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) pools oil and non-oil revenue collected by the central government and transfers them to local and regional governments. FAAC's funding has proved volatile given that Nigeria's federal budget depends on oil for more than a third of its revenue and the severe oil price slowdown from 2012 has resulted in lower transfers to local government entities, especially in 2016. Given that the revenue framework is highly equalised and irrespective of the minimum level of service provided, incentives for operating spending efficiencies are limited. Economic development of states is dependent on capital projects, which often face challenging budget execution and are driven by available funding options. IGR Supporting Revenue Framework: Lagos benefits from a diversified revenue structure and, especially from strong internally generated revenues (IGR), which mitigates dependency on state statutory allocations from FAAC. Lagos' IGR represents on average about 70% of the state revenue budget or about 40% of IGR collected in the country, which however includes a higher share of informal non-oil activities compared with the oil sector. Fitch expects Lagos' medium-term operating margin to be in the 45%-50% range, supported by a growing revenue base especially from IGR which is, however, challenged by a large informal economy. This, in tandem with the administration's commitment to keep cost growth under double-digit inflation, should mitigate the negative impact from potentially declining FAAC transfers, which represent about 10% of the state's revenue. Enhancing Management Practice: Fitch expects political continuity following last elections to boost capex over the medium term up to an annual average of NGN450 billion over 2017-2019, mostly focused on transportation, water, health, education and social protection. Despite Nigeria's weak governance indicators, as measured by the World Bank, the state is improving its governance and disclosure, and we expect new accrual accounting rules effective with 2016 financials to improve transparency and accountability. Growing Debt, Adequate Liquidity: Lagos' debt will grow over the medium term up to over NGN1 trillion or over 150% of tax revenue, driven by a demanding capex programme and the negative effect of the Naira devaluation on foreign currency-denominated debt and a new USD200 million loan with the World Bank to finance new investments. Foreign currency debt repayment is assisted by irrevocable standing payment orders (ISPOs), through which the central government deducts from monthly transfers to service the states' bonds, thereby transforming the ISPO from a back-up guarantee to a first-lien charge. Fitch expects long-term debt sustainability to remain compatible with Lagos' rating profile, with a pay-back (debt-to-current balance) ratio of four years. Liquidity, averaging NGN100 billion over the medium term and equivalent to approximately 1x annual debt service requirements, does not represent a risk. Growth and Socio Economic Improvement; Despite its weak socio-economic indicators by international standards, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse as its GDP accounts for 20%-25% of national GDP. Domestic production is fuelled by its diversified economy, with services, construction, transport and industry representing 80% of the local economy. Fitch believes that Lagos' socio-economic indicators will further improve as we forecast local GDP growth to outperform national real GDP growth, at 4.5%-5.5% in 2017-2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade of the sovereign's ratings would lead to a corresponding action on Lagos' IDRs. In the absence of a sovereign downgrade, an operating margin declining towards 30%, unfavourable changes in the national tax policy, debt rising beyond Fitch's expectations over the medium term and economic instability, even at the local level, could lead to a downgrade. A sovereign upgrade may be reflected in Lagos' ratings, provided that budgetary improvements reduce debt levels to 1x the budget size. Further improvement of the local economy giving additional boost to IGR would also be positive for the ratings.

The 47-year-old American posted a 77 on Friday, which left him 10-over-par after his first-round 73 and heading home for the first time in four outings at Southport. But Mickelson joked he had at least missed the cut  with flair  as he became another big-name casualty of swirling wind and biting cold on England's north-west coast.  You know, it's just one of those things where if it starts going bad in these conditions, it's just going to go bad. It's not that big a deal. Unfortunately it's the first cut I've missed this year and I missed it with flair,  he said. His early departure was disappointing for the crowd expecting more derring-do from last year's runner-up, who lost out after an epic duel with Henrik Stenson. But Mickelson has not won a tournament since 2013, when he tamed Muirfield to take his only British Open title, and earlier this year ended his long relationship with caddie Jim 'Bones' Mackay, who was replaced by Mickelson's brother Tim at Birkdale.  What Tim did was kept it fun,  said Mickelson.  And we made the best of it. We all go through days like this. And it's part of the game. I don't want to put too much stock in it, because I've really been hitting the ball well and playing well.  Mickelson blamed poor preparation for his disappointing showing.  I think playing a week before at the Scottish (Open) is very helpful, and it may have made a difference,  he said.

He was told about the burglary after finishing his first-round 69 on Thursday and, after hastily organising new gear, he returned to the course to shoot a 73 that left him two over par for the tournament, nine shots behind the leader.  Of course, it was not the afternoon, evening that we wanted yesterday to get the news,  Stenson told reporters.  I was still out here getting physio treatment. It was kind of surreal and to find out that my suitcase and all my clothes were gone, that was a bit weird.  Stenson said he still had dirty laundry in another bag.  I managed to wash some of that up. Boss provided some other stuff. And yeah, we can keep on going, obviously. But it's not happy news is it?,  he said. Stenson had returned the Claret Jug trophy he won last year to tournament organisers earlier in the week.   We were very sorry to hear about the burglary and have offered any assistance we can provide to Henrik and his family,  a spokesman for the Royal & Ancient golf club said. The thieves failed to spot Stenson's carry-on bag.   If they're listening, they didn't get the full jackpot, but they got obviously a lot of valuables, watches and other things,  he said.  But they were clearly targeting me because they were there when I was out playing and they figured out that the house was empty.  Stenson believes social media may have been a factor in the incident.  Obviously, I had a car this week with The Open logo,  he said.  I took pictures with some people that obviously I don't suspect in any way, but you know how social media works, if someone takes a picture in front of the house it might be tagged where the picture was taken and someone puts one and one together.

While Rory McIlroy fed off the home support with two birdies in his first three holes and an outward-nine 31, his American playing partner grappled with the elements at the British Open as swirling crosswinds and drying greens tested his game to the limit. A slightly despondent Johnson finished on 72, two over for the day and three over for the tournament, which will be good enough to make the cut but probably insufficient to mount a genuine tournament challenge. A bogey at the last, after finding one of Birkdale's 123 bunkers, summed up his difficult day.   I guess I'm just not playing that good. I hit a pretty good drive on the last hole, I just didn't think I was going to reach that bunker,  he said.  You hit it in a bunker, and you're going to have a tough time getting a par.  That represented a disappointing end to an otherwise solid back nine, with birdies on 12 and 15 and only one other bogey on 13. While his Irish playing partner was brought up on links golf, Johnson has found the conditions a world away from the South Carolina courses on which he honed his technique. But he chose not to offer the weather as an excuse.  I wish I could blame it on the wind. Just struggling a bit with the irons, not hitting the shots I wanted to. I hit a few good shots out there. But today was really tough,  he said.      Yesterday I just didn't play very well. But today was very difficult. I felt like I drove it all right.  Generally he showed control, although one wild shot at the ninth struck a journalist for the Irish Times on the face. Unlike Thursday, when the outward nine proved harder, the inward holes were more testing on Friday when crosswinds disrupted everyone's line.  You get a couple of holes -- not too many holes in the wind, maybe two holes downwind, maybe a couple of tee shots, 1 and 10 and 4 is about the only holes you get downwind, the rest of them are crosswind. It seems like today we played a lot of in and across,  he said. Although Johnson maintained he can still post  a good score  on Saturday to get himself  back in the tournament , he knows his chances of a first British Open title to add to last year's US Open triumph may have gone. For McIlroy it could be a different story.  Yeah, he's playing pretty good. He's 1-under par. That's pretty good through two rounds. Obviously got off to a rough start yesterday, but battled back.

Five of the past six winners have been 39 or older and so what better time and place for Kuchar, who has won $40 million on tour, to shed his tag as highest earner without a major. On the course where the American made his British Open debut in 1998, Kuchar posted a second-round one-over-par 71 to claim the early clubhouse lead on four under par on Friday. Afterwards Kuchar made for the TV lounge, where he anticipated  some fun  watching afternoon starters Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka, compatriots with whom he shared the overnight lead, grapple with the gathering wind.  There's a whole lot of trouble to be had, and trying to hit solid shots that the wind is going to affect the least is challenging,  he said after completing a calmly efficient round that included four bogeys -- two in the last three holes -- and three birdies.  What people enjoy about the British Open is watching the hard wind, the rain, the guys just trying to survive out there. Today is my day. I get to kick back in the afternoon and watch the guys just try to survive (which) is pretty much all you can do.  So in my situation, having been out there and posted a nice round, now I get to watch (which) is fun.  Superb Chip After bogeying the second, Kuchar looked in danger of dropping another at the third but responded with a superb chip from off the green to bag a birdie. A further red score followed at the short fourth before he expertly negotiated trouble at the back of the green on the sixth to save par on one of the course's hardest holes.  Conditions were really hard today,  he said.  Nearly opposite wind of what we had yesterday. So the course played completely differently.  And this wind, it felt like every hole was a crosswind hole. It felt like you had to play for so much curve on the ball. The wind was so strong. It was quite a trying, challenging day.  Under such circumstances, any score around par was creditable and Kuchar looks much better suited to dealing with tricky conditions than in his early years when he missed the cut in six of his first seven stabs at the tournament.  Last week he finished tied fourth in the Scottish Open and knows he is now well placed for Sunday's final shakedown.  I don't come in with a game plan, so I did not have to make any changes,  he said.  Each hole presents new challenges and I wait until I get there to see what challenge is presented to me and try to make the best of it.

The Northern Irishman started his opening round poorly before battling back to post a 71 and he mastered fierce crosswinds to pick up three birdies in the first six holes of round two at Royal Birkdale. After bogeying the 13th and 15th, McIlroy calmly rolled in an eight-foot birdie putt at the 17th and finished at one under par to stay firmly in contention to win his fifth major title.  To be under-par for this championship after the way I started, I'm ecstatic with that,  the 28-year-old told reporters.  I think anything around even par today is going to be a great score.  I got off to a good start, which I think is important today. The back nine is playing really, really difficult. So to birdie three of the first six and give myself that little bit of a cushion to play with was nice.  McIlroy has endured a frustrating season as he struggled to cope with a rib injury and he was not among the favorites before the tournament to secure a second British Open victory. He cut a dejected figure after slumping to five over par after six holes on Thursday, but the spring has clearly returned to his step.  I was very proud of myself that I hung in there and tried to stay as positive as I possibly could,  he said.  I just had to turn it around.

The issue ratings on Denmark's senior long-term unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'AAA'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AAA', and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F1+'. The issue ratings on short-term debt issues have also been affirmed at 'F1+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Denmark's ratings reflect a wealthy, high-value-added and diversified economy that is supported by strong institutions and a track record of macroeconomic policy credibility. External finance metrics are strong. Danish households' high gross debt levels present risks to the macroeconomic outlook, although these are mitigated by high savings and net household wealth. The Danish economy grew at a relatively robust pace in 2016, at 1.7%, following weak outturns in 2H15. The main drivers of growth were investment (+5.6% in 2016) and private consumption (+2.1%). Investment in 2016 expanded at the fastest pace since 2006. Residential investment rose by 11%, in the context of rising house prices. However, on a five-year average, real GDP growth has been weaker than peers (1.2% compared with the 'AAA' median of 2.0%). The investment to GDP ratio is still slightly lower than the 'AAA' median despite the strong rise in capital spending. GDP growth in 1Q17 was estimated at 0.6% qoq. We expect the growth momentum to be maintained over the year and forecast real GDP growth of 2.1%. Growth is expected to slow to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019. We expect domestic demand to be the main driver of growth. Net trade will boost growth this year, as growth prospects in Denmark's main trading partners improve. Improving growth prospects will translate into positive labour market dynamics. The unemployment rate averaged 6.2% in 2016, and we expect it to decline over the next three years, averaging 5.6% this year, before falling to 5.2% by 2019. Residential property prices have been rising since 2012, with price increases the strongest for flats in the main urban areas. Prices of flats in Copenhagen in real terms are now around 4% higher than the peak in 2006. Measures that may have a stabilising effect on property prices and the build-up of debt are being implemented. The Danish authorities have introduced a debt-to-income limit of 400% for borrowers taking out mortgages with variable rates or deferred amortisation in Copenhagen and Aarhus. Political parties in Denmark have agreed on reforms to property taxation that will take effect from 2021. Household indebtedness remains high (around 243% of disposable income at end-2016), even though the overall debt-to-income ratio has been declining since 2009. Historically low interest rates mean that interest payments are a very low proportion of income (around 2.5% of net disposable income). Moreover, the net asset position of the household sector in Denmark is strongly positive with net wealth of 1.7x GDP at end-2016. At the same time, low interest rates are encouraging households to take on relatively higher levels of mortgage debt, in the context of expectations of higher property prices. The general government deficit narrowed to 0.9% of GDP in 2016 from 1.4% in 2015. The reduction in the deficit was driven by expenditure restraint, which more than offset a decline in the revenue to GDP ratio. We expect the deficit to widen to 1.4% of GDP this year, due mainly to lower revenues from the pension yield tax. In 2018 and 2019 lower expenditure as a share of GDP will push the deficit down to 0.6%. Our public finance projections imply a further decline in the government debt to GDP ratio. The government debt ratio stood at 37.7% at end-2016 (down from 39.6% in 2015, and slightly lower than the 'AAA' median of 42%). We expect the debt ratio to fall to 35.5% by 2019. Denmark has a structural current account surplus (averaging just over 6% of GDP over the past decade). This resulted in the country becoming a net external creditor (net external debt was estimated at -11% at end-2016). The net international investment position is strongly positive (estimated at 53.5% of GDP at end-2016), reflecting the strong balance sheets of the Danish private sector. The current account surplus (8.1% of GDP in 2016, compared with an 'AAA' median of 6.4%) is expected to edge down over the next three years to 7.1%. Fitch assesses the Danish banking system to be resilient with an average standalone rating of 'a'. The Danish central bank's stress tests indicate that even in a severe recession, systemically important banks would still maintain statutory minimum capital requirements by 2019. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Denmark a score equivalent to a rating of 'AA' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Macroeconomic factors: +1 notch, to reflect the track record of strong macroeconomic policymaking underpinned by a 30-year exchange rate peg to Germany. - External finances: +1 notch, to reflect Denmark's strong net external creditor position, large positive net international investment position, and the exchange rate peg. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that downside risks to the rating are currently moderate. However, future developments that could individually or collectively result in negative rating action include: - A severe macroeconomic shock - potentially originating in the household sector - leading to a sharp deterioration in the public finances through higher deficits and lower GDP growth - Persistent weak growth performance resulting in a deterioration of key credit metrics KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the Danish krone peg to the euro under the ERM2 remains in place. Fitch expects the global economy to perform in line with the projections included in the latest Global Economic Outlook, in particular eurozone GDP growth of 2.0% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018, and 1.4% in 2019.

The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'B+' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Cabo Verde's ratings balance high levels of public and external debt, significant contingent liabilities and the economy's heavy reliance on the tourism sector, against a predominantly concessional public and external debt stock and solid governance indicators relative to the 'B' median. Cabo Verde has the highest public debt/GDP amongst Fitch-rated sub-Sahara African sovereigns, forecast at 128.5% at end-2016. Debt/GDP has risen from being in line with the 'B' median at 57.2% in 2008 as the previous government embarked on a large countercyclical public infrastructure investment programme following the global financial crisis and sought to take advantage of concessionary borrowing. Weak growth during the global financial and eurozone sovereign debt crises, appreciation of the non-euro external debt stock and financing of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOE) also contributed to the rapid rise in public debt/GDP. Fitch forecasts public debt/GDP to peak in 2017 at 131.1%, before falling gradually to 100.6% by 2026 due to the government's fiscal consolidation measures and faster nominal GDP growth. Public debt reduction will largely be dependent on Cabo Verde's growth performance and on the government's fiscal stance, but could also be accelerated if the government resolves stock-flow payments and lending to the SOEs. Fitch forecasts the 2017 general government deficit to worsen temporarily to 3.1% of GDP (2016: 2.4%) due to base effects from under-spending on public investments in 2016, before falling to 1.7% by 2019. In Fitch's view, there is some risk of fiscal slippage arising from the authorities' plan to cut public investments. The 2017 budget continues the government's fiscal consolidation strategy focused on revenue administration improvements and gradual cuts in public investments and in particular front-loading cuts to domestic-finance capital spending, aimed at crowding-in the private sector. The earmarking of roughly 20% of expenditures by the government for freezing in the event of revenue underperformance is expected to mitigate risks of fiscal slippage in current expenditure. Risks from the high debt/GDP level are mitigated by a high degree of concessionality (96% of debt is concessional, with a further 3.3% of bilateral loans considered semi-concessional) on the debt stock and low debt servicing levels. The average maturity of the debt was 22 years, while 94% of the debt is fixed rate. At end 2016, 22% of total debt was in local currency, 61% of the external debt was in euros, 20% in XDR and 7% in USD, with the CVE/EUR peg mitigating external financing risks. SOE-related contingent liabilities are high and were last estimated by the government at 26.3% of GDP at end-2015. These relate mainly to the wholly state-owned airline (TACV), housing and tourism real estate company (IFH) and utilities company (Electra). The government has successfully restructured Electra to stem the need for further state support, but continues to provide significant extra-budgetary support for TACV and IFH, estimated at 4.5% of GDP in 2016. TACV's domestic routes were sold to a foreign competitor in May 2017, but it is yet to conclude a sale for the rest of the airline. The government is also planning to privatise IFH along with other SOEs. Fitch forecasts real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2017, accelerating to 4.1% in 2018-19, but lower than the government's forecast of 5.0% for 2017 (recently lowered from 5.5%). Growth will be driven by robust tourist arrivals and a large portfolio of tourism-related FDI over the coming years. Real GDP growth slowed marginally in 1Q17 to 3.6%yoy from 3.9% yoy in 4Q16 following very strong growth in the peak 4Q16 tourist season. Tourism, the mainstay of the economy, accounted for 28% of GDP in 2016, and is experiencing tailwinds from strong euro area growth and brisk UK tourist arrivals. Cabo Verde's economy lacks natural resources and is heavily reliant on imports of food and energy, making the economy vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. It runs a structural current account deficit despite strong remittances and tourism receipts. The current account deficit narrowed in 2016 to 3.9% of GDP (2015: 4.9%) reflecting improvements in tourism receipts and current transfers, but was offset by a higher import bill due to two airplanes and the rise in international prices. Fitch forecasts the current account deficit to widen to 5.0% in 2017 and 8.7% by 2019 as private consumption and FDI led growth increases the import bill. Strong emigrant remittances support the current account balance while strong inward-FDI limit the rise of external debt-financing  due to the current account deficit. Net external debt has fallen to 46.1% of GDP in 2016 from a peak of 54.3% of GDP in 2013. External debt comprises primarily public external borrowing and stable diaspora deposits, with external financing risks mitigated by low concessional borrowing rates and long maturities. The bulk of external debt is euro-denominated and supported by the CVE/EUR peg and high reserves coverage that is forecast to rise to 7.3months of external payments in 2017. Cabo Verde's governance indicators significantly outperform the 'B' median and are more in line with the 'BBB' median, reflecting the strong and democratic institutions, and underpins strong confidence for concessionary financing and foreign investments. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Cabo Verde a score equivalent to a rating of 'B+' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect the country's high public debt stock and the risk of the large stock of SOE contingent liabilities materialising on the sovereign's balance sheet. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that risks to the rating are broadly balanced. The main factors that individually or collectively, could trigger negative rating action are: - A rise in the public debt/GDP ratio, resulting from failure to consolidate the public accounts or from the materialisation of contingent liabilities. - Declining growth prospects. - A sharp increase in the sovereign's debt service burden. The main factors that individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: - A marked decline in the public debt/GDP ratio - An improvement in medium term growth potential KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes the peg with the euro will remain. Fitch assumes that concessional financing to Cabo Verde will continue to decline in line with the country's graduation to middle income status, resulting in a decline in public investments and a gradual reduction in the budget deficits. Fitch assumes eurozone growth will be broadly in line with our forecast of 2.0% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018.

The issue ratings on Turkey's senior unsecured foreign-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BB+'. Turkey's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR has been affirmed at 'BBB-' and the issue ratings on Turkey's senior unsecured local-currency bonds have also affirmed at 'BBB-'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB-' and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at 'B'. The Short-Term Local-Currency IDR has been affirmed at 'F3' and the issue ratings on Turkey's senior unsecured short-term local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'F3'. The issue ratings on Turkey's Hazine Mustesarligi Varlik Kiralama Anonim Sirketi's foreign-currency and local-currency global certificates (sukuk) have been affirmed at 'BB+' and 'BBB-', respectively. KEY RATING DRIVERS Turkey's IDRs reflect the following key rating drivers: Turkey's ratings balance high external financing vulnerabilities, pronounced political and geopolitical risks and high levels of inflation and macroeconomic volatility against low public debt ratios backed by a long commitment to fiscal stability and strong growth performance. Structural indicators are generally superior to peers. Constitutional changes that enhance the power of the presidency were narrowly approved at a referendum in April. The implementation of the full provisions of the new constitution will be completed by new elections, which need to be held by November 2019. In Fitch's opinion, constitutional reform has entrenched a system in which checks and balances have been eroded and has somewhat polarised the country. Fitch expects strengthening the economy to have moved up the government's policy agenda in the realisation that stronger performance will be necessary to bolster political support. Temporary stimulus measures have boosted growth so far in 2017. There has been little progress on structural reform. Political and geopolitical risks weigh on Turkey's ratings. The purge of the followers of the group that the government considers responsible for the coup attempt in July 2016 continues and a state of emergency remains in place. The pace of the purge has slowed, but its scope continues to unnerve some economic actors. Security incidents have been confined to the unresolved conflict in the south east so far in 2017. Stimulus measures will weaken fiscal performance in 2017. Fitch forecasts a widening of the general government deficit to 3.1% of GDP, the largest since 2010, but in line with the 'BB' median. Temporary fiscal measures include tax exemptions for consumer durables and an employment scheme under which the government absorbs some costs for new private sector employees. Financial support facilitating a jump in lending backed by the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) could also impact the sovereign balance sheet. Continuation of stimulus measures once the recovery becomes entrenched could raise questions over the commitment to fiscal discipline. The space for countercyclical fiscal policy is underpinned by government debt metrics that are much stronger than peer medians. Debt/GDP in both gross and net terms and debt/revenues are all well below the 'BB' and 'BBB' medians. The rise in debt/GDP in 2016 was due primarily to exchange rate effects, which have subsided, and Fitch expects debt/GDP to remain around the current level of 28.3% over our forecast period to end-2019. Contingent liabilities are rising, but from a low base and are unlikely to have a material impact on government finances over the forecast period. Economic growth has rebounded and is expected to remain above the peer median. Growth was 5% yoy in 1Q17, with momentum supported by government incentives and an improved external environment; tailwinds that continued into 2Q. Fitch assumes the pace of growth will ease in 2H, as tax incentives and CGF lending may have brought forward demand. Nonetheless, a potentially smoother political environment, early signs of a recovery in the tourism sector and a stronger external environment should support solid performance over the forecast period. Fitch's growth projections, which average 4.3% between 2017 and 2019, compare favourably with the 'BB' median of 3.5%, but are well below Turkey's 2011-2015 average of 7.1%. The current account deficit is large relative to peers and persistent. Higher commodity prices have caused a renewed widening of the deficit, although exchange rate-induced import compression and an improvement in export conditions will limit the deterioration of the current account deficit in 2017. Ongoing security concerns mean that tourism revenues will be well down on 2013-2015 levels over the forecast period. Financing of current account deficits will keep net external debt on an upward trend. Fitch's end-2017 forecast of 32.1% of GDP compares with a 'BB' median of 19.3%. External vulnerabilities are a key credit weakness. The gross external financing requirement is very large, at an estimated USD193 billion in 2017, and the international liquidity ratio is 84.4, against a 'BB' median of 151.5, despite some lengthening of external maturities. Turkey's strained international liquidity position makes it vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. Evolving domestic and external conditions have raised external financing costs and could further test Turkey's ongoing resilience in external financing. Net international reserves are around one-third of the gross end-December level of USD107.2 billion (5.6 months of CXP), and gross reserves are on a slow but sustained downward path. Central bank actions, combined with global investor sentiment, have allowed the lira to recover from a sharp fall around the turn of the year. The average funding rate has been increased by 365 basis points so far this year through adjustments to some central bank rates and to the proportion of funding allocated at each rate. The move has been effective, but it reversed a move towards policy simplification that began in 2016. Exchange rate pass-through has pushed inflation into double digits. Fitch's annual average forecast of 10.7% for 2017 would be the highest since 2003. Two-year inflation expectations have been more stable, but at 7.9% compare unfavourably to the CBRT's 5% target. Inflation has persistently overshot targets and is well in excess of peers. Banks have been hit by the weaker economy and rising financing costs, but are proving resilient. Headline non-performing loans are low and stable at around 3% of total loans. However, the volume of at-risk restructured and watch-list loans has increased. Sector capitalisation, supported by adequate NPL reserve coverage, is sufficient to absorb moderate shocks, but is sensitive to further lira depreciation given the high level of foreign currency loans on banks' balance sheets, and further asset quality weakening as loans season. Credit growth has been temporarily boosted by CGF-backed lending, but at the cost of a squeeze of local currency liquidity. Banks have been active in tapping the international capital markets so far in 2017. Sector foreign currency liquidity is broadly adequate to cover banks' maturing wholesale funding liabilities due within a year, although it could come under pressure in the case of a prolonged market closure. Turkey is a large and diversified economy with a vibrant private sector. Human Development and Doing Business indicators, as measured by the World Bank, are in excess of the 'BB' median. GDP per capita is double the peer median, though the volatility of economic growth is well in excess of peers reflecting a vulnerability to regular domestic and external shocks. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Turkey a score equivalent to a rating of BBB on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External finances: -1 notch, to reflect a very high gross external financing requirement and very low international liquidity ratio. - Structural features: -1 notch, to reflect the ongoing risk of serious terrorist attacks and a political environment that may continue to affect economic policy-making and performance. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that, individually, or collectively, could lead to negative rating action are: - Heightened stresses stemming from external financing vulnerabilities. - Weaker public finances reflected by a deterioration in the government debt/GDP ratio to a level closer to the peer median. - A deterioration in the political or security situation. The main factors that, individually, or collectively, could lead to positive rating action are: - Implementation of reforms that address structural deficiencies and reduce external vulnerabilities. - A political and security environment that supports a pronounced improvement in key macroeconomic data. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Economic relations with key trading partners will not deteriorate seriously. - Fitch forecasts Brent Crude to average USD52.5/b in 2017, USD55/b in 2018 and USD60/b in 2019.

The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AA+' and the Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'F2'. The long- and short-term issue ratings on Spain's senior unsecured foreign and local currency debt have also been affirmed at 'BBB+'/'F2'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The revision of the Outlook to Positive reflects the following key rating drivers and their relative weights: MEDIUM Near-term budget implementation risks have reduced, and Fitch expects faster deficit reduction in 2017 than in recent years. Approval for the 2017 budget has been secured, and the 2018 expenditure ceiling has been agreed, at 1.3% above this year's ceiling. We forecast a fall in the general government deficit from 4.5% of GDP in 2016, to 3.2% this year and 2.5% next, driven by the cyclical economic recovery. Two-thirds of the deficit reduction this year is expected to fall on the expenditure side, with revenue measures agreed since late last year, particularly for corporate tax, supporting a 0.4% of GDP increase in revenues. Economic recovery remains strong and relatively broad-based, with some further progress made in reducing macroeconomic imbalances. GDP growth in 1H17 matched last year's 3.2%, fuelled by strong labour market dynamics. Unemployment fell to 17.7% in May from 20.2% a year earlier, helped by greater labour market flexibility from earlier structural reforms. Deleveraging has continued, with private sector non-financial debt falling 6.6pp in the year to 1Q17 (and 48.9pp since 2010) to 165.2% of GDP. Fitch forecasts GDP growth of 3.1% in 2017 with higher private investment offsetting the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and the dampening effect of higher inflation on consumer spending. We forecast a moderation in GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018 and 2.2% in 2019 as spare capacity in the economy is steadily absorbed. Spain's external adjustment has continued, with the current account surplus increasing to 2.0% of GDP in 2016, from 1.4% in 2015. This was driven by an improvement in the trade balance, and export volumes have grown strongly in 1Q17. The current account balance has improved by 11.7% of GDP since the onset of the financial crisis, with exports accounting for more of the adjustment in recent years, supported by a fall in unit labour costs (of 2.5% in 2016 and 15.6% since 2009) and a greater propensity of Spanish firms to export. Fitch forecasts a moderate reduction in the current account surplus, to 1.7% of GDP in 2019. Net external debt fell to 84.6% of GDP in 2016, from 92.0% in 2015, but is still elevated and compares with a 'BBB' rating median of 3.2% of GDP. The 'BBB+' IDRs also reflect the following key rating drivers: Spain has a diversified and high value-added economy (with GDP per capita almost three times the 'BBB' median), strong institutions relative to rating peers, an extremely low average yield at issuance (currently 0.7%), and a negligible share of foreign currency debt. Set against this are Spain's very high level of gross general government debt to GDP (GGGD/GDP), an external leverage amongst the highest of Fitch-rated countries, the still high unemployment rate, and political risk. Fitch forecasts a reduction in GGGD/GDP to 98.8% in 2017 and 97.9% in 2018, from 99.4% in 2016 (having peaked at 100.4% in 2014). This is a similar reduction to the previous two years despite the falling deficit, due to changes in stock-flow assumptions. In 2015 and 2016, large debt-reducing adjustments (totalling 2.1% of GDP and 1.6% respectively), including from the sale of financial assets and a reduction in central government deposits, more than offset sizeable fiscal slippage. By contrast, we assume a positive stock-flow adjustment of 0.4% of GDP in 2017, in line with the current Stability Programme. According to our long-term debt sustainability analysis, GGGP/GDP continues to fall only gradually, to 95.3% in 2020, and 91.4% in 2026, and compares with a 'BBB' median of 41.2%. We expect tensions between the central and Catalonia regional government to increase over the next few months, but without any significant disruption to the economy or government functioning. The Catalonia regional government has announced it will hold a referendum on independence, on 1 October, which is likely to be declared unconstitutional in the Spanish courts. It is currently unclear how the referendum process would then play out. Fitch also considers that differing policy priorities within the Catalonia regional coalition government increase the likelihood of an early regional election, particularly if any referendum does not deliver a decisive outcome in favour of secession. More broadly, Fitch does not observe progress this year in advancing measures that we consider would form the basis of a mutually acceptable agreement between the national and Catalonia regional government. The Spanish constitution does not allow for full independence, and our base-case assumption continues to be that there will be a settlement on regional reform and greater autonomy for Catalonia within Spain, but that this will be a challenging and potentially drawn-out process. The near-term stability of the minority PP government has been bolstered by the recent approval of the 2017 budget. Agreement on the 2018 expenditure ceiling has also increased the likelihood of securing approval for the 2018 budget, and should this not be forthcoming there is the possibility of rolling forward this year's budget. However, there is a risk that further into the parliament it will prove harder to sustain opposition support and we continue to see limited prospects of substantial new economic reform, particularly as the potential for policy support from the Socialist Party has diminished over recent months, in our view. The government is instead expected to focus on protecting earlier structural reforms, with only limited new measures, for example on active labour market programmes. There has been a steady improvement in Spanish banks' credit fundamentals. The NPL ratio fell by 1pp in the year to April, to 8.9%, and problem real estate assets have also declined at most banks, while the CET1 capital ratio has edged up to 12.8% from 12.6% a year earlier. The resolution of Banco Popular has not materially affected our overall view of the sector, as it was a bank-specific issue dealt with effectively and without recourse to public funds. The key challenge continues to be to further improve asset quality, pressures on profitability from low interest rate margins, intense competition, and the phase-in of additional regulatory requirements. Aggregate credit has continued to fall, but new loan growth is recovering more quickly, helping support better-quality, more productive activities. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Spain a score equivalent to a rating of 'AA-' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. In accordance with its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee decided to adjust the rating indicated by the SRM by more than the usual maximum range of +/-3 notches because in our view conditions justified a 4-notch adjustment to reflect the following:- - Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect public debt at 99% of GDP; the SRM is estimated on the basis of a linear approach to GGGD/GDP and does not fully capture the increased risks at such a high level of debt. - External Finances: -2 notches, to reflect: a) Spain's very high net external debt, which is not captured in the SRM; and b) the +2-notch SRM enhancement for  reserve currency status  has been adjusted to +1-notch given Spain's financial crisis experience. - Structural Features: -1 notch, to reflect downside political risks of a disorderly resolution of the Catalan government's call for independence. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may, individually or collectively, result in positive rating action: - Lower risk of disorderly resolution of tensions between the central and Catalan regional governments. - Further progress in reducing the budget deficit at the general government level, leading to a firm downward trend in public debt to GDP. - Improvement in Spain's external balance sheet. - Increased confidence of stronger long-run growth potential without creating macroeconomic imbalances, particularly if supported by structural reforms. As the Outlook is Positive, Fitch does not anticipate developments with a high likelihood of triggering a downgrade. However, the following factors, individually or collectively, could result in negative rating action: - An increase in general government debt to GDP, for example from loosening of Spain's fiscal policy stance, crystallisation of sizeable contingent liabilities or weaker GDP growth. - Heightened tensions between Catalonia regional and central government. - Emergence of a current account deficit, further weakening the net external position. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Fitch's long-term debt sustainability analysis assumes a primary fiscal surplus that averages 0.3% of GDP from 2017-2026, GDP growth that averages 1.7%, and a steady increase in marginal interest rates. - There is broad political stability, and Catalonia remains part of Spain. The Catalonia regional government's planned referendum on independence does not result in disorderly events that significantly disrupt economic activity.

The raids are set to begin on Sunday and continue through Wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The teenagers targeted will be 16- and 17-years-old. The raids represent a sharp departure from practices during the presidency of Barack Obama. Under Obama, minors could be targeted for deportation if they had been convicted of crimes, but were not arrested simply for suspected gang activity or membership. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that a person can be identified as a gang member if they meet two or more criteria, including having gang tattoos, frequenting an area notorious for gangs and wearing gang apparel. The agency said it does not comment on plans for future law enforcement operations, but that it focuses on individuals who pose a threat to national security and public safety. The memo instructing field offices to prepare for the raids was dated June 30. A Department of Homeland Security official speaking on background confirmed on Friday the raids were still scheduled to take place, though ICE could still change its plans. Trump, who campaigned on the promise of tough immigration enforcement, has made deporting gang members, especially those belonging to the El Salvador-based Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a top priority.  You have a gang called MS-13. They don't like to shoot people. They like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe,  Trump said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa last month. In a May speech, the president promised the gang would be  gone from our streets very soon, believe me.  'This Is Troubling' Although children can be deported like adults, U.S. immigration law considers minors arriving at the border without a parent or guardian particularly vulnerable and gives them additional protections. Minors apprehended entering the country without a guardian are placed in custody arrangements by U.S. Health and Human Services, often with a family member living in the United States. Law enforcement agencies maintain databases of individuals suspected of having gang affiliations, but the lists have come under fire from civil rights groups. Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, said the databases often contain inaccurate information.  This is troubling on several levels,  Hincapie said.  For one, the gang databases in places like California are rife with errors. We have seen babies labeled as potential gang members.  Immigration lawyer David Leopold of Ulmer & Berne said innocent children could be swept up in the raids.  In many cases, children don’t freely decide to join a gang. They are threatened by older gang members and forced to get a gang tattoo if they live in a certain neighborhood,  he said. The raids planned for next week will also target parents who crossed the border illegally with their children and have been ordered deported by a judge, and immigrants who entered the country as children without guardians and have since turned 18, according to the memo. The document directs field offices to identify people in their areas that meet the criteria. The Obama administration targeted those two groups in 2016 raids that sought to deter a surge of illegal border crossings by families and minors that began in 2014. Obama, however, directed immigration agents to prioritize for deportation only those who had committed serious crimes or had recently entered the country.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-raids-idUSL1N1KC1FL"},

Trump,US,CANADA,IMMIGRATION,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Canada,United States","sector":"World","content":"TORONTO (Reuters) - The number of asylum seekers walking across the U.S. border into Canada rose in June after dropping in the previous two months, according to government figures released on Friday.  There were 884 refugee claimants who crossed the border between formal crossings and were picked up by Royal Canadian Mounted Police last month, bringing the total for the first half of 2017 to 4,345, the data showed. Slideshow (5 Images)The vast majority, 88 percent, of June's crossers went to the province of Quebec, a marked contrast from previous months where upwards of 100 a month went to the prairie province of Manitoba.     Many asylum seekers whom Reuters has spoken to said they left the United States because they feared deportation in light of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.  Once in Canada, they are detained and held for questioning and security screening before being allowed to file refugee claims. However, time spent in the United States may put them at a disadvantage.  The influx of border-crossers is part of a rising number of refugee claimants in Canada, with 2017 on track to have the highest number of claims since at least 2011. The higher numbers are contributing to worsening delays in refugee hearings. The Canadian government has resisted calls to stop turning asylum seekers back at land border crossings under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement, which advocates say is the reason so many are crossing illegally.

On Friday, the Hall of Fame center ended speculation that he could be involved with a group looking to purchase the team by issuing a statement through China's Xinhua news agency.  I have no time to consider anything else (including buying the Houston Rockets),  Yao said. Since retiring from the Rockets in 2011, Yao has been involved with the China Basketball Association, initially as an owner of his hometown Shanghai Sharks. He was elected Thursday as the chairman of the company that runs the league and was named league president in February. Yao was the first overall pick by the Rockets in 2002. He was an eight-time All-Star and averaged 19 points and 9.2 rebounds in 486 career regular-season games during a nine-year career that was plagued by foot injuries and ankle injuries. He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016 in the same class as Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson. Yao's statement occurred after longtime owner Leslie Alexander announced Monday he was putting the Rockets up for sale. The 73-year-old Alexander bought the franchise for $85 million in 1993. Forbes valued the franchise in February at $1.65 billion -- eighth-most valuable in the league -- with revenue of $244 million. Alexander had immediate success as an owner as the Rockets won NBA titles over the New York Knicks in 1994 and the Orlando Magic in 1995 behind the play of Hakeem Olajuwon. Alexander put CEO Tad Brown in charge to  oversee the sales process with the league office, supported by my management team.  Brown made the announcement during Monday's news conference at Toyota Center. He said Alexander told him  it can wear on you after so many decades.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled down $1.15 or 2.45 percent, at $45.77 a barrel.      This turn around late in the week is suggestive that the concerns that drove us to 42 are still driving us lower,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. Both Brent and U.S. crude posted weekly losses of more than 1.6 percent after Petro-Logistics said OPEC crude production would rise 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month. Petro-Logistics, which tracks OPEC supply forecasts, said this would take the group's combined output above 33 million bpd. Higher supply from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Nigeria would drive this month's gains, it said. OPEC and some non-OPEC states, such as Russia, have been trying to cut production 1.8 million bpd through the end of March 2018.  On Monday several ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC member countries will meet in St. Petersburg. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq, whose country heads the joint ministerial committee, said attendees would discuss continuing the production cuts. The committee can make recommendations to adjust the deal if needed, but analysts expressed skepticism that the group will address rising production from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempted from the cuts.  There’s no expectation... that there’s going to be anything of substance in that meeting,  said Dan Katzenberg, senior analyst at Baird and Co in New York.  U.S. oil drillers cut one rig in the week to July 21, according to data from Baker Hughes. Analysts said the decline was likely a pause in a drilling recovery expected to continue through at least 2019. Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 18 by 36,267 contracts, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.      The discount of U.S. crude futures front-month versus the second-month CLc1-CLc2 briefly fell to just 12 cents per barrel during the trading session, the lowest since December 2014. This makes it less profitable for speculators to buy oil, sell it forward and store it in the meantime.

Petro-Logistics, which tracks OPEC supply forecasts, said this would take the group's combined output above 33 million bpd. Higher supply from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Nigeria would drive this month's gains, it said. OPEC and some non-OPEC states, such as Russia, have been trying to cut production 1.8 million bpd through the end of March 2018.  On Monday several ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC member countries will meet in St. Petersburg. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq, whose country heads the joint ministerial committee, said attendees would discuss continuing the production cuts. The committee can make recommendations to adjust the deal if needed, but analysts expressed skepticism that the group will address rising production from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempted from the cuts.  There’s no expectation... that there’s going to be anything of substance in that meeting,  said Dan Katzenberg, senior analyst at Baird and Co in New York.  U.S. oil drillers cut one rig in the week to July 21, according to data from Baker Hughes. Analysts said the decline was likely a pause in a drilling recovery expected to continue through at least 2019. Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 18 by 36,267 contracts, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.      The discount of U.S. crude futures front-month versus the second-month CLc1-CLc2 briefly fell to just 12 cents per barrel during the trading session, the lowest since December 2014. This makes it less profitable for speculators to buy oil, sell it forward and store it in the meantime.

The 41-year-old, who had to qualify for this week's event after being hampered by injury over the past year, did not let Friday's strong winds throw him off course as he finished the second round tied for third, three shots off leader Jordan Spieth.  On the scorecard it was a very boring round of golf, but it kind of wasn't from the perspective of how I had to kind of piece my way around this golf course,  said Poulter, who is bidding to become the first Englishman to win the British Open was Nick Faldo in 1992.  It was tricky. 35-mile-an-hour wind at times and it was  different wind than we had yesterday.  So the golf course played completely different. Holes that were hybrid, sand wedge were kind of driver, 4-iron today. So it really was a complete 180,  he added. Poulter's best ever major result came at this course in 2008 when he finished second to Padraig Harrington after surging up the leaderboard with a final round 69. Jul 21, 2017; Southport, ENG; Ian Poulter tees off the sixth hole during the second round of The 146th Open Championship golf tournament at Royal Birkdale Golf Club. Mandatory Credit: Steve Flynn-USA TODAY Sports I'm pulling hard this week on memories of how I remember 2008. I think the only memories I really have of 2008 was Sunday's round of golf, because I wasn't quite in position,  he said.  I mean, people were falling away, and I found myself moving up through the board. So every moment I'm on the golf course right now I'm thinking a lot about Sunday's round of golf in 2008.   Slideshow (8 Images)Poulter could be forgiven, as he sat out the past five majors, for wondering if he might get back to the kind of form that saw him finish tied for third in the 2013 British Open -- the last time he made the weekend's action. And he is clearly relishing being in the mix at the top of the leaderboard again.  It feels absolutely marvelous, it really does. Walking up 18, just walking from greens to tees was really pretty special today. Huge galleries and they were really pulling for me,  he said.   So it was really nice to be in position, keep churning out decent scores and keeping myself on the board. It was great.  I'm in a good frame of mind. I feel confident. The large confidence tank that was empty a few months ago is starting to fill up. And I like it when it gets full up. I play some of my best golf when I'm pretty confident. And I'm excited for this weekend; I can't wait.  Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-open-poulter-idUSKBN1A62G9"},

ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and noted that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that strength as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down. Draghi's apparent lack of concern about the strengthening euro convinced traders that the central bank remained on track to potentially begin tapering its bond-buying stimulus later this year.  The dollar index touched 93.854 .DXY, its lowest level since June of last year, and was last down about 0.5 percent at 93.885. The euro touched $1.1682 EUR=, its highest level against the dollar in nearly two years, and was last up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.1674.   The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro ... certainly gave the greenlight for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.  The euro was last on track to gain 1.8 percent for the week, which would mark its second straight weekly rise against the dollar. The dollar index was set to fall 1.3 percent to mark its second straight weekly decline. Against the yen, the dollar touched more than four-week low of 111.02 yen JPY=.  In addition to traders' expectations that the ECB was staying the course toward tightening monetary policy, investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign were viewed as obstacles to the administration's pro-growth agenda and negative for the dollar.   Compounding the (weaker dollar) move is this latest news on the political front in the U.S. about the Russia investigation expanding to Trump’s business affairs,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.   This is on top of the fact that Senate has not been able to pass anything meaningful on the healthcare front,  he said in reference to the collapse late on Monday of a Republican effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.  The dollar touched its lowest against the Swiss franc in more than a year at 0.9440 franc CHF=.

Sharp,KENTUCKY,LGBT/ (PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"LOUISVILLE (Reuters) - Kentucky must pay the legal fees of lawyers who represented couples denied marriage licenses in 2015 by a county clerk in the state, a federal judge ruled on Friday in a same-sex marriage case that garnered world attention. U.S. District Judge David Bunning ruled that county clerk Kim Davis herself was not liable to pay the more than $224,700 in fees and associated costs accrued by plaintiffs. In the days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, Davis, the Rowan County clerk, announced that she would no longer issue marriage licenses to any couple because same-sex marriage conflicted with her Apostolic Christian beliefs. The refusal made her a national symbol for opposition to the Supreme Court decision. Four couples, including two same-sex marriage couples, filed suit. Although Bunning issued an injunction at the time requiring Davis’ office to issue the licenses, she continued to refuse. Davis served five days in jail after Bunning ruled her in contempt of court. The couples' lawsuit was dismissed after Kentucky lawmakers approved changes to the marriage license form that removed the clerk’s name from it, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys, including lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, have continued to seek payment for their work. Bunning ruled on Friday that they were entitled to repayment, but he declined to make Davis responsible. “Davis represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky when she refused to issue marriage licenses to legally eligible couples,” he wrote in his order. “The buck stops there.” “(W)e hope this serves as a reminder to Kentucky officials that willful violations of individuals’ civil liberties, such as what occurred here, will not only be challenged but will also prove costly,” William Sharp, ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director, said in a statement on Friday. Mat Staver, Davis’ attorney, said in a phone interview on Friday that he disagreed with Bunning’s decision, but he was happy that neither his client nor the county had to pay the lawyers' fees. “We definitely consider it a victory,” said Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization. He said the ruling would likely put an end to other lawsuits against his client over the marriage-license standoff. Representatives for Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said in a statement that they were reviewing the opinion and had not made a decision on whether or not to appeal Friday's ruling.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kentucky-lgbt-idUSL1N1KC1CP"},

The teens, aged 16 to 18, were last seen Tuesday after the FIRST Global Robotics Challenge, Washington, D.C., police said.  We have been in touch with the Metropolitan Police Department; they told us that they are doing what they can to find those teens,  Benjamin Manirakiza, first counselor in the Burundi Embassy in Washington, said in a phone interview on Friday.  We have confidence in the capacity of the police.  A Washington police spokeswoman said the teenagers' disappearance was still under investigation on Friday, and declined to say what U.S. state they were spotted crossing from.  The teens left their hotel room key cards in a chaperone's bag, but took their clothes with them when they left, according to FIRST Global, the U.S. non-profit that organized the competition. Police have said they do not believe foul play was involved. Don Ingabire (L), 16 and Audrey Mwamikazi, 17, members of a teenage robotics team from the African nation of Burundi, who were reported missing after taking part in an international competition and later spotted crossing the United States border into Canada, are seen in pictures released by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., U.S. July 20, 2017.  Metropolitan Police Department/Handout via REUTERSTwo of the teens - Audrey Mwamikazi, 17, and 16-year-old Don Ingabire - were spotted crossing the United States border into Canada. The other missing Burundians were named as Nice Munezero, 17; Kevin Sabumukiza, 17; Richard Irakoze, 18; and Aristide Irambona, 18. Officials at Canada's Border Services Agency, the immigration and refugee ministry and the Burundian embassy in Ottawa, said they had no information on the teens' whereabouts. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to comment on the teens' whereabouts and said that anyone who crossed the border illegally would be returned to border services.  Crossing the Canadian border without reporting at a port of entry is illegal,  said spokeswoman Annie Deslile, in an e-mail.  If the individual who has illegally entered between ports of entry claims to be a refugee, he/she is then transported to a port of entry.  A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency had no information about the missing teens. High school students from more than 150 countries took part in the competition. An all-girl squad from Afghanistan drew worldwide attention when President Donald Trump intervened after they were denied U.S. visas. Burundi has long been plagued by civil war and other violence. Fighting has killed at least 700 people and forced 400,000 from their homes since April 2015.

The supporters of the Identitarian movement, which says it wants to preserve Europe's identity, have rented a ship to take them to international waters off the Libyan coast so they can monitor humanitarian rescuers, who they say collude with people smugglers who cram migrants onto dangerous boats.  There is a difference between saving lives and smuggling people to Europe,  Martin Sellner, an Austrian who is leading the effort, told Reuters at Catania's port.   What they are doing in fact is making millions of dollars for human trafficking rings,  he said. The activists, who are all in their 20s and early to mid-30s, will stay at sea about 10 days, but may renew the mission if it is successful, Sellner said. Charity groups operating rescue ships are concerned that the activists will try to disrupt them and put lives at risk.  The mission, which critics call a publicity stunt, is the latest in a series of accusations and media attacks against the non-governmental rescuers. In carefully choreographed videos posted on YouTube, the Identitarian message sounds much like that of Europe's far-right politicians, but Sellner characterizes the group as a  patriotic NGO  that is the  avant-garde of this patriotic shift in mainstream politics in Europe . The group is tapping into growing unease, especially in Italy, about immigration from North Africa that has brought more than a half a million impoverished migrants and refugees to Europe in less than four years. In that time, more than 13,000 have died trying to make the crossing. Next week the nine NGOs operating rescue missions are to meet with the Italian government, which wants them to sign a  code of conduct , capping months of controversy. The charities have repeatedly denied any ties to smugglers.  As a humanitarian organization, our biggest concern is the women, children and men that we rescue from unseaworthy boats,  a spokeswoman for SOS Mediterranee, which operates the Aquarius rescue ship, told Reuters.  Any attempt of interference would endanger the lives of people in need of protection.    Vigilantes  Former European Commissioner Emma Bonino talks with Reuters during an interview in Rome, Italy, July 20, 2017.Max RossiSo far this year sea migrant arrivals are approaching 100,000, 13 percent higher than last year, and some 200,000 asylum seekers are living in state-funded shelters.  I'm starting to have serious difficulties,  Catania's mayor, Enzo Bianco, told Reuters. The city's port took in 10,000 migrants during the first half of the year. An Ixe poll on Friday said 78 percent of Italians thought they had been abandoned by their European Union allies. But Bianco, a member of the ruling center-left Democratic Party, said he will seek to keep the C-Star, the ship rented by the Identitarians, from entering the city's port and  pouring fuel on the fire . Slideshow (4 Images) They are like vigilantes, people who take the law into their own hands without having any authority... the situation is too tense to be turned into the Wild West,  he said. The Identitarians are young and media savvy, quick to post their protests -- like when they hung a banner reading  secure borders, secure future  on the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin -- to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.  North American conservative YouTube pundits Lauren Southern and Brittany Pettibone are also supposed to go on their sea mission, but no mainstream news outlets will be on board.  To raise money for the operation, the Identitarians launched a website in May and have gathered some $170,000, enough to rent the 40-metre (yard) C-Star, which has been repeatedly delayed on its trip from its home port of Djibouti.  This massive immigration is changing the face of our streets, of our cities, and soon the people who have been living here for thousands of years will be an endangered minority,  Sellner said earlier this month when he announced the sea mission. Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister who is calling on Italy's government to come up with better integration policies, said the Identitarians are trying to capitalize on increasing discomfort among Italians. Poor migrants  sleep in the rail station or in the street or they cannot work, so people see them doing nothing. This is what makes people uneasy,  she said in an interview in her Rome home. Italians  would like this problem to be managed in a more human and regular way,  she said.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. PVTBTC's ratings reflect Fitch's view of institutional support from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC; Long-Term IDR 'AA-'). A full list of rating actions is at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT In June 2017, CIBC completed the previously announced acquisition of Chicago-based, The PrivateBank. While PVTBTC's $20.4 billion in total assets at March 31, 2017 is relatively small in the context of CIBC's overall balance sheet, the acquisition is consistent with CIBC's U.S. expansion strategy. The acquisition provides CIBC's Canadian clients with access to U.S. banking services and expands its middle-market commercial and private banking capabilities. CIBC's ratings were affirmed at 'AA-/F1+' on Oct. 28, 2016 as part of Fitch's periodic review of Canadian banks. The affirmation is supported by the company's solid franchise in Canada, sound capital levels, strong asset quality, continued earnings stability, strong funding and liquidity position, and favorable credit metrics such as gross impaired loans and loan impairment charge ratios relative to international peers. PVTBTC's IDRs are linked to its parent company, CIBC. As such, Fitch has assigned PVTBTC a Support Rating of '1', indicating that there is an extremely high probability of institutional support from CIBC, if needed. Consistent with Fitch's rating criteria, specifically regarding parent and subsidiary relationships, PVTBTC's 'A+/F1' ratings are one notch lower from its parent, CIBC. Fitch considers PVTBTC to be a  strategically important  subsidiary for CIBC reflecting its role within the CIBC group, the level of integration, separate branding between the two entities, and full ownership stake. Fitch believes the acquisition of PVTBTC by CIBC will improve PVTBTC's overall financial profile, particularly as it helps diversify PVTBTC's overall funding profile and support for continued loan growth. As with any merger or acquisition, there are operational and execution-related risks, particularly for CIBC which has a limited track record of bank acquisitions. Fitch notes that PVTBTC will operate independently following the merger, maintaining a separate management team. Nonetheless, Fitch believes related risks will be managed well within CIBC's central risk management infrastructure. Further, PVTBTC's balance sheet is modest in complexity and therefore should minimize disruptions. PVTBTC, a Chicago-based commercial bank, reported $20.4 billion in total assets at 1Q17. On a pro forma basis, this acquisition represented less than 5% of CIBC's assets, which is considered manageable for CIBC, and its projected Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is to remain above 10%, consistent with CIBC's strong credit profile. CIBC has acquired all of PVTBTC's assets. PVTBTC has 36 locations, including 23 full-service branches, $9.8 billion in assets under administration (AUA) and $16.7 billion of deposits for a revised purchase price of $5 billion, nearly a 32% increase in value compared to the initial $3.8 billion purchase price which had reflected a 24% premium of over PVTBTC's implied stock price. The acquisition gives CIBC entry to the Chicago market, which has attractive demographics and creates good prospects for U.S. loan growth. CIBC's U.S. corporate loan book will more than double from $10.6 billion to over $24 billion with PVTBTC's $15.6 billion total loan book. Additionally, the acquisition potentially complements CIBC's Atlantic Trust ($27.5 billion in AUA) business, giving its clients access to U.S. banking capabilities. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Fitch assigned The PrivateBank and Trust Company (PVTBTC) Long-Term and Short-Term deposit ratings of 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. PVTBTC's uninsured deposit ratings are one notch higher than the company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT RATING Fitch assigned PVTBTC an Institutional Support Rating of '1', reflecting the extremely high probability of institutional support from CIBC. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT The 'A+/F1' IDRs and senior unsecured debt ratings for PVTBTC are sensitive to any change in CIBC's ratings or change in Fitch's view of institutional support for PVTBTC. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT RATING PVTBTC's '1' Support Rating is sensitive to any change in Fitch's views regarding CIBC's propensity or ability to provide timely support to PVTBTC. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: The PrivateBank and Trust Company --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Long-Term deposits at 'AA-'; --Short-term deposits at 'F1+'; --Support at '1'.

Tensions flared last summer when Horton called Sun a  drug cheat  before ending the latter’s title defense in a tightly fought 400m freestyle final. Despite being only 21, Horton is one of Swimming Australia's team leaders in Budapest. But his views on Sun clearly haven't moderated nearly a year on from beating the London 2012 champion into silver in his Olympic debut. Asked if he was looking forward to resuming battle with Sun, Horton told a news conference:  I don’t think it's a rivalry. I think it's a rivalry between elite athletes and athletes who have tested positive. But there should be some good racing.  Horton was referring to Sun's three-month suspension for using a banned stimulant, a revelation which surfaced three years ago. It remains to be seen how Chinese social media users will view Horton's fresh comments following the backlash meted out against the Australian last August. 2016 Rio Olympics - Swimming - Preliminary - Men's 1500m Freestyle - Heats - Olympic Aquatics Stadium - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Mack Horton (AUS) of Australia reacts.Stefan WermuthThousands of incendiary comments were left on the swimmer’s Instagram account - which numbered at least 200,000 on one photo post alone - and were subsequently deleted by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC). At the time, Chinese state media reacted to Horton's remarks by calling Australia  uncivilized  and  Britain's offshore prison . The Australian delegation in Rio said they would support Horton's right to speak freely on the issue. Sun heads the world rankings leading into Sunday morning's heats of the men's 400m freestyle, with the final scheduled for the evening in the Hungarian capital. The 25-year-old Chinese is the only swimmer to dip under three minutes 43 seconds this season, while Horton has posted the third quickest time. At the Chinese national championships in April, Sun served warning of his form by winning all five freestyle events from 100m through to the 1500m. Continued fractious relations at the top of the rankings have left the men's 400m dubbed  War on the Water, Part II .

U.S. District Judge David Bunning ruled that county clerk Kim Davis herself was not liable to pay the more than $224,700 in fees and associated costs accrued by plaintiffs. In the days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, Davis, the Rowan County clerk, announced that she would no longer issue marriage licenses to any couple because same-sex marriage conflicted with her Apostolic Christian beliefs.  The refusal made her a national symbol for opposition to the Supreme Court decision. Four couples, including two same-sex marriage couples, filed suit. Although Bunning issued an injunction at the time requiring Davis’ office to issue the licenses, she continued to refuse. Davis served five days in jail after Bunning ruled her in contempt of court. The couples' lawsuit was dismissed after Kentucky lawmakers approved changes to the marriage license form that removed the clerk’s name from it, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys, including lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, have continued to seek payment for their work. Bunning ruled on Friday that they were entitled to repayment, but he declined to make Davis responsible. “Davis represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky when she refused to issue marriage licenses to legally eligible couples,” he wrote in his order. “The buck stops there.” “(W)e hope this serves as a reminder to Kentucky officials that willful violations of individuals’ civil liberties, such as what occurred here, will not only be challenged but will also prove costly,” William Sharp, ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director, said in a statement on Friday. Mat Staver, Davis’ attorney, said in a phone interview on Friday that he disagreed with Bunning’s decision, but he was happy that neither his client nor the county had to pay the lawyers' fees.  “We definitely consider it a victory,” said Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization. He said the ruling would likely put an end to other lawsuits against his client over the marriage-license standoff. Representatives for Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said in a statement that they were reviewing the opinion and had not made a decision on whether or not to appeal Friday's ruling.

U.S. District Judge David Bunning ruled that county clerk Kim Davis herself was not liable to pay the more than $224,700 in fees and associated costs accrued by plaintiffs. In the days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, Davis, the Rowan County clerk, announced that she would no longer issue marriage licenses to any couple because same-sex marriage conflicted with her Apostolic Christian beliefs.  The refusal made her a national symbol for opposition to the Supreme Court decision. Four couples, including two same-sex marriage couples, filed suit. Although Bunning issued an injunction at the time requiring Davis’ office to issue the licenses, she continued to refuse. Davis served five days in jail after Bunning ruled her in contempt of court. The couples' lawsuit was dismissed after Kentucky lawmakers approved changes to the marriage license form that removed the clerk’s name from it, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys, including lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, have continued to seek payment for their work. Bunning ruled on Friday that they were entitled to repayment, but he declined to make Davis responsible. “Davis represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky when she refused to issue marriage licenses to legally eligible couples,” he wrote in his order. “The buck stops there.” “(W)e hope this serves as a reminder to Kentucky officials that willful violations of individuals’ civil liberties, such as what occurred here, will not only be challenged but will also prove costly,” William Sharp, ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director, said in a statement on Friday. Mat Staver, Davis’ attorney, said in a phone interview on Friday that he disagreed with Bunning’s decision, but he was happy that neither his client nor the county had to pay the lawyers' fees.  “We definitely consider it a victory,” said Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization. He said the ruling would likely put an end to other lawsuits against his client over the marriage-license standoff. Representatives for Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said in a statement that they were reviewing the opinion and had not made a decision on whether or not to appeal Friday's ruling.

(Reuters) - Transgender people still face discrimination and threats to their safety in North Carolina despite lawmakers replacing a measure that restricted their access to many public bathrooms, advocacy groups said in a new federal court action on Friday. The law thrust the state into the center of a national debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom last year by requiring transgender people to use restrooms in state-run buildings that matched the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. A new measure, passed in March, helped bring back some business and sports events pulled from the state in protest in the year after it enacted the so-called bathroom bill. But the replacement law lacks clarity, with top state leaders in disagreement about what it means for transgender bathroom access, the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue in their amended lawsuit. That leaves transgender people uncertain - even fearful - about which restrooms they can safely use, they said.  When legislation fails to protect us, when it leaves us in limbo, it sends a message that our lives are expendable,  plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters. The amended complaint expands the lawsuit filed last year to challenge HB 2, which the state's Republican leaders said was needed for public safety. FILE PHOTO - North Carolina's Legislative Building is seen in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. on December 19, 2016.Jonathan Drake/File PhotoThe new law, HB 142, rescinded HB 2 but left many of its harmful effects in place, opponents say. The current law bars state agencies, schools and local governments from regulating government-run restrooms, showers and changing facilities, leaving responsibility for those policies with state lawmakers. It also bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020. Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat who signed the new law, is now named as a defendant in the lawsuit, replacing former Republican Governor Pat McCrory, whose defeat in the 2016 election is partly blamed on his support for the old law. Cooper has called the replacement law imperfect but necessary to help repair North Carolina's damaged reputation.   The governor's ultimate goal is statewide LGBT protections, and he is going to continue working toward that,  Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said in a statement on Friday. A battle over bathrooms also flared on Friday in Texas, where lawmakers heard impassioned public testimony about proposals to limit public restroom access to transgender people in that state.

The decision was not the first time that the Pentagon has declined to make military reimbursements to Pakistan. Last year, it withheld $300 million. Pakistan has been reimbursed $550 million of the $900 million it was authorized to receive in fiscal year 2016.  Of the rest, $300 million had already been reprogrammed for other purposes, but had not been previously reported. Mattis' latest decision affects the remaining $50 million.  Relations between the two countries have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Pakistan's unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, said the $50 million could not be released now because Mattis  could not certify that Pakistan has taken sufficient action against the Haqqani Network per the requirement in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.   President Donald Trump's administration is exploring potentially hardening its approach toward Pakistan to crack down on militants launching strikes in neighboring Afghanistan. Possible Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally. Mattis told reporters on Friday that the decision was not linked to the administration's broader South Asia strategy, which is still being reviewed.  This is simply an assessment of the current state of play,  Mattis said.  It is not a policy, it is a reality.  The United States in 2012 designated the Pakistan-based Haqqani network as a terrorist organization. The year before, U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, then the top U.S. military officer, caused a stir when he told Congress that the Haqqani network was a  veritable arm  of Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate. Pakistan argues that it has done a great deal to help the United States in tracking down terrorists and points out that it has suffered hundreds of deaths in Islamist militant attacks in response to its crackdowns. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, said that Islamabad had continued to fight militants.  It may be noted that the funds in question are a reimbursement of the expenses incurred by Pakistan towards achieving our common objectives in the fight against terrorism, and not an assistance,  Chaudhry said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman Stump said the decision did not  reduce the significance of the sacrifices that the Pakistani military has undertaken over previous years.

Kicking off on Thursday, this year's four-day Comic-Con gathering of nerd and pop culture fans will see fewer films being marketed by movie studios, which are instead focusing more narrowly on projects that tie directly into the interests of the convention's fandom. Meanwhile, numerous hit sci-fi television shows have garnered avid viewers and Emmy nominations, and can drum up buzz for upcoming seasons with an already engaged fanbase.  Drawing more than 100,000 attendees, Comic-Con has become an increasingly important tool for Hollywood to generate interest in upcoming projects. Yet this year, only three major Hollywood film studios - Fox, Warner Bros and Disney - and newcomer Netflix will hold panels for upcoming movies, a vast difference from five years ago when movies dominated the buzz from the convention.  Warner Bros will bring its sci-fi sequel  Blade Runner 2049,  virtual reality thriller  Ready Player One  and its DC movie franchise of superheroes, while Disney will bring its Marvel superhero franchise.   Studios are eyeing more quality than quantity at Comic-Con,  Entertainment Weekly's senior writer Darren Franich told Reuters.   There are less films debuting now, but there's high stakes for the ones that are, as studios are thinking 'if we do well here then that can create buzz over a year,'  he added.  Attendees arrive dressed in costume.Mike BlakeOn Thursday, Fox hosted a panel on upcoming British spy  comedy sequel  Kingsman: The Golden Circle,  with Colin Firth and Halle Berry.   You really feel like (Comic-Con) is owned by fans,  Firth told Reuters Television.  I don't think I've been in an environment where it's more about the passion for the material.    The fandom of Comic-Con attendees is what drove organizers in 2012 to give medieval fantasy  Game of Thrones,  zombie drama  The Walking Dead  and nerd comedy  The Big Bang Theory  a coveted spot at Comic-Con's prestigious Hall H.  Slideshow (22 Images)The 6,500-capacity hall is usually reserved for movie studios bringing in A-list talent, and fans often sleep outside overnight to gain access.  Hall H is where Netflix's 1980s-set supernatural mystery series  Stranger Things  will make its Comic-Con debut on Saturday, almost a year after it became a breakout hit  largely thanks to the passion of the fan base,  producer Shawn Levy told Reuters.   Comic-Con is such a hub of fans and passionate fanhood, so it feels like an organic match to the 'Stranger Things' franchise,  he said. But celebrity panels alone aren't enough for engaging fans. This year, Warner Bros has a virtual reality experience of its upcoming  Blade Runner 2049  sequel, HBO has installations of the futuristic theme park of  Westworld  and  Stranger Things  fans can experience the dark, evil  Upside Down  world from the show.  It's no small thing to get yourself to Comic-Con and spend money and time in a high-intensity environment, and we want to reward that interest level and commitment with something special,  Levy said.

It is a training exercise but the scenario is all too real for many of the doctors, who treated victims of a chemical attack three months ago and suffered symptoms themselves after being contaminated by a deadly nerve agent. Around 100 people were killed in the sarin gas attack on the opposition-held northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun on April 4, the international chemical weapons watchdog OPCW said. Two hundred people needed treatment, including medical staff. The United States and Western allies blamed the Syrian government for the attack - an accusation President Bashar al-Assad dismissed as  fabrication  - and launched cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air force base in response. The doctors hope the week-long course in southern Turkey organized by the World Health Organization, will leave them better prepared and better protected for any future attack. It is the most intensive training on chemical warfare provided to Syrian medical staff, who have also treated patients for chlorine gas attacks during Syria's brutal six-year war. Osama Darwish, a doctor at Maarat al-Numan hospital around 20 km (nearly 15 miles) north of Khan Sheikhoun, said his colleagues were overwhelmed when around 100 victims of the April sarin attack started to be brought in.  That was the first (nerve agent) case that we had dealt with. We had treated for chlorine, but the symptoms of chlorine are different. They were very severe,  he said. Syrian medical staff take part in a training exercise to learn how to treat victims of chemical weapons attacks, in a course organized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Gaziantep, Turkey, July 20, 2017.Murad Sezer The hospital wasn't prepared. We didn't have the equipment or the kit for medical teams to protect themselves,  Darwish said during a break in training, resting in the shade of a Turkish fire service truck brought in for the exercise. Like several of his colleagues responding to the April attack, Darwish himself soon started feeling symptoms, most likely through traces of nerve agent on the bodies and clothes of victims brought in for treatment.  Some (cases) were light but some were heavy and even went to intensive care. Thank God, my symptoms were light - choking and itching,  he said. Slideshow (7 Images)For other medics the consequences could have been more severe. The OPCW report released three weeks ago said an ambulance went missing for two hours - the driver passed out shortly after picking up patients at Khan Sheikhoun. The course, near southern Turkey's Gaziantep city, taught medics how to prioritize treatment for the most severely affected victims and protect themselves - using chemical suits and stripping and hosing down all unprotected victims.  Sarin and other nerve agents are banned under international law. The Syrian government said it gave up its stockpile of chemical weapons for destruction after a 2013 sarin attack near Damascus which killed hundreds of people.  Since then, a joint United Nations and OPCW investigation has declared Syrian government forces responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015. It has also said Islamic State militants used mustard gas. One of the trainers, a veteran of two decades of regional conflict, said the scale of violence in Syria's war sometimes overwhelmed even the most experienced medics.    I can remember many situations we as doctors, as surgeons inside Syria when we see the severity of injuries, sometimes we cried,  WHO technical officer Mohammed Elgazzar said.  Really, we cried when we have seen such kind of injury.  Editing by David Dolan and Alison Williams","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-doctors-idUSKBN1A6214"},

We're extremely pleased with the jury verdict and that Amphastar is finally out from under this baseless lawsuit,  said Michael Sommer, a lawyer for Amphastar. Momenta Chief Executive Craig Wheeler in a statement said the company was disappointed and was considering its options, including a potential appeal.

Momenta and Sandoz filed the lawsuit in 2011 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Amphastar's generic version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster Lovenox, an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots. Momenta claimed Amphastar infringed its patent covering a method used to confirm the structural signature of Lovenox, known generically as enoxaparin. Momenta, whose generic version Lovenox was the first to receive FDA approval in 2010, claimed Amphastar's infringement and subsequent sales of its own generic caused it to suffer a significant loss of profits.

Attorneys for Raymond Lucia, once known for his  Buckets of Money  investment strategy, argue in a 52-page petition that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's administrative law judges operate as  inferior officers  who wield significant decision-making powers. Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, inferior officers must be hired by the head of a federal agency, the president or a court. The SEC has argued that its judges are mere employees, because their decisions to impose penalties and other remedies against defendants are not final and are still subject to SEC review. Lucia's case stands a strong chance of being accepted by the Supreme Court for the next term, which begins in the fall. Currently, two U.S. appeals courts are split over the issue as to whether or not the hiring of the SEC's in-house judges violates the Constitution. Last month, the SEC won a victory after a panel of 10 judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Lucia's challenge. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that the SEC did violate the Constitution, however. Since then, the SEC has halted all pending in-house trials involving defendants with appeal rights to the 10th Circuit until the issue can be resolved. The SEC has faced mounting challenges in recent years to the constitutionality of how it appoints its in-house judges. Lucia, for his part, has been fighting the agency since 2012, when the SEC sued him over claims he misled investors. An administrative law judge sided with the SEC, finding Lucia liable for fraud and hitting him with $300,000 in fines and a lifetime ban from investment-related work. He has been appealing ever since, arguing that the judge was improperly hired.  The SEC's regime of unaccountable adjudicators has left countless casualties on the field - not least Ray Lucia,  wrote Lucia's legal team, led by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher's Mark Perry, in the petition to the court.  The (administrative law judge) who presided over his case imposed on him the 'securities industry equivalent of capital punishment.'

MbN, as he is known, was dismissed by the royal family  in the higher interests of the state  because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, often falling asleep at public events after he became crown prince in 2015, the source told Reuters in an interview. His addiction was a legacy of an Al Qaeda assassination attempt in 2009 that left shrapnel in his body.  MbN has a lot of respect among us as a crown prince and as interior minister but there are higher interests for the state which are more important than social position or status,  the source told Reuters. Reuters was unable to reach MbN for comment. Sources close to him said he would not comment and has remained in his palace in Jeddah since he was removed in June. The sources acknowledged MbN's addiction to morphine but said it was used as a pretext to speed up the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman, the king's 32-year-old son, to be next in line to the throne. Reuters was unable to confirm independently the specific drugs MbN used to treat his health problems. The source, who has knowledge of palace thinking, expanded on an account by Reuters earlier this week saying MbN was pushed aside because of his drug addiction. The drive to remove MbN came from the king and the Allegiance Council, the 34-member body of senior princes supposed to approve and monitor the king and his anointed successors, the source said.  He denied that MbN was the victim of a palace coup by King Salman's ambitious young son, known as MbS, in a hurry to clear his path to the throne while his ailing 81-year-old father still occupies it. He also denied suggestions by a Saudi source that the king was preparing to abdicate in favor of MbS, possibly as soon as September.  This scenario is out of the question and it has not been discussed or proposed,  the source said. MbN had struggled with drug addiction for years dating back to when the late King Abdullah was in power, the source said.  King Abdullah talked seriously to him about (his addiction). MbN confirmed that it was because of the assassination attempt. He said he needed to use the painkillers to relieve the pain from the shrapnel in his body. He promised King Abdullah to end this and be under medical supervision.  The source confirmed Reuters' report that MbN traveled to Switzerland on many occasions for treatment but to no avail.  The king told him clearly: if you return to addiction you will be removed,  the source said. King Salman decided that keeping MbN would be harmful to the country, the source said. The source denied an assertion by a source close to MbN that the former crown prince was under house arrest, and that his bodyguards had been replaced by a new security detail.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-palace-mbn-idUSKBN1A62FF"},

The verdict by the jury in Boston came in a lawsuit by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Momenta and its partner, Novartis AG's Sandoz unit, that sought nearly $940 million in damages. The jury found that while Rancho Cucamonga, California-based Amphastar had infringed Momenta's patent, it was invalid and unenforceable.  We're extremely pleased with the jury verdict and that Amphastar is finally out from under this baseless lawsuit,  said Michael Sommer, a lawyer for Amphastar. Momenta Chief Executive Craig Wheeler in a statement said the company was disappointed and was considering its options, including a potential appeal.  We continue to believe in the importance of investing in innovative techniques for bringing products to market and protecting those innovations from unauthorized use,  he said. Following the verdict, Amphastar's stock price rose 2.29 percent to $18.33 while Momenta's fell 2.32 percent to $16.85 on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Sandoz did not respond to requests for comment. Momenta and Sandoz filed the lawsuit in 2011 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Amphastar's generic version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster Lovenox, an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots. Momenta claimed Amphastar infringed its patent covering a method used to confirm the structural signature of Lovenox, known generically as enoxaparin. Momenta, whose generic version Lovenox was the first to receive FDA approval in 2010, claimed Amphastar's infringement and subsequent sales of its own generic caused it to suffer a significant loss of profits. Momenta and Sandoz sought damages of $938 million. Sommer, Amphastar's lawyer, told jurors on Thursday during closing arguments that such an award would  wipe out Amphastar altogether.

Wearing a hijab should not be a barrier for anything. We are free to be creative,  said the 24-year-old Indonesian designer after posting selfies of her latest  cosplay  outfit. She is among a growing number of young Muslim women in Southeast Asia who are taking part in  hijab  costume play, finding creative ways to incorporate the head covering into colorful fantasy costumes.  Yanti's fashions are inspired by Disney and Japanese anime characters, with artful hijab designs that resemble wigs or hoods. She can express herself while preserving the Islamic requirement of modest dress for women, Yanti said.  Her made-to-order designs cost between 250,000 rupiah ($18.79) and 500,000 rupiah each. The fashion play is also popular in neighboring Muslim-majority Malaysia, where young people dressed as superheroes, warriors and princesses flocked to a cosplay show in Kuala Lumpur, the capital. Among them was 20-year-old film student Nursyamimi Minhalia, who wore a black hijab cut to form a fringe with two buns on either side.

The voluntary program, which offers White County Jail inmates 30 days off their time behind bars, aims to cut the number of children who are born drug-dependent or end up in foster care, Judge Sam Benningfield said on Friday.  It is in no way a eugenic program,  Benningfield said in a statement.  Sterilization is never involved and is not an option as all procedures offered are reversible.  The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has denounced the program, describing it as a  so-called choice  between jail time and  coerced  contraception or sterilization.  Such a choice violates the fundamental constitutional right to reproductive autonomy and bodily integrity by interfering with the intimate decision of whether and when to have a child,  its executive director, Hedy Weinberg, said in a statement on Wednesday. Benningfield said the idea grew out of an earlier program he created with the state's Department of Health under which inmates' sentences were reduced by two days if they completed an education program on the risks of raising children while using illegal drugs. The judge's new order took effect on May 15 but did not gain wide attention Nashville's News Channel 5 aired a story this week. So far, 32 women have received the birth control implant, which prevents pregnancies for up to four years, and 38 men were awaiting a vasectomy, the station said. The program was originally aimed at women who might give birth to drug-addicted children, but it was expanded to men to avoid discrimination, Benningfield said. No men under the age of 21 can participate, the judge added in his statement, and those eligible must complete a full physical exam and wait 30 days before the procedure. Benningfield said that for inmates and former inmates,  Unplanned and unwanted children and the resulting obligations complicate their lives and make their reintegration into society more difficult.  A spokeswoman for Tennessee's Department of Health said it does not support the new program and that neither it nor the White County Health Department were involved in developing it.  We do not support any policy that could compel incarcerated individuals to seek any particular health services,  the spokeswoman, Shelley Walker, said in a statement on Friday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tennessee-vasectomy-idUSL1N1KC0XR"},

Attorneys for Raymond Lucia, once known for his  Buckets of Money  investment strategy, argue in a 52-page petition that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's administrative law judges operate as  inferior officers  who wield significant decision-making powers. Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, inferior officers must be hired by the head of a federal agency, the president or a court. The SEC has argued that its judges are mere employees, because their decisions to impose penalties and other remedies against defendants are not final and are still subject to SEC review. Lucia's case stands a strong chance of being accepted by the Supreme Court for the next term, which begins in the fall. Currently, two U.S. appeals courts are split over the issue as to whether or not the hiring of the SEC's in-house judges violates the Constitution. Last month, the SEC won a victory after a panel of 10 judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Lucia's challenge. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that the SEC did violate the Constitution, however. Since then, the SEC has halted all pending in-house trials involving defendants with appeal rights to the 10th Circuit until the issue can be resolved. The SEC has faced mounting challenges in recent years to the constitutionality of how it appoints its in-house judges. Lucia, for his part, has been fighting the agency since 2012, when the SEC sued him over claims he misled investors. An administrative law judge sided with the SEC, finding Lucia liable for fraud and hitting him with $300,000 in fines and a lifetime ban from investment-related work. He has been appealing ever since, arguing that the judge was improperly hired.  The SEC's regime of unaccountable adjudicators has left countless casualties on the field - not least Ray Lucia,  wrote Lucia's legal team, led by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher's Mark Perry, in the petition to the court.  The (administrative law judge) who presided over his case imposed on him the 'securities industry equivalent of capital punishment.'  (Reporting by Sarah N.

The deal, which would create two separate joint ventures for their signaling and rolling-stock divisions, could be announced as early as August, the sources said.  Siemens' supervisory board will discuss the matter at its meeting on Aug. 2, while Bombardier's board is expected to consider it before the company's second-quarter earnings call next week, the sources said, adding that an announcement could come in early August.  All of the sources, including one who talked to Reuters earlier in the week, spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.  Rail consolidation has been a trend over the last few years, as global companies seek to contain costs and Western companies struggle with the rising ambitions of China's state-backed CRRC at home and abroad. Media reports in April that Siemens and Bombardier explored a combination with total sales of $16 billion had sparked antitrust concerns in Europe. Bombardier would take just over a 50 percent stake in the joint rolling stock operations, one source said. Siemens would take roughly an 80 percent stake in a joint venture in the higher-margin signaling technology, two of the sources said.  While a deal could be a  win-win  for both companies, any agreement that largely cedes control over Bombardier's lucrative signaling business to Siemens, the market leader, could worry the Canadian company's investors, an analyst said.     A logo of Siemens is pictured on a building in Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2017.Edgard GarridoNevertheless, a tie-up could help Bombardier, the rail industry's fifth-largest signaling player by market share, grow that business, the analyst said. Bombardier and Siemens declined to comment. No money would be exchanged as part of the deal, two of the sources said.    It was not yet clear what role Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which owns a 30 percent stake in Bombardier Transportation, would play in the deal. A spokesman for the Caisse, Canada's second-largest pension fund, would not comment on Friday.  Caisse Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia told Reuters in June that he supports rail consolidation in general to create value and  to begin leveling the market,  given CRRC's size advantage. The proposed deal would also address antitrust concerns and fears that a tie-up would result in job losses. The companies have offered extensive job guarantees to get backing from the strong German labor side, two of the sources said.     Bombardier and Siemens also would have to sell off some high-speed train operations to address the antitrust concerns. The advisers for Siemens are Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, and UBS for Bombardier. The banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Siemens shares fell almost 2 percent while Bombardier was unchanged.

The deal, which would create two separate joint ventures for their signaling and rolling-stock divisions, could be announced as early as August, the sources said.  Siemens' supervisory board will discuss the matter at its meeting on Aug. 2, while Bombardier's board is expected to consider it before the company's second-quarter earnings call next week, the sources said, adding that an announcement could come in early August.  All of the sources, including one who talked to Reuters earlier in the week, spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.  Rail consolidation has been a trend over the last few years, as global companies seek to contain costs and Western companies struggle with the rising ambitions of China's state-backed CRRC at home and abroad. Media reports in April that Siemens and Bombardier explored a combination with total sales of $16 billion had sparked antitrust concerns in Europe. Bombardier would take just over a 50 percent stake in the joint rolling stock operations, one source said. Siemens would take roughly an 80 percent stake in a joint venture in the higher-margin signaling technology, two of the sources said.  While a deal could be a  win-win  for both companies, any agreement that largely cedes control over Bombardier's lucrative signaling business to Siemens, the market leader, could worry the Canadian company's investors, an analyst said.     A logo of Siemens is pictured on a building in Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2017.Edgard GarridoNevertheless, a tie-up could help Bombardier, the rail industry's fifth-largest signaling player by market share, grow that business, the analyst said. Bombardier and Siemens declined to comment. No money would be exchanged as part of the deal, two of the sources said.    It was not yet clear what role Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which owns a 30 percent stake in Bombardier Transportation, would play in the deal. A spokesman for the Caisse, Canada's second-largest pension fund, would not comment on Friday.  Caisse Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia told Reuters in June that he supports rail consolidation in general to create value and  to begin leveling the market,  given CRRC's size advantage. The proposed deal would also address antitrust concerns and fears that a tie-up would result in job losses. The companies have offered extensive job guarantees to get backing from the strong German labor side, two of the sources said.     Bombardier and Siemens also would have to sell off some high-speed train operations to address the antitrust concerns. The advisers for Siemens are Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, and UBS for Bombardier. The banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Siemens shares fell almost 2 percent while Bombardier was unchanged.

Wall Street stock indexes retreated from record peaks following weak results from General Electric Co, kindling safe-haven demand for low-risk government debt.     Trading volume was light in the absence of major U.S. economic data and some caution before next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting.     The euro's surge, if sustained, would hurt European exporters and possibly force ECB policymakers to delay any plans to reduce quantitative easing.      This is a directionality with the euro. The U.S. and Bunds spread is moving on that after the ECB meeting,  Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment Banking in New York.     On Thursday, the ECB stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance as Europe's inflation remained below 2 percent, but traders perceived ECB President Mario Draghi's comments at his news conference as supportive to build bullish bets on the euro .     The euro rose to $1.1677 earlier on Friday, the strongest since Aug. 24, 2015, while German 10-year yields traded as low as 0.496 percent, a two-week trough, Reuters data showed.     The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down more than 3 basis points at 2.230 percent after hitting a three-week low of 2.225 percent.     The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P; 500 were down 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.     Among Treasury bills, interest rates on T-bills due in October rose to their highest since October 2008 on risk of a default if Congress fails to raise the country's debt limit.      The Fed is widely expected to leave key interest rates  unchanged in the wake of a softening in domestic inflation.       You have four CPI (consumer price index) prints which were not very good. Why are we concerned about inflation?  said Jim Caron, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York.     Caron and some analysts expect inflation to rebound in the second half of 2017 on positive year-over-year comparisons and a further tightening in the labor market.     An expected pause in the Fed holding U.S. rates has partly led to a decline in interest rate volatility.     An index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on one-month volatility on Treasury yields has fallen in the past two weeks, recording an all-time low of 46.999 on Thursday.

The voluntary program, which offers White County Jail inmates 30 days off their time behind bars, aims to cut the number of children who are born drug-dependent or end up in foster care, Judge Sam Benningfield said on Friday.   It is in no way a eugenic program,  Benningfield said in a statement.  Sterilization is never involved and is not an option as all procedures offered are reversible.  The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has denounced the program, describing it as a  so-called choice  between jail time and  coerced  contraception or sterilization.  Such a choice violates the fundamental constitutional right to reproductive autonomy and bodily integrity by interfering with the intimate decision of whether and when to have a child,  its executive director, Hedy Weinberg, said in a statement on Wednesday. Benningfield said the idea grew out of an earlier program he created with the state's Department of Health under which inmates' sentences were reduced by two days if they completed an education program on the risks of raising children while using illegal drugs.  The judge's new order took effect on May 15 but did not gain wide attention Nashville's News Channel 5 aired a story this week.  So far, 32 women have received the birth control implant, which prevents pregnancies for up to four years, and 38 men were awaiting a vasectomy, the station said.  The program was originally aimed at women who might give birth to drug-addicted children, but it was expanded to men to avoid discrimination, Benningfield said.  No men under the age of 21 can participate, the judge added in his statement, and those eligible must complete a full physical exam and wait 30 days before the procedure.  Benningfield said that for inmates and former inmates,  Unplanned and unwanted children and the resulting obligations complicate their lives and make their reintegration into society more difficult.  A spokeswoman for Tennessee's Department of Health said it does not support the new program and that neither it nor the White County Health Department were involved in developing it.   We do not support any policy that could compel incarcerated individuals to seek any particular health services,  the spokeswoman, Shelley Walker, said in a statement on Friday.

MbN, as he is known, was dismissed by the royal family  in the higher interests of the state  because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, often falling asleep at public events after he became crown prince in 2015, the source told Reuters in an interview. His addiction was a legacy of an Al Qaeda assassination attempt in 2009 that left shrapnel in his body.  MbN has a lot of respect among us as a crown prince and as interior minister but there are higher interests for the state which are more important than social position or status,  the source told Reuters. Reuters was unable to reach MbN for comment. Sources close to him said he would not comment and has remained in his palace in Jeddah since he was removed in June. The sources acknowledged MbN's addiction to morphine but said it was used as a pretext to speed up the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman, the king's 32-year-old son, to be next in line to the throne. Reuters was unable to confirm independently the specific drugs MbN used to treat his health problems. The source, who has knowledge of palace thinking, expanded on an account by Reuters earlier this week saying MbN was pushed aside because of his drug addiction. The drive to remove MbN came from the king and the Allegiance Council, the 34-member body of senior princes supposed to approve and monitor the king and his anointed successors, the source said.  He denied that MbN was the victim of a palace coup by King Salman's ambitious young son, known as MbS, in a hurry to clear his path to the throne while his ailing 81-year-old father still occupies it. He also denied suggestions by a Saudi source that the king was preparing to abdicate in favor of MbS, possibly as soon as September.  This scenario is out of the question and it has not been discussed or proposed,  the source said. MbN had struggled with drug addiction for years dating back to when the late King Abdullah was in power, the source said.  King Abdullah talked seriously to him about (his addiction). MbN confirmed that it was because of the assassination attempt. He said he needed to use the painkillers to relieve the pain from the shrapnel in his body. He promised King Abdullah to end this and be under medical supervision.  The source confirmed Reuters' report that MbN traveled to Switzerland on many occasions for treatment but to no avail.  The king told him clearly: if you return to addiction you will be removed,  the source said. King Salman decided that keeping MbN would be harmful to the country, the source said. The source denied an assertion by a source close to MbN that the former crown prince was under house arrest, and that his bodyguards had been replaced by a new security detail.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-palace-mbn-idUSL5N1KC3X8"},

The U.S. International Trade Commission will announce in August whether Taiwan's rebar exports hurt U.S. producers, which would prompt an order to keep anti-dumping duties in place. In a statement on Friday, the Commerce Department said exporters from Taiwan had sold rebar in the United States at 3.50 percent to 32.01 percent less than fair value. It estimated 2016 rebar imports from Taiwan at $53 million. Preliminary duties had been set at 3.48 percent to 29.47 percent in March. “The United States can no longer sit back and watch as its essential industries like steel are destroyed by foreign companies unfairly selling their products in the U.S. markets,” the statement quoted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as saying.  We will continue to take action on behalf of U.S. industry to defend American businesses, their workers, and our communities adversely impacted by unfair imports.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), owner of the popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, and meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) are trading well below the prices they listed at earlier this year.   And though the U.S. IPO market has already raked in more money so far this year than it did in all of 2016, the underperformance of these stocks has sensitized investors to valuations and made them cautious about putting money on the table, IPO experts said.  Second half of 2017 will be better than 2016, but we might not get to the 2015, 2014 levels this year,  said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital LLC, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds.

Petcho, global macro portfolio manager for the $213 billion investment firm, said in an interview that sterling was set to fall about 15 percent from its level on Friday of around $1.2960 to $1.10 GBP=. The former Soros Fund Management analyst said second-quarter UK economic growth would likely be weak at slightly below 1 percent on an annualized basis. Petcho, who is based in Atlanta,  expected total 2017 growth to be a modest 1.5 percent, making it unlikely the Bank of England (BoE) would proceed with raising rates. He cited weak wage growth and depreciating home prices as two sources of concern.   “The result going forward is certainly bad for pound-sterling,  Petcho said. Petcho, who said he had been bullish on sterling before last month's UK election, said Voya had  expressed a negative view  on the currency immediately after the shock loss of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s parliamentary majority.  He said the negative call was being implemented in the roughly $480 million Voya Global Bond Fund (IGBWX.O) and the $197 million Voya Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (ISIAX.O). Petcho declined to specify whether the firm had bet against or “shorted” the currency. Sterling fell earlier this week from a 10-month high against the greenback of $1.3125 after data showing British inflation unexpectedly slowed in June. The data doused expectations that the BoE might soon raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Petcho also said he expected the euro to fall about 7.5 percent from Friday's nearly two-year high of above $1.1680 to $1.08 by year-end. The euro has rallied in the past two sessions after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi abstained from talking down the currency on Thursday.  The ECB chief's apparent lack of concern about the strengthening euro convinced traders that the central bank remained on track to at least announce a tapering of its bond-buying stimulus in the autumn, analysts said. Petcho said, however, that any tapering announcement would likely disappoint traders hoping for a hawkish move by showing a more moderate bias, while second-quarter European economic growth was poised to come in at a modest 1.5 percent annualized.   The euro also looks quite ripe for a depreciation,  he said. Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-voya-sterling-idUSKBN1A62EN"},

More than 250 civil rights activists, executives and others registered to speak to the Republican-dominated Senate as it began consideration of the measure, the most closely watched item on the state's agenda during a 30-day special session. So-called  bathroom bills  have become a flashpoint of U.S. culture wars, with social conservatives saying they protect public safety and civil rights activists saying the measures allow government-sanctioned bias against transgender people. Ashley Smith, a transgender woman and San Antonio architect, said transgender women suffer more violence than the general public, and a bathroom bill would make her more fearful.  Can’t you see how this legislation would make the very real problem of assault even worse?  she asked members of the Senate Committee on State Affairs. Smith drew wide notice on the internet this week after posting a picture of herself with Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a supporter of the bathroom measure who she suggested had no idea she was transgender.

If the measure is enacted, the state could lose about $1.4 billion from lost conventions, sports contests and other events, they said. The main measure under consideration is Senate Bill 3, which says certain restrooms, showers and changing facilities in places such as public schools  must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a person's birth certificate.  Slideshow (3 Images)Supporters were few in number on Friday. The bill's sponsor, Republican Senator Lois Kolkhorst, said SB 3 was about  about much more than bathrooms.

During the regular session that ended in May, the Texas Senate easily passed such a measure. But it died in the state's House of Representatives under pressure from pro-business Republicans. Political analysts expect a similar pattern for the special session. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of major sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

Bond yields fell after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Thursday the ECB was in no rush to scale back its asset purchase program. The greenback retreated against a basket of major currencies, with the dollar index hitting a more than one-year low in afternoon dealings.                                                         Central banks have  taken a more dovish tone and the dollar is working in gold's favor,  said Josh Graves, a senior market strategist with RJO Futures in Chicago.     Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates. Lower yields help gold prices by reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.                             Spot gold        was up 0.87 percent at $1,255.0601 an ounce by 2:21 p.m. EDT (1821 GMT). Prices hit $1,255, the highest since June 26, and were on track for their largest weekly gain since May.        U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled up $9.4, or 0.75 percent, at $1,254.90 per ounce and finished the week up 2.2 percent.     While gold was benefiting from the dollar's weakness against the euro and the move in yields, its gains would be limited by expected interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve and it would remain in a $1,200-$1,250 range, ABN AMRO analyst Georgette Boele said.       The Fed's rate-setting committee is due to meet on July 25 and 26.                 Gold broke through resistance at its technically important 100- and 50-day moving averages, both around $1,250.      Falling bond yields and a weakening dollar have helped gold rise 3.9 percent from a low of $1,204.45 on July 10, but this was driven by short-covering and not physical demand, Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.      Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, have fallen 4.3 percent, or 1.2 million tonnes, this month.            In other precious metals, silver        was up 1.18 percent at $16.482 an ounce after touching $16.509, the highest since July 3. Silver was up 3.3 percent this week, on track for the largest weekly gain since January.      Platinum       rose 0.87 percent to $934.35 an ounce and on track to end the week up 2.1 percent. Palladium        was up 0.20 percent at $844.22, but set for a weekly fall of 1.6 percent.

Philip Morris advertises Marlboro cigarettes, the world’s best-selling brand, at tobacco shops in India and distributes free smokes at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people to promote the brand, Reuters reported earlier this week. The strategy is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. (reut.rs/2uuye5Y)     Indian government officials previously have said these marketing activities violate the country's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules, but companies get away with it because enforcement is weak.

Jha added that the ministry will also ask states to take action against advertisements that violate regulations.      Our basic objective is to reduce deaths caused by tobacco,  Jha told Reuters.     Philip Morris previously described its advertising as  compliant with Indian law . It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes, government data showed. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in the country.     The cigarette industry is dominated by ITC Ltd, which also uses some of the same marketing tactics, such as advertising at kiosks, Reuters had found.

In a statement on Friday, the Commerce Department said exporters from Taiwan had sold rebar in the United States at 3.50 percent to 32.01 percent less than fair value. It estimated 2016 rebar imports from Taiwan at $53 million. Preliminary duties had been set at 3.48 percent to 29.47 percent in March. “The United States can no longer sit back and watch as its essential industries like steel are destroyed by foreign companies unfairly selling their products in the U.S. markets,” the statement quoted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as saying.

There was no immediate word on the number of casualties or who they were but the U.S. military statement said they were  local security personnel aligned with Afghan government forces , suggesting they may have been local militia forces.  During a U.S. supported ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) operation, aerial fires resulted in the deaths of the friendly Afghan forces who were gathered in a compound,  the statement said. Local people said as many as 15 local police, including two commanders, may have been killed and many more wounded in the strike in Gereshk district, north of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah, which has been the scene of heavy fighting over recent days. However there was no official confirmation.  Our forces are at the scene and bringing dead bodies out of ruins. An accurate number of casualties and details of the incident will be announced later,  said Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand. The incident underlines the complicated security situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump's administration weighs sending more troops as part of a new strategy for the region. Fighting in Helmand, an opium-rich province where the Taliban controls much of the countryside and threatens Lashkar Gah, has picked up in the past week as the Afghan army has begun operations to push the insurgents back from the capital. U.S. aircraft have carried out 52 air strikes in Helmand over the past five days, including 10 in Gereshk on Thursday, according to U.S. military headquarters in Kabul. Earlier this week, Afghan security forces backed by U.S. air strikes retook Nawa district south of Lashkar Gah. On Thursday, insurgents attacked security perimeters set up around Gereshk, blowing up three captured Humvees packed with explosives. The U.S. military said in a statement there would be an investigation into Friday's incident.

(Reuters) - In a new assessment, the U.S. intelligence community judges that large numbers of foreigners fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria likely will stay to defend what is left of their self-declared caliphate rather than return to their homelands, a top U.S. counter-terrorism official said on Friday. “Many if not most of the foreign fighters who made their way to the conflict zone will end up staying, fighting and potentially dying in order to maintain the caliphate,” Nicholas Rasmussen, the director of the U.S. National Counter Terrorism Center, told the annual Aspen Security Forum. That contrasts with the previous assessment that many foreign fighters would return home, posing major security threats. Rasmussen also said that he has seen no information confirming recent reports that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has been killed. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday he assumes that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is still alive. “I’ve seen nothing that would lead me to believe that the leader of ISIS (Islamic State) has been removed from the battlefield,” Rasmussen said. “We know a good bit. We just don’t have information that would confirm his death and demise.” The new foreign fighter assessment will be welcome news to the countries of origin of the tens of thousands of Islamist extremists. They flocked to fight for the caliphate that Islamic State declared in 2014 after storming out of Syria, seizing the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and charging to Baghdad’s outskirts. Extremists who have returned home have staged attacks that claimed scores of lives, and governments have been bracing for new strikes as the group loses ground in Syria and Iraq. FILE PHOTO: A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi making what would have been his first public appearance, at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video.Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File PhotoU.S.-backed Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul this month and U.S.-backed Kurdish and Syrian Arab fighters are moving to retake Raqqa, the group’s main stronghold in northeastern Syria. Rasmussen noted that the U.S. intelligence community, which estimated that some 40,000 foreigners joined Islamic State in Syria and Iraq after the conflict began, until recently assessed that many would return home. “At one point, we were worried about this out-rush, outflows, massive outflows of foreign fighters once the battlefield situation changed in Iraq and Syria and that Western countries, countries in the region, would be flooded with returnees,” he said. “I think now speaking kind of broadly, that’s less likely than we first assessed.” A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that fewer than 15,000 Islamic State extremists still are fighting in Iraq and Syria.  It has become harder for foreign fighters to return home because of the ongoing combat operations and because Turkey and other countries have significantly tightened their borders, the intelligence official said. While there may be no major outflow of foreign fighters, Rasmussen said he is concerned by the threat posed by Islamic State's affiliates from Asia to Africa. He said he also remains worried by those who manage to escape home, bringing with them specialized skills like bomb-making, that they acquired in Syria and Iraq.

But the replacement law lacks clarity, with top state leaders in disagreement about what it means for transgender bathroom access, the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue in their amended lawsuit. That leaves transgender people uncertain - even fearful - about which restrooms they can safely use, they said.  When legislation fails to protect us, when it leaves us in limbo, it sends a message that our lives are expendable,  plaintiff Joaquín Carcaño, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters. The amended complaint expands the lawsuit filed last year to challenge HB 2, which the state's Republican leaders said was needed for public safety.

The current law bars state agencies, schools and local governments from regulating government-run restrooms, showers and changing facilities, leaving responsibility for those policies with state lawmakers. It also bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020. Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat who signed the new law, is now named as a defendant in the lawsuit, replacing former Republican Governor Pat McCrory, whose defeat in the 2016 election is partly blamed on his support for the old law. Cooper has called the replacement law imperfect but necessary to help repair North Carolina's damaged reputation.   The governor's ultimate goal is statewide LGBT protections, and he is going to continue working toward that,  Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said in a statement on Friday. A battle over bathrooms also flared on Friday in Texas, where lawmakers heard impassioned public testimony about proposals to limit public restroom access to transgender people in that state.

The fighting between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance led by al Qaeda's former Syria branch, and the more moderate Islamist Ahrar al-Sham plus mainstream rebel factions broke out in insurgent stronghold Idlib province this week. Ahrar al-Sham said in an online statement that under the ceasefire, it and other rebel factions would  leave the Bab al-Hawa crossing and turn it over to civilian administration . The clashes have been the heaviest yet between the two sides who have long vied for influence in the only province in Syria that is entirely under rebel control. Tahrir al-Sham had on Friday advanced in several areas, including towards Bab al-Hawa, an important supply route for Turkish-backed rebels fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner. Related CoverageSyrian Islamist rebel groups agree ceasefire in Idlib: statementMainstream foreign-backed rebels fighting under the FSA banner have increasingly lost out to more powerful Islamist groups in Syria's six-year conflict. In blow to those rebels, the U.S. administration decided to halt a CIA program to equip and train some groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. officials said this week. The agreement for Ahrar and its allies to withdraw from Bab al-Hawa is yet another setback. A resident of Atmeh, a town north of the crossing, who is in touch with local officials and rebels said earlier Bab al-Hawa had effectively been encircled from the Syrian side. Tahrir al-Sham  has taken control of the hills around Bab al-Hawa , bringing them to within 1 km (mile) of the crossing, he said.  Just the crossing remains  under the control of Ahrar al-Sham, he said. A source in Ahrar al-Sham also said Tahrir al-Sham had surrounded the crossing, but vowed not to give it up. Tahrir al-Sham later released a statement urging Ahrar al-Sham fighters at Bab al-Hawa to surrender, saying they would not be harmed if they did.  To our brothers in Ahrar al-Sham leadership, come out strong and dignified - we will give you security and peace and sit together to come up with a project that unifies us,  it said. War monitors reported that Tahrir al-Sham attacked military positions of Ahrar al-Sham on Tuesday. In clashes early this year, several more hardline Islamist groups joined Tahrir al-Sham, which is headed by al Qaeda's former Syria branch, previously known as the Nusra Front. Ahrar al-Sham sided with FSA groups fighting against the Tahrir al-Sham alliance. Rebels say the infighting takes the focus away from the battle against Assad's forces and weakens insurgents.

While stay-at-home Muscovites can order an array of international pizza brands from Sbarro to Domino's to Papa John's, regional cities such as Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod are still chiefly the preserve of small local chains. Multiple challenges have kept global fast food brands wedded to major Russian cities, including patchy transport links, bureaucratic delays, finding an army of chefs who can maintain quality, as well as the sheer cost of shipping often perishable ingredients across a vast country that spans 11 time zones. Western fast food chains have also had to adapt menus to suit Russian palates better, once the allure of new foreign tastes has worn off. One of Domino's best-selling pizzas is the  Russian  with 13 toppings including potato, beef, pork, bacon, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese to help ward off the cold. But Domino's Pizza's Russian franchisee, DP Eurasia, believes the time is now right to expand beyond Moscow, where sales at the 76 outlets it had at the end of March are far outstripping growth in its main market Turkey.  The company has done its own research and realized that there's almost no quality pizza in the regions, which gives us enormous ground for development,  said DP Eurasia's head of Russian development Elena Ivanova. Like-for-like sales in Russia have risen 30.1 percent this year up to May 21, whereas the comparable figure for Turkey was 6.3 percent growth. Aggressive Expansion Domino's was Russia's third-largest pizza chain last year yet its share of the fragmented market stood at less than 2 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Guvenc Donmez, DP Eurasia's Russian head, said he saw room for 1,500 Domino's outlets in the longer term. A staff member prepares pizzas at a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Moscow, Russia, July 14, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinFor now, the company is using part of the 148 million pounds  ($192 million) it raised listing shares in London in June to add 40 outlets this year, venturing as far as Krasnodar, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow. Domino's closest rival is not standing idle. The Russian franchise of U.S. chain Papa John's International Inc, the fourth biggest player in the country in 2016, sees room for 60-80 store openings each year over the next five years.  We still see potential in Moscow. I think we could open a further 40-50 stores there, but we are also embarking on an aggressive expansion to small towns,  Christopher Wynne, the chief executive of Papa John's franchisee, told Reuters. Another U.S. brand Sbarro was the market leader with a 4 percent market share in 2016, according to Euromonitor, followed by DoDo Pizza, a Russian chain with a presence in former Soviet states as well as China and the United States. Slideshow (6 Images)Sbarro's Russian franchise had 88 stores last year, including in provincial cities. However, it was hit by a Russian food import ban and a drop in the rouble as Sbarro refused to let it replace imports with local products and the franchising agreement was terminated, Russia's RBC daily has reported. Sbarro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wynne said Papa John's Russia had imported 90 percent of products before the 2014 food ban came in but had replaced all its suppliers within six months. DP Eurasia acknowledged the restrictions could adversely affect its business, even though it too had managed to replace the banned imports. It also said there could be challenges in rolling out the franchise in places with less dense populations than Moscow but believes it can stay profitable thanks to greater purchasing power and economies of scale.  Russia is a huge market and is still very underpenetrated. You don't have many options to eat,  Donmez said in an interview with Reuters TV.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), a newly-empowered court that oversees Britain's fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to proceed to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced U.S.-style  opt-out  collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was  completely unsuitable  to be brought under the collective action regime. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centered on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as Mastercard on merchants' banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers.  The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,  he said.  I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.  He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the  perfect exam question  for Britain's CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country's maiden  opt-out  class action lawsuits in antitrust cases.  Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out.  Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses who fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together. London's High Court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

Petcho, global macro portfolio manager for the $213 billion investment firm, said in an interview that sterling was set to fall about 15 percent from its level on Friday of around $1.2960 to $1.10 GBP=. The former Soros Fund Management analyst said second-quarter UK economic growth would likely be weak at slightly below 1 percent on an annualized basis. Petcho, who is based in Atlanta,  expected total 2017 growth to be a modest 1.5 percent, making it unlikely the Bank of England (BoE) would proceed with raising rates. He cited weak wage growth and depreciating home prices as two sources of concern.   “The result going forward is certainly bad for pound-sterling,  Petcho said. Petcho, who said he had been bullish on sterling before last month's UK election, said Voya had  expressed a negative view  on the currency immediately after the shock loss of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s parliamentary majority.  He said the negative call was being implemented in the roughly $480 million Voya Global Bond Fund (IGBWX.O) and the $197 million Voya Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (ISIAX.O). Petcho declined to specify whether the firm had bet against or “shorted” the currency. Sterling fell earlier this week from a 10-month high against the greenback of $1.3125 after data showing British inflation unexpectedly slowed in June. The data doused expectations that the BoE might soon raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Petcho also said he expected the euro to fall about 7.5 percent from Friday's nearly two-year high of above $1.1680 to $1.08 by year-end. The euro has rallied in the past two sessions after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi abstained from talking down the currency on Thursday.  The ECB chief's apparent lack of concern about the strengthening euro convinced traders that the central bank remained on track to at least announce a tapering of its bond-buying stimulus in the autumn, analysts said. Petcho said, however, that any tapering announcement would likely disappoint traders hoping for a hawkish move by showing a more moderate bias, while second-quarter European economic growth was poised to come in at a modest 1.5 percent annualized.   The euro also looks quite ripe for a depreciation,  he said. Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/investment-voya-sterling-idUSL1N1KC0X9"},

Philip Morris advertises Marlboro cigarettes, the world’s best-selling brand, at tobacco shops in India and distributes free smokes at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people to promote the brand, Reuters reported earlier this week. The strategy is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. (reut.rs/2uuye5Y)     Indian government officials previously have said these marketing activities violate the country's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules, but companies get away with it because enforcement is weak.      The government now plans to write letters to Philip Morris' India unit as well as other tobacco companies and take  action as per law , said Arun Kumar Jha, a federal health ministry official who oversees tobacco control in the country. Jha added that the ministry will also ask states to take action against advertisements that violate regulations.      Our basic objective is to reduce deaths caused by tobacco,  Jha told Reuters.     Philip Morris previously described its advertising as  compliant with Indian law . It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes, government data showed. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in the country.     The cigarette industry is dominated by ITC Ltd, which also uses some of the same marketing tactics, such as advertising at kiosks, Reuters had found.

How it manages that threat will be central not just to the British economy, but also to the island’s constitutional and social well being.  The City, shorthand for the square mile synonymous with London’s financial district, has been a huge strategic and financial asset to the UK for almost 200 years. But Brexit has put it in some danger, and, even as it is under attack from abroad, the City can’t count on much popular support at home.  French President Emmanuel Macron makes no secret of his wish for Paris to profit from Britain’s exit from the EU, a desire he voiced in London itself after talks with Prime Minister Theresa May. In a memo leaked to the Daily Mail on Sunday, Jeremy Browne, the City’s special representative to the EU,  wrote that officials in the French Economic Ministry and the Banque de France and politicians in the Senate “are crystal clear about their underlying objective: the weakening of Britain, the on-going degradation of the City of London.”   Paris is not alone. Frankfurt, home of German finance, has recognized that German labor law would deter the hire-and-fire culture of the City, and has offered some exemptions from legislation protecting workers to “risk takers” willing to re-locate, in the German city. Milan also wants to be a “financial citadel.” Bepi Pezzulli, head of Select Milano, which has backing from Italy’s finance ministry, says that his city would create  a legal and judicial ecosystem similar to the City of London  to enable the seamless relocation of  financial markets which for legal and regulatory reasons can no longer be housed in the City  - an ambitious claim, but apparently a serious one.  READ MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Peter Apps: How Putin sparked a Western military renaissance Jordan Michael Smith: Justin Trudeau masters the Trump two-step There’s more. Dublin, Amsterdam and Stockholm are all competing to draw business from London, and the Irish-born head of Morgan Stanley, Colm Kelleher, has predicted that some jobs could gravitate back to New York.  Yet while the foreigners threaten their capital, most Brits don’t feel like developing a patriotic defense. London isn’t loved, and literature has much to do with that. Brits have been suspicious and resentful of the City, at least since Charles Dickens, in novels like   More than a century and a half later, John Lanchester’s “Capital” (2012) takes the same moral stance. Lanchester writes that part of his inspiration was a realization that “the British, looking at their capital city, increasingly struggle to see a resemblance with themselves.”  London’s lack of resemblance with the rest of the UK is in large part because of the wealth the City bestows on its workers. Median earnings in the City are GBP958 ($1242) a week, compared with GBP671 ($869) in the rest of London, GBP539 ($698) in the U.K. as a whole and GBP391 ($506) in the lowest paying area, in England’s Northwest.  The City’s earnings are boosted by the vast sums taken home by the highest paid. Figures for 2015, for example, show that investment bank Goldman Sachs UK paid 512 key staff in London an average of GBP1.9 million ($2.5 million) per head. These figures cause serious envy. For Londoners whose average earnings have remained stagnant, the resentment can amount to hate.  Yet the usually-unacknowledged fact of the City, and of London, is that it props up the rest of the UK. London as a whole, with 13 percent of the UK population (8.8m of 65.64m) contributes 30 percent of all tax income to the British exchequer - a figure which has increased since the 2008 financial crash, and is equal to the tax gathered from the next largest 37 UK cities combined. Overpaid the City folk may be, but as one of only three UK regions where citizens pay more in taxes than they receive in public spending, they also subsidize less affluent areas in other parts of the country.  Thus while non-London Brits may struggle to see “a resemblance to themselves,” in the capital, their standard of living - especially if they receive income from the state - depends significantly on the City’s financial health.  That’s particularly true in Scotland, where the decline in the oil price means that its citizens run a ‘“tax-income deficit’” of GBP 2,824 ($3,660) a head. Were the City to falter, and the UK be forced to make cuts to the regional subsidies, the Scottish National Party may be able to bolster its case for independence by arguing that continued union would no longer protects Scots’ living standards.  Within the UK, a weaker City could be an opportunity as well as a loss. Successive governments have called for a “rebalancing” of Britain’s economy away from its heavy dependence on finance and services to industry, especially advanced electronics and biotech. Yet though there are some small signs of a shift towards manufacturing, the larger structural problems - a lack of investment in particular - hampers real growth. Most depressingly, a report last year from the University of Sheffield claims that manufacturing in Britain has entered a new and dangerous phase of decline.  Much of the report’s forecast woe has yet to happen, and may not. A 2016 report from Price Waterhouse Cooper claimed that London would remain dominant in most of its present markets after Brexit because it “is resilient, agile and great at adapting,” according to PwC partner David Snell.   The unsatisfactory conclusion - as for most Brexit forecasting - is that no one knows what Brexit will mean for London’s economy. The uncertainties in the contemporary world are larger than they have been for decades. Most of us still live in the hangover of the financial crash, which produces febrile economic and political movements. The Brexit negotiations continue. The City is still rich, still semi-detached from the rest of the UK - but it’s running a little scared.

There is no plan. For the time being, our economic team is just looking at this increase (announced Thursday),  Temer told journalists during a meeting of the South American trade bloc Mercosur. He added:  I don't know if there will be a need for more later, but not now.  In a speech earlier, Temer said Brazilians would understand the need to raise taxes to shrink the budget gap and recover investor confidence in Brazil's overdrawn government accounts. The tax hike was blasted by business leaders as the wrong way to go in restoring fiscal balance because it would hurt Brazilian's incipient recovery from its worst recession on record.  Their reaction is natural; nobody wants more taxes. But I am sure this will pass when they understand that meeting the fiscal target is fundamental for the country's stability and encouraging growth,  Temer said. The Finance and Planning ministries announced on Thursday that the government was freezing an additional 5.9 billion reais  ($1.9 billion) in federal spending this year, and increasing the federal PIS/Cofins social contribution tax on gasoline, diesel and ethanol to raise about 10.4 billion reais in new revenues. Brazil plans to cut its budget deficit to 139 billion reais this year before interest payments. Earlier this year it had announced a budget freeze of 39 billion reais to meet that target.

The lawmakers asked that the review include consideration of what effect the merger could have on access to healthy foods in less privileged areas, or  food deserts,  where residents may have limited access to fresh groceries.  While we do not oppose the merger at this time, we are concerned about what this merger could mean for African-American communities across the country already suffering from a lack of affordable healthy food choices from grocers,  the letter said. The letter was signed by U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and 11 additional Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker. It was made public by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in America. Fudge's office confirmed it was sent by her. Amazon did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Amazon's plan announced in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and possibly hurt employment. Still, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. The letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the UFCW union. “Political concerns about Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods are growing for good reason,” said Marc Perrone, President of the UFCW. “Amazon’s monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard-working men and women at Whole Foods, it’s also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.

In March, the East African nation became the first country to issue a mobile phone-based bond, which can be bought by phone users without the need for them to have a bank account. Investors can use mobile phone networks' financial platforms like M-Pesa to send money and  receive interest payments on the M-Akiba bonds, which can be traded in the secondary market. Kenya's first such three-year infrastructure bond raised its target of 150 million shillings within days and it launched the sale of the second tranche last month. However, the second tranche had raised only 128 million shillings by midday on Friday, the finance ministry told Reuters, without offering more details. Kenya has a vibrant conventional bond market, which the government relies on to raise the bulk if its financial borrowing requirements, but it is pushing through mobile phone bonds to tap into a wider pool of retail investors. Only a few ordinary Kenyans bought traditional government bonds, scared off by the minimum investment of 50,000 shillings and the need for a commercial bank account. Investors can buy the M-Akiba bond for as little as 3,000 shillings, earning a tax-free interest of 10 percent. There was no immediate explanation for the lower demand on the latest mobile phone bond, but Kenya is in the midst of election campaigns ahead of an Aug. 8 poll that has seen some businesses and investors take a wait-and-see attitude.  Elections are often tense in Kenya after 1,200 people were killed in ethnic violence that broke out due to a disputed presidential election in December 2007.

Several other European countries, including Belgium, Finland and Switzerland, are looking at possible orders of the aircraft at a time when tensions between NATO and Russia have increased. Officials from Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, gave officials an update on the $379 billion program, the Pentagon's costliest arms project, as allies in Europe move toward increased use of the jets in coming years, they said.  We've come together as a team of allies and partners to begin to set the conditions on ... operating the F-35 in the European theater,  Major General Timothy Fay, deputy commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, said in a statement. Italy, which participated in the meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, was the first nation to fly the new fighter outside the United States, and already has three jets in Italy. Norway will have jets in country by the end of the year, Israel already has five on hand, and Britain will have jets flying in Europe next year, according to a Pentagon spokesman for the F-35 program.

More than 250 civil rights activists, executives and others registered to speak to the Republican-dominated Senate as it began consideration of the measure, the most closely watched item on the state's agenda during a 30-day special session. So-called  bathroom bills  have become a flashpoint of U.S. culture wars, with social conservatives saying they protect public safety and civil rights activists saying the measures allow government-sanctioned bias against transgender people. Ashley Smith, a transgender woman and San Antonio architect, said transgender women suffer more violence than the general public, and a bathroom bill would make her more fearful.  Can’t you see how this legislation would make the very real problem of assault even worse?  she asked members of the Senate Committee on State Affairs. Smith drew wide notice on the internet this week after posting a picture of herself with Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a supporter of the bathroom measure who she suggested had no idea she was transgender.

If the measure is enacted, the state could lose about $1.4 billion from lost conventions, sports contests and other events, they said.

Mortgage banking income fell by double digits on a percentage basis at most regional banks that have reported results so far. BB&T; Corp (BBT.N) posted a 15 percent fall in mortgage banking income, while U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), the largest regional bank, said revenue from mortgage banking fell 11 percent. Along with the slump in refinancing, higher funding costs and increased competition have undermined gains from a recovery in the housing sector that has been driven by higher wages and a stronger labor market. Financing applications are increasing as more buyers enter the market for the first time, while 30-year mortgage rates are still at their lowest in years despite recent rate increases. Banks started to benefit from refinancing after the 2008-2009 financial crisis because of near-zero interest rates and various federal programs aimed at helping struggling borrowers. But mortgage rates are starting to inch higher - the borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 3.96 percent in the week ended July 20. That compares with 3.45 percent a year-ago. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times since June last year bringing the target overnight rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.  We expect refinance volume will likely to drop more than 40 percent this year relative to last year,  said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at Mortgage Bankers Association.  With the decline in volume, we are seeing vigorous competition for the loans that are getting done, and profit margins have narrowed for all lenders,  he said. Atlanta, Georgia-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), which reported earnings on Friday, said mortgage-related income fell $63 million in the quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 33 percent to 41 percent last week. While mortgage banking remained a dark spot, most regional lenders benefited from having to set aside less money to meet future losses as their energy portfolios improved. Provision for loan losses fell between 38 percent and 65 percent at SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and Comerica Inc (CMA.N). BB&T; Chief Executive Kelly Stuart struck a positive note for the future.  Soon, the structure will be set for the future, and auto will begin to grow again, and mortgage will stabilize and probably slow a little bit again then grow again.

The complaint was raised by a Spaniard who said her brother was arrested, tortured and executed in 2013 at a center in Damascus under the control of Syrian security forces. The Spanish woman filed her case after identifying her brother from a cache of more than 50,000 photos smuggled out of the country by a Syrian forensics officer showing more than 6,000 people who had been tortured and mutilated.  A judge at the Madrid-based High Court agreed in March to investigate the lawsuit in March, the first case against Syrian security forces taken up overseas.  But a higher panel within the High Court ruled on Friday that the investigation should be dropped following an appeal by Spain's state prosecutors.  The woman's legal representatives, London-based Guernica 37, said they had not received any notification of the decision, but might lodge an appeal to the Spanish Supreme Court.   This is a setback and we are of course disappointed, but this is just a step in the legal process. We remain confident in the strength of our case and the firm jurisdictional basis,  Guernica 37 said in a statement.  Under Spanish law, the examining magistrate investigates accusations brought in a criminal complaint before moving into a trial phase. Spain was once a pioneer of  universal jurisdiction , whereby judges could pursue criminal cases originating anywhere in the world. Spanish courts led investigations into human rights abuses in Argentina and Rwanda under this premise.  But the conservative government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy moved to curb these powers in 2014, arguing that they could cause diplomatic conflicts, and it passed the new limits through parliament. Cases now must have a clear Spanish connection to proceed.

The source said Hammond made a presentation to the Goldman Sachs board on June 29 when chief executive Lloyd Blankfein was in London for the annual board meeting. The source confirmed an earlier Sky News report which said Hammond had offered private reassurances that he wanted a long transition period to help banks prepare for Brexit and ease concerns of a  cliff-edge  exit from the bloc.  The Sky report said Hammond did not offer Goldman assurances above or beyond his public attempts to reassure the business community that the government was aware of its concerns.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Asked to confirm the Sky report and its contents, a Treasury spokesman said:  As you would expect, the chancellor (Hammond)regularly meets with businesses to hear their views, most recently participating in the prime minister's business advisory group and hosting a roundtable with asset managers.  Banks are keen to see transitional arrangements put in place to give them time to adapt to the huge legal and regulatory change Brexit is likely to bring.  But while Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants a  phased process of implementation  to smooth the country's path out of the EU, many in her party fear a lengthy transition period could be used to water down or block Britain's eventual exit.  Hammond, who is seen as one of the most pro-European members of May's cabinet, said on Sunday that the majority of senior ministers now agreed on the need for a transition period. Leading Brexiteer Michael Gove endorsed that view on Friday. However, in response to the uncertainty over what the transition will look like, international banks are planning to set up subsidiaries in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate across the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019. Bank of America BAC. on Friday became the first Wall Street lender to pick Dublin as its new base for its European Union operations. Goldman has not formally announced any similar plans but Blankfein has previously said he would like to see an implementation period of at least  a couple of years  once the British exit deal is agreed. He has said the bank has  contingency plans  to move people depending on the outcome of the negotiations.

There is no plan. For the time being, our economic team is just looking at this increase (announced Thursday),  Temer told journalists during a meeting of the South American trade bloc Mercosur. He added:  I don't know if there will be a need for more later, but not now.  In a speech earlier, Temer said Brazilians would understand the need to raise taxes to shrink the budget gap and recover investor confidence in Brazil's overdrawn government accounts. The tax hike was blasted by business leaders as the wrong way to go in restoring fiscal balance because it would hurt Brazilian's incipient recovery from its worst recession on record.  Their reaction is natural; nobody wants more taxes. But I am sure this will pass when they understand that meeting the fiscal target is fundamental for the country's stability and encouraging growth,  Temer said. The Finance and Planning ministries announced on Thursday that the government was freezing an additional 5.9 billion reais  ($1.9 billion) in federal spending this year, and increasing the federal PIS/Cofins social contribution tax on gasoline, diesel and ethanol to raise about 10.4 billion reais in new revenues. Brazil plans to cut its budget deficit to 139 billion reais this year before interest payments. Earlier this year it had announced a budget freeze of 39 billion reais to meet that target. The deficit in the 12 months through May was at 167.6 billion reais, equivalent to 2.59 percent of gross domestic product.

Gains in the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries pointed to moves into safe-haven assets rather than stocks that are considered riskier. Oil prices sank 2 percent. The euro built on sharp gains from a day earlier, rising to near two-year highs against the dollar and undermining European stocks, with Germany's DAX equity index falling 1.7 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down.  The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro ... certainly gave the green light for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.22 percent, falling after 10 days of gains. U.S. stock indexes traded modestly lower, pulling back from record high levels reached earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.46 points, or 0.21 percent, to 21,566.32, the S&P; 500 lost 2.78 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,470.67 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.93 points, or 0.14 percent, to 6,381.07. General Electric shares dropped 3.2 percent after the industrial conglomerate's profit report. Visa shares gained 1.8 pct after the payments network operator's results, as a big week of corporate earnings came to an end. “The market is pausing after another stellar run to record high levels, as people take modest profits off the table and cut back on risk just a little bit going into the weekend,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Next week, investors will be focusing on a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, the release of second-quarter economic growth data, as well as another flood of corporate results. Headwinds In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.10 percent.  FX strength is set to weigh on euro earners’ results, which will likely contribute to subdued beat ratios for the remainder of the season,  said Deutsche Bank equity strategist Wolf von Rotberg. In currencies, the dollar index fell 0.41 percent, falling to its lowest point since June 2016. The euro was up 0.37 percent to $1.1672. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.74 percent versus the greenback at 111.08 per dollar. Aside from the ECB comments, investors were also assessing whether Trump's recent legislative setbacks and developments involving a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. general election were threatening his domestic plans for tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  Compounding the (weaker dollar) move is this latest news on the political front in the U.S. about the Russia investigation expanding to Trump’s business affairs,” said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. “This is on top of the fact that Senate has not been able to pass anything meaningful on the healthcare front.  U.S. Treasury yields fell in step with European yields as the euro strengthened against the dollar, raising doubts whether the ECB would scale back its bond purchases later in 2017. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.2322 percent, from 2.266 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices sank after a consultant forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output, reigniting concerns the global market will stay awash with crude. U.S. crude fell 2.3 percent to $45.84 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.19, down 2.25 percent on the day. Spot gold added 0.8 percent to $1,253.89 an ounce, as the weaker dollar made bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies.

Mortgage banking income fell by double digits on a percentage basis at most regional banks that have reported results so far. BB&T; Corp (BBT.N) posted a 15 percent fall in mortgage banking income, while U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), the largest regional bank, said revenue from mortgage banking fell 11 percent. Along with the slump in refinancing, higher funding costs and increased competition have undermined gains from a recovery in the housing sector that has been driven by higher wages and a stronger labor market. Financing applications are increasing as more buyers enter the market for the first time, while 30-year mortgage rates are still at their lowest in years despite recent rate increases. Banks started to benefit from refinancing after the 2008-2009 financial crisis because of near-zero interest rates and various federal programs aimed at helping struggling borrowers. But mortgage rates are starting to inch higher - the borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 3.96 percent in the week ended July 20. That compares with 3.45 percent a year-ago. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times since June last year bringing the target overnight rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.  We expect refinance volume will likely to drop more than 40 percent this year relative to last year,  said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at Mortgage Bankers Association.  With the decline in volume, we are seeing vigorous competition for the loans that are getting done, and profit margins have narrowed for all lenders,  he said. Atlanta, Georgia-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), which reported earnings on Friday, said mortgage-related income fell $63 million in the quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 33 percent to 41 percent last week. While mortgage banking remained a dark spot, most regional lenders benefited from having to set aside less money to meet future losses as their energy portfolios improved. Provision for loan losses fell between 38 percent and 65 percent at SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and Comerica Inc (CMA.N). BB&T; Chief Executive Kelly Stuart struck a positive note for the future.  Soon, the structure will be set for the future, and auto will begin to grow again, and mortgage will stabilize and probably slow a little bit again then grow again.

The Congressional Budget Office said last month that Congress would need to raise the debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid a default. Investors are concerned that efforts to raise the debt ceiling will come down to the wire as disagreements among Republicans on healthcare legislation show a lack of consensus among lawmakers. “I think that the healthcare bill is the catalyst for it this week,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. “You can see a very significant discount for October bills.  Discord over healthcare is also pushing back budget negotiations with legislators due to take recess in August, which will delay activity until they return in early September. Yields on three-month Treasury bills, which are due to mature on Oct. 19, rose to 1.17 percent on Friday, near its highest levels since October 2008, and more than the 1.09 percent yields paid on six-month debt. Longer-dated debt normally pays higher returns than shorter-dated bills, with an inversion in the yield curve reflecting that investors are concerned with being repaid in October. The three-month yields are on track for their largest weekly percentage increase since March 3, having jumped from 1.03 percent last Friday. Investors may also be avoiding October maturities due to the early notice that it is the most likely month that the government will run out of funds. “I think the main reason the market’s starting to price in some debt ceiling risk is that we don’t normally have a fairly accurate estimate of the ‘X date’ this far out,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. The early October timeframe has extra credence as large federal outlays are due on Oct. 2, Goldberg said. Funding markets are not yet reflecting concern about the debt limit as a large portion of the market is overnight loans, though if no resolution is reached by October that is likely to change. When negotiations over raising the debt ceiling came down to the wire in October 2013 investors pulled cash from the repo market on concern about receiving debt maturing that month as collateral, adding to pressure on bond yields.

The two-day gathering in Germany this week included officials from Denmark, Israel, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and Britain - all of which are buying the F-35, according to U.S. Air Force and Pentagon officials. Several other European countries, including Belgium, Finland and Switzerland, are looking at possible orders of the aircraft at a time when tensions between NATO and Russia have increased. Officials from Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, gave officials an update on the $379 billion program, the Pentagon's costliest arms project, as allies in Europe move toward increased use of the jets in coming years, they said.  We've come together as a team of allies and partners to begin to set the conditions on ... operating the F-35 in the European theater,  Major General Timothy Fay, deputy commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, said in a statement. Italy, which participated in the meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, was the first nation to fly the new fighter outside the United States, and already has three jets in Italy. Norway will have jets in country by the end of the year, Israel already has five on hand, and Britain will have jets flying in Europe next year, according to a Pentagon spokesman for the F-35 program. Several Dutch jets are participating in testing in the United States, he said. Turkey's first aircraft is still being built, and Denmark last year decided to buy 27 jets in coming years. Air Force General Tod Wolters, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, said the F-35 was a  force multiplier  and  game changer for missile defense .  Wolters urged military leaders to codify common tactics, techniques and procedures to prepare for joint use of the aircraft in Europe, which will mark the first time that U.S. allies are flying stealth aircraft. Officials will meet again in October to address issues such as operations, maintenance, logistics and intelligence.

The source said Hammond made a presentation to the Goldman Sachs board on June 29 when chief executive Lloyd Blankfein was in London for the annual board meeting. The source confirmed an earlier Sky News report which said Hammond had offered private reassurances that he wanted a long transition period to help banks prepare for Brexit and ease concerns of a  cliff-edge  exit from the bloc.  The Sky report said Hammond did not offer Goldman assurances above or beyond his public attempts to reassure the business community that the government was aware of its concerns.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Asked to confirm the Sky report and its contents, a Treasury spokesman said:  As you would expect, the chancellor (Hammond)regularly meets with businesses to hear their views, most recently participating in the prime minister's business advisory group and hosting a roundtable with asset managers.  Banks are keen to see transitional arrangements put in place to give them time to adapt to the huge legal and regulatory change Brexit is likely to bring.  But while Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants a  phased process of implementation  to smooth the country's path out of the EU, many in her party fear a lengthy transition period could be used to water down or block Britain's eventual exit.  Hammond, who is seen as one of the most pro-European members of May's cabinet, said on Sunday that the majority of senior ministers now agreed on the need for a transition period. Leading Brexiteer Michael Gove endorsed that view on Friday. However, in response to the uncertainty over what the transition will look like, international banks are planning to set up subsidiaries in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate across the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019. Bank of America BAC. on Friday became the first Wall Street lender to pick Dublin as its new base for its European Union operations. Goldman has not formally announced any similar plans but Blankfein has previously said he would like to see an implementation period of at least  a couple of years  once the British exit deal is agreed. He has said the bank has  contingency plans  to move people depending on the outcome of the negotiations.

After Snap, Blue Apron and YogaWorks appeared to spell doom for initial public offerings of trendy, fast-growing businesses, shares of PetIQ jumped by a third in their Friday debut after having priced at the top of the range. A more sensible valuation helped the maker of canine treats and medicine, but it also may have wagged the dog. Like social media, meal kits or body-and-mind studios, PetIQ is capitalizing on a hot and hyped area. Some $7.4 billion worth of pet treatments for tapeworm, ticks and the like were sold in the United States last year and sales are expected to grow by a fifth in the next few years. Unlike its recent IPO predecessors, though, PetIQ managed to turn a profit, albeit a small one. In the first quarter, the firm generated a bottom line of about $4 million on some $67 million of sales. Beyond the recent move into the black, PetIQ also cuddled up to investors. With some 20 million shares sold at $16 each, the Idaho-based company was initially valued at $322 million. That's less than two times 2016 revenue, about half what retailer PetSmart paid for e-commerce rival Chewy in May. Blue Apron initially tried for a similar multiple and YogaWorks also had been seeking more than three times sales before yanking its IPO earlier this week. Just like its voguish share-selling peers, though, PetIQ remains vulnerable to competition. Blue Apron shares suffered, for example, after Amazon revealed plans to box up ingredients and recipes, too. PetIQ counts the e-commerce titan as a client, but that doesn't mean it – or other retailers or drugmakers like Perrigo – won't someday produce and market rival products. Even for pet-supply investors, it can be all too easy to forget what a dog-eat-dog world it is.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Muhiddin Kabiri, leader of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), said the relatives of at least 10 activists who had taken part in a conference in Germany on July 9 marking the 20th anniversary of a peace accord had been targeted. The government said it had received no complaints of intimidation. The mostly Muslim former Soviet republic banned the IRPT in 2015, accusing it of being linked to a failed coup and prompting a number of party leaders and activists, including Kabiri, to leave the country. The IRPT denies being involved in attempts to topple the government, but, according to Kabiri, its aim is to stop President Imomali Rakhmon passing power to family members. Human Rights Watch separately said this week that authorities, including police and security officers, visited the relatives of the activists both ahead and after the conference.  They use them (the relatives of activists) as hostages , Kabiri said.  Many activists have already given up the fight (because of threats to their relatives).  His comments echoed those of the New York-based rights group.  The Tajik government’s vicious campaign of intimidation against dissidents’ relatives is widening and becoming ever more brazen,” Steve Swerdlow, Central Asia researcher for HRW, said.  The simultaneous actions by security services and local officials across numerous cities suggest a policy of collective punishment sanctioned at the highest levels, which should end immediately.” The Dortmund conference marked the 20th anniversary of a peace accord which ended a devastating civil war in Tajikistan. IRPT founders had been among those fighting the government of Rakhmon and later, in 2000, accused him of violating the agreement in order to boost his powers. Asked whether the authorities were intimidating the relatives of opposition activists, who are wanted in Tajikistan on charges of extremism and terrorism, Tajik Interior Minister Ramazon Rahimzoda said on Friday his ministry had received no such complaints.  If they have been questioned as witnesses about the whereabouts of their relatives, this does not equal persecution or humiliation,  he said. Kabiri said there may have been more cases of intimidation which went unreported because the families chose not to tell activists living abroad about them. Kabiri said he had no direct contacts with his own relatives living in Tajikistan.

Women who had common blood pressure problems like preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during their first pregnancy had 12 to 25 times higher odds of having elevated blood pressure in the first year after delivery than women who had normal blood pressure during pregnancy, researchers report in The BMJ.  Over the first decade after delivery, women with high blood pressure during pregnancy had 10 times higher chances of developing chronic hypertension, the study also found.  “We already knew that women who had had preeclampsia or gestational hypertension during pregnancy had an increased risk of developing chronic hypertension later in life, but the conventional wisdom was that `later in life’ was years or decades postpartum,” said senior study author Dr. Heather Boyd of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. “We looked year by year, starting right after pregnancy, and found that the risk of chronic hypertension is increased right from the start,” Boyd said by email.  Boyd and colleagues examined data on more than 1 million women who had babies or stillbirths in Denmark from 1978 to 2012.  They found the increased risk of chronic hypertension after a high blood pressure disorder during pregnancy got larger for older first-time mothers.  For women who had first pregnancies in their 20s, 14 percent who developed high blood pressure while pregnant had chronic hypertension during the first decade after delivery, compared with 4 percent of their peers with normal blood pressure during pregnancy.  Among women who had first pregnancies in their 40s, 32 percent of those who had high blood pressure during pregnancy got hypertension over the next decade, compared with 11 percent of women who had normal blood pressure during pregnancy.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if pregnancy conditions like preeclampsia or gestational hypertension cause high blood pressure later in life.  Even so, the results suggest that even young women who develop high blood pressure during pregnancy should be monitored for symptoms of heart disease long before they reach middle age, when hypertension becomes more common, Boyd said.  A separate U.S. study in The BMJ examined data on more than 5,500 women with a history of high blood pressure during pregnancy and found that obesity may influence their odds of developing chronic high blood pressure after delivery.  “Women are generally advised to keep a healthy weight before and throughout pregnancy,” said lead study author Dr. Simon Timpka of Lund University Diabetes Center in Malmo, Sweden. “In order to reduce the risk of post-pregnancy hypertension, it appears especially important for women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to keep a healthy weight,” Timpka said by email.  Avoiding chronic high blood pressure after preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, however, isn’t all about diet and exercise, said Dr. Leonie Callaway, author of an accompanying editorial and professor at the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research. “It is also about work-life balance, contentment, spirituality, engagement in nature, social connections, family connections, etc.,” Callaway said by email. “Take a diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy as a special gift - a warning that you are a special person and you really need to take care of yourself.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2twXFUJ, bit.ly/2vrXmbp and bit.ly/2tO5NLV The BMJ, online July 12, 2017.

Preferred shares in Petrobras, as the company is known, slipped 2.3 percent, subtracting the most points from Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index.     The shares moved after the government raised the federal PIS/Cofins social contribution tax on gasoline, diesel in ethanol to cover a budget shortfall, increasing concerns of reduced demand because of higher prices.     But the outlook for higher prices was not enough to dissuade traders that the central bank will cut interest rates by an aggressive 100 basis points in its meeting this month.     Rate-future yields, which were nearly flat on Thursday, suggested an 86 percent chance that of a 100 basis-point reduction in the benchmark Selic rate to 9.25 percent.       The impact is relevant on consumer prices though I don't think this is essentially 'inflationary,'  Santander Brasil managing director Sandro Sobral wrote in a note to clients.  The net result is positive when looking at the fiscal impact.      Economists at Banco BTG Pactual on Thursday revised their forecast the Selic rate and now expect it to fall as low as 8 percent, compared to 8.5 percent previously, while  also recognizing that there is at this stage a greater probability of an even lower figure.      Shares in Localiza Rent a Car SA, Brazil's largest rental car company, touched an all-time high and were the biggest gainers on the benchmark index after falling interest rates helped it to post record quarterly profit.      The Brazilian real seesawed, but still headed for its fourth straight week of gains.     It has been the best-performing currency in Latin America this month after a proposal to reform the country's labor regulations cleared Congress, suggesting resilient lawmaker support for President Michel Temer's reform agenda despite a political crisis.     The Mexican peso slipped 0.6 percent as the drop in crude prices drove investors to book profits on the currency, which reached this year's peak earlier this week.     It was set to gain for a third straight week, boosted by trader optimism over a trade deal between Mexico and the United States, as well as bets on a slower-than-expected pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.

Gross domestic product (GDP) in North Korea last year rose 3.9 percent from the previous year when the economy contracted due to a drought and low commodity prices, the Bank of Korea said. The expansion, driven by mining and energy, marked the biggest rise since a 6.1 percent gain in 1999. North Korea, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also boosted exports by 4.6 percent, the most since an 11.8 percent jump in 2013. Still, the isolated state's per capita gross national income in 2016 was just 1.5 million won ($1,342), less than 5 percent of the comparable number in South Korea.  North Korea does not publish economic data. The Bank of Korea has released GDP data on North Korea every year since 1991 based on information from government agencies including South Korea's Ministry of Unification and the National Intelligence Service. The estimate is widely used by international organizations and researchers.  North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches. Missiles Likely Boosted Output The robust economic growth may partly be due to the North's active nuclear and missile development program, as the manufacture of components is included when calculating GDP growth, according to Shin Seung-cheol, an official at the BOK.  Shin added North Korea had boosted electricity production in 2016 but could not confirm whether this was linked to missile manufacturing. In February, China banned all imports of coal from its reclusive neighbor, cutting off its most important export. China is also restricting the flow of oil into the North. The United States is mulling new sanctions on Chinese firms and bank doing business with Pyongyang on top of trying to get China and Russia to back a new U.N. Security Council resolution imposing stiffer sanctions on North Korea following its latest missile test. In 2016, China accounted for 92.5 percent of all North Korean trade, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) on Friday.

North Korea can bypass some sanctions but coal is critical for their economy and it is something that's difficult to smuggle. Coal can be spotted easily when it's being moved,  said Kim. Lim Soo-ho, a research head at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said that sanctions didn’t bite hard last year, as China loosened some of its earlier restrictions in the second half after South Korea decided to deploy a U.S. anti-missile defense system.  With expanding sanctions, there are more downside risks to its growth this year than last,  Lim said.  Pyongyang’s heavy industries and manufacturing sectors could be hit hard if China continues to cut fuel sales to North Korea.  The Bank of Korea official declined to comment on how the Chinese coal ban and tightened international sanctions since last year would affect North Korea's economy in 2017. The United Nations' food agency said on Thursday North Korea is facing severe food shortages due to the worst drought since 2001. Kim said it was too early to say whether North Korea's crops will suffer, as the Korean Peninsula has seen much rain in recent weeks. Fraction of s.korea Economy North Korea's 2016 GDP in real terms stood at 32.0 trillion won ($28.50 billion), according to the Bank of Korea data - a fraction of South Korea's 1,508.3 trillion won ($1.34 trillion). Mining and manufacturing make up the biggest portion of North Korea's industry, accounting last year for 33.2 percent of the sector. Overall exports from North Korea, excluding trade with South Korea, rose 4.6 percent last year to $2.82 billion thanks to shipments of fishery products, which soared 74.0 percent, the South's central bank said. North Korea imports rose 4.8 percent to $3.73 billion, led by plant products and textiles. Although trade between the two Koreas plunged 87.7 percent last year due to a shutdown of a joint industrial zone the North shared with the South just north of the border, the North's headline trade numbers were barely affected, the data showed. The Kaesong Industrial Zone was shut down early last year after the North tested a long-range rocket in February defying U.N. sanctions.

The 16 students and three staff from Poynton High School in Cheshire in northern England were denied entry by immigration staff for having tourist visas. Headteacher David Waugh said the school had made three previous trips to support a Macclesfield-based charity, India Direct, which runs two homes for 165 destitute children in Chennai and in a nearby fishing village. He said the students had always traveled on tourist visas as they did not work for the charity once there but simply visited the homes to deliver toys and other goods. Waugh reported feelings of  sadness and shock  in the community as the charity has been an integral part of the school since 2005, with students raising more than 27,000 pounds ($35,000) for their work.  A barrier has been put up between students simply reaching out from here to there,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Waugh said attempts to reach the Indian High Commission were unsuccessful as he was referred to the complaint section of their website. The Indian High Commission did not respond to a request for comment by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The block on their entry comes after civil society groups in India have come under increased government scrutiny in recent years, particularly since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power. More than 10,000 charities in India have had their licenses to receive or donate foreign funds canceled or suspended since 2014, hampering their ability to work in areas ranging from housing and education to health and sanitation. India Direct said attempts to get the immigration decision overturned were unsuccessful, with a disappointing outcome for the students.  Our hearts go out to this great team of staff and students, who have already made a real difference, and who must be so disappointed,  the charity said on its website.  As you can imagine the staff and students are in a state of tired shock, having traveled for 48 hours as a round trip.  Editing by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith and Lyndsay Griffiths.

Founded by the chief executive of derivatives specialist Leonteq and based in Switzerland's 'Crypto Valley', Flynt aims to offer wealthy clients a platform from which to manage their asset portfolios, from bank accounts to real estate.   The banking license allows Flynt the required independence to approach wealth management in new ways and using innovative technologies, thus enabling private and institutional clients, such as entrepreneurs and family offices, to independently control their total wealth at all times,  the group said in a statement. Flynt currently employs 43 people. The Commercial Registry of the Canton of Zug confirmed  Flynt's registration as a bank and said the information would be published in two to three working days. In recent years, a variety of fintech players have received European banking licenses.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law called for federal banking and securities regulators to create limits on incentive-based compensation at big financial companies and prevent executives from receiving outsized rewards for overly risky gambles. Last year those regulators, many appointed by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, rolled out a 500-page rule over many weeks that would require senior executives to return  bonuses earned by making decisions that materially hurt their banks. But in the biannual White House agenda on regulation, the rule was listed under the heading  long-term action,  instead of one denoting regulators were making progress toward a final version. In Washington-speak that meant the rule was dead. The move followed President Donald Trump's campaign pledges to lighten federal regulations that hurt liquidity and strangled business.  They’re not even working on it,  said Lisa Gilbert, who closely tracks Dodd-Frank implementation for the liberal-leaning public interest group Public Citizen.

Any action acquisition has to compete with what we consider our very strong organic investment portfolio,  Peabody said on a conference call after the company reported a smaller loss for its second quarter. Global producers have been bailing on Canadian resource investments due to higher development costs, limited pipeline capacity to get crude to market and concerns about high carbon emissions in the sector. Assets are expected to be available cheaply as the pool of buyers dwindles, investors have said. Husky is prioritizing investments in its offshore business and its integrated operations, Peabody said.   Chief Financial Officer Jonathan McKenzie said:  What you won't see us do is something that's off strategy or outside of sort of the existing operating areas that we're in.   Husky on Friday reported a net loss of C$93 million ($73.89 million), or 10 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of C$196 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. The Calgary, Alberta-based company's smaller loss was helped partly by higher oil prices and an increase in production. Oil prices began to rise late last year after a two-year slump, now hovering around $50 per barrel, as an OPEC-led production cut and rebounding demand slowly erode a global glut. The company's second-quarter production rose to 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), from 316,000 boed, a year earlier. Husky, which is controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, realized C$41.48 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in the second quarter, up from C$34.59 per boe a year earlier.     In the year-ago quarter, Husky had incurred a C$105 million after-tax loss related to dispositions, property impairment and asset write-downs. Husky's earnings came about a year after one of the company's pipelines leaked in the province of Saskatchewan and spilled into river, costing the company C$107 million in clean-up costs. The province has said it may lay charges.  Peabody said Husky expects to receive permission to repair the line and will change its design and monitoring equipment before restarting it.

Any action acquisition has to compete with what we consider our very strong organic investment portfolio,  Peabody said on a conference call after the company reported a smaller loss for its second quarter. Global producers have been bailing on Canadian resource investments due to higher development costs, limited pipeline capacity to get crude to market and concerns about high carbon emissions in the sector. Assets are expected to be available cheaply as the pool of buyers dwindles, investors have said. Husky is prioritizing investments in its offshore business and its integrated operations, Peabody said.   Chief Financial Officer Jonathan McKenzie said:  What you won't see us do is something that's off strategy or outside of sort of the existing operating areas that we're in.   Husky on Friday reported a net loss of C$93 million ($73.89 million), or 10 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of C$196 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. The Calgary, Alberta-based company's smaller loss was helped partly by higher oil prices and an increase in production. Oil prices began to rise late last year after a two-year slump, now hovering around $50 per barrel, as an OPEC-led production cut and rebounding demand slowly erode a global glut. The company's second-quarter production rose to 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), from 316,000 boed, a year earlier. Husky, which is controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, realized C$41.48 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in the second quarter, up from C$34.59 per boe a year earlier.     In the year-ago quarter, Husky had incurred a C$105 million after-tax loss related to dispositions, property impairment and asset write-downs. Husky's earnings came about a year after one of the company's pipelines leaked in the province of Saskatchewan and spilled into river, costing the company C$107 million in clean-up costs. The province has said it may lay charges.  Peabody said Husky expects to receive permission to repair the line and will change its design and monitoring equipment before restarting it.

A White House official confirmed the departure of Spicer, 45, and said Trump had named Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci as his new, top communications official. While not a surprise, Spicer's departure was abrupt and reflected heightened turmoil within Trump's legal and communication teams amid a widening investigation into possible ties between Trump's 2016 campaign and the Kremlin. Parodied memorably by Melissa McCarthy on the  Saturday Night Live  sketch comedy show for his combative encounters with the White House press corps, Spicer became one of the Trump administration's most recognized figures. He invited controversy from the beginning, attacking the news media in his debut appearance as press secretary for reporting what he called inaccurate crowd numbers at Trump's inauguration.  This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,  he said, an assertion that quickly drew scorn. While the White House official gave no reason for Spicer's resignation, the New York Times reported that he had quit over Scaramucci's appointment. Spicer had been serving as both press secretary and communications director, but with a lower profile recently. Spicer was targeted by critics for what they said were false or misleading statements. In recent weeks, he has less frequently taken the lectern in the White House press room. From the start, Spicer and other Trump aides sought to shake up the status quo in White House dealings with the media, including cutting back daily televised news briefings and replacing them with audio briefings only. When Trump tapped Spicer for the job of press secretary, he was spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Separately, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possible Trump-Russia ties, has asked White House officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, a source with knowledge of the request said on Friday. The White House said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders will give an on-camera briefing on Friday afternoon.

Royalty deals give the owner the right to receive a percentage of revenue or profits from a mining operation, often in exchange for financing. Reuters reported in May that Glencore had hired the Bank of Nova Scotia to sell its royalty assets, including one for the Antamina copper-zinc mine in Peru, which was expected to fetch up to $250 million. The sources said on Friday it was now in talks to create a 50:50 venture for the assets with Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.  A separate vehicle would help Glencore to secure supplies of copper, zinc and nickel for its trading unit. Both companies would also expand the portfolio by purchasing royalties from other miners' operations, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Glencore declined to comment and Ontario Teachers was not immediately available for comment.  Ontario Teachers, Canada's third biggest pension fund with net assets of more than C$175 billion ($139 billion), has some natural resources investments and also royalty interests in oil and gas, according to its website. Glencore is looking to maximize the value of its assets as it moves from cost-cutting to pursuing growth. Last month, it embarked in a bidding war with China's Yancoal for the Australian thermal coal assets being sold by Rio Tinto, while in May the miner approached U.S. grain trader Bunge Ltd over a potential business combination. Glencore, which owns a 33.75 percent stake in Antamina, has already monetized a portion of the mine's output.

Analysts, however, noted weekly declines in the rig count were likely just a brief pause in a drilling recovery expected to continue through at least 2019. Drillers cut 1 oil rig in the week to July 21, bringing the total count down to 764, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.  That compares with 371 active oil rigs during the same week a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 54 of the past 60 weeks since the start of June 2016. The rate of those additions, however, has slowed over the past few months with declining oil prices. Rig additions over the past four weeks averaged 2, its lowest since June 2016. U.S. crude futures were down almost 2 percent this week to under $46 a barrel on Friday after Petro-Logistics forecast OPEC production would rise in July.  Lingering worries about global oversupply have knocked around 15 percent off U.S. crude futures so far this year, despite a deal involving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of 2017 through the end of March 2018. Analysts said those OPEC-led efforts have been frustrated by increased drilling activity and rising output from U.S. shale drillers and other producers hoping to capture higher crude prices in future months. U.S. shale oil production is forecast to rise for an eighth straight month, climbing 112,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 5.6 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Department said on Monday. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading around $46 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching about $47 a barrel. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas rig count would rise to an average of 892 in 2017, 998 in 2018 and 1,107 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with 833 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 rig forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes. The rig count is an early indicator of future output. U.S.  producers are expected to boost output to 9.3 million bpd in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), a newly-empowered court that oversees Britain's fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to proceed to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced U.S.-style  opt-out  collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was  completely unsuitable  to be brought under the collective action regime. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as Mastercard on merchants' banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers.  The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,  he said.  I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.  He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the  perfect exam question  for Britain's CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country's maiden  opt-out  class action lawsuits in antitrust cases. Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out. Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses who fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together. London's High Court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

Shares of GE fell as much as 5.4 percent to their lowest level since Oct 2015, as the company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and its 2017 profit forecast came in at the low end. The stock's fall weighed on other industrials such as Caterpillar and 3M. Visa rose 1.8 percent after the world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast. The stock was the top boost on the Dow and the S&P.;  We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today,  said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.  GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market too.  Microsoft fell 0.7 percent, despite the company reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings. Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook . The Nasdaq came off its 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at record levels on Thursday. The tech sector, however, continues to be the best performing S&P; sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth from sectors relatively immune to a policy gridlock in Washington.  If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one,  said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:39 p.m. ET (1639 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.63 points, or 0.24 percent, at 21,559.15, the S&P; 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,470.47. The Nasdaq Composite was down 5.61 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,384.39. A rise in Netflix and biotech stocks Celgene and Gilead helped limit losses on the tech-heavy index. The S&P; and the Nasdaq are on track to close higher for the third straight week. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the industrials and energy sectors leading the decliners. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output. Honeywell International rose 1.2 percent after the technology and manufacturing company raised the low-end of its profit forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,651 to 1,119. On the Nasdaq, 1,601 issues fell and 1,158 advanced.

Sabia,SIEMENS,BOMBARDIER/TRANSPORTATION (UPDATE 2,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"FRANKFURT/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier and Germany's Siemens are in the final stages of talks to combine their rail operations, several sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, in a deal that would give the two added heft to compete against Chinese rail giant CRRC . The deal, which would create two separate joint ventures for their signalling and rolling-stock divisions, could be announced as early as August, the sources said. Bombardier and Siemens declined to comment. Siemens shares fell 2.2 percent while Bombardier was unchanged. Siemens' supervisory board will discuss the matter at its meeting on Aug. 2, while Bombardier's board is expected to consider it next week, the sources said, adding that an announcement could come in early August. Bombardier is not expected to discuss the deal on its second-quarter earnings call on July 28. No money would be exchanged as part of the deal, two of the sources said. Under the agreement, Bombardier would take just over a 50 percent stake in the planned combination of the rolling stock operations, one source said. Siemens would take roughly an 80 percent stake in a joint venture in the higher-margin signalling technology, two of the sources said. All of the sources, including one who talked to Reuters earlier in the week, spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. The companies have offered extensive job guarantees to get backing from the strong German labour side, two of the sources said. Rail consolidation has been a trend over the last few years, as global companies seek to contain costs and Western companies struggle with the rising ambitions of China's state-backed CRRC at home and abroad. Michael Sabia, chief executive officer of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which owns a 30 percent stake in Bombardier Transportation, told Reuters in June that he supports rail consolidation in general  to begin levelling the market,  given CRRC's size advantage.  A larger entity has a leg up on smaller entities when you’re looking at that kind of scale,  he said in an interview in New York.  We think that there’s value creation associated with that (consolidation).  During the interview, Sabia would not comment about a possible tie-up between Bombardier and Siemens, and a spokesman for the Caisse, Canada's second largest pension fund, was not immediately available for comment on Friday. Media reports about Siemens and Bombardier exploring a joint venture surfaced in April. Analysts warned at the time that a combined company with total sales of $16 billion would face antitrust concerns in Europe. Also, both companies might not agree on who would get a controlling stake in the venture, analysts said. The current potential deal addresses those concerns because control is divided through the two joint ventures. Two of the sources said Bombardier and Siemens would have to sell off some high-speed train operations to address the antitrust concerns. Bombardier, Siemens and French rival Alstom have talked to each other about combining their businesses in various arrangements over the past years. This would be the third attempt by Siemens and Bombardier, one of the people said. The advisers for Siemens are Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, and UBS for Bombardier. The banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.

Ping told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Berlin that Germany and the European Union had been supportive and vocal in their criticism of the August 2016 re-election of Gabonese President Ali Bongo, but said more action was required.  We are asking everybody to watch the situation seriously. Otherwise it's non-assistance to people in danger,  Ping said.   We tell them, 'Look, don't come after we have all been killed by that man.'  Ping, a former African Union chairman, accuses Bongo of cheating to win the election, and of using security forces to violently suppress protests in the weeks that followed. He said his home has been surrounded by soldiers for two years, although he is permitted to travel. Bongo in March offered to hold talks with opposition parties in a bid to ease tensions in the central African oil producer, but Ping rejected the offer as a  masquerade.  Gabon's Constitutional Court has dismissed Ping's allegations of vote-rigging, but international observers have also criticized the poll and the European Parliament in February called the results  extremely doubtful.  Ping met this week with officials from the German development and foreign ministries, as well as other European backers in France, Brussels and Geneva.  They are vocal. What we can maybe complain about is that being vocal is not sufficient. At the same time, they cannot do more than is possible. They have limitations,  he said. Ping said his party would also continue to organize protests and strikes to keep pressure on Bongo's government. He said he was disappointed that the United Nations had passed resolutions about violence in the Ivory Coast and Congo, but had not taken action about the situation in his country. He said he canceled plans to visit the United Nations and meet with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.  I don't need to be just received. But I have the impression that (anything beyond that) is a long way off because of the system,  he said. Bongo first came to power in 2009 after the death of his long-ruling father Omar Bongo. Unlike some of its neighbors, Gabon has little history of internal violence since independence from France in 1960, partly due to the latter's unwavering support for Omar Bongo in exchange for privileged commercial access.

While one minister in Berlin compared Ankara's behavior over the detention of six rights activists to the authoritarian former communist East Germany, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Germany to  pull itself together . Bilateral tensions were already high after bitter recriminations during a referendum in April on extending Erdogan's powers and a pullout of German troops from a Turkish air base that began this month. They rose further after Turkey detained the activists, including a German national, in custody two weeks ago. Turkey's economy minister sought to calm matters but Erdogan, renewing earlier criticism, accused Berlin of trying to scare German companies away from investing in Turkey.  Germany, home to three million people with Turkish roots, said it would review Turkish applications for arms projects.  We're checking all applications,  an Economy Ministry spokeswoman said. That means the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (Bafa) probably cannot issue new export approvals, but projects already agreed will not be affected initially. In 2016, the German government exported armaments worth 83.9 million euros to Turkey. In the first four months of 2017, business worth 22 million euros was approved, for navy deliveries and joint projects with other NATO partners. Germany has warned Germans traveling to Turkey that they do so at their own risk, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quoted on Friday as comparing Turkey with the former communist East German state - the German Democratic Republic (GDR).   Related CoverageTurkey committed to improving investment climate, rule of law, democracy: Deputy PMTurkey's Erdogan tells Germany to 'pull itself together'Turkey has over 680 German firms on terrorism black list: security source Turkey now makes arbitrary arrests and no longer sticks to minimum consular standards. That reminds me of how it was in the GDR,  he told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper. Schaeuble said those who traveled to the former Communist East before it collapsed in 1990 were aware that  if something happens to you, no one can help you . German officials say they have not had full consular access to arrested German activist Peter Steudtner, who was accused of terrorism - an allegation Berlin has dismissed as absurd. Another German citizen was arrested on charges of links to terrorism earlier this year. Turkish Secret Services FILE PHOTO: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble arrives to attend an European Union finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, July 11, 2017.Francois LenoirGermany's domestic security chief said Turkey had been carrying out ever more covert operations in Germany, especially since a failed coup attempt against Erdogan last July.  Since the coup attempt and domestic political changes there, we no longer see Turkey's intelligence service purely as a partner but also as an opponent,  BfV chief Hans-Georg Maassen said. Covert activities included influence operations targeting Germany-based Turks, with attempts to intimidate opponents of Erdogan. In March, German authorities barred Turkish ministers from speaking at mass rallies of expatriates backing the president's referendum campaign. He responded by accusing Berlin of  fascist actions . The activist arrests were part of a broader crackdown across Turkish society since last year's failed coup. More than 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in Turkey's civil service, military and private sector and more than 50,000 have been jailed.  Rights groups and some Western governments say Erdogan is using the crackdown as a pretext to quash dissent. The Turkish government says the measures are necessary given the gravity of the security threat it faces. They may have extended to German companies.  A security source told Reuters Turkey had sent German authorities a list of over 680 firms it suspected of supporting terrorism. Turkey's Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci told Reuters Germany's behavior in cautioning its citizens over travel to Turkey was  unfortunate , but he did not see harm accruing to tourism. So far this year, bookings from Germany have accounted for some 10 percent of Turkey's tourists. Last year, the number of foreign visitors to Turkey fell 30 percent amid bombings by Kurdish and Islamist militants, the lowest in nine years. The travel sector contributes about $30 billion to the economy in a normal year. Commercial links are close. Germany was Turkey's top export destination in 2016, buying $14 billion worth of Turkish goods, and the second biggest source of Turkish imports, at $21.5 billion. German news broadcaster n-tv said it would no longer run adverts that aimed to attract investment in Turkey.

Right now, it's about him getting back on the mound and us being conservative with him until the feel-good is there,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said. LHP Jake Diekman (abdomen) had his first bullpen session Thursday after playing catch at 170 feet Monday. He threw 21 pitches and was  very pleased  with the session. Diekman underwent three surgeries in the spring to rebuild his colon. He has not appeared in a game for the Rangers this season. LHP Cole Hamels pitched 24 consecutive scoreless innings before the Orioles Jonathan Schoop belted a solo homer in the fourth Thursday in the series finale. Adam Jones and Mark Trumbo also homered off Hamels, who had allowed only five long balls in his previous nine starts. Hamels, who was out from May to late June with a right oblique strain, tied a season high by allowing seven runs. He also yielded nine hits.  I am definitely not happy about it just for the fact that we obviously did not win the game,  Hamels said.  We were just trying to win one against these guys. I was not finishing off hitters in counts that are favorable for me. That's unacceptable on my part in not being able to get the job done when the team does actually give you a lead.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled Friday that wireless carrier Clearwire Corp was sold in 2013 for more than twice its fair value, a decision that dealt a stinging loss to the Aurelius Capital Management hedge fund which spent years battling to prove Clearwire was vastly underpriced. Sprint Corp acquired Clearwire in 2013 after a bidding war with Dish Network Corp pushed the price to $5 per share, valuing Clearwire at about $14 billion. After Clearwire shareholders approved the deal, an affiliate of Aurelius that had opposed the Sprint acquisition brought what is known as an appraisal action, asking a judge to determine fair value of the stock. The affiliate had sought $16.08 for each of its 25 million shares, or about $400 million. Vice Chancellor Travis Laster on Friday sided with Clearwire, which had said the fair price was $2.13 per share, or about $53 million for the fund's stock. Aurelius will also collect interest. The ruling stands out for a court that rarely finds fair value below deal price, let alone more than 50 percent below. The decision can be appealed. A spokesman for Aurelius, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, said it was pleased the court recognized Clearwire shareholders received a significant premium. Wall Street dealmakers have urged Delaware judges and lawmakers to discourage appraisal, which has been become an investment strategy for hedge funds. Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who studies appraisal, called the ruling unusual. Typically, each side presents extreme valuations and the judge finds fair value somewhere in the middle. Instead, Laster took Clearwire's valuation and rejected Aurelius's.  I think it's a message to litigants to be sure the arguments they put in front of the court are reasonable,  said Myers. The court has been criticized by dealmakers for not deferring to the negotiated deal price when a company ran a proper marketing and sale process. Laster found the Clearwire sale was fair to minority investors, but only after Dish intervened and the price was driven to $5 per share. The Delaware court has ruled in the past year that computer maker Dell Inc and DFC Global Corp, a lender, were both sold below fair value despite properly run mergers.

The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business.  It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts. GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio.   It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything,  said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to  hold  after Friday's results. Related CoverageGE incoming CEO Flannery to update 2018 outlook in NovemberIncoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook.  Still, the stock could be in  in a state of limbo  until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. GE's cash flow was below expectations and also weighed on the stock, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones.  People want to get the answers sooner  to Flannery's review. FILE PHOTO: The logo of General Electric Co. is pictured at the Global Operations Center in San Pedro Garza Garcia, neighbouring Monterrey, Mexico, May 12, 2017.Daniel Becerril/File PhotoShares were down 3 percent at $25.87 in mid-morning trading after earlier hitting a 2-year low. GE faced a  slow-growth, volatile environment  in the quarter, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in his final earnings release before his Aug. 1 retirement. Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009. Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom (ALSO.PA), merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston. Flannery said he is  in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses.  He also is  taking a hard look at our corporate spending  to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors. GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will  meet or exceed  its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management. GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division.  Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue. Net profit slumped 59 percent to $1.34 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $3.30 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings fell 45 percent to 28 cents a share, compared with estimates for 25 cents.

Britain's FTSE 100 index was down 0.5 percent, substantially outperforming European bourses, having earlier hit its highest level since mid-June. The relative weakness of the pound, close to an eight-month low against the euro, helped limit losses on the index whose exporting constituents tend to gain with a falling currency. The blue-chip stocks made a 1 percent gain on the week, their best weekly performance since May. Meanwhile mid-caps sealed their best weekly gains in nearly a year, up 1.8 percent on the week, though they dipped 0.1 percent on Friday. They were boosted higher this week by a recovery in construction contractor Carillion, which plummeted last week, and strongly received results from Weir Group and Sports Direct.  People have been indiscriminately selling the FTSE 250 and buying the FTSE 100, but contrary to what everyone thinks, there are all sorts of opportunities in the mid and small-cap indexes,  said Mark Martin, manager of the Neptune UK Opportunities fund. Mid-caps are up 9.2 percent this year, about double the performance of their larger FTSE 100 counterparts. On Friday shares in Paysafe rocketing 6.8 percent after a consortium of Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners made a 2.86 billion pound ($3.72 billion) bid for the firm, the latest move in a spate of deal-making in the payments industry.  On first impressions the acquisition appears to make sense, is not a particularly high multiple in the context of payments and we would estimate potential EPS accretion of around 10 percent,  UBS analysts said in a note. Among blue-chips betting firm Paddy Power Betfair led losers, down 3.3 percent after a double downgrade from Investec.  PPB should remain among the top five global listed online gambling stocks and so still deserves a premium rating, though below the current level,  Investec analysts said. But they added they saw shorter-term pressure for the shares as the market prices in punter-friendly sports results and a worsening regulatory outlook. Vodafone shares pared gains to trade up 0.5 percent after hitting a one-month high as it reported better-than-expected revenue growth for its first quarter thanks to a strong performance in Italy and Spain.  Whilst there's nothing here to kick-start a higher quantum of growth in the medium-term, the efficiency programme and the cash generation plans look to have remained on track,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. Healthcare was a rare bright spot, with Convatec and Shire up 1.7 to 1.9 percent. At the opposite end of the spectrum, shares in mid-cap Acacia Mining plummeted 17 percent after the troubled gold miner said its output would fall to the lower end of its full-year guidance after its first-half results were hit by Tanzania's export ban.

A native of Jerusalem who has covered the city for Reuters for 17 years, Awad headed to Ras al-Amud, directly across the valley from the Old City, from where the Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock stand out in the near distance. Knowing there were likely to be clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian worshippers, and that Muslims intended to pray in the street outside, he climbed up to the roof of a nearby mosque to gain a higher vantage point.  I know all these areas and the people know me, so it helps,  said Awad, 36, explaining how he managed to gain access to the mosque, which was shut by the imam to ensure that the faithful held their prayers outside.  I was on the roof and took lots of pictures of the men praying in the street, with the Old City and the Dome of the Rock in the background,  he explained.   After they finished praying, they started shouting 'Allah wa-Akbar' and some were chanting  I will sacrifice myself for al Aqsa  in Arabic. The Israeli police started to explode sound bombs to disperse the crowd.  I was going to come down, but I decided to stay and see what more pictures I could get.  As the sound bombs erupted, many of those who had been praying started to run. Others were still completing their prayers as the scene turned chaotic.  Awad fired off 20 frames as a tear gas canister was unleashed on the crowd. The light from the blast lit the scene, highlighting the colors as scores of men cowered from the bang.   I was lucky to get the picture,  he said.  As soon as I saw it, I knew it was the picture of the day. The men were finishing prayers, there's al Aqsa and the Old City in the background - it told the whole story.  Since Israel decided to install the metal detectors on Sunday, after two Israeli policemen were killed by attackers who had smuggled weapons into the holy compound, there have been nightly clashes near the Old City.  Awad has followed those events, capturing the raw scenes of running battles between Palestinian youth and security forces.  It's been an emotional week and an emotional day,  he said.

The euro climbed to a two-year high on Friday, sending the exporter-heavy STOXX 600  down 1 percent to a weekly decline of 1.7 percent. Euro zone stocks .STOXXE fell 1.3 percent while blue chips sank 1.4 percent. The weekly loss came after the STOXX 600 had its strongest week in more than two months, indicating a sharp turnaround in sentiment.   While earnings seasons over the past year have typically started strong before turning worse, the current season is off to a decidedly weak start , Deutsche Bank's equity strategist Wolf von Rotberg, said.  FX strength is set to weigh on euro earners’ results, which will likely contribute to subdued beat ratios for the remainder of the season , he said.  However, money kept flowing into European equities, with the largest inflows to the region in 10 weeks, some $3 billion. Investors pointed to inflows as mitigating muted second-quarter earnings growth.   Since the start of 2016, $60 billion left European equities, and $20 billion has flowed back in. So there's still that remaining $40 billion which hasn't yet come back in, which provides the technical support for our positive view,  said Nandini Ramakrishnan, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  She added she saw second-quarter earnings growth for the STOXX 600 in the high single digits and hitting 14 percent for the full year.  France's blue-chip CAC 40 .FCHI fell to its lowest since April 21, just before Emmanuel Macron's first-round victory sent French and European equities surging.  Germany's DAX .GDAXI fell 1.7 percent, its worst daily performance in a month and its lowest since April as well.  Deutsche Bank strategists have an underweight on the French and German markets because of their heavy cyclicals weighting, which they think could hurt them as momentum in PMI indicators fades. They are favorable on the more defensive Swiss and UK indexes.  Infineon (IFXGn.DE) led the DAX down, falling 5 percent after Exane analysts cut the stock to  underperform .   While Infineon has been preparing for GaN/SiC (gallium nitride/silicon carbide) migration, competitors are also joining the race. We see more threats than opportunities for Infineon,  they said.  Auto stocks fell the most, .SXAP, sinking 2.8 percent, in their worst day in six months, after French car parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) posted disappointing results and fell 7 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40 .FCHI. Deal-making triggered some of the rare gains. Payments firm Paysafe (PAYS.L) surged 6.8 percent after a bid from Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners.

The number of female Nigerians, many of them minors, arriving by sea in Italy surged over the past three years, from 1,454 in 2014 to 11,000 last year. Some 4,000 have arrived so far in 2017, the United Nations agency said.  Based on data collected at landing sites, it estimates that 80 percent are  potential victims  of trafficking as sex workers, noting that the girls are often told the trip is free.  These girls, who are increasingly younger ever year, are brought to Italy and to Europe for sexual exploitation,  IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo told a Geneva briefing by telephone from Rome.  They are taken by traffickers and then they are forced to be prostitutes in the streets in Italy. And sometimes, as far as we know these girls are also sent to other European countries such as Spain, Germany, France, Austria,  he said. Many of the Nigerian girls are from poor families in Edo state who are  psychologically manipulated  during a voodoo ritual before leaving, he said. They are accompanied by a madame linked  to the traffickers on the long journey through Niger and Libya.  The increasing number of minors arriving really do not have any idea even what prostitution is, what sex is,  Di Giacomo said.   But many of them understand the real purpose of this journey ... because many times they are forced to prostitute themselves in Niger, in Libya especially, in brothels there,  he said.  So they understand they are not going to work as hairdressers.  IOM officials try to intercept the Nigerian girls at landing points and inform them about the prostitution ring and their right to protection, Di Giacomo said.  The agency, which helps those who decide to flee the networks, reported the cases of 425 girls last year to police.  A few days ago we had the story of this young girl, let's call her Precious, a 17-year-old girl. She has been told she was going to work at a hair salon, she didn't have any idea she was going to be forced to prostitute herself.  It was only when she arrived she found out that it was not real. The job was a lie and she was forced to become a prostitute, which was the only way to pay off the debt of the journey ... She was forced to be out on the streets for 12 hours a day.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which spearheaded ZTO's IPO, are named in the class-action suit filed in Alabama state court by the city of Birmingham's pension fund which says that they failed to do adequate due diligence. ZTO's listing was the largest U.S. listing in 2016 and was the biggest by a Chinese company since the $25 billion IPO of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) in 2014.  Shares of Shanghai-based ZTO closed on Thursday at $15.68, about 20 percent below its IPO price of $19.50.   We believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously,  a ZTO spokeswoman said in an e-mail to Reuters on Friday.  In the lawsuit dated May 16, the Birmingham Retirement and Relief System said ZTO had issued  untrue statements  and omitted  crucial realities  in its registration statement. It also said ZTO inflated profit margins by keeping certain low-margin segments of its business out of its financial statements.  ZTO used a system of 'network partners' to handle lower-margin pickup and delivery services, while maintaining ownership of core hub operations. By keeping the 'network partners' businesses off its own books, the company was able to exaggerate its profit margins to investors,  it said.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Goldman did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.  In ZTO's pre-IPO filings to the stock exchange it said it had achieved operating profit margins of 15.4 percent and 25.1 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  In unaudited results for the quarter ended March published on May 17, ZTO posted a 48 percent jump in net income from a year ago and a 34 percent spike in revenue.  The lawsuit also names the ZTO IPO's smaller underwriters China Renaissance Securities, Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and J.P. Morgan (JPM.N). All the underwriters declined comment. Individual defendants, including ZTO's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, were also named.  The lawsuit against ZTO comes at a time when Alibaba-backed Chinese logistics company, Best Inc, is preparing to raise up to $750 million from an IPO in the United States. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Greg L. Davis, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the city of Birmingham pension fund, for comment outside usual office hours.

The statement said that construction and operation of the $5.0-$5.5 billion pipe would cause some adverse environmental effects but noted those impacts could be minimized or avoided if the company followed its own and FERC staff's recommendations.  The favorable environmental report released today provides a clear path for final approval of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline this fall,  said Leslie Hartz, Dominion's Vice President, Engineering & Construction, in a statement.  The report concludes that the project can be built safely and with minimal long-term impacts to the environment,  Hartz said. Atlantic Coast is a proposed 600-mile (965-kilometer) pipeline designed to deliver up to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas from the Marcellus/Utica shale region in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio to customers in Virginia and North Carolina. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes. The environmental report also included possible impacts from Dominion's proposed $500 million, 375-mile Supply Header project that will feed gas from producers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio into the Atlantic Coast pipe. Dominion said it expects Atlantic Coast and the Supply Header projects to enter service in late 2019. Dominion said on its website the Atlantic Coast project is expected to create 17,000 new jobs, save customers about $377 million in annual energy costs and result in $28 million in new local tax revenues.

{"news_time":"2017-07-21 18:46:00","news_title":"Small-cap rally could shrink on earnings, tax reform hurdles","keywords":"United States,Dan Suzuki,David Aurelio,Donald Trump,Lori Calvasina,Steven DeSanctis,Russell,Russell 2000,US,USA,STOCKS,WEEKAHEAD,Americas,Major News,Graphics,Equities Markets,Market Reports,Reports,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism is souring around small-cap stocks for some investors, with a host of factors conspiring to up-end gains that have taken them to record highs. Small-caps, which led the market's rally just after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, are facing weak earnings forecasts, little progress on tax reform and recent outflows.  We have downside risk here. Earnings numbers aren't great, and valuations are ... pretty rich,  said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies.  Investors had expected the administration of Republican Trump, with his promises of aggressive tax cuts and a healthier U.S. economy, would be a boon for small-caps, which tend to be more domestically focused. Republicans so far have been unable to push through bills to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the first leg of the Trump agenda. That has raised doubts about the likelihood of any tax reform this year. Small-caps have higher effective tax rates - about 32 percent versus 26 percent for large-caps, a note from Nuveen Asset Management showed. The performance of both the Russell 2000 , a widely used gauge for small-caps, and the small-cap S&P; 600 .SPCY has lagged that of large-caps so far this year, but the Russell is up 20.3 percent since the election compared with a gain of 15.3 percent for the S&P; 500 .SPX. Related CoverageTake Five: World market themes for the week aheadAll three indexes hit record highs in recent sessions, just as the earnings reporting period was getting under way. But analysts estimate earnings for S&P; 600 companies declined 8.3 percent in the second quarter, dragged down by projected drops in consumer discretionary, energy and health care results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue is expected to have risen slightly in the quarter. Among consumer companies, weakness in apparel, accessories and luxury goods and other retailers is expected to have hurt results, said David Aurelio, Thomson Reuters senior research analyst. In the small-cap energy sector, services and equipment companies continue to be affected by project cutbacks by larger companies. The small-cap outlook is in contrast to expectations for another quarter of strong profit growth for the S&P; 500 and a sharp year-over-year jump in large-cap energy.  Small-cap earnings growth has been trailing large-caps for the last four years, and that continues to be the case in the first half of this year,  said Dan Suzuki, senior U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. That does not bode well for valuation metrics for small-caps, which the bank calls  the most expensive segment of an expensive market.  The Russell 2000 is trading at about 26 times forward earnings as per Thomson Reuters Datastream data, above a median of about 21. The S&P; 500 trades at about 17.3 times, also above its median. While analysts expect small-cap earnings to rebound in the second half of the year, some strategists said those lofty expectations are not likely to hold since U.S. economic growth remains sluggish. Large-caps have benefited from recent weakness in the U.S. dollar .DXY, which makes foreign currency earnings for U.S. companies worth more in dollars.  This may explain why mid- and large-caps have seen a stronger bounce in earnings revisions than small-caps recently,  Lori Calvasina, Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a research note. Recent fund data also shows a weakening trend. According to Lipper, U.S.-based small-cap funds have recorded five straight weeks of withdrawals. At the same time, technical momentum indicators are trailing the Russell 2000's recent push to new highs, a possible warning that its foray into record territory is on less than firm footing.  We're in a longer period of underperformance,  Suzuki said.

Three Israelis were stabbed to death in a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, hours after three Palestinians were killed in violence prompted by Israel's installation of metal detectors at entry points to the Noble Sanctuary-Temple Mount compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the suspension of all official contact with Israel until it removed the metal detectors. He gave no details, but current contacts are largely limited to security cooperation.  I declare the suspension of all contacts with the Israeli side on all levels until it cancels its measures at al Aqsa mosque and preserves the status quo,  Abbas said in a brief televised speech. The three Israelis stabbed to death and a fourth who was wounded were from the fenced-in West Bank settlement of Neve Tsuf. Israeli media said the three dead were all members of the same family, two men aged 60 and 40 and a woman of 40. The wounded woman, 68, was hospitalised with stab wounds to her back, Israeli media said. A still photo carried by Israeli television showed a kitchen floor completely red with blood. The family had sat down to a traditional Friday evening meal when the attack occurred, according to Israel Radio.  The Israeli army and media said the assailant slipped into the settlement under cover of darkness to carry out his attack. Related CoverageThree Israelis stabbed to death in West Bank settlementIsrael Radio identified him as a 19-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Khobar near Ramallah. It said he was shot, but his condition was not initially known. Palestinian-Israeli Clashes Near Shrine Earlier, Palestinian worshippers clashed with Israeli security forces. Tensions had mounted for days as Palestinians hurled rocks and Israeli police used stun grenades after the detectors were placed outside the sacred venue, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Mohammed Sharaf, 17, and Mohammad Hassan Abu Ghannam, age unknown, died of gunshot wounds in two neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem somewhat away from the epicentre of tension in the walled Old City. It reported a third Palestinian fatality, Mohammed Lafi, 18, later. A Palestinian protester stands next to burning tyres during clashes with Israeli troops near Qalandiya checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah July 21, 2017.Mohamad TorokmanIt was not immediately clear who fired the shots, with unconfirmed media reports that an Israeli settler was responsible in Sharaf's death. Israel decided to install the metal detectors at the entry point to the shrine in Jerusalem's walled Old City on Sunday, after the killing of two Israeli policemen on July 14. The shrine includes the al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam, and the golden Dome of the Rock. It was also the site of an ancient Jewish temple, the holiest place in Judaism. Despite international pressure to remove the metal detectors, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet decided in Friday's early hours to keep them in place, saying they were needed to prevent arms being smuggled into the shrine. Slideshow (16 Images)In protest, thousands of worshippers gathered for Friday prayers at various entrances to the sacred compound, which sits on a marble and stone plateau in the Old City. They refused to enter, preferring to pray outside, in some cases filling the narrow alleyways of the Old City's Muslim quarter.   We reject Israeli restrictions at the Aqsa Mosque,  said Jerusalem's senior Muslim cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammad Hussein. Muslim leaders and Palestinian political factions had urged the faithful to gather for a  day of rage  on Friday against the new security policies, which they see as changing delicate agreements that have governed the holy site for decades. Israeli police mobilised extra units and erected barriers to carry out checks at entrances to the Old City. Access to the shrine for Muslims was limited to men over 50 but open to women of all ages. Roadblocks were in place on approach roads to Jerusalem to stop buses carrying Muslims to the site. At one location near the Old City, stone throwers did try to break through a police line, and police used stun grenades to drive them back. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said four officers were injured in the sporadic clashes and the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said at least 377 protesters had been hurt, some suffering from tear gas inhalation. The hilltop compound has long been a source of religious friction. Since Israel captured and annexed the Old City, including the compound, in the 1967 Middle East war, it has also become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism.  This is our place of prayer, we have sovereignty here,  Salaam said. On Thursday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to press for the removal of the metal detectors. Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East, appealed for calm and the White House called for a resolution. Jordan, the custodian of the holy site, has also been involved in mediation efforts. But Netanyahu's 11-member security cabinet opted in a late-night meeting to retain the metal detectors to ensure no weapons were smuggled in, a week after three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen in the vicinity of the complex.

In a statement, Telecom Italia (TIM) said its remuneration and appointments committee would also meet on July 24 to discuss  a proposal to end the relationship (with Cattaneo) by mutual consent.  Earlier on Friday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters Cattaneo would step down within days. A top Vivendi executive, Amos Genish, is set to be appointed as TIM's managing director, effectively taking over from Cattaneo, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the decision isn't public.  Vivendi declined to comment, while Cattaneo did not reply to an emailed request for comment.  Relations between the 54-year-old Cattaneo, who took over as TIM's boss in March 2016, and the French media group which owns 24 percent of the phone company have soured in recent weeks, several sources have said. According to them, Vivendi, which had previously praised Cattaneo for cutting costs at the indebted Italian firm, grew unhappy after he became embroiled in a row with Italy's government over the rollout of ultrafast broadband.  This upset Vivendi, which is already under scrutiny for its growing influence in Italian business through its stake in TIM and a 30 percent share in private broadcaster Mediaset (MS.MI).  One source said on Friday that Vivendi had explored the possibility of limiting Cattaneo's powers by appointing other managers but added that option was no longer on the table.   Special Award Genish, an Israeli citizen, was appointed Chief Convergence Officer of the French media group led by Vincent Bollore in January. He is a former head of Telefonica's (TEF.MC) Brazil unit and founder of Brazilian telecoms company GVT. Vivendi has since turned to him to integrate all the content it produces and delivers to clients. At Telecom Italia, he would work closely with chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who is also Vivendi's CEO. Two sources said Giuseppe Recchi, currently TIM's deputy chairman, could replace Cattaneo as CEO, though a third said the CEO job would not be filled for now. Cattaneo has been negotiating his severance package and is close to an agreement, three sources said.  They said he would likely get less than the maximum 40 million euros ($47 million) he could claim under a clause in his contract. One source said he would get 32 million euros.        Cattaneo's multi-million wage and benefit package envisaged a performance-based  special award  of up to 40 million euros - or 10 million for each of the four years of his mandate.  The award could be paid in its entirety in case of early departure, according to a company remuneration report. Strained After his predecessor Marco Patuano, Cattaneo is the second CEO to quit since Vivendi tightened its grip on TIM. One source said Cattaneo was viewed by the French group as too  independent ; another said there were divergences over Vivendi's decision to sell TIM's stake in broadcasting services group Persidera to win European Union approval for the French group's plan to gain de facto control of TIM. Cattaneo's exit could raise more concerns in Rome about Vivendi's sway over Italian business. In April, communications authority AGCOM ordered Vivendi to cut its stake in either TIM or Mediaset, ruling it was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power.  On Wednesday, Italy's markets watchdog Consob ordered inspections at TIM's offices to assess how much influence Vivendi has on the group's management, sources said. Telecom Italia's shares have fallen on speculation that Cattaneo may leave, and shed 0.4 percent on Friday following the Reuters report of his imminent departure.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday new U.S. economic sanctions imposed against Iran contravened the nuclear accord reached with world powers in 2015 and he pledged Tehran would  resist  them while respecting the deal itself. The Trump administration slapped new sanctions on Iran on Tuesday over its ballistic missile program and said Tehran's  malign activities  in the Middle East undercut any  positive contributions  coming from the nuclear accord, which was reached during the Obama administration. Iran can use the so-called Joint Commission meetings held every three months in Vienna to trigger a formal dispute resolution mechanism set out for cases where one party feels there is a breach of the deal. Iran's nuclear envoy Abbas Araqchi declined to answer whether he had used the meeting to trigger the mechanism. But he said:  We were not satisfied with America's...broken promises and...announced that we're not convinced that America has properly carried out its duties.  He added:  Iran maintains its right to show any reaction toward these bad promises.  A source with knowledge of the matter said  the Iranians did complain a lot and the Russians supported them, but they won't play along to Washington's game and be turned into killjoys.  This source, and another one with knowledge of Friday's meeting, said Iran did not use the plenary session comprised of envoys from Iran, the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain, Germany and the EU to start a dispute resolution.     This mirrored Tehran's actions in January at a previous so-called Joint Commission meeting, which is held in Vienna every three months, when Iranian officials opted not to escalate a stand-off over the extension of other U.S. sanctions. The U.S. measures signal that the administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to increase pressure on Iran while keeping in place the deal designed to curb its nuclear activities in return for a lifting of international sanctions. The Trump administration is reviewing policy on Iran, not only looking at Tehran's compliance with the nuclear deal, which it has certified, but also its behavior in the region that Washington says undermines U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.

The European Medicines Agency said its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had recommended the product, Lutathera, setting the stage for full approval within a couple of months. Chief Executive Stefano Buono told Reuters the company was also ready to re-file its application for U.S. marketing approval with the Food and Drug Administration this month. The French biotech company has described the new drug as a  multi-hundred million  dollar opportunity, with the potential to transform its fortunes. AAA, which was spun off from Europe's physics research centre CERN 15 years ago and is listed on Nasdaq, had sales from existing diagnostic products of $34.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Shares in the company reached an all-time high following news of the EU recommendation. Analysts at Jefferies said the positive decision had been expected but was reassuring ahead of a U.S. verdict on the medicine. Lutathera is unusual in harnessing the same molecule that is already used to diagnose cancer to also deliver treatment. The radiopharmaceutical works by hitting cancer cells with high energy electrons, just like radiotherapy, but the injection targets gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) that over-express a certain protein. It has shown impressive results in clinical tests against a disease associated with very poor survival, and one that killed Apple co-founder Jobs in 2011. The path to market, however, has not been easy for the drugmaker, due to technical problems with the drug's filing at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a slower than initially hoped approval timetable in Europe. In a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, Lutathera reduced the risk of disease progression compared to standard care by 80 percent. That compares favourably with existing NETs drugs such as Novartis' Afinitor and Pfizer's Sutent.

The port, which owns and operates the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, will use the money to fund capital improvements to the airport, and to refund a 2009 bond issuance, according to bond documents. The port is undertaking a handful of capital projects over the next five years, including building a new arrival facility for international passengers, revamping the baggage claim system, and addressing seismic concerns in one of its terminals. Next week's biggest competitive bond deal comes from Alexandria, Virginia, which plans to sell some $95 million of GO capital improvement bonds. The South Carolina Association of Governmental Organizations will provide the biggest sale of notes, offering $52 million in certificates of participation. Municipal bond yields have fallen lately, generally down more than 10 basis points over the last week or two, a trend Barclays municipal credit analyst Mikhail Foux attributed to the similar fall in U.S. Treasury yields.  Foux added he expects municipal debt trading to continue to be slow next week, though he is keeping an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve, which  could have some effect on rates.   The market expects the Fed to stay put, but maybe we'll get some clarity on their thinking,  Foux said.

Magufuli, nicknamed  the Bulldozer  for his forceful leadership style, is increasing pressure on the mining companies, which include Acacia Mining, the biggest gold miner in the country.  I have launched an economic war,  Magufuli told a cheering crowd at a public rally in the northwestern town of Kigoma.  We have asked them to come for talks ... they have agreed to come. But if they delay those talks, I will close down all the mines,  Magufuli told the crowd. Magufuli has sent shock-waves through the mining community in Africa's fourth-largest gold producer since his election late in 2015 with actions he says are aimed at ensuring that mining companies pay a fair share of taxes. Tanzania has passed new laws to increase mining taxes, to force companies to re-negotiate their contracts and to allow the state to own up to 50 percent of shares in mining companies. In March, it introduced a ban on exports of copper concentrate or mineral sand for processing abroad, which hit Acacia. Since the ban, London-listed Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold, has nearly halved in value. The company suspended its dividend for the first time in February. Acacia Mining said on Friday it aimed to reinstate its dividend in early 2018 if Tanzania ended the concentrate export ban. Acacia's shares were down more than 17 percent on Friday. Acacia has been having trouble renewing work permits for its international staff in Tanzania, Chief Executive Brad Gordon told Reuters.   We were having difficulty getting work permits renewed. But no foreign nationals have been asked to leave the country,  Gordon said. The government has also accused Acacia of evading taxes worth billions of dollars by under-declaring export volume and value of its minerals. Acacia denies the allegations. The company said on July 4 it was seeking international arbitration to resolve the dispute.  Acacia is fully cooperating with these investigations and has provided extensive documentation and information to the investigating authorities,  Gordon said. AngloGold Ashanti, which owns Tanzania's biggest open-pit mine, Geita, also said last week that it was filing for international arbitration after the overhaul of the mining laws. Barrick Gold Corp., which owns a 63.9 percent stake in Acacia, agreed last month to hold talks with the government to resolve the tax evasion claims against Acacia. The talks are yet to begin but officials said they could start  soon.  The president said he had taken on multinational companies for the sake of the country, where mining contributes around 4 percent of the gross domestic product.

The dollar hit a year low against a currency basket after the European Central Bank's chief abstained from talking down the euro, while obstacles to U.S. President Donald Trump's policy agenda also weighed. A weaker dollar makes dollar-priced copper cheaper for non-U.S. investors. Also helping copper, China's economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter, data this week showed, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target.  Overall demand in China is not that bad at all,  said Richard Fu, head of Asia and Pacific at LME Floor Member AMT.  In general global economic figures are improving, there’s supply disruptions here and there, plus the Chinese want to cut metal production in order to tackle pollution and over-capacity,  he added. Fundamentals * LME COPPER: Three-month LME copper closed up 0.8 percent at $6,004 a tonne, having hit its highest since March 1 at $6,051. * INVENTORIES: Copper inventories in Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored warehouses fell 4.9 percent from last Friday to their lowest since January. * STRIKE: An estimated 5,000 workers at the giant Grasberg copper mine operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit will extend their strike for a fourth month in a dispute over layoffs and employment terms. * COPPER DEFICIT: The world refined copper market showed a 53,000 tonne deficit in April, compared with an 18,000 tonne deficit in March, industry data showed. * CHINA FORECASTS: The Asian Development Bank raised its 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts for China and other countries in the region. * ALUMINIUM OUTPUT: Daily average primary aluminium output excluding China rose to 70,300 tonnes in June, from 70,000 tonnes in May, industry data showed.  Although sweeping production cuts were announced in recent months, especially in China, they have not been implemented so far or have been offset by new capacities. We see no justification for the high aluminium price,  said Commerzbank in a note. * ALUMINIUM PRICES: Aluminium closed down 0.1 percent at $1,915. * NICKEL EXPORTS: Indonesia exported 403,201 tonnes of nickel ore in the first six months of 2017, when a complete ban on exports was lifted. * NICKEL MINING BAN: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the government will draft a new law for the country's mining industry. Worries over supply from the Philippines have faded since the country's firebrand environment secretary was replaced in May. * NICKEL PRICE: LME nickel ended up 0.3 percent at $9,520 a tonne. * SPREADS: Discounts of cash copper, aluminium and lead to their three-month contracts were near multi-year highs, signalling ample nearby supply. MCU0-3, MAL0-3, MPB0-3 * U.S. ECONOMY: Jobless claims fell more than expected to the lowest level in nearly five months, suggesting strong job gains that should continue to underpin economic growth. * OTHER METALS: Zinc closed up 1 percent at $2,753, lead closed up 1.2 percent at $2,239 while tin ended up 0.8 percent at $20,225.

The European Medicines Agency said its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had recommended the product, Lutathera, setting the stage for full approval within a couple of months. Chief Executive Stefano Buono told Reuters the company was also ready to re-file its application for U.S. marketing approval with the Food and Drug Administration this month. The French biotech company has described the new drug as a  multi-hundred million  dollar opportunity, with the potential to transform its fortunes. AAA, which was spun off from Europe's physics research centre CERN 15 years ago and is listed on Nasdaq, had sales from existing diagnostic products of $34.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Shares in the company reached an all-time high following news of the EU recommendation. Analysts at Jefferies said the positive decision had been expected but was reassuring ahead of a U.S. verdict on the medicine. Lutathera is unusual in harnessing the same molecule that is already used to diagnose cancer to also deliver treatment. The radiopharmaceutical works by hitting cancer cells with high energy electrons, just like radiotherapy, but the injection targets gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) that over-express a certain protein. It has shown impressive results in clinical tests against a disease associated with very poor survival, and one that killed Apple co-founder Jobs in 2011. The path to market, however, has not been easy for the drugmaker, due to technical problems with the drug's filing at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a slower than initially hoped approval timetable in Europe. In a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, Lutathera reduced the risk of disease progression compared to standard care by 80 percent. That compares favourably with existing NETs drugs such as Novartis' Afinitor and Pfizer's Sutent.

More than half the revenue of top European firms is generated outside the euro zone, according to Thomson Reuters data, meaning a strengthening euro has an adverse impact on those revenues once they are brought home. As European earnings season kicks off in earnest over the coming week, the extent to which the euro's rise is hurting companies earning revenue outside the euro zone will be a key area of focus for investors. Every 10 percent rise in the euro trade-weighted index takes 5 percent off the STOXX 600 earnings per share (EPS), Deutsche Bank strategists found. For Nandini Ramakrishnan, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management Europe remains the most favored equity market globally given a good economic backdrop and recovery in earnings growth, but the strengthening currency is a concern.  The main challenge for European equities is the strength of the euro,  said Ramakrishnan. Earnings growth in Europe is expected to come in at around 14 percent this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, a striking turnaround after five years of sluggish to zero profit improvements.  The upbeat outlook for European earnings has seen global investors pump money back into regional stocks pushing up valuations to above long-term averages. Some $19 billion has poured into European equities over the past three months, EPFR data shows.  We do expect the currency to strengthen given the ECB tapering, but that should not derail earnings growth,  Ramakrishnan added.   The euro has run up this year as a brightening macroeconomic backdrop dovetails with easing political concerns after the French election and an ECB getting ready to ease stimulus as inflation picks up. For strategists at Deutsche Bank the relatively weak start to European earnings season is partly down to the euro's strength.  With the euro trade-weighted index up 5 percent between the middle of April and the end of June, FX strength is set to weigh on euro earners' results, which will likely contribute to subdued beat ratios for the remainder of the season,  the strategists said in a note. Roughly 18 percent of the MSCI Europe index constituents have reported results so far.  Morgan Stanley strategists also voiced their concerns, pointing out that the earnings revisions ratio - a metric which tracks the number of upgrades to downgrades and measures analyst sentiment - has hit an 11-month low with financials the only sector not seeing downgrades. Companies that are more export-focused are the most exposed to a strengthening euro which makes their products more expensive abroad.

Autos were the worst-performing sector on Friday, down 2.4 percent.

Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.

The statement did not say when the raid took place or whether the militants killed were responsible for Thursday's police shooting.

The operation targeted insurgents from the Nusra Front group in the mountainous outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal and areas near the Syrian town of Fleita, the commander said. Media run by Hezbollah reported significant gains by its side in the early stage of the operation. It later said Hezbollah fighters had captured the Sahl al-Rahwa area, taking over a Nusra operations center, after driving militants out. At least 23 of the militants had been killed in the first day of fighting, a security source said, as well as five Hezbollah combatants. The Lebanese army, which assumed a defensive position around the town of Arsal, raised its alert level and was carrying out strict security measures including patrols and guarding the entrances to the town. The army later stopped an attempt by militants to breach its defenses, military sources said. A Lebanese security source said refugees living in the area were fleeing toward Arsal and the Lebanese army was facilitating their passage with U.N. supervision. U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) spokeswoman Lisa Abou Khaled said only a small number of people had fled to Arsal so far.  UNHCR has only received confirmation ... that two Syrian families have arrived in the town of Arsal from the outskirts.  Several thousand Syrian refugees occupy camps east of the town in an area known as Juroud Arsal, a barren mountainous zone between Syria and Lebanon that has served as a base for Islamic State militants and other jihadists and rebels fighting in Syria's six-year-old civil war.    Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said Nusra militants were under attack in Juroud Arsal and in areas near the Syrian town of Fleita. A military news outlet run by Hezbollah reported Syrian army air strikes on Nusra positions near Fleita. Al-Manar broadcast footage showing an artillery gun being fired from the back of a truck flying the Hezbollah flag. Plumes of smoke were shown rising from the hills.     A still image taken on July 21, 2017 from an undated footage by Hezbollah Military handout shows the area at the Syrian-Lebanese border, taken by a drone at an unidentified location at the Syrian-Lebanese frontier. Hezbollah Military/Handout via Reuters TVHezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim group backed by Iran, has played a critical part in previous campaigns against Sunni Muslim insurgents along the border, part of the much wider role it has played supporting President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war. The Lebanese army is not taking part in the operation, according to the commander in the pro-Damascus military alliance and the Lebanese security source. The Lebanese source said the army had assumed a defensive position, was monitoring militant movements, and would fire if it came under attack.  The Lebanese National News Agency later reported that the army had fired on a group of militants trying to flee the fighting toward Arsal. Slideshow (4 Images)Army Reinforcements The Lebanese army, a recipient of U.S. and British military support, deployed reinforcements on the outskirts of Arsal in anticipation of the operation this week to prevent militants  crossing into Lebanon. Hezbollah's role in the Syrian war has been a major point of contention in Lebanon, drawing criticism from opponents including Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. Hariri's Future Movement said on Thursday the anticipated Arsal battle was part of  the services  offered by Hezbollah to  the Syrian regime . Hariri said on Tuesday the Lebanese army would carry out a carefully planned operation in the Juroud Arsal area, but there was no coordination between it and the Syrian army. The Nusra Front was al Qaeda's official affiliate in the Syrian war until last year when it formally severed ties to al Qaeda and renamed itself. The group now spearheads the Tahrir al-Sham Islamist alliance. In 2014, Arsal was the scene of one of the most serious spillovers of the Syrian war into Lebanon when jihadists briefly overran the town. Negotiations failed to secure the militants' withdrawal from the Juroud Arsal area to other rebel-held parts of Syria.   Earlier this month, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said time was running out for Syrian militants along the border near Arsal to reach deals with Syrian authorities. He said it was  high time to end the threat of militant groups in Arsal .

Peru's liquefaction plant suspended loadings for several weeks without explanation, exerting strain on Shell, which is the sole exporter of Peruvian LNG and was forced to pick up replacement supply on spot markets.   Shell doesn't want to be exposed so they've been covering their positions, but I'm not sure that deal activity is reflecting end-user demand, which is a more sustainable price indicator,  a trading source said.  The company bought a Nigerian free-on-board cargo loading July 29-30 at an estimated price of $4.80-$4.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), considered high after adding shipping costs, another trader said.  An expected increase in supply is likely to limit recent gains, however, and pull back prices, some traders said. Australia's new 8.9 million tonnes-a-year Wheatstone LNG plant is due to start operations in August and the fourth production line at Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana is also nearing start-up. Spot prices for Asian LNG for September were at $5.65/mmBtu. Last week the August spot contract traded at $5.50/mmBtu. Malaysia's Bintulu production plant awarded to an undisclosed buyer a closed tender for a cargo loading in late August at $5.75/mmBtu.  Dealers in Asia expressed surprise at the recent strength in spot prices, with one trading source describing this week's market as  complex .  Prices have suddenly increased on talk that there are bids at levels in the high $5s,  said a second trading source based in Singapore, adding that it was not clear where the demand or bids were coming from.  A sell tender from Indonesia's Donggi-Senoro plant for an early-September cargo to the Far East was awarded for about$5.60/mmBtu, traders said, though details were not immediately clear. A number of Japanese buyers helped to buoy demand. But the status of Kansai Electric's tender to buy a cargo for delivery between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5, which closed on Tuesday, is unclear. The tender might have drawn unattractively high offers, prompting Kansai to rethink, a trader said.  Peer Tohoku Electric has quietly tendered for a spot cargo delivering Sept. 18-30. Taiwan's state-run CPC is interested in a couple of cargoes for delivery in mid-September and mid-October. Mexico's CFE is likewise signaling its interest with suppliers.   On the supply side, Angola's LNG project launched two tenders to sell two cargoes, loading July 22-24 and Aug. 31 to Sept. 2. Algeria was also offering free-on-board cargoes to trade houses including PetroChina and B.B. Energy among others, a trader said.

A report by lawmakers in Nigeria's upper house said this followed an investigation by the Senate's foreign affairs committee into alleged extortion in haj operations. Africa's biggest economy has at least six exchange rates -- an official rate and a black market one, a retail rate set by licensed exchange bureaus, and a rate for foreign travel and school fees, in addition to the one for Muslim pilgrims.  The committee strongly recommends the concession of 200 naira to a dollar for haj to bring down the cost to a bearable level,  the report seen by Reuters on Friday says. Severe dollar shortages have been a hallmark of Nigeria's recession, now in its second year. The downturn was brought on by lower prices for oil, the government's main source of income, which is mostly paid for in hard currency. Senate President Bukola Saraki said Nigeria's medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) was based on an exchange rate of 305, but added  businessmen are getting 200 naira, then definitely pilgrims deserve 200 naira as well . The central bank offered pilgrims dollars at 197 naira, before it partially devalued the currency for retail customers in February after it hit 520 to the dollar on the black market. The naira has been stuck at around 305 levels on the official currency market since last August, but it trades at a market determined rate of 365.33 at a newly introduced window for investors. On the black market it traded at 366 against the dollar on Friday. Spokesman Isaac Okorafor said he was unable to provide comments on the Senate's recommendation. Nigeria runs a convoluted exchange rate system which has masked the pressure on the naira. The bank has said it has used a multiple exchange rate to eliminate  frivolous demand  for hard currency. Investors have cheered the new window launched in April with some more adventurous stock and bond funds that fled the frontier market two years ago cautiously returning. The new window has also led banks to more than double foreign currency limits on debit cards for clients travelling abroad, something they restricted completely at the peak of the currency crisis.

Peru's liquefaction plant suspended loadings for several weeks without explanation, exerting strain on Shell, which is the sole exporter of Peruvian LNG and was forced to pick up replacement supply on spot markets.   Shell doesn't want to be exposed so they've been covering their positions, but I'm not sure that deal activity is reflecting end-user demand, which is a more sustainable price indicator,  a trading source said.  The company bought a Nigerian free-on-board cargo loading July 29-30 at an estimated price of $4.80-$4.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), considered high after adding shipping costs, another trader said.  An expected increase in supply is likely to limit recent gains, however, and pull back prices, some traders said. Australia's new 8.9 million tonnes-a-year Wheatstone LNG plant is due to start operations in August and the fourth production line at Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana is also nearing start-up. Spot prices for Asian LNG for September were at $5.65/mmBtu. Last week the August spot contract traded at $5.50/mmBtu. Malaysia's Bintulu production plant awarded to an undisclosed buyer a closed tender for a cargo loading in late August at $5.75/mmBtu.  Dealers in Asia expressed surprise at the recent strength in spot prices, with one trading source describing this week's market as  complex .  Prices have suddenly increased on talk that there are bids at levels in the high $5s,  said a second trading source based in Singapore, adding that it was not clear where the demand or bids were coming from.  A sell tender from Indonesia's Donggi-Senoro plant for an early-September cargo to the Far East was awarded for about$5.60/mmBtu, traders said, though details were not immediately clear. A number of Japanese buyers helped to buoy demand. But the status of Kansai Electric's tender to buy a cargo for delivery between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5, which closed on Tuesday, is unclear. The tender might have drawn unattractively high offers, prompting Kansai to rethink, a trader said.  Peer Tohoku Electric has quietly tendered for a spot cargo delivering Sept. 18-30. Taiwan's state-run CPC is interested in a couple of cargoes for delivery in mid-September and mid-October. Mexico's CFE is likewise signaling its interest with suppliers.   On the supply side, Angola's LNG project launched two tenders to sell two cargoes, loading July 22-24 and Aug. 31 to Sept. 2. Algeria was also offering free-on-board cargoes to trade houses including PetroChina and B.B. Energy among others, a trader said.

Gains in the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries pointed to moves into safe-haven assets compared with stocks that are considered riskier. Oil prices sank more than 1 percent. The euro built on sharp gains from a day earlier, rising to near two-year highs against the dollar and undermining European stocks, with Germany's DAX equity index down 1.7 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down.  The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro...certainly gave the greenlight for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.32 percent, falling after 10 days of gains. U.S. stock indexes opened lower, pulling back from record high levels reached earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.58 points, or 0.31 percent, to 21,544.2, the S&P; 500 lost 5.36 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,468.09 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.87 points, or 0.23 percent, to 6,375.13. General Electric shares dropped 3.2 percent after the industrial conglomerate's profit report. “The market is pausing after another stellar run to record high levels, as people take modest profits off the table and cut back on risk just a little bit going into the weekend,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Next week, investors will be focusing on a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, the release of second-quarter economic growth data, as well as a flood of corporate results. Headwinds In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.08 percent.  The strength of the euro does appear to be acting as a bit of a headwind for European stocks,  said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. In currencies, the dollar index fell 0.25 percent, falling to its lowest point since June 2016. The euro was up 0.18 percent to $1.165. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.63 percent versus the greenback at 111.22 per dollar. Aside from the ECB comments, investors were also assessing whether Trump's recent legislative setbacks and developments involving a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. general election were threatening his domestic plans for tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  Compounding the (weaker dollar) move is this latest news on the political front in the U.S. about the Russia investigation expanding to Trump’s business affairs,” said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. “This is on top of the fact that Senate has not been able to pass anything meaningful on the healthcare front.  U.S. Treasury yields fell in step with European yields as the euro strengthened against the dollar, raising doubts whether the ECB would scale back its bond purchases later in 2017. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.2393 percent, from 2.266 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices fell after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output, reigniting concerns the market will stay awash with crude. U.S. crude fell 1.45 percent to $46.24 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.67, down 1.28 percent on the day. Spot gold added 0.5 percent to $1,250.53 an ounce, as the weaker dollar made bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies.

Permira, Advent and Bain have all recently announced acquisitions of payment processors in the hope of capitalising on the cashless zeitgeist. Blackstone and CVC, which just offered $3.7 billion for UK-listed Paysafe, are placing a double wager. Paysafe’s quirk is that roughly half its revenue comes from online gambling and gaming. Investors have struggled with the associated risks – notably from its Asian business, which brings in around a fifth of EBITDA. A short-seller’s report alleging unsavoury dealings in China wiped 38 percent off the company’s share price last December. Though the stock recovered, Paysafe still suffers from a stubborn valuation discount to peers like Worldpay and Nets – both acquisition targets themselves. The buyout firms thus spy an opportunity. They will end up paying close to $4.7 billion for Paysafe, factoring in fees, net debt and the extra borrowings from a $470 million acquisition it announced on Friday. Assume the new owners can quickly sell the Asian business for a fairly modest 5 times EBITDA, their outlay would fall to around $4.4 billion. That’s about 12 times the roughly $370 million of EBITDA Paysafe is on course to make in 2018. From there, the odds are in the private equity groups’ favour. Assume they fund around 40 percent of the acquisition with debt, that Paysafe’s EBITDA grows at around 10 percent annually for the next five years, and that the owners use about one-third of that to pay down borrowings. At the same multiple of 12 times EBITDA, Paysafe could have an enterprise value of $7 billion, with $850 million of net debt. That implies equity worth close to $6.2 billion at the end of five years – 2.5 times the buyout firms’ original investment, and equivalent to an annualised return of 20 percent. Put more simply, Blackstone and CVC stand to make a decent return not just from riding the digital payments bandwagon, but for taking on risk that public-market investors are less comfortable shouldering. It’s hardly radical. But ultimately, that kind of willingness to wade into the dicier corners of finance is what private equity is for.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

No other changes were immediately expected in a communications operation that includes press secretary Sean Spicer and his deputy, Sarah Sanders, the official said. The appointment comes as the White House deals with questions around a special counsel probe and several congressional investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion with Trump's campaign. The communications position has been vacant since Michael Dubke resigned in May as communications director. Spicer has been serving a dual role as press secretary and communications director since Dubke left. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Scaramucci was interviewed by Trump on Friday morning and the job had been offered and accepted.

The ECB left its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged on Thursday and did not discuss clawing back stimulus, though ECB chief Mario Draghi signalled that discussions would come in the autumn.  Policymakers now see October as the most likely date to decide on the future of the ECB's asset buys and consider December, an option flagged by staff, as too late, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussion told Reuters. Investors are turning their attention to the strength of the euro and the effect it may have on the pace of monetary policy tightening, analysts said.  The single currency rose on Friday to $1.1677, its strongest against the dollar since August 2015. A stronger euro would hit euro zone exporters and hurt growth. Further currency strength could also dampen inflation by keeping down import costs.  The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent.   If euro strength remains where it is for a long period of time, it has the potential to derail the ECB's plans because of the effect on inflation,  said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.   On a trade-weighted basis, we are now back to where we were before quantitative easing began. This is a problem for Draghi.   Euro zone bond yields, which have been pushed up in the past three weeks on heightened expectations for ECB tapering in the months ahead, extended Thursday's falls. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, fell 3.5 basis points to a one-week low of 0.50 percent .  Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds - seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's largesse - saw their yields fall 4-10 basis points.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing costs is at its narrowest level since March 2015 at 94 bps. Spanish and Italian bond yields were set for their biggest weekly falls in over a year, down about 20 bps each.

North American shale producers have ramped up drilling in recent quarters as oil prices bounced back from their lows in 2016, when they hit about $27 per barrel. Crude in the second quarter averaged $48.15 per barrel, and companies added 506 onshore rigs in the past year, according to a closely watched Baker Hughes report. Schlumberger and rivals such as Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes GE Co (BHGE.N), which help explorers locate oil and prepare drill-wells, are bringing back equipment they stacked during the downturn. Houston-based Schlumberger said on Friday that North American revenue jumped 18 percent and international revenue rose 4 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding. Chief Executive Paul Kibsgaard said on an earnings call he was  somewhat positively surprised  in terms of activity in international markets.  The market has viewed international with the expectation that it will be weak until oil gets up to the $50-$60,  said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst with Edward Jones.   The comment that there are signs of life below $50 (oil)could be positive.     To tap the improving demand in international markets, Schlumberger said it would buy a majority stake in Russia's biggest oilfield services firm, Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC).  The purchase of the Eurasia group is sort of a bet that international markets are going to keep advancing,  said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York.  U.S. onshore revenue soared 42 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding, as fracking revenue was boosted by companies completing more wells and better pricing.  We expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year, with a frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4,  said Patrick Schorn, executive vice president of new ventures at Schlumberger. Total revenue rose 4.2 percent to $7.46 billion in the second quarter, beating the average analysts' estimate of $7.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 35 cents per share, handily beating expectation of 30 cents. The company's shares rose as much as 3 percent to $68.96,  before paring some gains. Gains were limited by a fall in oil prices that dragged down the broader energy index.

By 1430 GMT the pound was trading down 0.1 percent on the day at 89.76 pence EURGBP=D3, having earlier touched 89.91 pence. That was its weakest since early November, as it built on losses the previous day when ECB chief Mario Draghi said possible changes to the central bank's expansive stimulus programme would be discussed in the autumn. Though he kept the door open to further easing, investors interpreted Draghi's comments as less dovish than previous ECB meetings and the euro shot up broadly, hitting its highest levels in almost two years against the dollar EUR=. The pound was on track to lose 2.5 percent against the euro this week. Against the dollar, sterling was trading up around 0.1 percent at $1.2990 GBP=D3. Earlier in the week it traded above $1.31 but it slipped on weaker-than-expected inflation data, which poured cold water on expectations that the Bank of England could hike interest rates in the coming months.      The pound is by some distance the worst performing G10 FX over the last five trading days and has dropped 0.85 percent versus the US dollar – the only G10 currency to fall versus the dollar over that period,  said MUFG's European head of global markets research, Derek Halpenny. But Halpenny said he was upbeat on the currency from here on, viewing political risk as easing off. He cited as important reports that the British cabinet is united over the need for a transitional period when Britain leaves the European Union.  Prime Minister Theresa May moved to ease concerns over Brexit among British business on Thursday, saying she wanted a  smooth, orderly exit  from the EU including  a period of implementation in order to avoid any cliff-edges .     We view the emerging signs of a cabinet deal on Brexit direction as very significant and are somewhat surprised by the muted attention this important development is currently receiving,  Halpenny said.  MUFG has one of the most bullish sterling forecasts in the market, seeing the currency reaching $1.40 by the second quarter of next year.   Others take a more pessimistic view.      Sterling's weakness should not be underestimated in the current dollar-selling backdrop,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.   The stagflation warning signs are flashing for the UK economy after this week's data, while any 'soft' Brexit euphoria is slowly beginning to fade as the reality of difficult negotiations begins to sink in.

The tanker had been heading to eastern Canada to discharge the cargo at the end of June when the Federal Court of Canada issued a seizure order for the cargo at the request of Iraq's oil ministry. Iraq alleges the cargo was unlawfully misappropriated by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and sold to Vitol. Along with the seizure request made to Canada, the ministry filed a separate claim against Vitol and two subsidiaries for $32.5 million. The tanker appears empty, according to the draft on the ship tracking system. Vitol, the world's largest independent oil trader, declined to comment. Baghdad and the KRG have been locked in long-running battle over the right to export and market crude from the semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The KRG began small-scale exports via truck to Turkish ports in 2012 before building a pipeline to Turkey, allowing it to ramp up exports to fill tankers with up to 1 million barrels of oil in mid-2014. Following the rise of Islamic State and attacks on Iraq's own pipeline to Turkey, tensions over oil exports eased and Baghdad now uses the KRG's pipeline to Turkey. While Kurdish oil regularly flows to Europe, traders have steered clear of North America since Iraq blocked a 1 million barrel tanker from discharging in the United States in 2014. Smaller parcels were delivered to the United States prior to that.

It is a training exercise but the scenario is all too real for many of the doctors, who treated victims of a chemical attack three months ago and suffered symptoms themselves after being contaminated by a deadly nerve agent. Around 100 people were killed in the sarin gas attack on the opposition-held northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun on April 4, the international chemical weapons watchdog OPCW said. Two hundred people needed treatment, including medical staff. The United States and Western allies blamed the Syrian government for the attack - an accusation President Bashar al-Assad dismissed as  fabrication  - and launched cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air force base in response. The doctors hope the week-long course in southern Turkey organized by the World Health Organization, will leave them better prepared and better protected for any future attack. It is the most intensive training on chemical warfare provided to Syrian medical staff, who have also treated patients for chlorine gas attacks during Syria's brutal six-year war. Osama Darwish, a doctor at Maarat al-Numan hospital around 20 km (nearly 15 miles) north of Khan Sheikhoun, said his colleagues were overwhelmed when around 100 victims of the April sarin attack started to be brought in.  That was the first (nerve agent) case that we had dealt with. We had treated for chlorine, but the symptoms of chlorine are different. They were very severe,  he said. Syrian medical staff take part in a training exercise to learn how to treat victims of chemical weapons attacks, in a course organized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Gaziantep, Turkey, July 20, 2017.Murad Sezer The hospital wasn't prepared. We didn't have the equipment or the kit for medical teams to protect themselves,  Darwish said during a break in training, resting in the shade of a Turkish fire service truck brought in for the exercise. Like several of his colleagues responding to the April attack, Darwish himself soon started feeling symptoms, most likely through traces of nerve agent on the bodies and clothes of victims brought in for treatment.  Some (cases) were light but some were heavy and even went to intensive care. Thank God, my symptoms were light - choking and itching,  he said. Slideshow (7 Images)For other medics the consequences could have been more severe. The OPCW report released three weeks ago said an ambulance went missing for two hours - the driver passed out shortly after picking up patients at Khan Sheikhoun. The course, near southern Turkey's Gaziantep city, taught medics how to prioritize treatment for the most severely affected victims and protect themselves - using chemical suits and stripping and hosing down all unprotected victims.  Sarin and other nerve agents are banned under international law. The Syrian government said it gave up its stockpile of chemical weapons for destruction after a 2013 sarin attack near Damascus which killed hundreds of people.  Since then, a joint United Nations and OPCW investigation has declared Syrian government forces responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015. It has also said Islamic State militants used mustard gas. One of the trainers, a veteran of two decades of regional conflict, said the scale of violence in Syria's war sometimes overwhelmed even the most experienced medics.    I can remember many situations we as doctors, as surgeons inside Syria when we see the severity of injuries, sometimes we cried,  WHO technical officer Mohammed Elgazzar said.

We are talking to (GM) right now about the products that they currently have  at underused car plants such as Hamtramck in Michigan and Lordstown in Ohio, and whether they might be replaced with newer, more popular vehicles such as crossovers, Dennis Williams told reporters.   We are tracking it (and) we are addressing it,  Williams added. GM has cut shifts at several U.S. plants this year as inventories of unsold cars have ballooned. Industry analysts said more jobs could be at risk as the automaker wrestles with permanently shrinking production of small and midsized sedans. GM is reviewing whether to cancel at least six passenger cars in the U.S. market after 2020, including the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, which could be replaced in 2022 with a new gasoline-electric crossover model, Reuters has learned from people familiar with the plans. Other GM cars at risk include the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Sonic, sources said. Some analysts have singled out GM’s Hamtramck plant in Detroit as one of the most vulnerable because of plummeting car sales.  The plant, which opened in 1985, builds four slow-selling models: Buick LaCrosse, Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac CT6 and Chevrolet Volt.  In the first half, it built fewer than 35,000 cars, down 32 percent from the same period in 2016, according to suppliers familiar with GM’s U.S. production schedule. The typical GM assembly plant builds 200,000-300,000 vehicles a year.    GM must  create some innovative new products  to replace slow-selling sedans  or start closing plants,  said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions. The auto maker already has begun to shift future production plans from cars to trucks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch auto analyst John Murphy. He estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the new vehicle models that GM will introduce over the next four years will be passenger cars, with the rest divided among trucks, SUVs and crossovers. GM plans to add production of the new Cadillac XT4 crossover next year to its Malibu sedan plant in Fairfax, Kansas. The company is cutting production in the short term rather than dumping cars into rental car fleets at little or no profit, company executives have said.  However, the long-term shift in demand toward SUVs calls into question the future of factories GM currently has dedicated to building sedans, analysts said.  GM said it does not comment on future products. Alan Batey, president of GM’s North American operations, told Reuters in an interview: “I don’t think we have too many” sedans.  Gm Says 'in a Good Place' Batey said GM intends to reduce overall inventories to around 75 days by year-end from 105 currently. “We’re in a good place to have a good 2017,” he said. The shift toward SUVs, fueled by cheap gasoline, is putting pressure on nearly all major automakers in the United States to simultaneously shift short-term production plans and rework long-term product programs that drive capital spending over several years. Sales of GM passenger cars plunged 17 percent in the first half and 36 percent in June, exceeding the industry-wide declines of 12 percent in the first half and 14 percent in June, according to Automotive News.  GM dealers ended June with as much as six months supply of certain models. Two months is considered normal. “There could be some consolidation” of passenger car production in fewer U.S. plants, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of LMC Automotive. “GM doesn’t need all the sedans it has today.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016. But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact. Investors are again focusing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60. The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs. The painstaking effort has paid off. Net income for Exxon, Chevron (CVX.N), Shell, BP (BP.L), Total, Eni (ENI.MI) and Statoil (STL.OL) is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters. By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programs, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash.  More of the Same  But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54.  While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates.  Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment,  said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander.    The sector needs to continue doing more of the same,  he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs.  Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns. Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1. Majors were targeting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said. About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added.  Off Life Support  Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery. Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil. Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focused more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale.  Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18  strong buy  or  buy  recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16. Exxon holds the lowest number of  buy  recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said. Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3. Oil majors have underperformed so far this year relative to the broader stock market . For some, that makes current valuations attractive. (See graphic: reut.rs/2twyZvW)  The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything,  said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron.  They are off life support at $55 a barrel.

We are talking to (GM) right now about the products that they currently have  at underused car plants such as Hamtramck in Michigan and Lordstown in Ohio, and whether they might be replaced with newer, more popular vehicles such as crossovers, Dennis Williams told reporters.   We are tracking it (and) we are addressing it,  Williams added. GM has cut shifts at several U.S. plants this year as inventories of unsold cars have ballooned. Industry analysts said more jobs could be at risk as the automaker wrestles with permanently shrinking production of small and midsized sedans. GM is reviewing whether to cancel at least six passenger cars in the U.S. market after 2020, including the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, which could be replaced in 2022 with a new gasoline-electric crossover model, Reuters has learned from people familiar with the plans. Other GM cars at risk include the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Sonic, sources said. Some analysts have singled out GM’s Hamtramck plant in Detroit as one of the most vulnerable because of plummeting car sales.  The plant, which opened in 1985, builds four slow-selling models: Buick LaCrosse, Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac CT6 and Chevrolet Volt.  In the first half, it built fewer than 35,000 cars, down 32 percent from the same period in 2016, according to suppliers familiar with GM’s U.S. production schedule. The typical GM assembly plant builds 200,000-300,000 vehicles a year.    GM must  create some innovative new products  to replace slow-selling sedans  or start closing plants,  said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions. The auto maker already has begun to shift future production plans from cars to trucks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch auto analyst John Murphy. He estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the new vehicle models that GM will introduce over the next four years will be passenger cars, with the rest divided among trucks, SUVs and crossovers. GM plans to add production of the new Cadillac XT4 crossover next year to its Malibu sedan plant in Fairfax, Kansas. The company is cutting production in the short term rather than dumping cars into rental car fleets at little or no profit, company executives have said.  However, the long-term shift in demand toward SUVs calls into question the future of factories GM currently has dedicated to building sedans, analysts said.  GM said it does not comment on future products. Alan Batey, president of GM’s North American operations, told Reuters in an interview: “I don’t think we have too many” sedans.  Gm Says 'in a Good Place' Batey said GM intends to reduce overall inventories to around 75 days by year-end from 105 currently. “We’re in a good place to have a good 2017,” he said. The shift toward SUVs, fueled by cheap gasoline, is putting pressure on nearly all major automakers in the United States to simultaneously shift short-term production plans and rework long-term product programs that drive capital spending over several years. Sales of GM passenger cars plunged 17 percent in the first half and 36 percent in June, exceeding the industry-wide declines of 12 percent in the first half and 14 percent in June, according to Automotive News.  GM dealers ended June with as much as six months supply of certain models. Two months is considered normal. “There could be some consolidation” of passenger car production in fewer U.S. plants, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of LMC Automotive. “GM doesn’t need all the sedans it has today.

While widely seen as symbolic, the move raises the specter of the development of a parallel state. The top court has warned that the naming of  the alternate judges is illegal, and they could be jailed.  The Supreme Court's constitutional chamber warns those who undertake the unconstitutional pretense of naming magistrates will face the consequences of usurpation of functions,  the Supreme Court said in a statement late on Thursday. Undeterred, opposition lawmakers were planning to swear in the new judges shortly in a public plaza to combat what they say is oil-rich Venezuela's slide into dictatorship under Maduro.  Justice is coming,  said opposition legislator Jesus Abreu on Twitter.  We will name the true magistrates of democracy in Venezuela.  Critics hold that the current Supreme Court justices were named illegally by Maduro, rushed in before the opposition took over the legislature in January 2016.  They're pirate magistrates named on the fly,  said opposition legislator Juan Requesens as he made his way to the session. Even so, the government will not allow the congressionally appointed judges to unseat those already sitting on the Supreme Court. Rather, the move is seen as part of the opposition coalition campaign to ramp up pressure on unpopular Maduro after nearly four months of violent street protests, an unofficial plebiscite against him last weekend and a national strike on Thursday. Apart from the plan to name new judges, the opposition held an unofficial referendum on Sunday in which the opposition said some 7.5 million people voted against the government. Two young men died in unrest related to the Thursday's strike, according to authorities. Venezuela's second-largest city, Maracaibo, suffered looting, fires and four additional deaths during the stoppage, according to local reports that have not been confirmed by authorities. Over 360 people were arrested, rights group Penal Forum said. The opposition is vying to stop Maduro's plan to on July 30 create a controversial super-legislature with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions. Maduro also faces widespread pressure from abroad to abort the assembly, including from U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Monday he would take  strong and swift economic actions  if the Venezuelan leader went ahead with his plans.

ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and noted that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that strength as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down. Draghi's apparent lack of concern about the strengthening euro convinced traders that the central bank remained on track to potentially begin tapering its bond-buying stimulus later this year. The dollar index touched 93.952, its lowest level since June of last year, and was last down 0.3 percent at 94.032. The euro touched $1.1677, its highest level against the dollar in nearly two years, and was last up 0.2 percent on the day at $1.1653.  The fact that Draghi didn’t necessarily argue too much against the strength of the euro ... certainly gave the greenlight for individuals to want to own the currency again or actually add to their positions,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. The dollar touched a more than four-week low against the yen of 111.09 yen. In addition to traders' expectations that the ECB was staying the course toward tightening monetary policy, investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign were viewed as obstacles to the administration's pro-growth agenda and negative for the dollar.  Compounding the (weaker dollar) move is this latest news on the political front in the U.S. about the Russia investigation expanding to Trump’s business affairs,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.  This is on top of the fact that Senate has not been able to pass anything meaningful on the healthcare front,  he said in reference to the collapse late on Monday of a Republican effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system. The dollar also touched its lowest against the Swiss franc in more than a year at 0.9468 franc. The euro was last on track to gain 1.6 percent for the week, which would mark its second straight weekly rise against the dollar.

The central bank said in a notice to commercial lenders on Friday it would sell dollars to manufacturers, airlines, fuel importers and agriculture businesses at a special auction to clear their backlog of foreign exchange obligations. Traders said the auction and sales of treasury bills left some banks short of liquidity, forcing them to scramble for cash to pay for their purchases on the interbank market. That pushed up the cost of borrowing among lenders. The central bank sold 86.25 billion naira ($283 million)worth of 365-day and 195-day treasury bills on Friday in a bid to reduce excess liquidity following the government's distribution of debt refunds to some states on Monday.

The British company said the increase in organic service revenue, which beat analysts' consensus forecast for a 1.6 percent rise, boosted its confidence in its prospects for the full year, when it expects to grow core earnings by 4-8 percent.  We made a good start to the year with a robust commercial momentum in Europe and accelerating growth in AMAP (Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific),  Chief Executive Vittorio Colao  said on Friday.  Shares in the group rose to a six-week high of 231 pence.  We see this as a decent performance delivered broadly across Vodafone's markets,  said Citi, which rates the stock  neutral .  However we expect growth to ease next quarter as roaming, UK handset financing, competition in Italy and tougher comparatives in some emerging markets offset an easier comparative in Spain.  Vodafone expects cash flow to jump this year, enabling it to increase dividends, as it eases back on network investment, improves efficiency and tackles intense competition in India by merging with a rival. The company has invested billion of pounds in its networks to meet surging demand for mobile data. Colao said the rise in data traffic seen in the quarter was the equivalent to total data traffic just two years ago. Areas of weakness remained in Europe, however. Growth in Germany halved to 0.6 percent, from 1.2 percent in the previous quarter, which was put down to lower wholesale revenue and accounting changes a year ago. And although its performance in its problematic British market improved, it was still down 2.7 percent, with enterprise revenue declining in what it said was a competitive market. Competition was also increasing in Italy ahead of the arrival later this year of Iliad, the operator that has seized 18 percent of the French market in just four years.  Colao said operators were already  throwing a huge number of very cheap offers to the market .

Earlier this month UNESCO called on Poland to halt logging in Bialowieza, saying it could otherwise decide to put the forest on its list of world heritage sites in danger, while the European Commission asked the European Court of Justice for interim steps to suspend the logging. The row is one in a series of clashes between Poland's nationalist-minded government and EU authorities in Brussels.  On Friday, Polish lawmakers were set to defy the EU and opposition protesters by backing an overhaul of the judiciary denounced by critics as a lurch towards authoritarianism. Soon after the conservative Law and Justice party took power in 2015, Environment Minister Jan Szyszko, a hunter backed by powerful forester and hunter lobbies, approved a tripling in the volume of wood to be harvested in part of Bialowieza. Szyszko has argued that logging is needed to protect the woods against a beetle outbreak that is destroying spruce trees in the forest in northeast Poland.  In a video seen by Reuters and provided by the conservationist Wild Poland Foundation, guards from an agency that oversees state-run forests used force to carry away several protesters who tried to block the loggers.

Officials at the environment ministry were not immediately available for comment.

Last week's attack occurred when security personnel approached three wanted men in their vehicle in the town of Sehat, a statement carried by the state news agency SPA said.   When they were surrounded and asked to surrender, they started shooting in a random way,  the statement said. SPA said the men's suspected crimes included killing at least eight soldiers, armed robberies and weapons smuggling.

Shares of GE fell as much as 5.4 percent to their lowest level since Oct 2015, as the company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and its 2017 profit forecast came in at the low end. The stock's fall weighed on other industrials such as Caterpillar and 3M.  We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today,  said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.  GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market too.  Microsoft fell 0.3 percent, despite the company reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings. Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook . The Nasdaq came off its 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at record levels on Thursday. The tech sector, however, continues to be the best performing S&P; sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth from sectors relatively immune to a policy gridlock in Washington.  If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one,  said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 10:50 a.m. ET (1650 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.93 points, or 0.34 percent, at 21,538.85, the S&P; 500 was down 6.03 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,467.42. The Nasdaq Composite was down 11.80 points, or 0.18 percent, at 6,378.20. The S&P; and the Nasdaq are on track to close higher for the third straight week. All 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the industrials and energy sectors leading the decliners. Oil prices fell more than 1.5 percent after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output. Visa rose 1.7 percent after the world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast. EBay fell 2.8 percent as the company warned that adjusted profit this quarter could fall below analysts' estimates. Honeywell International rose 1.7 percent after the technology and manufacturing company raised the low-end of its profit forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,635 to 1,059. On the Nasdaq, 1,464 issues fell and 1,164 advanced.

Earlier this month UNESCO called on Poland to halt logging in Bialowieza, saying it could otherwise decide to put the forest on its list of world heritage sites in danger, while the European Commission asked the European Court of Justice for interim steps to suspend the logging. The row is one in a series of clashes between Poland's nationalist-minded government and EU authorities in Brussels.  On Friday, Polish lawmakers were set to defy the EU and opposition protesters by backing an overhaul of the judiciary denounced by critics as a lurch towards authoritarianism. Soon after the conservative Law and Justice party took power in 2015, Environment Minister Jan Szyszko, a hunter backed by powerful forester and hunter lobbies, approved a tripling in the volume of wood to be harvested in part of Bialowieza. Szyszko has argued that logging is needed to protect the woods against a beetle outbreak that is destroying spruce trees in the forest in northeast Poland.  In a video seen by Reuters and provided by the conservationist Wild Poland Foundation, guards from an agency that oversees state-run forests used force to carry away several protesters who tried to block the loggers.

(...) The Ministry has totally ignored both UNESCO and the European Commission,  the Wild Poland Foundation said in a statement.  The Wild Poland Foundation as well as Greenpeace said their activists were continuing to protest and impede the forest harvesters and expressed concern over  escalating violence  from state authorities.   The protests are being stopped in a more aggressive way then before. The foresters are using more people to protect the machines; they mobilized forest guards from all over Poland,  the Wild Poland Foundation statement said.  Officials at the environment ministry were not immediately available for comment.  In a separate statement on Friday, the ministry criticized non-government organizations for their appeal to protect the independence of courts as parliament pressed on with the judicial overhaul.  The appeal clearly shows that the so called environmentalists have taken the side of the total opposition,  the ministry statement said.

The 93-year-old leader's comments could fuel political violence in the ZANU-PF party as the southern African nation gears up for elections in 2018, which Mugabe has said he wishes to contest. Opponents have repeatedly accused ZANU-PF of using violence to win past elections and cling to power, charges the party denies. Addressing a youth rally in Lupane, 450 km (279 miles) southwest of the capital Harare, Mugabe, said ZANU-PF should confront groups of people pretending to be ruling party members. The veteran leader has been in power since Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980.   You should not allow those small groups to spoil our name. Wherever you see them, come on, seize them and get them out of the road and give them good punishment,  Mugabe said at the end of a speech broadcast on state television.  You don't need to have to wait for the police ... they are doing harm, they are committing crime, come on, hold them and kick them. Give them the punishment they deserve and call the police afterwards,  he added, amid cheers from the crowd.

Signed in 2015, the deal collapsed when rebel leader Riek Machar, appointed First Vice President in a unity government under President Salva Kiir, fled the country after fighting broke out in the capital Juba last July. The government says it is implementing the peace deal after appointing a replacement for Machar, and the West has stood by it until now. But the donors from the European Union, the United States, Britain and Norway said they would offer no further support. They have not specified how much funding they have been providing.  Parts of the agreement signed between the two men were  obsolete in light of the expansion of conflict since 2015,   they said in a statement issued late on Thursday. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but plunged into civil war in 2013 after Kiir fired his then deputy Machar. The war has split the country along ethnic lines, killing tens of thousands and displacing nearly a quarter of the 12 million-strong population. Millions face famine. A national election, which the deal stipulates should take place next year, would now be an  unnecessary diversion  from ending the war given the widespread violence, displacement and hunger, the donors said. Government spokesman Michael Makuei said the government would participate in efforts by East African nations to boost the peace process. But he refused to commit to including Machar as part of an inclusive plan that Western nations have called for. He accused the West of having  unstable opinions  for changing stance on backing the peace deal and elections.  This (peace deal) is their child and it is their duty to ensure that this child survives,  he told Reuters.  If they don't want to support, then let them be quiet.  Senior rebel official Nathaniel Oyet said revitalizing the deal was the  final opportunity  to save the country from  total disintegration,  and dismissed talk of holding an election.  War continues unabated in the countryside,  he told Reuters.  Where will the polling stations be? The front lines?  South Sudan has never held national elections as an independent nation. In 2015, its parliament postponed them for three years by amending the constitution to extend Kiir's term and their own.

The bag, which for years sat unidentified in a box at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, was bought by a person who bid by telephone and did not wish to be named publicly, auctioneer Sotheby's said. Auctioneers had expected the bag to fetch between $2 million and $4 million. It was the highest-value item at an auction of moon memorabilia that included the Apollo 13 flight plan annotated by its crew, which sold for $275,000; a spacesuit worn by U.S. astronaut Gus Grissom, which sold for $43,750, and a famous image of Buzz Aldrin of Apollo 11 on the moon taken by Neil Armstrong, which went for $35,000. After Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crew came come in July of 1969, the fate of the 12-inch by 8.5-inch (30-cm by 22-cm) bag labeled  Lunar Sample Return, was unknown for decades. After disappearing from the Johnson center, it surfaced in the garage of the manager of a Kansas museum, Max Ary, who was convicted of its theft in 2014, according to court records. FILE PHOTO: The Apollo 11 Contingency Lunar Sample Return Bag used by astronaut Neil Armstrong is displayed for Sotheby's Space Exploration auction in New York City, U.S., July 13, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe bag was seized by the U.S. Marshals Service which put it up for auction three times, drawing no bids, until it was bought in 2015 for $995 by a Chicago-area attorney, Nancy Lee Carlson. She sent the bag to NASA for authentication, and when tests revealed it was used by Armstrong and still had moon dust traces inside, the U.S. space agency decided to keep it. Carlson successfully sued NASA to get the bag back, and the attention created by her legal challenge prompted many inquiries from potential buyers, according to Sotheby's. That led Carlson to decide to auction it again. One group criticized the decision to sell a piece of space history.  The bag belongs in a museum, so the entire world can share in and celebrate the universal human achievement it represents,  said Michelle Hanlon cofounder of For All Moonkind, a non-profit formed to persuade the United Nations to adopt measures to preserve and protect the six Apollo lunar landing sites.

The wealthy northeastern region plans to hold a popular vote on whether it should secede from Spain on Oct. 1, which the central government says cannot go ahead because it is unconstitutional. Spain's regions pay taxes to the central government and are then given a quota to spend on health, education and public infrastructure, a system Catalonia - which has one of Spain's strongest regional economies - says is unfair.  Madrid also sends extra funds to the Catalan government under a program - the Autonomous Liquidity Fund (FLA) - set up during the economic crisis, when Spain's regional governments were all but cut off from international debt markets.   Catalan authorities will be obliged to provide weekly accounts to show no public money is being used to promote the independence drive, or lose access to the FLA, central government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said on Friday.   The Autonomous Liquidity Fund payments are conditional on compliance with the agreement,  de Vigo told a news conference following a weekly cabinet meeting.  The government has sent some 67 billion euros ($78 billion) to Catalonia since the FLA fund was created in 2012, and 3.6 billion euros this year.   Not one euro of the Catalan money will go to an illegal referendum,  de Vigo said.

While stay-at-home Muscovites can order an array of international pizza brands from Sbarro to Domino's to Papa John's, regional cities such as Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod are still chiefly the preserve of small local chains. Multiple challenges have kept global fast food brands wedded to major Russian cities, including patchy transport links, bureaucratic delays, finding an army of chefs who can maintain quality, as well as the sheer cost of shipping often perishable ingredients across a vast country that spans 11 time zones. Western fast food chains have also had to adapt menus to suit Russian palates better, once the allure of new foreign tastes has worn off. One of Domino's best-selling pizzas is the  Russian  with 13 toppings including potato, beef, pork, bacon, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese to help ward off the cold. But Domino's Pizza's Russian franchisee, DP Eurasia, believes the time is now right to expand beyond Moscow, where sales at the 76 outlets it had at the end of March are far outstripping growth in its main market Turkey.  The company has done its own research and realized that there's almost no quality pizza in the regions, which gives us enormous ground for development,  said DP Eurasia's head of Russian development Elena Ivanova. Like-for-like sales in Russia have risen 30.1 percent this year up to May 21, whereas the comparable figure for Turkey was 6.3 percent growth. Aggressive Expansion Domino's was Russia's third-largest pizza chain last year yet its share of the fragmented market stood at less than 2 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Guvenc Donmez, DP Eurasia's Russian head, said he saw room for 1,500 Domino's outlets in the longer term. A staff member prepares pizzas at a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Moscow, Russia, July 14, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinFor now, the company is using part of the 148 million pounds  ($192 million) it raised listing shares in London in June to add 40 outlets this year, venturing as far as Krasnodar, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow. Domino's closest rival is not standing idle. The Russian franchise of U.S. chain Papa John's International Inc, the fourth biggest player in the country in 2016, sees room for 60-80 store openings each year over the next five years.  We still see potential in Moscow. I think we could open a further 40-50 stores there, but we are also embarking on an aggressive expansion to small towns,  Christopher Wynne, the chief executive of Papa John's franchisee, told Reuters. Another U.S. brand Sbarro was the market leader with a 4 percent market share in 2016, according to Euromonitor, followed by DoDo Pizza, a Russian chain with a presence in former Soviet states as well as China and the United States. Slideshow (6 Images)Sbarro's Russian franchise had 88 stores last year, including in provincial cities. However, it was hit by a Russian food import ban and a drop in the rouble as Sbarro refused to let it replace imports with local products and the franchising agreement was terminated, Russia's RBC daily has reported. Sbarro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wynne said Papa John's Russia had imported 90 percent of products before the 2014 food ban came in but had replaced all its suppliers within six months. DP Eurasia acknowledged the restrictions could adversely affect its business, even though it too had managed to replace the banned imports. It also said there could be challenges in rolling out the franchise in places with less dense populations than Moscow but believes it can stay profitable thanks to greater purchasing power and economies of scale.  Russia is a huge market and is still very underpenetrated. You don't have many options to eat,  Donmez said in an interview with Reuters TV.

The executives said on Thursday the company would soon open a facility in Palo Alto, California, that would eventually be staffed by  several hundred  engineers. Lyft engineers will collaborate there with autonomous vehicle experts from other companies to build self-driving systems.  We are putting down the accelerator significantly on investment on this,  Raj Kapoor, chief strategy officer for Lyft, told reporters at its San Francisco headquarters. The move marks a striking strategy change for Lyft, which said previously it would leave the building of self-driving systems to others while allowing partners to test their autonomous cars in Lyft's ride-hailing network. Lyft previously announced partnerships with Alphabet's self-driving division, Waymo, technology company Nutonomy, and automakers General Motors Co and Jaguar Land Rover. Lyft's new effort could put it in direct competition with some of those partners. The company, which will not be manufacturing the actual cars, offered no time line for its self-driving ambitions. Executives said Lyft would share data from its self-driving efforts with other companies joining the collaboration. Lyft does not have a permit to test autonomous cars in California, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. The company plans to launch a pilot with Nutonomy in Boston by year-end.  Recruiters for Lyft wait for the opening of a job fair in Golden, Colorado, June 7, 2017.Rick WilkingBuilding autonomous driving systems is a complicated and expensive endeavor, and brings a new layer of complexity to Lyft. Unlike its far larger rival, Uber Technologies Inc, which has tackled everything from food delivery to flying cars, and expanded overseas, Lyft has operated strictly as a ride service for people in the United States. Lyft's 700,000 drivers complete more than 200 million rides and 1.2 billion miles (1.9 billion km) a year in the 350 cities where it operates, which executives said gave the company detailed knowledge of traffic patterns, bridges, construction and other roadway data critical for building autonomous systems.  The one thing that is very, very key is the scale that we have,  said Luc Vincent, vice president of engineering.  None of those miles have been driven with autonomous technology, experts point out, meaning Lyft will be starting from scratch in a business where Waymo, Tesla and Uber have been operating for years.   It does still take a lot to do this, even if there is lots off-the-shelf technology, to engineer them together and create systems and put them in a vehicle,  said Jeremy Carlson, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit. Lyft's new push comes as Uber is facing a lawsuit from Waymo over alleged theft of trade secrets relating to self-driving technology designs. Lyft in April raised $600 million in new funding. The company has begun preparations for an initial public offering, sources close to the company told Reuters.

In March, the East African nation became the first country to issue a mobile phone-based bond, which can be bought by phone users without the need for them to have a bank account. Investors can use mobile phone networks' financial platforms like M-Pesa to send money and  receive interest payments on the M-Akiba bonds, which can be traded in the secondary market. Kenya's first such three-year infrastructure bond raised its target of 150 million shillings within days and it launched the sale of the second tranche last month. However, the second tranche had raised only 128 million shillings by midday on Friday, the finance ministry told Reuters, without offering more details. Kenya has a vibrant conventional bond market, which the government relies on to raise the bulk if its financial borrowing requirements, but it is pushing through mobile phone bonds to tap into a wider pool of retail investors. Only a few ordinary Kenyans bought traditional government bonds, scared off by the minimum investment of 50,000 shillings and the need for a commercial bank account. Investors can buy the M-Akiba bond for as little as 3,000 shillings, earning a tax-free interest of 10 percent. There was no immediate explanation for the lower demand on the latest mobile phone bond, but Kenya is in the midst of election campaigns ahead of an Aug. 8 poll that has seen some businesses and investors take a wait-and-see attitude.  Elections are often tense in Kenya after 1,200 people were killed in ethnic violence that broke out due to a disputed presidential election in December 2007.

The fate of more than half of 41 mines in the Philippines, the world's top nickel ore supplier, has been uncertain since February when then Environment Secretary Regina Lopez ordered their closure for causing environmental damage and violating laws. Lopez led a 10-month industry crackdown until her dismissal in May by the Commission on Appointments following her mining orders, which included a ban on open-pit mining and a demand for a bigger government share in mining revenues. She was replaced by Duterte's friend, former military general Roy Cimatu.  I'd like to tell you frankly, we will come up with new legislation ... we have to rearrange everything,  Duterte said in a speech at a business conference in his home town, Davao City. Duterte also said he would invite all industry stakeholders to the presidential palace for a dialogue together with former environment minister Lopez and other anti-mining advocates. Duterte said he has always been supportive of Lopez's pro-environment stance but could not stop mining because there is a law that allows the miners to continue to operate. He also complained that the taxes miners pay are  too low  and lamented the lack of compensation to mining communities that suffer from environmental damage. The Philippines' No. 2 nickel ore producer, Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc welcomed Duterte's invitation, saying a dialogue will help clarify problems with mining. But Dante Bravo, president of Global Ferronickel, said his company has been paying a lot of taxes already, including a 30 percent regular corporate income tax, a 5 percent royalty on mineral reservation and a 2 percent excise tax, both based on gross sales.  You sum it up, it is so heavy,  he told Reuters. Duterte did not say when the meeting would take place but he said he planned to show industry stakeholders footage shown to him by anti-mining advocates, including Lopez, about the environmental destruction, as well as examples of good practices in mining.  I will tell (them), look at the slides about good practices of mining, and I will ask everybody to focus on that,  he said.  Then let's also look at the slides on mining gone awry.  He also urged mining companies to  come up with an arrangement that is fair to everybody.  Lopez, now an environmental advocate and TV travel show host, immediately thanked Duterte and said his  fearless stand  will help the country  see the light of day.   I can assure you a green economy based on love (for the environment) will be much more dynamic and all-embracing than an extractive one based on greed and selfishness,  Lopez said in a message to Duterte via a Facebook post.

The move is part of the Chinese government's drive to rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital. Beijing added China Unicom last year to a first batch of state-owned enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform. China Unicom, formally known as China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, is one of the world's largest mobile carriers by user numbers, but its recent earnings have struggled in a fiercely competitive market. The carrier is widely seen as over-staffed, inefficient and slow to develop key technologies. It already lags state-owned China Mobile and China Telecom, and private firms have moved ahead in developing cloud and big data services, and mobile software. Reuters reported last month that Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings would be among new investors putting a total of about $10 billion into China United Network Communications Ltd, China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit. That total is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan ($11.8 billion), with Baidu, China's biggest internet search provider, investing about 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion), and JD.com, the country's second-largest e-commerce company, putting in about 5 billion yuan, one of the people said. The China Unicom unit is likely to raise 15 billion yuan from Tencent and 7 billion yuan from Alibaba, while China Life Investment Holding Co Ltd would be the biggest new investor, with a 20 billion yuan commitment, that person added. Overall, it would be the largest capital raising in the Asia-Pacific region since insurer AIA Group's 2010 initial public offering, according to Thomson Reuters data. The majority of the capital would be raised through new share issues, while China Unicom would also sell part of its stake in the Shanghai unit, the two people said. Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not public. FILE PHOTO: Company logos of China Unicom are displayed at a news conference during the company's announcement of its annual results in Hong Kong, China March 16, 2016.Bobby Yip/File PhotoBaidu and JD.com declined to comment, and China Unicom, Alibaba and Tencent didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. China Life Investment Holding could not immediately be reached for comment.  China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees state enterprises, also did not respond to requests for comment. 5g Push After the share sale, China Unicom's stake in the Shanghai-listed business would fall to just above 40 percent, from 63 percent currently, one of the sources said, and top investors, including China Life Investment and Tencent, would likely have seats on the firm's board to engage in its operations and improve its management. Both sources said teaming up with China's big tech companies, particularly Tencent and Alibaba, would help revive China Unicom by lowering the cost of attracting new users and shifting its focus from traditional telecoms services to digital information services. The share sale also comes at a time when Beijing is pushing to build the world's largest fifth-generation (5G) mobile network - bringing a significant speed upgrade from today's 4G network. China's 5G market could be worth 1.1 trillion yuan, or 3.2 percent of GDP, by 2025, according to a recent research paper from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The capital raising would give China Unicom the firepower to boost its spending on 5G. Share trading in China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit has been halted since it said in early April it would be part of the government's mixed-ownership pilot. It gave no further details at that time. Prior to that suspension, the unit's market value topped $23 billion. A week ago, the unit said it was waiting for regulatory approvals over details of the mixed-ownership plans, and trading in its shares would remain suspended for another month. The sources said the share sale plan is likely to be finalized by late August.

Amazon has long had a presence in Washington, lobbying on a broad range of topics ranging from taxes, immigration, trade and mobile payments. But their decision, announced in June, to buy premium grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion roiled the grocery industry and has sparked some opposition on Capitol Hill and among unions and other Amazon critics.  That said, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. Complicating the company's status in the nation's capital, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post - a newspaper that has drawn the public ire of Donald Trump.  Candidate Trump famously said in May 2016 that Amazon has  a huge antitrust problem.  Amazon is on pace to spend more than $12 million this year, if they keep up their lobbying efforts at the same rate. In 2016, the online retailer spent $11 million on lobbying in Washington.  The company's lobbying effort more than doubled in 2015 compared with prior years, spending $9 million that year compared with $4.7 million the year before. Amazon added a new firm to the lobbying army in the second quarter of 2017, hiring McGuireWoods Consulting to handle work on drones, among other matters. In addition to consultants, Amazon also employs in-house lobbyists. Their latest filing lists some 15 employees who lobby on behalf of the company on a long list of topics and issues ranging from drone policy to trade regulations and immigration to food stamp programs. Amazon also employs firms to lobby on its behalf on a range of topics. In the second quarter of this year, Amazon paid lobbying megafirm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld $80,000 to lobby, primarily focused on the Marketplace Fairness Act - a bill that would allow state government to collect sales tax from online retailers. Amazon Prime Air, a subsidiary of the company, also paid Akin Gump to lobby on drone policy. They also filed a termination, indicating they won't be doing work for the subsidiary in future.

Medium and longer-dated yields touched three-week lows as benchmark German 10-year yields hit a two-week trough. The euro's surge, if sustained, would hurt European exporters and possibly force ECB policymakers to delay any plans to reduce quantitative easing.      This is a directionality with the euro. The U.S. and Bunds spread is moving on that after the ECB meeting,  Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment Banking in New York.     On Thursday, the ECB stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance as Europe's inflation remained below 2 percent, but currency traders perceived ECB President Mario Draghi's comments at his news conference as supportive to build bullish bets on the euro .     The single currency rose to $1.1677 earlier on Friday, the strongest since Aug. 24, 2015, while German 10-year yields  traded as low as 0.496 percent, a two-week trough, Reuters data showed.     At 10:40 a.m. (1440 GMT), the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down more than 2 basis points at 2.243 percent after hitting a three-week low of 2.236 percent.     Trading volume was light in the absence of major U.S. economic data and some caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that will begin on Tuesday.     Expectations that the U.S. central bank will leave key overnight borrowing costs unchanged partly fed the decline in short-term interest rate volatility.     An index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on one-month volatility on Treasury yields has fallen in the past two weeks, recording an all-time low of 46.999 on Thursday.

Concerns over immigration were a key driver behind last year's vote to leave the EU, and the government has made controlling Britain's borders central to its Brexit plans and the main reason for its decision to leave the EU single market. But last month's national election, in which voters stripped Prime Minister Theresa May of her parliamentary majority, has reopened the debate about what kind of future relationship with the EU Britain should pursue, with the government promising to seek as wide a consensus as possible. Any position Britain adopts will be subject to negotiation with the EU, which on Thursday demanded more clarity from ministers after the first full round of exit talks ended with limited progress. Media reported on Friday that finance minister Philip Hammond, one of May's most prominent pro-European ministers, had won cabinet backing for a plan to allow free movement of people to continue for at least two years after Brexit. One of the leading pro-Brexit members of May's cabinet, environment minister Michael Gove, said there was no opposition to a transitional arrangement that involved access to EU workers.   The prime minister has made clear, as we leave the European Union we will have an implementation period which will ensure that we can continue to have, not just access to labor, but the economic stability and certainty which business requests,  he said according to media reports of a speech he made on Friday.  That is something around which the government and the cabinet is united.  As part of Hammond's plans, EU citizens would remain free to move to Britain for up to two years after March 2019, when Britain is due to leave the bloc, The Times newspaper reported on Friday. The Guardian newspaper cited a senior cabinet source as saying free movement could last for up to four years. Asked about the reports, May's office pointed to the speech the prime minister made in January to set out her Brexit position, in which she called for a  phased process of implementation  to allow businesses to prepare. May stressed the need for a  smooth orderly exit  from the EU on Thursday at a meeting with businesses. Brexit minister David Davis has previously said that Britain would not suddenly shut the door on low-skilled EU migrants after Brexit. Time to Adapt A report published by a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament also stressed the importance of phasing in any immigration controls.   It will take companies time to adapt their business models to be less dependent on EU workers and an implementation period is essential to ensure a smooth transition,  said Michael Forsyth, chairman of the economics committee of the House of Lords.  The report said the necessary training of the British workforce and investment in new technologies could take a number of years, and businesses would need to retain access to the EU labor market during this time. The committee of lawmakers also said that without improvements to the accuracy of migration data the government would struggle to control immigration after Brexit as it would be formulating policy  in the dark .  Existing data does not provide an accurate number of migrants entering or leaving the country, or the number of migrants in work, it said, calling on the government to work to improve the data before basing new policy on it. The government has repeatedly failed to meet a pledge to reduce the annual net migration level to below 100,000. In 2016 the figure fell to its lowest in more than 2-1/2 years but, at 248,000, was still more than double that target, which covers immigration from the EU and outside.  The committee said sticking with a numerical target risked causing  considerable  disruption to businesses and the economy.  The objective of reducing migration to sustainable levels should be implemented flexibly and be able to take account of labor market needs, in particular during the implementation period,  it said.

Leader Marine le Pen vowed to  deeply renew  the party after she lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron in May. A month later, the National Front (FN) won just eight seats in a parliamentary poll, well short of the minimum 15 required to form a group that would have greater influence in the chamber. Both results came despite opinion polls pointing to a strong showing for the anti-EU, anti-immigration party, briefly spooking investors who worried that it would rock France's political establishment and with it the European Union.  We shouldn't cover up issues or look for quick fixes, but must instead get to the bottom of things, to be a challenger to be reckoned with in the next presidentials,  Jerome Riviere, part of Le Pen's presidential campaign team, told Reuters. He will be one of around 40 senior party representatives meeting privately on Friday and Saturday on the outskirts of Paris, but with infighting spilling into the open and divisions over central policies wide, no final decisions are expected. The meeting will be followed by a questionnaire sent to National Front members in September and a party congress early next year. Among the biggest disagreements is the FN's economic policy, and in particular its rejection of the euro, an idea which is unpopular with the majority of the electorate but appeals to the party's core supporters. FN deputy chief Florian Philippot threatened to quit if the party's policy on restoring the franc was dropped, much to the annoyance of some senior colleagues. Le Pen, meanwhile, has left open the possibility of watering down that pledge, and two aides who were key to drafting her presidential platform told Reuters they were pushing in that direction, albeit with important caveats. Jean Messiha, who was in charge of Le Pen's presidential manifesto which included ditching the euro, said he would call at the seminar for the party to focus instead on what he called a  vital  challenge for France: the fight against immigration.

They would then propose steps such as exiting the banking union, a move which they recognize would break euro zone rules. What's in a Name? Political analysts blamed the FN's election defeat on its lack of allies, distrust among voters for some of its hardline policies and a TV debate performance by Le Pen that some party officials admit was damaging. Slideshow (2 Images)For Sophie Montel, a party member for nearly 30 years who will also attend the seminar despite being ousted this month from the FN's group in a regional council, the party must soften its tone and move away from focusing on hardline anti-immigration policies.  We need to come up with an optimistic message, embody hope and stop being caricatures of ourselves, a bit too aggressive,  she told Reuters, urging the party to focus on issues including education. Montel's demotion came after she backed two younger colleagues who were pushing for major reforms and criticizing the party's campaign logistics, and she plans to use the meeting to propose diluting some powers concentrated within the FN's headquarters. Despite tensions, there is one issue that unites most of the party's senior leadership, according to some FN officials: changing its name.  It resonates in France and abroad, in part because people associate it with its founder, Marine's estranged father Jean-Marie le Pen, a politician known for his provocative style and convictions for incitement to racial hatred. It  frightens  people, said Philippot. At a time when opinion polls show the far-left France Unbowed to be a stronger opponent to Macron than the FN, analysts say the party faces one of its greatest challenges and would need time to rebound.  There might be a change in name and a ... repositioning on the euro, but that will not change the fact that this is a solitary party and that without alliances it cannot hope to have 50 percent of the votes,  said Jerome Fourquet of Ifop pollsters.

Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years and boasts strong popularity ratings, is widely expected to run for, and win, his fourth presidential term in March next year. Speaking during a question-and-answer session with school children in the Black Sea resort of Sochi which analysts said was designed to widen his support base among young people, Putin, 64, said:  Do I need to continue my work in this capacity - I haven't decided yet.  I have not yet decided whether to leave my post as president or not. After I address this issue, I will think about what to do next.  When asked whether he had a presidential successor in mind, Putin did not name any names, saying that choice would be up to the Russian people.  Putin served two presidential terms before stepping down in 2008 to become prime minister to avoid a constitutional bar on running for a third consecutive term. He returned to the presidency in 2012 for another term and is legally entitled to serve for a fourth term as well. Some political commentators have suggested however that Putin could change the constitution to allow him to stay on as president for a fifth term past 2024. The Russian leader ruled that out on Friday.  I had an opportunity, they even asked me to change the constitution. But I didn't do it, and I don't intend to do it in the future,  said Putin. School children peppered Putin with a range of non-political questions as well, asking him what he did in his spare time and  about his childhood memories. They frequently applauded his answers.  When asked what the three most important values in life were, Putin said  life itself, love and freedom.  When asked which events had made the greatest impression on him, he named the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, something he has previously called the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.  Citing a heavy workload, he also said he did not really use the Internet but relied on advisers instead.

Freeport shares were down about 1 percent on New York at $12.93 Friday morning.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016. But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact. Investors are again focusing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60. The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs. The painstaking effort has paid off. Net income for Exxon, Chevron (CVX.N), Shell, BP (BP.L), Total, Eni (ENI.MI) and Statoil (STL.OL) is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters. By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programs, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash.  More of the Same  But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54.  While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates.  Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment,  said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander.    The sector needs to continue doing more of the same,  he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs.  Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns. Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1. Majors were targeting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said. About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added.  Off Life Support  Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery. Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil. Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focused more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale.  Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18  strong buy  or  buy  recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16. Exxon holds the lowest number of  buy  recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said. Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3. Oil majors have underperformed so far this year relative to the broader stock market . For some, that makes current valuations attractive. (See graphic: reut.rs/2twyZvW)  The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything,  said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron.  They are off life support at $55 a barrel.

Valcour currently oversees three Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) and the Valcour Opportunity Fund, a hedge fund focused on credit and structured products, according to its website.

We will run with the same drivers that we have this year again next year. That is a given,  he told the official Formula1.com website.  And given the other continuity aspects, we should be better racers next season.  The only U.S.-owned outfit on the starting grid are currently seventh in the 10-team championship at the halfway stage with 29 points, the same amount that they scored in all of their debut 2016 season. Experienced Frenchman Grosjean scored all of the team's 2016 points but Denmark's Magnussen, who replaced Mexican Esteban Gutierrez at the end of last year, has taken 11 from the 10 races so far.  My guess is that we will score at least another 29 points,  said Haas.  And next year, without a big car or engine change, and with the drivers the same, that should give us a nice continuity boost.  Haas have Ferrari engines and a close working relationship with the Italian team, which has put them in the spotlight as a possible home for promising young drivers backed by the sport's oldest and most successful team.

Ferrari-backed Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc is leading the GP2 feeder series and is another tipped to enter Formula One with a Ferrari-powered team. Those options look limited, however, with Ferrari-powered Sauber due to switch to Honda engines next season -- although recent management changes at the Swiss-based team have cast doubt on that deal. If Sauber do switch to Honda, that would leave Haas as Ferrari's only customer team.

Land redistribution is a burning political issue in South Africa and has divided the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ahead of a December conference where President Jacob Zuma's successor as party leader will be chosen. Many Zuma supporters are demanding land expropriation from whites without compensation, while the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), an increasingly popular four-year-old party, has told South Africans to occupy unused land illegally. Although Zuma has said any land reform will be done sensibly and within the law, there are concerns that the populism in South African politics could lead to the scenes witnessed in Zimbabwe in the early-2000s. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe permitted violent land seizures from white farmers, beginning in 2000, that prompted the international community to cut off ties and sent a once-promising economy into a tailspin.  We were arrogant. We thought they would never take the land because we were too important for the economy,  Peter Steyl, president of Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union, the nation's biggest commercial farming union, told Reuters.  You never think it will happen until people turn up at your door armed with machetes, off their heads. It gets pretty real.   They are facing the same situation in South Africa. I would tell them: 'it's better to give a little bit now than lose everything when things go too far'.           Blind Stupidity  South Africa's government says only eight million hectares of arable land have been transferred to black people since the end of apartheid in 1994, less than 10 percent of the 82 million hectares available and a third of the ANC's 30 percent target. The ANC is under pressure to win back many poor, black voters who have switched allegiance to the EFF, founded by Julius Malema after he was expelled from the ANC for misconduct. Malema, a former protege of Zuma who has become a thorn in his side, is due to appear in court on charges of inciting violence due to his comments on land grabs.     FILE PHOTO: A farmer addresses a meeting of white commercial farmers in Harare, Zimbabwe, February 5, 2010.Philimon Bulawayo/File PhotoSteyl said taking land without compensation would be disastrous and would prompt investors and foreign institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to turn their back on Africa's most developed economy.  That would be blind stupidity. It's possible you will never recover,  Steyl said.  I know there are huge problems with unemployment in South Africa. Everyone needs to come to the table to negotiate.  Agriculture employs 850,000 people in South Africa, or 6 percent of the workforce, and the country of 56 million is a major food exporter. Jannie de Villiers, CEO of South African commercial farming group Grain SA, said he was confident there would be no repeat of the chaos in Zimbabwe because South Africa's constitution does not allow land expropriation without compensation. FILE PHOTO: Martha Mafa, a subsistence farmer, carries a bucket of maize on her head in Chivi, about 378km (235 miles) south-east of Zimbabwe's capital Harare, April 1, 2012.Philimon Bulawayo/File PhotoHe also said South African white farmers were committed to working with the government on land reform.  We realize there is a lot more we can do to allow land reform to happen. We think the percentage chance of going down the Zimbabwe route is very small,  de Villiers told Reuters. Anc Leadership Vote How to address the inequality that still exists 23 years after the end of white-minority rule will be the central debate at the ANC leadership vote in December. Veteran politician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife, is expected to run on a campaign to radically transfer wealth from the white minority to the black majority, including land reform. Her main opponent is expected to be Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has also called for wealth redistribution but has made tackling government corruption and winning back investor confidence priorities. Steyl warned against politics driving land reform, as happened in Zimbabwe when Mugabe allowed land grabs to secure the loyalty of the military. The knock-on effects were disastrous. Zimbabwe tumbled into recession, inflation peaked at 500 billion percent. Unemployment is now above 90 percent.  Don't allow it to happen to you,  Steyl said.  You have to engage. You have to be sensible. You mustn't allow desperation to win they day.

(PepsiCo) at 'A/F1'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the press release. The Rating Outlook is Stable. PepsiCo's ratings reflect its considerable financial flexibility, substantial cash flow, significant scale, geographic reach, product diversification provided by its high-margin Frito-Lay North America segment, and brand strength as the world's second largest food and beverage company. Rating concerns include increased leverage driven by past domestic borrowing for shareholder initiatives combined with foreign exchange headwinds. Consequently, debt has increased to approximately $39.5 billion at the end of second quarter 2017 compared to $29 billion at the end of 2014. Fitch expects supplemental net leverage to remain within the mid 2x range going forward, which Fitch views as acceptable for the current ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Brand Strength, Global Diversity: More than half of PepsiCo's $63 billion in annual net revenue is derived from snacks, and more than 40% of its operating profit is derived from its higher margin Frito-Lay's North America segment. PepsiCo has significant global geographical diversification with approximately 42% of revenues generated outside of the United States. The company's brand strength is demonstrated by its portfolio of more than 20 brands, including Pepsi, Gatorade, Lay's Doritos, and Quaker. Each has more than $1 billion in annual retail sales and is typically No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective categories. Diversification Supports Organic Growth Operationally, PepsiCo is focused on increased brand support to grow volume share, expand its emerging market presence and grow its nutrition business. The company is also reducing overhead and leveraging technology and processes across its organization. Fitch believes PepsiCo's diversified portfolio anchored by its food business, strong brands and good innovation pipeline (high-single digits of sales) should enable core revenue growth of at least 3% during the next couple of years. PepsiCo has been able to use price/mix to offset a significant portion of foreign exchange headwinds, and pricing has remained rational in key developed markets. Consequently, PepsiCo generated core revenue growth of approximately 3.7% in 2016. Fitch expects core revenue growth in 2017 of roughly 3% driven by price/mix benefits. Growing Overseas Cash Continues: PepsiCo generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its international operations. PepsiCo, like other multi-national companies, has been reluctant to repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign cash balances have grown along with debt balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital investment and share repurchase program. Absent material M&A; and tax reform, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to approximately $23 billion by 2018. With potential tax reform on the horizon, multi-nationals including PepsiCo would be reluctant to pursue material repatriation until after a new tax plan is implemented. Fitch discounts PepsiCo's foreign cash balances by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further 50% adjustment capturing expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for shareholder-friendly actions when determining supplemental net leverage. Mid-2x Supplemental Net Leverage: For U.S. issuers with significant foreign cash balances, Fitch uses a supplemental net leverage ratio as part of our analysis. PepsiCo's supplemental net leverage was approximately 2.6x at the end of the second quarter 2017. Supplement net leverage is expected to be approximately 2.5x for 2017 compared to 2.4x at the end of 2016. Fitch expects gross debt leverage in 2017 of approximately 3.0x. Leverage at the end of the second quarter of 2017 was 3.1x which compares to the low 2x range in 2010. For 2017, PepsiCo has reduced expected shareholder returns to approximately $6.5 billion from $9 billion in 2015, although Fitch anticipates PepsiCo will still need to increase debt by approximately $3 to $3.5 billion to fund their domestic cash requirements. This is based on Fitch's estimate that approximately 45% of CFFO is available for domestic use and does not consider any foreign cash that could be used for domestic funding requirements. Debt increased $2.5 billion during the first half of 2017. Productivity Underpins Earnings Expansion: PepsiCo's five-year $5 billion productivity cost savings program to be completed by 2019 remains on track and provides the company with significant flexibility to expand margins and drive increased earnings over the longer term. PepsiCo is using a portion of these savings to bolster brand strength by increasing media, innovation and R&D; spending combined with cost reductions that strongly support future growth in revenues and operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views PepsiCo's long-term mid-single-digit profit before tax financial targets as achievable. Despite the past effects of foreign exchange translation due to the strong dollar that has negatively affected EBITDA, benefits of productivity efforts and working capital gains have resulted in stable cash generation. Cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF) averaged $10.5 billion and $3.6 billion respectively for the past three years. Fitch expects PepsiCo's CFFO and FCF to be approximately $10 billion with FCF less than $3 billion in 2017. Beverage Category Headwinds: PepsiCo's challenges include global concern with health and wellness trends, increased excise taxes on its beverage products in certain markets, evolving consumer shopping habits and the maturity of its categories in developed markets. Several of PepsiCo's developed markets have stagnant or declining per capita carbonated soft drink (CSD) consumptions trends and low population growth. Weak CSD volume trends in developed markets place more dependence on increases with price/mix. However, exposure to CSDs continues to decline at less than 25% of revenues, and PepsiCo has good growth offsets from its non-carbonated portfolio due to Gatorade (low to mid-single digit volume growth) and water (double-digit). Developing and emerging markets have experienced more volatility and pressure in the past with growth and local cost inflation. Even so, growth in these markets was 6% in Q2 2017 compared to 2% in developed markets driven by Mexico and Russia, although certain pockets remain weak including Brazil, Argentina and the Middle East. DERIVATION SUMMARY PepsiCo's significant scale, geographic reach, distribution, product diversification including strong margins in its Frito-Lay North America segment, and brand strength as the world's second largest food and beverage company strongly positions the company relative to its peers. Consequently, PepsiCo's ability to execute on innovation and price/mix strategies has leveraged consumer trends in the snack food segment, resulting in greater U.S. retail growth than other larger competitors. With less than 25% of its beverage portfolio carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo has much less exposure than The Coca-Cola Company ('A+'/ Outlook Negative) that is in excess of 70% of its beverage portfolio. PepsiCo has a weaker presence in higher growth developing/emerging markets than Coca-Cola with lower brand equity, resulting in less pricing power across its international footprint. Consequently, PepsiCo's consolidated operating margins are also much lower due to its lower margin beverage segment, in the mid-teen range, when compared to Coca-Cola in the mid 20% range. However, PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North American segment generates industry leading operating margins at approximately 30% versus Mondelez ('BBB'/Outlook Stable) North American segment at approximately 20% and Kellogg's ('BBB'/Outlook Stable) US Snacks segment at approximately 12%. PepsiCo's financial policies have been aggressive during the past several years with increased shareholder returns, similar to Coca-Cola, which has resulted in higher domestic borrowing given the reluctance to repatriate foreign earnings. Given the increases in leverage for both companies, Fitch expects moderating shareholder returns with PepsiCo's long-term supplemental net leverage in the mid 2x range compared with Coca-Cola's long-term supplemental net leverage that is expected to decline to less than 2x. Fitch does expect PepsiCo will return a higher level of cash to shareholders than Coca-Cola during the medium-term, particular in the event of tax reform. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for 2017 and 2018 for PepsiCo include: --Underlying revenue growth in the 3% range; Fx impact of approximately 2% in 2017; --Modestly improving margins over the time period as productivity benefits accrue; --$10 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO) in 2017; increasing to the mid $10 billion range in 2018. Fitch estimates approximately 45% of CFFO is available for domestic use; --Free cash flow (FCF) in the $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion range, increasing to approximately $2.8 to $2.9 billion in 2018; --Absent cash repatriation, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to approximately $19 billion and $23 billion in 2017 and 2018 respectively; --Total debt increases by roughly $3 billion annually to fund domestic cash requirements; --Capital spending in the $3 billion range; --Share repurchases in the $2 billion range; --Gross leverage of approximately 3x and net supplemental leverage of approximately 2.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action While a positive ration action is not anticipated, the following would lead to an upgrade: --A public commitment by Pepsi to maintain a more conservative financial strategy related to debt levels and cash returned to shareholders; --Supplemental net leverage as calculated by Fitch below 2x and/or gross leverage in the 2.5x range or less; --Better than expected organic growth and operating metrics. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A significant increase in debt due to M&A; activity and/or share repurchases; --Weaker than expected organic growth and operating metrics; and/or --Supplemental net leverage sustained above the mid 2.5x; and/or gross leverage sustained materially above 3.0x. LIQUIDITY Liquidity, Maturities and Guarantees: PepsiCo maintains good liquidity. The company's cash and short-term investments totaled $17.2 billion at the end of the second quarter 2017, of which $16.3 billion was offshore. This compares to $15.2 billion at the end of 2016. PepsiCo has a combined capacity of $7.5 billion under its 364-day and five-year revolving credit facilities maturing in 2018 and 2022 respectively that remain undrawn. Upcoming maturities of long-term debt include $3.4 billion in 2017 and $2.5 billion in 2018. Commercial paper (CP) balances as of June 17, 2017 were approximately $1.8 billion. During the second quarter of 2017, PepsiCo issued $3.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated senior notes and $750 million of Canadian dollar denominated senior notes with net proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of CP. PepsiCo guarantees all of the senior notes at its bottling subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company (PMBC), which is wholly owned by PepsiCo. While PMBC's notes are structurally superior to the notes issued by PepsiCo, Inc., Fitch has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings at the single 'A' level as default risk is very low. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms the ratings for PepsiCo and its subsidiaries as follows: PepsiCo --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper program at 'F1'. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (Operating Company/Intermediate Holding Co.) --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes at 'A'. The following rating has been withdrawn since all of the debt at the bottling subsidiary has been repaid: Bottling Group, LLC (Operating Company) --Long-term IDR 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Sales rose by 0.6 percent from April to hit a record C$48.91 billion ($38.82 billion), Statistics Canada said on Friday. The increase was greater than the 0.2 percent advance forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. The Bank of Canada last week raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years. It also vowed to wait for more economic data before committing to its next move. Separately, Statscan said the annual inflation rate slowed to a 20-month low of 1.0 percent in June, well below the central bank's 2.0 percent target, although core measures showed signs of strength.  The Bank of Canada hiked rates based on the outlook for growth ... and in my view the numbers today really speak to that principle,  said Jimmy Jean, a senior economist at Desjardins, a Canadian brokerage.  I think the Bank of Canada will be very satisfied ... it keeps very alive and well the likelihood of a hike in October.  The bank is expected to lift rates again in October, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers. The Canadian dollar strengthened, hitting C$1.2547 to the greenback, or 79.70 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2595, or 75.40 U.S. cents. May's advance in retail trade was driven by a 2.4 percent increase in sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers.  The better-than-expected performance of the Canadian economy ... should allow the Bank of Canada to follow through with another rate hike in October,  said economist Dina Ignjatovic of TD Economics. The overall inflation rate - which matched the forecast of analysts - was the lowest since the 1.0 percent recorded in October 2015. Gas prices fell 1.4 percent in the 12 months to June after increasing by 6.8 percent on an annual basis in May. Two of the three measures of core inflation, which the Bank of Canada introduced last year, posted gains. Among those core inflation measures, CPI common, rose to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent. The bank says this gauge is useful in assessing the economy's underperformance. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, rose to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, stayed at 1.2 percent.

The Republican-dominated Senate will hear public testimony as it begins consideration of the bill, the most closely watched item on the state's agenda during a 30-day special session. So-called  bathroom bills  have become a flashpoint of U.S. culture wars, with social conservatives saying they protect public safety and civil rights activists saying the measures allow government-sanctioned bias against transgender people. During the regular session that ended in May, the Texas Senate easily passed such a measure. But it died in the state's House of Representatives under pressure from pro-business Republicans. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Republican who steers that chamber's agenda, has said such measures are unnecessary and raise worries of economic boycotts and event cancellations, which would harm the economy. Political analysts expect a similar pattern for the special session, with the Senate passing a bill and Straus trying to run out the clock to stop the legislation. One measure under consideration is Senate Bill 3, which says restrooms, showers and changing facilities in places such as public schools  must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a person's birth certificate.  When a bathroom bill was introduced in the regular session in March, hundreds of people lined up for a nearly 21-hour Senate hearing, with the bulk of public testimony coming from those opposed to the bill. Texas Values, a social conservative group that backs a bathroom bill, has called on supporters to speak up.  The radical Left and LGBT lobby will certainly be out in full force again. We must let our state leaders hear loudly from Texans across that state that we support common sense legislation to keep men out of women’s intimate facilities,  it said in an email alert on Thursday. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The stakes are far higher in Texas. The state could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 and businesses could find it difficult to recruit top talent if such a measure is enacted, said the Texas Association of Business, the state's leading employer organization.

We are doing this because the Norwegian government fails to understand what they are supposed to do according to the Paris agreement,  protest leader Sune Scheller told Reuters.  The vast majority of the oil and gas has to remain in the ground if we are going to protect our homes from the consequences of climate change,  he said before the action.

Among the protesters is Joanna Sustento, a 25-year-old writer from the Philippines, who lost relatives in the 2013 Haiyan typhoon, one of the strongest cyclones on record.

What happened to my community in Tacloban is an example of things to come for other people if we continue to focus on short-term gain,  Sustento told Reuters. On Monday, the Songa Enabler rig found a small gas deposit, which Statoil called disappointing. In its latest oil licensing round, Oslo offered a record number of blocks, brushing off concerns about the risks of drilling in the region.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-oil-greenpeace-idUSKBN1A61SA"},

Several high-profile attacks have occurred recently, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks in May and a virus dubbed  NotPetya  that halted production at some companies for more than a week. Others lost millions of euros to organized crime in a scam called  CEO Fraud . Some 53 percent of companies in Germany have been victims of industrial espionage, sabotage or data theft in the last two years, Bitkom found - up from 51 percent in a 2015 study. At the same time, the damage caused rose by 8 percent to around 55 billion euros a year, the survey of 1,069 managers and people responsible for security in various sectors found. Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany's BSI federal cyber agency, said many big companies and especially those operating critical infrastructure were generally well-prepared for cyber attacks. But many smaller and medium-sized companies did not take the threat seriously enough, he said.  The high number of companies affected clearly shows that we still have work to do on cyber security in Germany,  he said in a statement on Friday. The BSI urged companies in Europe's largest economy to make information security a top priority and said all companies need to report serious IT security incidents, even if anonymously. Schoenbohm told Reuters in an interview that hardware and software makers should do their part to shore up cyber security and patch weaknesses in software more quickly once identified.  There's still a lot of work to be done,  he said.  We have to be careful that we don't focus solely on industry and computer users, but also look at the producers and quality management.  Some 62 percent of companies affected found those behind the attacks were either current or former employees. Forty-one percent blamed competitors, customers, suppliers or service providers for the attacks, Bitkom said.  Foreign intelligence agencies were found to be responsible in 3 percent of the cases, it said. Twenty-one percent believed hobby hackers were responsible while 7 percent attributed attacks to organized crime.

A Turkish and a Swedish tourist, aged 39 and 22 years, died when the roof of a popular bar collapsed, Greek police said. Kos's port was put out of action and, across the strait, a small tsunami damaged vehicles parked near Bodrum's shore. On Kos, around 115 people were injured, including tourists of various nationalities -- 12 of them seriously. More than 350 people visited hospitals in Turkey, though most had only light injuries. The quake struck at 1:31 a.m. (2231 GMT), and many of Kos's tourists spent the rest of the night in the open as a precaution, hotel owners said.  All of a sudden it felt like a train was going right through the room,  said Vernon Hausman, a German holidaying on Kos.  I told my son: 'Looks like an earthquake, so let's get the hell out of here.'  Greek authorities said the 12 people seriously injured on Kos included tourists from Turkey, Sweden and Norway; four were transferred to Crete and three to Athens. One person was in a critical condition, while a Swedish tourist lost a leg, the director of the hospital in Crete told Greek Skai TV.  Lucky Escape  Turkish and Greek authorities put the magnitude at 6.3 and 6.6 respectively and reported several aftershocks, with one estimated at 5.1. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter of the main quake in the Aegean Sea, 10 km (6 miles) SSE of Bodrum and about 16 km ENE of Kos's main port. Hotel owners in Bodrum told Turkish broadcasters that some tourists were checking out.  It was a lucky escape and it could have been much worse,  said Issa Kamara, a 38-year old personal trainer at the Maca Kizi hotel in Bodrum's smart Turkbuku area. Constantina Svynou, head of the hoteliers' association in Kos, told Greek state television that many visitors had spent the night outside their hotels.  There are about 200,000 tourists on the island, we are at the peak season. Our first reaction was to calm the tourists, following basic rules and evacuating hotel buildings,  Svynou said, adding that there had been no injuries at hotels. A man stands in front of a damaged building following an earthquake off the island of Kos, Greece July 21, 2017.Costas BaltasReuters video footage showed residents and tourists walking along the streets of Kos's main town among collapsed walls and debris. Long, wide cracks appeared in the asphalt on the quayside, which is near a tourist strip of cafes and bars.  It was terrible ... our bed was shaking from the left to the right,  said Jara, a 26-year-old Dutch tourist.  Everything was going crazy.  Kos's airport remained operational and Greek Deputy Shipping Minister Nektarios Santorinios flew there. But he said the main port was out of action.  Passengers on ferries have been rerouted to the islands of Nisyros and Kalymnos,  he told Greek SKAI TV. Slideshow (11 Images)Tidal Wave Police said most of the damage in Kos had been to older buildings.  A seismologist told Greek TV that there had been a tidal wave about 70 cm (28 inches) high. Turkey's emergency authorities warned against aftershocks, but said there had been no casualties or major damage there. Some power cuts were reported, and a minaret in the town of Islamkoy was said to have collapsed. The broadcaster CNN Turk said that, in Bodrum, 60 vehicles had been dragged along by the water. It also showed boats listing in a harbor. Several store owners told the broadcaster NTV they had suffered flood damage. Turkey said it would evacuate around 200 of its citizens from Greece by boat. President Tayyip Erdogan said the fact that no lives had been lost in Turkey was a sign that  the measures we took have been effective . Turkey's location between the Arabian tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate renders it prone to earthquakes. In October 2011, more than 600 people died in the eastern province of Van following a 7.2-magnitude quake and powerful aftershocks. In 1999, two massive earthquakes killed about 20,000 people in Turkey's densely populated northwest. The same year, a 5.9 magnitude quake killed 143 people in Greece.

Consultations will happen over the next 18 months and will culminate in the publication of the final aviation strategy by the end of 2018, the government said. The government said that the aviation strategy would be separate to negotiations over access to European markets after Britain leaves the EU, although protecting and promoting the sector after Brexit would be a key focus of the consultation.  The purpose of this exercise is to take a longer term view on how we can maintain and strengthen our links to our European partners and the rest of the world,  Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said.  A range of topics will be under discussion, such as customer service, security considerations and minimising the environmental impact of any future expansion in flights. Among the proposals, the public will be asked to discuss the idea of having airport bag check-ins in town centres, and compensation for noise from airplanes. It will also examine how to make the most of existing capacity at UK airports. The consultation began as the government launched a 1 billion pound ($1.30 billion) investment in Manchester Airport, which will double the size of its second terminal. Britain has also said it backs the building of a third runway at Heathrow, ending 25 years of indecision, and has announced the expansion of City Airport. Neither expansion project is included in the consultation.  It is crucial that the government’s future aviation strategy supports the continued growth and development of our airports,  Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. However, with much of the focus of airline executives on airport expansion and the still uncertain status of flying to and from the UK after Brexit, there was concern that the new strategy could prove a distraction.  We would caution ... that the strategy process is kept as simple as possible, given the government's already packed aviation agenda,  said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers.

Jio has enjoyed a meteoric rise since its launch a year ago, with its months of free services and sharply discounted plans battering the fortunes of incumbents such as Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) and Idea Cellular (IDEA.NS), who have seen revenues and profits shrink dramatically. Despite Jio's rapid rise, funded by mega-profits churned out by parent Reliance Industries' (RELI.NS) core refining and petrochemicals operations, it has been unable to tap more than 500 million non-smartphone users in India, who still rely on old feature phones to make calls and send text messages, as its network only supports 4G-enabled phones.   Reliance sees the new handset, named JioPhone, allowing it to target India's entire mobile market for the first time. The new phone will  effectively cost zero  as buyers would be able to get the device for a one-time refundable security deposit of 1,500 rupees ($23.3), said Ambani, chairman of  Reliance Industries, announcing the launch at the conglomerate's annual shareholders' meeting. The announcement, which was greeted by applause from shareholders at a packed auditorium in south Mumbai, sent shares in rivals Airtel and Idea down 2 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.  Disruptive Pricing Jio's disruptive pricing of the new phone and its online content partnerships could further weigh on the sector's already dismal earnings and put pressure on lenders' balance sheets.  Earlier this year, India's central bank warned the telecom sector's earnings had deteriorated to the point that it was untenable for telecoms players to even cover the interest costs tied to loans.   They are getting people hooked to the data with the content,  said Varun Khandelwal, managing director, Bullero Capital.  Airtel, Vodafone do not have such bandwidth to give free phones, or the kind  of content that Jio has.  Reliance shares closed up 3.7 percent, after touching a nearly nine-and-a-half-year high in trading following the meeting, where the company also announced a one-for-one bonus share issue.  Ambani said the new device would begin to hit store shelves from Aug. 15. Voice calling will be free on the JioPhone, while unlimited data packs will cost 153 rupees ($2.38) a month.   The offer is quite compelling, as the phone has a lot of compelling features,  said Nitin Soni, who covers the telecoms sector for Fitch Ratings. Jio already boasts more than 125 million users, making it the world's fastest growing tech firm, and has added customers quicker than even the likes of free services such as Facebook (FB.O) and its popular messaging service WhatsApp, said Ambani. It has propelled India to become the No. 1 data consumer worldwide, surpassing both the United States and China, he said.  My sense is that they are looking at between 150 million and 200 million subscribers within the next 12 months,  said Fitch's Soni. Export Opportunities Ambani, whose speech was frequently punctuated with loud chants of  Jio , said that the company was aiming to make 5 million JioPhones available every week after launch. The company was bracing for huge demand after the launch and expected it might run out of stock, said a senior company executive who did not wish to be named. Ambani dedicated Friday's launch to his father, Dhirubhai Ambani, who founded the company. It is the second time Ambani has upended India's telecoms sector - he did the same in 2002 with a different venture, Reliance Infocomm, launched with the advent of CDMA technology. Unlike 2002, when Ambani indicated Infocomm would be profitable within a year, this time he has given no indication of a timeline for making profits from a business that has already guzzled around $30 billion. The company believes the scheme offered with the JioPhone will make money and the entire business has a set internal target for reaching profits, the senior executive said. The manufacturing of the phone will eventually be done  by the likes of Foxconn, Flextronics , working to a design and operating system produced by any in-house Reliance team, said the executive, adding that the company had been approached by foreign peers about exporting the phone. Reliance plans to start reporting performance numbers for Jio along with its quarterly results from October onwards, said another senior executive who did not wish to be named. Ambani said that Jio has more than 100 million paying customers with most of them on a 309 rupees plan.

Britain's Paysafe, which offers pre-paid cashcards and online wallets, said separately it was also planning to buy Merchants' Choice Payments Solutions for $470 million, strengthening its presence in the United States. Payments companies have become sought-after targets as more shoppers switch from cash to paying for purchases by smartphone or other mobile devices and a series of deals has driven share prices in the sector higher in recent weeks. Mastercard made the first move last year by buying Britain's Vocalink and deals have picked up in recent weeks. Danish payment services firm Nets A/S said in early July that it had been approached by potential buyers, while days later U.S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy Britain's Worldpay for 7.7 billion pounds to expand outside the United States. That has been followed by a 1.5 billion euro bid on Thursday for Stockholm-based Bambora by France's Ingenico, and, on Friday, news that private equity firm Permira had bought a stake in Sweden's Klarna. Previous Experience  Paysafe said it had been approached in early May, when its shares were trading at about 450 pence, banking sources said. Shares in Paysafe were up 7.4 percent to 582.5 pence a share at 0955 GMT, leading the gainers in Britain's mid-cap index but slightly below the 590 pence per share proposed offer price. If successful, the private equity bid would mark a return to the payments sector for CVC. It previously owned Skrill, a payments company which was bought by Optimal Payments, the AIM-listed forerunner to Paysafe.  CVC knows the space extremely well,  said a banking source, adding Paysafe had a  very positive  outlook with some strong growth fundamentals given the drive to go cashless. FILE PHOTO --  The ticker and trading information for Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4, 2016.Brendan McDermid/File Photo - RTS135C2 And that's the reason why they (CVC) are interested. They know the actors, they like the dynamics around the sector, which is underpinned by growth.  CVC and Blackstone have until Aug. 18 to make a formal offer. Lazard are lead advisors to Paysafe, while Credit Suisse is working with CVC. Old Mutual on Board Paysafe said that after turning down a number of indicative proposals, it had granted the bidders due diligence access on the basis of the 590 pence per share proposal. The deal is conditional on the buyers being able to sell off Paysafe's Asia Gateway business, with a buyer already lined up, although no further details were given. A source with knowledge of the situation said Blackstone and CVC's experience of a partnership in British group Merlin Entertainments made them a good fit. And a source familiar with CVC's thinking said that Paysafe was potentially a good buy given its current valuation and the consortium's ability to add further value. UBS analyst David Mulholland said the deal value implied a valuation of 14 times Paysafe's estimated 2018 price-to-earnings ratio and 10.4 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Old Mutual Global Investors, Paysafe's largest shareholder with a stake of about 10.3 percent in the group, has signed a non-binding letter of support for the possible offer. Paysafe said its deal for Delta Card Service Inc, the holding company for Houston-based Merchants' Choice Payment Solutions ( MCPS ), will see Paysafe add around 60,000 clients across 50 states and over $14 billion in sales volume annually. The cash deal will be part-funded by $380 million in bank loans and $90 million from existing cash funds, it added.  We would initially highlight that on first impressions the acquisition appears to make sense, (but) is not a particularly high multiple in the context of payments,  UBS's Mulholland said in a note to clients, flagging a 'buy' rating.

The U.S. International Trade Commission refused to rescind its May 4 ruling that found Arista's switches infringed two Cisco patents and banned Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States. After the ITC released that decision, a different agency, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, said the two Cisco patents are invalid.  Arista urged the ITC to rescind its import ban, saying it would be unfair because the Patent Office invalidated Cisco's patents. But the ITC said in Thursday's decision that the Patent Office rulings  do not constitute a changed circumstance such that the remedial orders should be rescinded.  Marc Taxay, senior vice president and general counsel of  Santa Clara, California-based Arista, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was  deeply disappointed  in the ruling, which he called a departure from established law.  Taxay said Arista will appeal the ruling and will also be releasing modified products to maintain the supply of its products in compliance with the ITC's decision. Cisco said in a statement on Thursday that the ITC sent a strong message that Arista's  corporate culture of copying,  as it said the ITC described it, must stop.  San Jose, California-based Cisco and Arista are fierce competitors in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches that connect computers and servers. Cisco brought multiple lawsuits against Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied Cisco's intellectual property. Arista, which was formed by former Cisco employees, has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign and trying to stifle competition. The ITC ruled last year in a separate lawsuit that Arista infringed Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. Arista redesigned its switches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in April that the company could resume importing its redesigned products.

Jio has enjoyed a meteoric rise since its launch a year ago, with its months of free services and sharply discounted plans battering the fortunes of incumbents such as Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) and Idea Cellular (IDEA.NS), who have seen revenues and profits shrink dramatically. Despite Jio's rapid rise, funded by mega-profits churned out by parent Reliance Industries' (RELI.NS) core refining and petrochemicals operations, it has been unable to tap more than 500 million non-smartphone users in India, who still rely on old feature phones to make calls and send text messages, as its network only supports 4G-enabled phones.   Reliance sees the new handset, named JioPhone, allowing it to target India's entire mobile market for the first time. The new phone will  effectively cost zero  as buyers would be able to get the device for a one-time refundable security deposit of 1,500 rupees ($23.3), said Ambani, chairman of  Reliance Industries, announcing the launch at the conglomerate's annual shareholders' meeting. The announcement, which was greeted by applause from shareholders at a packed auditorium in south Mumbai, sent shares in rivals Airtel and Idea down 2 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.  Disruptive Pricing Jio's disruptive pricing of the new phone and its online content partnerships could further weigh on the sector's already dismal earnings and put pressure on lenders' balance sheets.  Earlier this year, India's central bank warned the telecom sector's earnings had deteriorated to the point that it was untenable for telecoms players to even cover the interest costs tied to loans.   They are getting people hooked to the data with the content,  said Varun Khandelwal, managing director, Bullero Capital.  Airtel, Vodafone do not have such bandwidth to give free phones, or the kind  of content that Jio has.  Reliance shares closed up 3.7 percent, after touching a nearly nine-and-a-half-year high in trading following the meeting, where the company also announced a one-for-one bonus share issue.  Ambani said the new device would begin to hit store shelves from Aug. 15. Voice calling will be free on the JioPhone, while unlimited data packs will cost 153 rupees ($2.38) a month.   The offer is quite compelling, as the phone has a lot of compelling features,  said Nitin Soni, who covers the telecoms sector for Fitch Ratings. Jio already boasts more than 125 million users, making it the world's fastest growing tech firm, and has added customers quicker than even the likes of free services such as Facebook (FB.O) and its popular messaging service WhatsApp, said Ambani. It has propelled India to become the No. 1 data consumer worldwide, surpassing both the United States and China, he said.  My sense is that they are looking at between 150 million and 200 million subscribers within the next 12 months,  said Fitch's Soni. Export Opportunities Ambani, whose speech was frequently punctuated with loud chants of  Jio , said that the company was aiming to make 5 million JioPhones available every week after launch. The company was bracing for huge demand after the launch and expected it might run out of stock, said a senior company executive who did not wish to be named. Ambani dedicated Friday's launch to his father, Dhirubhai Ambani, who founded the company. It is the second time Ambani has upended India's telecoms sector - he did the same in 2002 with a different venture, Reliance Infocomm, launched with the advent of CDMA technology. Unlike 2002, when Ambani indicated Infocomm would be profitable within a year, this time he has given no indication of a timeline for making profits from a business that has already guzzled around $30 billion. The company believes the scheme offered with the JioPhone will make money and the entire business has a set internal target for reaching profits, the senior executive said. The manufacturing of the phone will eventually be done  by the likes of Foxconn, Flextronics , working to a design and operating system produced by any in-house Reliance team, said the executive, adding that the company had been approached by foreign peers about exporting the phone. Reliance plans to start reporting performance numbers for Jio along with its quarterly results from October onwards, said another senior executive who did not wish to be named. Ambani said that Jio has more than 100 million paying customers with most of them on a 309 rupees plan.

Several high-profile attacks have occurred recently, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks in May and a virus dubbed  NotPetya  that halted production at some companies for more than a week. Others lost millions of euros to organized crime in a scam called  CEO Fraud . Some 53 percent of companies in Germany have been victims of industrial espionage, sabotage or data theft in the last two years, Bitkom found - up from 51 percent in a 2015 study. At the same time, the damage caused rose by 8 percent to around 55 billion euros a year, the survey of 1,069 managers and people responsible for security in various sectors found. Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany's BSI federal cyber agency, said many big companies and especially those operating critical infrastructure were generally well-prepared for cyber attacks. But many smaller and medium-sized companies did not take the threat seriously enough, he said.  The high number of companies affected clearly shows that we still have work to do on cyber security in Germany,  he said in a statement on Friday. The BSI urged companies in Europe's largest economy to make information security a top priority and said all companies need to report serious IT security incidents, even if anonymously. Schoenbohm told Reuters in an interview that hardware and software makers should do their part to shore up cyber security and patch weaknesses in software more quickly once identified.  There's still a lot of work to be done,  he said.  We have to be careful that we don't focus solely on industry and computer users, but also look at the producers and quality management.  Some 62 percent of companies affected found those behind the attacks were either current or former employees. Forty-one percent blamed competitors, customers, suppliers or service providers for the attacks, Bitkom said.  Foreign intelligence agencies were found to be responsible in 3 percent of the cases, it said. Twenty-one percent believed hobby hackers were responsible while 7 percent attributed attacks to organized crime.

Tillerson shuttled between Gulf countries last week to convince them to help ease the worst regional dispute in years but left the region without any firm signs the feud would be resolved soon. Last month, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran. Qatar denies the allegations. The countries made 13 demands of Qatar - including that it shuts down a Turkish military base and the Al Jazeera pan-Arab television network - which Doha has rejected. While in the Gulf, Tillerson signed an accord with Qatar on terrorism financing in a bid to ease the crisis, but Qatar's opponents said it fell short of addressing their concerns.  They have been very aggressive in implementing that agreement, so I think we're satisfied with the effort they're putting forth,  Tillerson told reporters just before meeting with Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah at the State Department. Tillerson said Qatar was willing to sit with the four countries to discuss their demands, but that it was important to Doha  that the sovereignty and dignity of all five countries be respected in those discussions.  In a move to counter the four states' accusations, Qatar has set rules for defining terrorism, freezing funding and terrorism financing and established national terrorism lists. In one of the first positive signs from the four Arab states since they imposed the sanctions last month, the United Arab Emirates on Friday welcomed Qatar's decision to amend its anti-terrorism laws. The four states cut diplomatic, transport and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, disrupting the import of food and other items and causing foreign banks to scale back business with Qatar.  I hope the four countries will consider as a sign of good faith lifting this land blockade which is really having the most, I think, negative effects on the Qatari people,  Tillerson said.

In a move to counter their accusations of supporting terrorism, which it denies, Qatar has set rules for defining terrorism, freezing funding and terrorism financing and established national terrorism lists.  The Qatari decree to amend the anti-terrorism law is a positive step to deal seriously with the 59 terrorists,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain designated dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities.  The pressure of the crisis has started to bear fruits, and the wiser course would be changing the whole orientation,  Gargash added. Gargash also said the countries’ concerns about Qatar’s relationship with Iran had eased since Kuwait ordered the expulsion of the Iranian ambassador and 14 other diplomats for alleged links to a  spy and terror  cell on Thursday.       The four countries led a diplomatic and economic campaign to pressure and isolate the small Gulf state, which is a critical global supplier of gas and hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East.  Last week, Qatar signed an accord with the United States on working together to fight terrorism financing.

The Nordic country wants to open up northern areas for exploration to offset declining production in the south. Oil and gas production is Norway's leading industry, accounting for 20 percent of its economy. From the Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise ship, 11 campaigners launched inflatable boats carrying banners opposing Statoil's Songa Enabler oil rig, 275 km (170 miles) north of the Norwegian coast, in the Arctic Barents sea. One of the banners read  “The People Vs. Arctic Oil”.  We are doing this because the Norwegian government fails to understand what they are supposed to do according to the Paris agreement,  protest leader Sune Scheller told Reuters.  The vast majority of the oil and gas has to remain in the ground if we are going to protect our homes from the consequences of climate change,  he said before the action. Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship sails during a protest in the Barents sea, Norway, July 21, 2017. Will Rose/Greenpeace/Handout via ReutersSome 29 activists from 19 different countries, including the Philippines, South Africa, New Zealand, Bulgaria, Spain, Finland and Sweden, participated in the protest near the Songa Enabler rig that is operated by Songa Offshore. Among the protesters is Joanna Sustento, a 25-year-old writer from the Philippines, who lost relatives in the 2013 Haiyan typhoon, one of the strongest cyclones on record.

What happened to my community in Tacloban is an example of things to come for other people if we continue to focus on short-term gain,  Sustento told Reuters. On Monday, the Songa Enabler rig found a small gas deposit, which Statoil called disappointing. In its latest oil licensing round, Oslo offered a record number of blocks, brushing off concerns about the risks of drilling in the region.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/norway-oil-greenpeace-idUSL8N1K839Z"},

Tillerson shuttled between Gulf countries last week to convince them to help ease the worst regional dispute in years but left the region without any firm signs the feud would be resolved soon. Last month, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran. Qatar denies the allegations. The countries made 13 demands of Qatar - including that it shuts down a Turkish military base and the Al Jazeera pan-Arab television network - which Doha has rejected. While in the Gulf, Tillerson signed an accord with Qatar on terrorism financing in a bid to ease the crisis, but Qatar's opponents said it fell short of addressing their concerns.  They have been very aggressive in implementing that agreement, so I think we're satisfied with the effort they're putting forth,  Tillerson told reporters just before meeting with Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah at the State Department. Tillerson said Qatar was willing to sit with the four countries to discuss their demands, but that it was important to Doha  that the sovereignty and dignity of all five countries be respected in those discussions.  In a move to counter the four states' accusations, Qatar has set rules for defining terrorism, freezing funding and terrorism financing and established national terrorism lists. In one of the first positive signs from the four Arab states since they imposed the sanctions last month, the United Arab Emirates on Friday welcomed Qatar's decision to amend its anti-terrorism laws. The four states cut diplomatic, transport and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, disrupting the import of food and other items and causing foreign banks to scale back business with Qatar.  I hope the four countries will consider as a sign of good faith lifting this land blockade which is really having the most, I think, negative effects on the Qatari people,  Tillerson said.

Sixty-one MPs in the 101-member assembly approved a symbolic statement that called for Russia to withdraw troops, weapons and other military equipment from Transdniestria, which seceded from the ex-Soviet republic in 1990.  The main opposition Socialists left the chamber in protest, calling it a provocation that would worsen relations with Russia and damage efforts to achieve a lasting settlement of Transdniestria's status.  Parliament  calls upon the Russian Federation to recommence and finalize the process of withdrawing its troops..., its munitions, weapons and military equipment from the territory of the Republic of Moldova,  the statement said.  Moldovan politics is divided between a pro-Western government that has forged closer trade and diplomatic links with the European Union and Washington, and a pro-Russian president who wants to move Moldova back within Russia's orbit. The Russian-speakers of Transdniestria seceded from Moldova  one year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union amid fears that Moldova would shortly merge with neighboring Romania, whose language and culture it broadly shares. The separatist region fought a brief war with Moldova in 1992 and declared itself an independent state, but it remains unrecognized by any country, including Russia. Attempts to resolve the dispute have made little progress. A 2006 referendum in Transdniestria, which borders Ukraine but not Russia, produced a 97.2 percent vote in favor of joining Russia. Moldova has been governed by pro-Western leaders since 2009 and inked an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014. Russia retaliated by halting the import of Moldovan farm produce.  Relations between Moldova and Russia suffered further this year in a row in March over the treatment of Moldovan officials traveling to or through Russia, and the expulsion of five Russian diplomats in May. There was further tension in the run-up to Friday's vote when Moldova barred Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin from flying to Transdniestria in a military plane.

A Moscow court earlier this month sentenced Zaur Dadayev, a former soldier in Chechnya, to 20 years in jail for the murder and handed terms of between 11 and 19 years to four other men convicted of being his accomplices. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics, was murdered in 2015 as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin after dining with his girlfriend. Aged 55, he had been working on a report examining Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine. His killing sent a chill through opposition circles. Some of Nemtsov's supporters deemed the jail sentences too lenient and were unhappy the court did not make mention of their assessment that he had been killed for his political activity.   On Friday Interfax cited Olga Mikhailova, a lawyer for Zhanna Nemtsova, as saying she had asked the court to annul the sentences and return the case to prosecutors to have the crime reclassified from a contract killing to the murder of  a state or public figure.  The late politician's allies have said the investigation into his murder was a cover-up and that the people who ordered his killing remain at large.

Shares of GE fell as much as 5.4 percent to their lowest level since Oct 2015, despite the results beating estimates, as the company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500. Honeywell International reversed course after market opened and fell 0.7 percent despite the technology and manufacturing company reporting a rise in its second-quarter profit. Microsoft fell 0.5 percent, despite the company reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings. Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook . The Nasdaq notched its 10th straight record close on Thursday, marking its best streak since February 2015. The tech sector has been the best performing S&P; sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth in an otherwise low-growth environment and sectors that are relatively immune from a policy gridlock in Washington.  If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one,  said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 15 percent of S&P; 500 companies have posted results so far.  The earning season has been good so far and CEOs are also painting a good picture. A lot of people are booking profits and readjusting their positions. It's been a pretty good year so far and people are taking money off the table,  said Kinahan.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.92 points, or 0.23 percent, at 6,375.08. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the industrials index's 0.81 percent fall leading the decliners. Visa rose 1.8 percent after the world's largest payments network operator reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its annual earnings forecast. EBay fell 2 percent as the company warned that adjusted profit this quarter could fall below analysts' estimates. Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services provider, was up 1.5 percent after it reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.7 percent after its revenue came in below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,281 to 1,213.

Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) cheating on diesel emissions tests has cast a shadow over its Porsche division and the sports car brand, which first introduced diesel in its Cayenne sports utility vehicle (SUV) in 2009, is considering its options.  Of course we are looking into this issue,  CEO Blume said in an interview at the Nuerburgring motorsports complex in western Germany.  We have not made a decision on it.  Blume said Porsche would offer a mix of combustion engines, plug-in hybrid vehicles and purely battery-powered cars over the next 10-15 years and would decide at the end of the decade whether diesel had a future at Porsche. German prosecutors last month started investigating Porsche staff to see whether they were involved in designing illicit engine-control software and regulators are examining whether the Cayenne was fitted with such a device. A redesign of the Cayenne will be launched in September and it will still offer a diesel version, Blume said, just like the Panamera saloon that hit dealerships last November.  For the generations that will follow there are different scenarios,  Blume said. One scenario has Porsche backing out of diesel altogether, sources at the carmaker said. Stuttgart-based Porsche still relies on diesels, which account for about 15 percent of its global sales, to help it bring down emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) as they are more fuel-efficient than petrol engines. At luxury rival BMW (BMWG.DE), diesel cars make up 35 percent of new registrations while Audi's (NSUG.DE) European diesel sales alone account for two-thirds of deliveries. Electric Cities  FILE PHOTO - Oliver Blume, CEO of German luxury car company Porsche AG, poses before the company's annual news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, March 17, 2017.Lukas BarthBut diesel's image has been badly tarnished by the emissions scandal and revelations that some engines pump dangerously high levels of poisonous nitrogen oxides into the air, prompting many carmakers to review their strategies. To tap into growing demand for electric cars, Porsche is spending a billion euros ($1.2 billion) to overhaul its main Stuttgart plant and build its first battery-only model - the four-door Mission E saloon which is due on the market in 2019. Battery-only vehicles could account for a quarter of Porsche's sales by 2025, give or take 5 to 10 percentage points, Blume said, contradicting a media report that said up to half of its output by 2023-24 could be electric. Slideshow (6 Images)Earlier this month, Geely's GEELY.UL Volvo said all its cars launched after 2019 would be electric or hybrids, making it the first major traditional carmaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles power solely by combustion engines. Porsche and Audi, which together contribute 60 percent of VW's profits, are targeting  significant savings  in development and material costs for their electric-car programs by sharing a new production platform code-named PPE, Blume said. The new architecture will allow both brands to save money by sharing components and modules, helping Porsche with a goal of keeping its return on sales at about 15 percent a year, he said.  Further platforms are conceivable, for instance with SUVs.   Porsche sales rose 6 percent to a record 238,000 cars in 2016 and Blume said the carmaker had a guideline for increasing its sales about 5 percent per year through 2025. Counting on growing demand for high-end electric cars, Porsche may spawn another zero-emission model off the Mission E platform, for which it plans an initial capacity of about 20,000 cars at its Zuffenhausen factory, Blume said. An electrified version of the top-selling Macan SUV is also possible.  We expect the metropolises in China and Asia will switch to pure electric mobility very fast,  the CEO said.  I believe there will be few pure combustion engines to be seen in the large cities there in five years time. The development in rural areas will, however, proceed much more slowly.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), a newly-empowered court that oversees Britain's fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to proceed to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced U.S.-style  opt-out  collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was  completely unsuitable  to be brought under the collective action regime. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centered on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as Mastercard on merchants' banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers.  The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,  he said.  I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.  He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the  perfect exam question  for Britain's CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country's maiden  opt-out  class action lawsuits in antitrust cases.  Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out.  Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses who fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together. London's High Court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

So many bodies are brought in that the morgue workers struggle to identify and bury the dead fast enough to make space for the next batch that arrives with grim regularity, as the city's residents clear up after nine months of urban warfare.  The battle for Mosul is over, but the task of sorting out the dead is only just beginning.  A lot of blood has been shed,  said an employee at the morgue, who asked not to be named.  Iraq used to have two rivers: the Tigris and the Euphrates. Now we have a third: the river of blood.   The full scale of the losses may never be known. Morgue and rescue workers said they were now receiving bodies at a rate of at least 30 to 40 per day - most of them killed by air strikes that helped dislodge the militants.       Inside one of the fridges, black body bags stacked to the side contain the remains of civilians who were methodically gunned down by Islamic State snipers, behind a soft-drinks factory as they fled toward Iraqi security forces in June. A woman at the morgue had just identified one of them as her mother:  I've been searching for her body for a month and a half,  she said. What she found hardly resembled her mother, but she recognized the clothing and contents of her pocket.     All that remained of one man was a shriveled foot, brought to the morgue wrapped in a dust-clogged jacket. Relatives identified it from the sock the man wore when an air strike crushed him to death beneath his own home, a morgue worker said.  The numbers are higher than we expected,  said Dr Modhar al-Omary, the head of the morgue in east Mosul.  We keep hoping the flow will decrease, but so far it hasn't.  Retrieving the Dead Leading the effort to recover corpses decaying beneath the rubble is the Civil Defence Force.  I can't even smell it anymore,  said Lieutenant Colonel Rabia at the force's headquarters in west Mosul. Retrieving the dead is itself a potentially lethal endeavor: Last week, a member of the Civil Defence Force was killed when a bomb buried under the ruins of a home exploded as he tried to free bodies trapped there. The worker who drove the bulldozer, clearing the way for bodies to be taken out, was also wounded and has since quit, severely affecting the team's capabilities.  Adding to their woes, they have not been paid since the government suspended salaries to its employees in areas under Islamic State control nearly three years ago.   If we don't do it, who will?  said Civil Defence worker Ahmed Abdulqader, asked why he continued working without pay.  We are serving our country.  The Civil Defence Force only recovers bodies to which relatives of the deceased lead them. The rest are left in the rubble for now. Otherwise, there would be too many corpses to fit in the fridges at the morgue, and it would be harder for relatives to identify them. When an unidentified body is brought to the morgue, it is kept in the fridge for some time. If nobody claims it, the remains are photographed and buried in a numbered plot by the Mosul municipality so they can be located if someone comes searching in future. Identity  Beyond identifying and burying the hundreds killed during the battle, an even bigger challenge looms. The status of all the people who died during three years of Islamic State rule, whether from natural or unnatural causes, is ambiguous. Many of them were buried informally, or received death certificates issued by Islamic State, but the Iraqi government does not recognize those. Without an Iraqi death certificate, relatives of the deceased cannot claim compensation from the government, but to obtain one, the body must be dug up so the identity can be verified.     Yasin Abdullah's brother died in February when a car bomb parked outside the entrance to his home in west Mosul blew up. He was buried in the yard of a nearby school because it was too dangerous to make the trip to a graveyard.  The school has re-opened now, but Abdullah has yet to receive permission from the court to dig up his brother's grave.       How will I secure my brother's rights and his children's?  he asked. The authorities want to check they were not Islamic State members, for whom Iraqi authorities do not issue death certificates.  As for their bodies, they are left to rot in the sun, said Civil Defence worker Ayham Abdelhamad:  There are hungry animals around - they can eat them.

Retail sales rose by 0.6 percent in May from April to hit a record C$48.91 billion, Statistics Canada said, much greater than the 0.2 percent advance forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. Sales volumes grew by 1.1 percent.     A separate report showed Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to a 20-month low of 1.0 percent in June, well below the Bank of Canada's 2.0 percent target, although core measures showed signs of strength.                               The Bank of Canada can be expected to pursue that normalization (in rates) it started in July,  said Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins.     The central bank raised interest rates last week for the first time since 2010. Chances of a second rate hike in October climbed above 70 percent from a roughly two-thirds chance before the economic reports, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                Still, Canada's real return bonds and flat yield curve are signaling the Bank of Canada will not reach its 2 percent inflation target any time soon. That suggests the central bank is unlikely to pull off more than one more rate hike even as money markets see further tightening into 2018.                  At 9:21 a.m. ET (1321 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2556 to the greenback, or 79.64 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2546 to C$1.2607. On Thursday, it touched its strongest since early May 2016 at C$1.2541.     The loonie rose even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 0.60 percent at $46.64 a barrel.     Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 1.245 percent and the 10-year             climbing 4 Canadian cents to yield 1.878 percent.     The gap between the 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 1.1 basis points to a spread of -10.8 basis points, its narrowest since early July 2016.

The 71-year-old was sanctioned for multiple breaches of conduct rules during a Fed Cup tie between Romania and Britain in April, including making a  highly inappropriate and racially insensitive  comment about Serena Williams's unborn child. The governing body's internal adjudication panel also found him guilty of making  advances of a sexual nature  towards British team captain Anne Keothavong, and  abusive and threatening comments  to members of the British team, match officials and a member of the press. Nastase, who has been fined $10,000, will also be denied access to, and not granted accreditation for, all official ITF team competitions and tennis circuits until Dec. 31, 2018, the ITF said in a statement. Grand slam tournaments, which lie outside the ITF's jurisdiction, are not included in the sanction. Both Nastase and the Romanian Tennis Federation have 21 days to appeal the decision. There was no immediate comment from Nastase.  The ITF launched its investigation after Nastase was heard speaking in Romanian to one of his team members about Williams' unborn baby at the Fed Cup draw in Constanta in April.  Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?  the former French Open and U.S. Open champion was quoted as saying. Williams, who had confirmed her pregnancy through a spokeswoman a few days earlier, is engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who is white. Nastase's comment was widely reported in the media, and he was booted out of Romania's Fed Cup tie against Britain the following day for aiming abuse at the umpire, British player Johanna Konta and Keothavong.

The software updates will cost under 2 billion euros ($2.33 billion) for cars in Germany, with the auto industry agreeing to shoulder the expense of about 100 euros per car, the sources said.  Diesel-engine cars from all domestic and foreign car brands equipped with engines designed to meet Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards, will be updated, the sources said. The plan is set to be presented at the beginning of August.  With the software updates, the auto industry is able to cut nitrogen oxide pollution by about 20 percent, the sources said.

The franc has lost 40 percent of its value in the past year, with a particularly sharp decline over the past week, amid political turmoil and persistently low prices for Congo's key commodity exports. Inflation is expected to top 30 percent this year, but wages remain unchanged.

It was not immediately clear how many workers would answer the call. In a statement, Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala's office said he planned to sign a decree raising salaries once the measure was approved by the full cabinet and the president. Congo's deepening economic woes are compounding political and security crises related to President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December after 16 years in power. Police fired teargas on Friday at dozens of students at Kinshasa University protesting against the arrest of a classmate, witnesses told Reuters. The university was at the epicenter of anti-Kabila protests last year that killed dozens.  Right now students are demonstrating on the campus. They ransacked the administrative building,  said one university administrator, who gave only his first name, Albert. Opposition leader Martin Fayulu said on Twitter that authorities had stopped the main opposition bloc holding a convention where it was expected to announce protests against repeated delays to an election to replace Kabila. There was no immediate comment on that from police. Africa's top copper producer depends on its oil and mining sectors for about 95 percent of export revenues. It now only has enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports, the Central Bank has said. The government has requested financial support from the International Monetary Fund and other donors to help it restore its reserves and stabilize the franc. But the IMF said any assistance would likely require measures to address the current political impasse.

Shares were down 10 percent by 1226 GMT after earlier touching their lowest since February 2016 at 242 pence.  Since the ban was imposed in March the London-listed Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), has nearly halved in value and is burning $10 million to 15 million of cash a month.  We expect that following the negotiations ... there will be a resolution and we will achieve positive cash flow in the second half and, when that occurs, we would expect to announce a dividend in February,  CEO Brad Gordon told Reuters. The Tanzanian government agreed to hold talks over the ban with Barrick but those negotiations have not yet begun.  Acacia and Tanzania are also at loggerheads over allegations of tax evasion and the government is reviewing all existing mining licenses. Acacia, which is Tanzania's largest miner, suspended its dividend for the first time. In February, it raised its payout by nearly 150 percent for the previous financial year to 10.4 cents. Due to the ban, full-year production is now expected to fall to the lower end of a previous guidance of 850,000 to 900,000 ounces of gold. Acacia's Bulyanhulu mine is the most effected by the export ban because of its size and higher running costs. Buzwagi mine is nearing the end of its life. In the first half of the year, total production rose 4 percent to 428,203 tonnes compared to a year ago as the company mostly stockpiled its ore despite the ban. Acacia said it could temporarily close the Bulyanhulu mine for an upfront cost of $30 million should the ban persist.   Given the scale of the cash outflows at Bulyanhulu we do not believe that this situation is sustainable at that operation beyond the end of the current quarter,  the company said. First-half output at Bulyanhulu fell 22 percent to 122,084 ounces. Total 2017 production is expected to fall about 10 percent. The firm's cash balance has fallen 80 percent to $176 million since March and 30 percent on the previous year. Acacia kept costs down by deferring payments and non-essentials, cutting them by 5 percent in the first six months of the year.  Under the circumstances, Acacia has produced a sound operating performance with production in-line and costs,  JP Morgan said in a note.  However, the investment case continues to be clouded by the concentrate export impasse in Tanzania, where negotiations are yet to commence and in which Acacia will take no direct part.  Highlighting Acacia's challenges in Tanzania, two sources told Reuters that two of the firm's senior local employees were detained and questioned at an airport this week. Acacia said it was having trouble renewing work permits for foreign staff.

Police fired teargas on Friday at dozens of students at Kinshasa University protesting against the arrest of a classmate, witnesses told Reuters. The university was at the epicenter of anti-Kabila protests last year that killed dozens.  Right now students are demonstrating on the campus. They ransacked the administrative building,  said one university administrator, who gave only his first name, Albert. Opposition leader Martin Fayulu said on Twitter that authorities had stopped the main opposition bloc holding a convention where it was expected to announce protests against repeated delays to an election to replace Kabila. There was no immediate comment on that from police. Africa's top copper producer depends on its oil and mining sectors for about 95 percent of export revenues. It now only has enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports, the Central Bank has said. The government has requested financial support from the International Monetary Fund and other donors to help it restore its reserves and stabilize the franc. But the IMF said any assistance would likely require measures to address the current political impasse.

Shares were down 10 percent by 1226 GMT after earlier touching their lowest since February 2016 at 242 pence.  Since the ban was imposed in March the London-listed Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), has nearly halved in value and is burning $10 million to 15 million of cash a month.  We expect that following the negotiations ... there will be a resolution and we will achieve positive cash flow in the second half and, when that occurs, we would expect to announce a dividend in February,  CEO Brad Gordon told Reuters. The Tanzanian government agreed to hold talks over the ban with Barrick but those negotiations have not yet begun.  Acacia and Tanzania are also at loggerheads over allegations of tax evasion and the government is reviewing all existing mining licenses. Acacia, which is Tanzania's largest miner, suspended its dividend for the first time. In February, it raised its payout by nearly 150 percent for the previous financial year to 10.4 cents. Due to the ban, full-year production is now expected to fall to the lower end of a previous guidance of 850,000 to 900,000 ounces of gold. Acacia's Bulyanhulu mine is the most effected by the export ban because of its size and higher running costs. Buzwagi mine is nearing the end of its life. In the first half of the year, total production rose 4 percent to 428,203 tonnes compared to a year ago as the company mostly stockpiled its ore despite the ban. Acacia said it could temporarily close the Bulyanhulu mine for an upfront cost of $30 million should the ban persist.   Given the scale of the cash outflows at Bulyanhulu we do not believe that this situation is sustainable at that operation beyond the end of the current quarter,  the company said. First-half output at Bulyanhulu fell 22 percent to 122,084 ounces. Total 2017 production is expected to fall about 10 percent. The firm's cash balance has fallen 80 percent to $176 million since March and 30 percent on the previous year. Acacia kept costs down by deferring payments and non-essentials, cutting them by 5 percent in the first six months of the year.  Under the circumstances, Acacia has produced a sound operating performance with production in-line and costs,  JP Morgan said in a note.  However, the investment case continues to be clouded by the concentrate export impasse in Tanzania, where negotiations are yet to commence and in which Acacia will take no direct part.  Highlighting Acacia's challenges in Tanzania, two sources told Reuters that two of the firm's senior local employees were detained and questioned at an airport this week. Acacia said it was having trouble renewing work permits for foreign staff.

Fitch has also assigned a final rating of 'BB'/'RR2' to Banijay's issue of senior secured debt for refinancing. Banijay has an experienced management team that has maintained cost discipline during the expansion of non-scripted content. Non-scripted content is exposed to shifts in consumer sentiment, but Banijay has demonstrated an ability to adapt to these trends, including through customer diversification, with success in renewing shows for multiple seasons and in syndicating them to multiple countries. The rating is constrained by the company's high leverage, more limited size than peers, and the low monetisation of the company's back catalogue through Banijay Rights. If Banijay continues to attract talented producers that understand the local market and to expand its geographic reach, its ratings will benefit. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Independent TV Producer: Banijay is the fourth-largest producer of TV content and the largest independent producer globally. The success of scripted dramas such as  Versailles  and the rapid growth of over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix is leading to additional content demand across the industry. However, the cost of production and the length of development mean there is limited ability to produce new scripted content, whereas Banijay's focus on non-scripted content means it can be produced and delivered quickly. Greater Scale and Diversification: The recent acquisition of Zodiak has expanded the production of scripted shows.  Including the pending Castaway transaction, scale has improved significantly, with revenue and EBITDA more than doubling. The mergers have also enhanced Banijay's library in scripted and non-scripted content and added greater geographical diversification.  Banijay plans to increase scripted content to up to 20% of sales over the medium term.  This has the potential to increase the need for working capital as a scripted show can take up to two years to produce and some offsets, such as tax credits, are only received at the end of production. Consistent FCF Generation despite Earn-Outs: Banijay's business is free cash flow (FCF)-positive; capex is low due to a asset-light operating model. Fitch expects funds from operations (FFO) margins to fall to around 7% through 2019 from above 9% in 2016, due to higher interest expense following the refinancing. We forecast consistently positive FCF, which will be used to finance over EUR100 million in earn-out payments in 2017 and 2018, but we expect cash balances to grow thereafter. Renewals Mitigate Business Cycle Risk: The risk of shows not being renewed and the potential for decreased demand among broadcast networks or OTTs due to the business cycle is mitigated by the success Banijay has had in renewing its existing shows and distributing them in additional geographies. The development of Banijay Rights after the Zodiak acquisition should improve the company's ability to monetise its back catalogue and further enhance revenue visibility. Above-Average Recoveries: Fitch uses a bespoke recovery approach for credits whose IDR is 'B+' or below. For Banijay, Fitch uses a going-concern approach where it assumes post-restructuring EBITDA is 25% below its 2017 forecast EBITDA, a 5.5x distressed multiple, and 10% of going-concern enterprise value (EV) is deducted for administrative claims.  Fitch also assumes that the company's revolving credit facility (RCF), term loan and senior secured note are pari passu and that the RCF would be fully drawn upon default. Fitch therefore assigns a Recovery Rating of 'RR2' to the senior secured debt with recoveries between 70% and 90%. DERIVATION SUMMARY Banijay is the leading independent TV production studio and the fourth-largest globally. Its primary competitors are EndemolShine Group, ITV Studios, FremantleMedia and All3Media.  It has a greater proportion of unscripted content than its peers, although the acquisition of Zodiak increases its exposure to scripted content. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth trending towards 6% in 2019; - EBITDA margin stable at 11.5%; - Increased demand for working capital due to the shift towards producing scripted content; - Over EUR100 million in payments for earn-outs and put options between 2017 and 2019. KEY RECOVERY RATING ASSUMPTIONS In addition to the recovery assumptions described above, Fitch considered the following factors in its recovery analysis. - The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganisation EBITDA level upon which we base the valuation of the company.  The going-concern EBITDA is 25% below forecast 2017 EBITDA to reflect the industry's move from top of the cycle conditions to mid-cycle conditions and intensifying competitive dynamics.  This discount reflects the loss of several large shows and a decline in demand for scripted and non-scripted content. - An EV multiple of 5.5x is used to calculate a post-reorganisation valuation. The estimate considered the EV multiple of Fitch rated peers at 5.5x and current EV multiples of public companies similar to Banijay trading at the 8x-12x range, with the industry considered at the peak of the cycle. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -FFO-adjusted net leverage trending below 4x. -FFO fixed charge coverage above 3.5x. -Increased scale with sales above EUR1 billion, improved mix between non-scripted and scripted content and further development of the digital strategy. -Successful development of the Banijay Rights business and expansion into additional geographies. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -FFO-adjusted net leverage trending above 5x. -FFO fixed charge coverage below 3x. -Inability to turn around the businesses in Spain and Germany. -Failure to renew leading shows and delays in the development of the digital strategy. LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: Banijay has comfortable liquidity, with EUR73 million in cash on balance sheet for 2016, consistently positive FCF, a EUR35 million RCF once the refinancing is completed and modest working-capital swings.  Fitch believes that the transition to a greater proportion of scripted content will increase working capital requirements, but Banijay's liquidity is sufficient to meet those needs.

In a move to counter their accusations of supporting terrorism, which it denies, Qatar has set rules for defining terrorism, freezing funding and terrorism financing and established national terrorism lists.  The Qatari decree to amend the anti-terrorism law is a positive step to deal seriously with the 59 terrorists,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain designated dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities.  The pressure of the crisis has started to bear fruits, and the wiser course would be changing the whole orientation,  Gargash added. Gargash also said the countries’ concerns about Qatar’s relationship with Iran had eased since Kuwait ordered the expulsion of the Iranian ambassador and 14 other diplomats for alleged links to a  spy and terror  cell on Thursday.       The four countries led a diplomatic and economic campaign to pressure and isolate the small Gulf state, which is a critical global supplier of gas and hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East.  Last week, Qatar signed an accord with the United States on working together to fight terrorism financing. Details have not been released but sources said it provides for the United States to post officials at Qatar's state prosecutor's office.

Sales rose by 0.6 percent from April to hit a record C$48.91 billion ($38.82 billion), Statistics Canada said on Friday. The increase was much greater than the 0.2 percent advance forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. The central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, citing the need to look through soft inflation. It also vowed to wait for more economic data before committing to its next move. Separately, Statscan said the annual inflation rate slowed to a 20-month low of 1.0 percent in June, well below the Bank of Canada's 2.0 percent target, although core measures showed signs of strength.  The Bank of Canada hiked rates based on the outlook for growth ... and in my view the numbers today really speak to that principle,  said Jimmy Jean, a senior economist at Desjardins, citing the retail data and the strength in core inflation.  I think the Bank of Canada will be very satisfied with these numbers ... It keeps very alive and well the likelihood of a hike in October.  The bank is expected to lift rates again in October as it charts a course of gradual tightening, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers. The Canadian dollar strengthened on the data, rising to C$1.2566 to the greenback, or 79.58 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2595, or 75.40 U.S. cents. May's advance in retail trade was largely driven by a 2.4 percent increase in sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers. The overall inflation rate - which matched the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll - was the lowest since the 1.0 percent recorded in October 2015. Gas prices fell 1.4 percent in the 12 months to June after increasing by 6.8 percent on an annual basis in May. Two of the three measures of core inflation the Bank of Canada introduced last year posted gains. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, edged up to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, rose to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, stayed at 1.2 percent.

At a White House event, Trump said the effort will create nearly 1,000 jobs at facilities in New York and New Jersey and at a soon-to-be-determined site in the southeastern United States. The deal could eventually result in a total investment of $4 billion and create around 4,000 jobs, Trump said, joined by the CEOs of Corning, Merck and Pfizer. The commitments were made as part of Trump's  Made in America  week, during which he has showcased American-made products and made an impassioned defense of his  America First  policies. Corning said it developed the new type of glass in collaboration with the drugmakers.  This initiative will bring a key industry to our shores that for too long has been dominated by foreign countries. We’re moving more and more companies back into the United States,  Trump said. After the remarks, Trump tested the strength of the new Corning Valor Vial. Pressing down on an old vial in a vise-like machine, he easily broke it but struggled to break one of the new vials despite putting far greater effort into it.

ACS confirmed it was considering making an offer for Spain's Abertis after Italian infrastructure group Atlantia (ATL.MI), controlled by the Benetton family, bid more than 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion) in May.  Atlantia had offered 16.50 euros per share, looking to create the world's biggest toll road company.  One of the sources also said that the deal, which was not seen as imminent, is likely to involve ACS taking a leading position in Abertis and one or several funds being part of the equity structure.  Negotiations with funds from Australia and Canada, including sovereign funds, are ongoing, although no agreement has been reached yet,  the source said on condition of anonymity. Related CoverageSpain government says following Abertis takeover news very closelyIn its statement to Spain's market regulator on Friday, ACS said it had not yet decided whether to bid for Abertis, which it was studying with external advisers. Key Capital Partners, Lazard and JP Morgan are the company's advisers on the potential deal, the source said. ACS and Lazard declined to comment, while representatives of JP Morgan and Key Capital Partners were not immediately available to comment. Expansion newspaper reported that ACS had been working on its own offer for weeks and could use its German subsidiary Hochtief (HOTG.DE) to launch the counter-bid. One of the sources said it was too early to say if Hochtief would be part of the deal and there had been no discussions with the German subsidiary. Analysts said that the most likely scenario now is for Atlantia to improve its offer price because the bid undervalues Abertis. ACS's counter-bid makes strategic sense, they said, because Abertis is a low-risk asset that would complement its own operations. The market regulator is still looking at whether to approve Atlantia's bid -- a process that usually takes two or three months -- and the Spanish government can block the transaction if it does not fit with Spain's strategic interests. The Spanish government is following developments very closely, government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said on Friday. Atlantia said in a June prospectus that it could consider making a full cash offer for Abertis instead of the initial proposal for a cash-and-shares deal with at least 10 percent of Abertis shareholders taking payment in shares.  News of ACS's possible bid sent its shares down more than 5 percent to the bottom of Spain's blue-chip IBEX index .IBEX. Atlantia shares fell 1.8 percent, while Abertis was up 1.4 percent at 16.70 euros. A Hochtief spokesman declined to comment on Expansion's report and said it was a matter for ACS, which owns 72 percent of the business.

(Reuters) - O.J. Simpson was granted parole on Thursday and will be released from a Nevada prison in October, following an emotional hearing that centered on the botched armed robbery of his own mementos at a Las Vegas hotel that landed him behind bars for nine years. A four-member panel of the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners voted unanimously to release the 70-year-old former National Football League star turned TV pitchman and actor, now best remembered as the defendant in a sensational double-murder trial that gripped America two decades ago. Simpson participated by video feed from Lovelock Correctional Center, about 100 miles (160 km) from the parole board's offices in Carson City, sitting at a wooden table next to his attorney dressed in a prison-issue denim shirt and dark pants. A smiling Simpson, with close-cropped gray hair and looking thinner than at his last parole hearing in 2013, testified along with his daughter and one of the victims in the 2007 heist. He offered a rambling account of the robbery, at times striking a defensive tone and at others sounding apologetic.  A board spokesman said that Nevada law does not require an expression of remorse as a criteria for winning parole, though he said it could be noted as a mitigating factor. Simpson bowed his head and appeared to be in tears as the board  voted unanimously to grant him parole, then stood and thanked the commissioners repeatedly, hands clasped. Related CoverageSoon out of prison, O.J. Simpson still handcuffed by financial claims I've done my time, I've done it as well and respectfully as anyone can,  Simpson said during the hearing.  None of this would have happened if I'd had better judgment.  Among reasons the commissioners gave for granting parole once Simpson completed the minimum of his nine-to-33-year sentence on Oct. 1 was his compliance with prison rules, a lack of prior criminal convictions and his minimal safety risk to the public.  He Made a Mistake  Despite previous murder charges against Simpson, commissioners did not challenge his assertion that he had spent a largely conflict-free life and had always been  pretty good to people.  O.J. Simpson reacts during his parole hearing at Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada, U.S., July 20, 2017.Jason Bean/PoolSimpson, known during his football career as the  Juice , said he was ready to spend time with his children and friends and could handle the public attention he would get. “I’m not a guy that has conflicts in the street, I don’t expect to have any when I leave here” he told the commissioners. Simpson's adult daughter, Arnelle, told the hearing that his incarceration had been hard on her family. Slideshow (8 Images) No one really knows how much we have been through, this ordeal the last nine years,  she said.  He's like my best friend and like my rock.  Bruce Fromong, one of the sports memorabilia dealers Simpson was convicted of robbing, said he had long ago forgiven the man he called a close friend.  This is a good man. He made mistake. But if he called me  tomorrow and said, 'Bruce I'm getting out, will you pick me up?' Juice, I'll be here tomorrow for you.  The second robbery victim was Alfred Beardsley, who according to Simpson’s lawyer made amends with Simpson years before his death in 2015. Simpson hopes to move to Florida, where he has friends and family, when he is released, a plan that must first be approved by probation authorities there.    I could easily stay in Nevada, but I don’t think you guys want me here,” Simpson said to laughter during the hearing. The board's chairwoman, Connie Bisbee, replied:  No comment.  The commissioners said they did not take into consideration the notoriety still surrounding Simpson's 1995 acquittal from charges he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and a civil court decision that found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages. Simpson will probably be transferred in the final weeks of his incarceration to one of two other Nevada prisons used to accommodate soon-to-be-released inmates because of their proximity to airports and other public transportation, Corrections Department Warden Isidro Baca said.

In an interview with Reuters, Nihat Zeybekci also denied reports that Turkey gave Berlin a list of companies it was targeting for suspected links to last year's coup attempt.  All German investments in Turkey are 100 percent under the guarantee of the Turkish government, the state and law,  Zeybekci said in the interview in Ankara late on Thursday.  The Turkey-Germany crisis is temporary. One must refrain from words that would cause lasting harm to the economies. Germany must reassess comments that are inappropriate.  Germany on Thursday told its citizens to exercise caution if traveling to Turkey and threatened measures that could hinder German investment there, as its impatience grew with Ankara after the detention of rights activists. Turkey this month detained several human rights activists, including a German and the local head of rights group Amnesty International, as part of the widespread crackdown that followed last year's failed coup. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said that Berlin's policies towards Turkey should go in a  new direction  and said he could not advise companies to invest in a country without legal certainty. More than 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service, military and private sector in the purges that followed last year's attempted putsch. More than 50,000 people have been jailed. Rights groups and some Western governments say Erdogan is using the crackdown as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the measures are necessary given the gravity of the security threat it faces. 'Fake News' The Die Zeit newspaper reported this week that Turkish authorities had several weeks ago handed Berlin a list of 68 German companies, including Daimler and BASF that they accused of having links to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating last July's failed coup.  The allegation that Turkish authorities gave Germany the names of German companies linked to Gulen is not true. This is fake news,  Zeybekci said. Germany was Turkey's top export destination in 2016, buying $14 billion worth of Turkish goods, according to IMF data. It was also the second biggest source of Turkish imports, at $21.5 billion. Only China, at $25.4 billion, exported more to Turkey. Zeybekci said Germany's behavior in cautioning its citizens over travel to Turkey was  unfortunate , but he did not see harm accruing to tourism. So far this year, bookings from Germany have accounted for some 10 percent of Turkey's tourists. Last year, the number of foreign visitors to Turkey fell to 30 percent amid a spate of bombings by Kurdish and Islamist militants, the lowest in nine years. The travel sector contributes about $30 billion to the economy in a normal year.

Several high-profile attacks have occurred recently, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks in May and a virus dubbed  NotPetya  that halted production at some companies for more than a week. Others lost millions of euros to organised crime in a scam called  CEO Fraud . Some 53 percent of companies in Germany have been victims of industrial espionage, sabotage or data theft in the last two years, Bitkom found - up from 51 percent in a 2015 study. At the same time, the damage caused rose by 8 percent to around 55 billion euros a year, the survey of 1,069 managers and people responsible for security in various sectors found. Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany's BSI federal cyber agency, said many big companies and especially those operating critical infrastructure were generally well-prepared for cyber attacks. But many smaller and medium-sized companies did not take the threat seriously enough, he said.  The high number of companies affected clearly shows that we still have work to do on cyber security in Germany,  he said in a statement on Friday. The BSI urged companies in Europe's largest economy to make information security a top priority and said all companies need to report serious IT security incidents, even if anonymously. Some 62 percent of companies affected found those behind the attacks were either current or former employees. Forty-one percent blamed competitors, customers, suppliers or service providers for the attacks, Bitkom said. Foreign intelligence agencies were identified in 3 percent of the cases, it said. Twenty-one percent believed hobby hackers were responsible while 7 percent attributed attacks to organised crime.

The U.S. International Trade Commission refused to rescind its May 4 ruling that found Arista's switches infringed two Cisco patents and banned Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States. After the ITC released that decision, a different agency, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, said the two Cisco patents are invalid.  Arista urged the ITC to rescind its import ban, saying it would be unfair because the Patent Office invalidated Cisco's patents. But the ITC said in Thursday's decision that the Patent Office rulings  do not constitute a changed circumstance such that the remedial orders should be rescinded.  Marc Taxay, senior vice president and general counsel of  Santa Clara, California-based Arista, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was  deeply disappointed  in the ruling, which he called a departure from established law.  Taxay said Arista will appeal the ruling and will also be releasing modified products to maintain the supply of its products in compliance with the ITC's decision. Cisco said in a statement on Thursday that the ITC sent a strong message that Arista's  corporate culture of copying,  as it said the ITC described it, must stop.  San Jose, California-based Cisco and Arista are fierce competitors in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches that connect computers and servers. Cisco brought multiple lawsuits against Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied Cisco's intellectual property. Arista, which was formed by former Cisco employees, has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign and trying to stifle competition. The ITC ruled last year in a separate lawsuit that Arista infringed Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. Arista redesigned its switches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in April that the company could resume importing its redesigned products.

Shares of GE fell 3 percent in premarket trading after the company results beat estimates but posted a nearly 60 percent decline in profit. Honeywell International edged up 0.1 percent after the technology and manufacturing company reported a rise in its second-quarter profit. Microsoft fell 0.8 percent, a day after the company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook . The Nasdaq notched its 10th straight record close on Thursday, marking its best streak since February 2015. The tech sector has been the best performing S&P; sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth in an otherwise low-growth environment and sectors that are relatively immune from a policy gridlock in Washington.  If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one,  said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Stocks ended little changed on Wall Street on Thursday as a deal between Sears and Amazon weighed on home improvement retailers, along with weak earnings. Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 15 percent of S&P; 500 companies have posted results so far.  The earning season has been good so far and CEOs are also painting a good picture. A lot of people are booking profits and readjusting their positions. It's been a pretty good year so far and people are taking money off the table,  said Kinahan. Dow e-minis were down 27 points, or 0.13 percent, with 15,598 contracts changing hands at 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were down 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent, with 118,646 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 13 points, or 0.22 percent, on volume of 24,089 contracts. Visa rose 0.8 percent after the world's largest payments network operator reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its annual earnings forecast. EBay fell 4 percent as the company warned that adjusted profit this quarter could fall below analysts' estimates. Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services provider, was up 1.5 percent after it reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Colgate-Palmolive fell 2.2 percent after its revenue came in below estimates. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL3N1KC416"},

Despite her non-pharmaceutical background in consumer brands, Emma Walmsley sees improving drug research productivity as her top priority, and she wants Britain's biggest drugmaker to have fewer but potentially more lucrative new medicine launches in future. That means axing or licensing out some experimental drugs in non-core therapy areas, while boosting investment - as well as potential early-stage acquisitions - in the most promising fields, according to company insiders. Even after recent expansion of GSK's vaccines and consumer health units, pharmaceuticals still account for nearly 70 percent of group operating profits. Yet while GSK now has leading positions in vaccines and consumer health, it has a lackluster record in prescription medicines and has not come up with the kind of multibillion-dollar products launched by big pharma rivals in recent years. Walmsley will flesh out her plans for overhauling drug research when she presents second quarter results on July 26. She has already flagged her readiness to scrap products not generating sufficient value with plans to sell off malted drink Horlicks in Britain and MaxiNutrition, while considering the disposal of older antibiotics. Describing the approach after presenting her first set of results in April, she said:  We will need to be switching off some areas.  The goal is to sharpen what is currently one of the more diverse drug pipelines in the pharmaceuticals industry, spread across a wide range of therapy areas. In some fields, like respiratory and HIV medicine, GSK has a clear leading position. But it lags in others such as cardiovascular, rare diseases and diabetes, and some investors worry it has been spreading its R&D; budget too thinly. FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoThe result can be sub-optimal product launches, such as Tanzeum for type 2 diabetes, which has generated disappointing sales after GSK launched the injection behind rival medicines from Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L). Others, like a novel pill for heart disease, have flopped in tests even before getting to market, while its lupus drug Benlysta has failed to hit initial blockbuster sales forecasts, despite GSK spending $3 billion to buy the firm that invented it. Following Astrazeneca? In prioritizing areas where GSK has deep scientific and market expertise, Walmsley wants the R&D; and commercial departments at GSK to work together much more closely in future. In some ways, GSK looks set to follow in the footsteps of its smaller British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which has divested a large number of non-core drug projects recently as it concentrates on core areas like cancer. Significantly, former AstraZeneca executive Luke Miels will be a key lieutenant for Walmsley during the shake-up. He will join GSK in September, several months later than planned due to a legal tussle with his former employer.  Analysts and investors have welcomed the idea of rationalizing GSK's R&D;, but caution it will be a long haul.  It’s a company which has struggled to do what you would hope a pharmaceutical company would do, which is do the R&D; and successfully get the products through,  said Insight Investment fund manager Tim Rees. Rees said an R&D; revamp made sense but it would take 5-7 years to yield results. Fortunately, Walmsley has a window to make the changes. GSK is not expecting its next wave of new drugs until after 2020 and also has no significant patent expiries, barring the imminent loss of protection on lung drug Advair, until 2026.

In a move to counter their accusations of supporting terrorism, which it denies, Qatar has set rules for defining terrorism, acts of terrorism, freezing funding and terrorism financing. It has also established national terrorism lists with rules for listing individuals and groups.  The Qatari decree to amend the anti-terroism law is a positive step to deal seriously with the 59 terrorists,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain designated dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities.  The pressure of the crisis has started to bear fruits, and the wiser course would be changing the whole orientation,  Gargash added. The four countries led a diplomatic and economic campaign to pressure and isolate the small Gulf state, which is a critical global supplier of gas and hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. Last week, Qatar signed an accord with the United States on working together to fight terrorism financing. Details have not been released but sources said it provides for the United States to post officials at Qatar's state prosecutor's office.

The supporters of the Identitarian movement, which says it wants to preserve Europe's identity, have rented a ship to take them to international waters off the Libyan coast so they can monitor humanitarian rescuers, who they say collude with people smugglers who cram migrants onto dangerous boats.  There is a difference between saving lives and smuggling people to Europe,  Martin Sellner, an Austrian who is leading the effort, told Reuters at Catania's port.   What they are doing in fact is making millions of dollars for human trafficking rings,  he said. The activists, who are all in their 20s and early to mid-30s, will stay at sea about 10 days, but may renew the mission if it is successful, Sellner said. Charity groups operating rescue ships are concerned that the activists will try to disrupt them and put lives at risk.  The mission, which critics call a publicity stunt, is the latest in a series of accusations and media attacks against the non-governmental rescuers. In carefully choreographed videos posted on YouTube, the Identitarian message sounds much like that of Europe's far-right politicians, but Sellner characterizes the group as a  patriotic NGO  that is the  avant-garde of this patriotic shift in mainstream politics in Europe . The group is tapping into growing unease, especially in Italy, about immigration from North Africa that has brought more than a half a million impoverished migrants and refugees to Europe in less than four years. In that time, more than 13,000 have died trying to make the crossing. Next week the nine NGOs operating rescue missions are to meet with the Italian government, which wants them to sign a  code of conduct , capping months of controversy. The charities have repeatedly denied any ties to smugglers.  As a humanitarian organization, our biggest concern is the women, children and men that we rescue from unseaworthy boats,  a spokeswoman for SOS Mediterranee, which operates the Aquarius rescue ship, told Reuters.  Any attempt of interference would endanger the lives of people in need of protection.    Vigilantes  Former European Commissioner Emma Bonino talks with Reuters during an interview in Rome, Italy, July 20, 2017.Max RossiSo far this year sea migrant arrivals are approaching 100,000, 13 percent higher than last year, and some 200,000 asylum seekers are living in state-funded shelters.  I'm starting to have serious difficulties,  Catania's mayor, Enzo Bianco, told Reuters. The city's port took in 10,000 migrants during the first half of the year. An Ixe poll on Friday said 78 percent of Italians thought they had been abandoned by their European Union allies. But Bianco, a member of the ruling center-left Democratic Party, said he will seek to keep the C-Star, the ship rented by the Identitarians, from entering the city's port and  pouring fuel on the fire . Slideshow (4 Images) They are like vigilantes, people who take the law into their own hands without having any authority... the situation is too tense to be turned into the Wild West,  he said. The Identitarians are young and media savvy, quick to post their protests -- like when they hung a banner reading  secure borders, secure future  on the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin -- to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.  North American conservative YouTube pundits Lauren Southern and Brittany Pettibone are also supposed to go on their sea mission, but no mainstream news outlets will be on board.  To raise money for the operation, the Identitarians launched a website in May and have gathered some $170,000, enough to rent the 40-metre (yard) C-Star, which has been repeatedly delayed on its trip from its home port of Djibouti.  This massive immigration is changing the face of our streets, of our cities, and soon the people who have been living here for thousands of years will be an endangered minority,  Sellner said earlier this month when he announced the sea mission. Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister who is calling on Italy's government to come up with better integration policies, said the Identitarians are trying to capitalize on increasing discomfort among Italians. Poor migrants  sleep in the rail station or in the street or they cannot work, so people see them doing nothing. This is what makes people uneasy,  she said in an interview in her Rome home. Italians  would like this problem to be managed in a more human and regular way,  she said.

North America's oldest company, HBC is under pressure from activist investor Jonathan Litt, who disclosed a 4.3 percent stake in the company in June, to get cash from its real estate assets or take action to boost income from them. Initial public offerings of two joint ventures with billions of dollars in U.S., European, and Canadian real estate are  unlikely at this point  because market conditions are poor, RioCan founder and Chief Executive Edward Sonshine said in an interview in his Toronto office. The retailer formed those ventures in February 2015, one with RioCan, among North America's largest retail REITs, and another with U.S.-based Simon Property Group Inc. It said at the time the combined value was C$3.8 billion ($3 billion). The Simon joint venture, HBS Global Properties, has since added investors and European properties. Hudson's Bay spokesman Andrew Blecher declined to comment. But he noted that Hudson's Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker said in a June 9 earnings conference call that the opportunity to do an IPO was still available, but that conditions had grown tougher in the past six months. Sonshine, a former real estate lawyer whose firm owns 12 percent of the Canadian real estate venture, said an IPO was not realistic.  The prevailing narrative is that retail is dead,  said Sonshine, who believes otherwise.  When the market says that's the prevailing narrative, you can't fight it.  Sonshine said Baker had many other options to get cash from HBC's properties, including sale-leasebacks, financing or subleasing.  It shouldn't be hard because it's great real estate.  Litt had called on HBC's board to consider options including repurposing its real estate, shuttering stores, or taking the company private. HBC said it set up the ventures to pave the way for an IPO or alternative transaction to generate income from their holdings, which include prime real estate in Canada and the United States. RioCan, founded in 1993, focuses on major urban markets and has been reducing holdings in low-growth markets and diversifying its tenants. $1 = 1.2590 Canadian dollars Reporting by Solarina Ho; Editing by Jim Finkle and Richard Chang","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hudsons-bay-riocan-reit-ipo-idUSL1N1KC0DE"},

Tucked away in Reuters latest quarterly economic poll series is a projection that growth rates in nearly all of the world's largest economies will fall over the next two years. Inflation, meanwhile, will remain benign and in some cases below target. Both findings would suggest that the current caution of central bankers is warranted. As the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi said in the past week:  We aren't there yet.  The Reuters polls of economists around the world -- looking at 46 economies -- have been prescient in past years.  If they prove right again, it means the United States, euro zone, Japan, Germany, France and China will all grow more slowly in 2019 than at present. Britain will be growing at this year's rate -- but only after a 2018 Brexit-related hammering. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, reckons the projected growth slowdown is a natural maturing of the economic cycle, exacerbated by the gradual tightening of monetary policy measures adopted following the financial crisis.  Consumers are getting to the point now when debt levels are starting to rise, and with central banks increasingly moving in the direction ... of tightening, then that could start to act as a brake on economic activity,  he said. There will be growth. But it will be fairly humdrum. Consider the euro zone, currently running at a projected 1.9 percent growth rate. That will drop to 1.5 percent in 2019, according to the economists.  Japan will see its 1.4 percent growth rate today halve to 0.7 percent. The U.S. economy will be down slightly, to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent, way below the historical trend of above 3 percent. Did You Feel It? It may come as a surprise to the average person in many of these economies that the growth cycle is maturing. In many cases it has been a very mild rebound from the Great Recession triggered by the financial crisis a decade ago. FILE PHOTO: Painted wheelbarrow buckets arrive at the end of the assembly line at the AMES Companies factory, the largest wheelbarrow factory in the world, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S. on June 29, 2017.Tim Aepp/File PhotoAs Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC, noted this month:  Economic records are there to be broken. The U.S. is on the cusp of breaking two simultaneously. Within weeks, the U.S. may have delivered both the longest and the weakest economic upswing in post-war history.  The new normal -- post-crisis and with big emerging economies having matured themselves --  may well be for less robust growth, although the Reuters polls project the world economy to grow at around 3.5 percent annually over the next three years. That is pretty much the average since 1961, according to World Bank statistics, although that of course is dragged down by the Great Recession and the big slump around 1980. This all goes some way to explaining the extreme caution of central banks in rolling back their unprecedented monetary stimulus. They do not, as the ECB's Draghi admitted openly this past week, want to commit a policy error. FILE PHOTO: Equipment for rent outside of the United Rentals store in Denver, Colorado July 19, 2017.Rick Wilking /File PhotoTheir dilemma is that they want to normalize monetary policy as much as possible without killing what growth trillions of dollars of stimulus have helped achieve. So data releases are even more crucial to policymakers than usual. The coming week will give them a snapshot of monthly business activity, culminating in the first real look at what happened in the second quarter. Flash purchasing managers' indexes for Japan, Germany, France, the euro zone and the United States are released on Monday. All have been in expansion mode. That should continue, but Reuters polls suggest some easing. Britain announces its preliminary second quarter growth figures on Wednesday. There is a strong consensus that it will tick up to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, but slip to 1.7 percent from 2.0 percent year against year. Arguably the biggest data release comes on Friday with advance U.S. GDP numbers. An annualized rate -- that is, roughly speaking the quarterly number times four -- is seen at 2.7 percent, a large jump from the previous 1.4 percent.

The substance of the existing criteria remains unaltered and most of the revisions are presentational in nature. A summary of the changes is below: - We have added a section to the front page to describe the weighting of the four analytical pillars used in Fitch's sovereign rating analysis. - Our sovereign default event definitions have been updated to include a specific default event for the redenomination of existing debt obligations into a different currency and to incorporate any material change in terms of existing obligations that are imposed to avoid a traditional payment default. - We have introduced some conditions and exceptions to the application of Fitch's Sovereign Rating Model (SRM) and Qualitative Overlay (QO), including the provision that we will not utilise the SRM and QO where the committee decides that the sovereign rating should be 'CCC' or below. Other new provisions included guidance on the time limit for the rating committee not to adopt the SRM output as the starting point on which to apply the QO and guidance on how we treat sovereign data revisions in the criteria. - We have provided updated coefficients and weights following a re-estimation of the SRM to include an additional year of data. The weights of the four analytical pillars have changed marginally to the following: structural features 55.0% (from 53.6%); macroeconomic performance, policies and prospects 10.4% (from 11.8%); public finances 17.3% (from 16.7%); and external finances 17.3% (from 17.9%). - We have provided a more detailed description of the variables included in our Debt Dynamics Model (DDM). - A section on Disclosures has been added at the end of the criteria. - A new appendix has been included, outlining how the output from our Macro-Prudential Indicator Model is used in the sovereign rating criteria. - Other revisions included minor editorial changes, clarifications and re-ordering of certain sections. The revised criteria will not result directly in any rating changes. The previous version of the criteria dated 18 July 2016 has been retired.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

In many cases it has been a very mild rebound from the Great Recession triggered by the financial crisis a decade ago.

The U.S. is on the cusp of breaking two simultaneously. Within weeks, the U.S. may have delivered both the longest and the weakest economic upswing in post-war history.  The new normal -- post-crisis and with big emerging economies having matured themselves --  may well be for less robust growth, although the Reuters polls project the world economy to grow at around 3.5 percent annually over the next three years. That is pretty much the average since 1961, according to World Bank statistics, although that of course is dragged down by the Great Recession and the big slump around 1980. This all goes some way to explaining the extreme caution of central banks in rolling back their unprecedented monetary stimulus. They do not, as the ECB's Draghi admitted openly this past week, want to commit a policy error. FILE PHOTO: Equipment for rent outside of the United Rentals store in Denver, Colorado July 19, 2017.Rick Wilking /File PhotoTheir dilemma is that they want to normalize monetary policy as much as possible without killing what growth trillions of dollars of stimulus have helped achieve. So data releases are even more crucial to policymakers than usual. The coming week will give them a snapshot of monthly business activity, culminating in the first real look at what happened in the second quarter. Flash purchasing managers' indexes for Japan, Germany, France, the euro zone and the United States are released on Monday. All have been in expansion mode. That should continue, but Reuters polls suggest some easing. Britain announces its preliminary second quarter growth figures on Wednesday. There is a strong consensus that it will tick up to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, but slip to 1.7 percent from 2.0 percent year against year. Arguably the biggest data release comes on Friday with advance U.S. GDP numbers. An annualized rate -- that is, roughly speaking the quarterly number times four -- is seen at 2.7 percent, a large jump from the previous 1.4 percent.

Britons voted just over a year ago to leave the EU and Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 at the end of March, starting a two-year countdown before Britain's decades long membership of the bloc comes to an end. According to the poll of 36 economists mostly from large banks, taken in the past few days, there is a median 30 percent chance the deadline passes without agreement. But the vast majority said a trade deal would probably be signed, regardless of whether there is a transitional arrangement.  There was little difference between UK- and non-UK based respondents but the range of forecasts was wide - from 5 to 75 percent.  Both sides still appear to be talking at, rather than to, each other, which is unhelpful when time is of the essence,  said Marc Ostwald at ADM ISI. If there is a disorderly Brexit and the two sides fail to reach agreement, Britain will have to deal with the world's biggest trading bloc under World Trade Organization terms, bringing a host of new negotiations and complications. Finance Minister Philip Hammond has said no deal would be a  very, very bad outcome.   Under WTO rules Britain would have to treat everyone the same, whether it wanted to or not, from Australian farmers to U.S. car manufacturers. And that includes its former colleagues, suppliers and clients in the EU.  From the current vantage point, the probability of a disorderly Brexit does look high. However, both sides clearly realize - or at least I hope they do - that failure to reach a deal would be highly damaging,  said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank. Trade Deal Most Likely Outcome About four out of every five respondents put a free trade deal between Britain and the EU as the number one most likely eventual outcome. They put full access to the single market in second place. But concern over immigration from other EU member states was a major reason behind the vote to leave, so Britain is unlikely to agree to the free movement of labor that would probably come with such a deal. Respondents put  no agreement  in third place, ahead only of the option that Brexit was reversed and Britain remains a member of the EU. A bespoke deal between Britain and the EU should be  one of the easiest in human history  to reach, British trade minister Liam Fox said on Thursday.  But while EU and British negotiators found some common ground at the end of a first full round of Brexit talks this week, big differences remain and Prime Minister May has said she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary.  No Brexit  Still Best Option for Economy May has vowed not go back on the referendum result.  But when asked what would be best for the UK economy, economists overwhelmingly voted for no Brexit - as they have consistently said in Reuters polls ahead of, and after, the referendum.   Without a doubt, the best trading arrangements are those we have now, so staying in the EU would impose the least damage,  said Commerzbank's Dixon in London. However, Philip Rush, economist at Heteronomics cautioned it may not be the case anymore.  The European Council would need to be unanimous in allowing the UK to abort Brexit and the ill-feeling already generated would lead to far worse terms,  he said  In particular, the rebate and key opt-outs would be gone, thereby making the costs of being in the EU far higher than before.

An investigation found that the air force saw people massing in the area on satellite footage, assumed they were Boko Haram Islamist militants and launched the assault, the military said in a statement. Rann is in Nigeria's Borno state, the heart of an eight-year-old insurgency by Boko Haram fighters who have killed thousands in their bid to carve out an Islamist caliphate.  The main reason that caused the unfortunate air strike near the IDP (internally displaced person) camp at Rann, was lack of appropriate marking of the area,  the military statement said.  Hitherto, people were not expected to amass at that location. Furthermore, the location was not reflected in the operational map as a humanitarian base.

The overall rate - which matched the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll - was the lowest since the 1.0 percent recorded in October 2015. The central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, citing the need to look through soft inflation. It also vowed to wait for more economic data before committing to its next move. The drop in the overall inflation rate was driven by lower gas prices, which fell 1.4 percent in the 12 months to June after increasing by 6.8 percent on an annual basis in May. Two of the three measures of core inflation the Bank of Canada introduced last year posted gains. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, edged up to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, rose to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, stayed at 1.2 percent.

A Turkish and a Swedish tourist, aged 39 and 22 years, died when the roof of a popular bar collapsed, Greek police said. Kos's port was put out of action and, across the strait, a small tsunami damaged vehicles parked near Bodrum's shore. On Kos, around 115 people were injured, including tourists of various nationalities -- 12 of them seriously. More than 350 people visited hospitals in Turkey, though most had only light injuries. The quake struck at 1:31 a.m. (2231 GMT), and many of Kos's tourists spent the rest of the night in the open as a precaution, hotel owners said.  All of a sudden it felt like a train was going right through the room,  said Vernon Hausman, a German holidaying on Kos.  I told my son: 'Looks like an earthquake, so let's get the hell out of here.'  Greek authorities said the 12 people seriously injured on Kos included tourists from Turkey, Sweden and Norway; four were transferred to Crete and three to Athens. One person was in a critical condition, while a Swedish tourist lost a leg, the director of the hospital in Crete told Greek Skai TV.  Lucky Escape  Turkish and Greek authorities put the magnitude at 6.3 and 6.6 respectively and reported several aftershocks, with one estimated at 5.1. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter of the main quake in the Aegean Sea, 10 km (6 miles) SSE of Bodrum and about 16 km ENE of Kos's main port. Hotel owners in Bodrum told Turkish broadcasters that some tourists were checking out.  It was a lucky escape and it could have been much worse,  said Issa Kamara, a 38-year old personal trainer at the Maca Kizi hotel in Bodrum's smart Turkbuku area. Constantina Svynou, head of the hoteliers' association in Kos, told Greek state television that many visitors had spent the night outside their hotels.  There are about 200,000 tourists on the island, we are at the peak season. Our first reaction was to calm the tourists, following basic rules and evacuating hotel buildings,  Svynou said, adding that there had been no injuries at hotels. A man stands in front of a damaged building following an earthquake off the island of Kos, Greece July 21, 2017.Costas BaltasReuters video footage showed residents and tourists walking along the streets of Kos's main town among collapsed walls and debris. Long, wide cracks appeared in the asphalt on the quayside, which is near a tourist strip of cafes and bars.  It was terrible ... our bed was shaking from the left to the right,  said Jara, a 26-year-old Dutch tourist.  Everything was going crazy.  Kos's airport remained operational and Greek Deputy Shipping Minister Nektarios Santorinios flew there. But he said the main port was out of action.  Passengers on ferries have been rerouted to the islands of Nisyros and Kalymnos,  he told Greek SKAI TV. Slideshow (11 Images)Tidal Wave Police said most of the damage in Kos had been to older buildings.  A seismologist told Greek TV that there had been a tidal wave about 70 cm (28 inches) high. Turkey's emergency authorities warned against aftershocks, but said there had been no casualties or major damage there. Some power cuts were reported, and a minaret in the town of Islamkoy was said to have collapsed. The broadcaster CNN Turk said that, in Bodrum, 60 vehicles had been dragged along by the water. It also showed boats listing in a harbor. Several store owners told the broadcaster NTV they had suffered flood damage. Turkey said it would evacuate around 200 of its citizens from Greece by boat. President Tayyip Erdogan said the fact that no lives had been lost in Turkey was a sign that  the measures we took have been effective . Turkey's location between the Arabian tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate renders it prone to earthquakes. In October 2011, more than 600 people died in the eastern province of Van following a 7.2-magnitude quake and powerful aftershocks. In 1999, two massive earthquakes killed about 20,000 people in Turkey's densely populated northwest. The same year, a 5.9 magnitude quake killed 143 people in Greece.

Oxfam projected the number could rise to more than 600,000 cases,  the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year since records began , exceeding Haiti in 2011.  Nigel Timmins, the charity's humanitarian director who has just returned from the country, said:  Cholera has spread unchecked in a country already on its knees after two years of war and which is teetering on the brink of famine. For many people, weakened by war and hunger, cholera is the knockout blow.  The WHO reported 368,207 suspected cases and 1,828 deaths  in the Arabian Peninsula country since late April.  Every day we have 5,000 more Yemenis falling sick with symptoms of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera,  WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing in Geneva.

A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels and fighting limits access for aid workers. Surveillance data  confirms a slight decline in suspected cases over the past two weeks  in some of the most affected governorates - Amanat Al Asimah, Amran and Sana'a, Chaib said.  But great caution was called for as there is a backlog in reporting and data is still being analyzed, she said.  Oxfam, which is based in Britain, said Yemen's rainy season from July to September would increase the risk of the disease spreading further through water contaminated with faeces.  It is feared that the total number of people infected could eventually rise to over 600,000, making it one of the largest outbreaks since records began in 1949,  Oxfam said. The WHO did not provide its latest planning figure.  The fighting is hugely exacerbating the ability to stop this epidemic of cholera. The kind of disintegration of the health system in Yemen as a result of the conflict at a time of cholera is an absolutely lethal combination,  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Friday's briefing.

In its first estimates of this year's output, the ministry estimated this year's wine production in France, the world's second-largest producer, at 37 million to 38.2 million hectolitres, down from 45.5 million in 2016. The median value, at 37.6 million hectolitres, would be 17 percent less than last year's output and 16 percent below average. That would be  historically low  and less than the output in 1991, when vines were also badly hit by frosts. The ministry did not say how far back its records go.  This fall in production is primarily due to the severe frosts in the spring, which affected, at a sensitive stage of the vine's growth, all the wine-growing basins to varying degrees,  the ministry said in a note. Wine growers used candles, heaters and even the down-draught from helicopters during the cold snap in April to try to save crops. FILE PHOTO: Heaters are lit early in the morning to protect vineyards from frost damage outside Chablis, France April 28, 2017.Christian Hartmann/File PhotoFrance's wine output had already fallen in 2016 because of bad weather. Champagne was among the worst hit, with the harvest down more than 20 percent from the previous year as spring frosts were followed by other problems, such as mildew. This year's production in Champagne was expected to recover slightly, up 8 percent, but still 9 percent below the 2012-2016 average. Late April, frosts severely damaged the Bordeaux vineyard, which could lose half its output from the large volume produced in 2016 and fall 40 percent below the five-year average, the ministry said.  The Bourgogne and Beaujolais region, which suffered major damage in 2016, were better off this year, with output expected to rise 14 percent. The estimates were provisional and did not take into account the weather until harvest, which usually takes place from August to October in France.

Russia has sought to reassure NATO that the military exercises will respect international limits on size, but NATO and U.S. official remain wary about their scale and scope. U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who heads U.S. Army forces in Europe, told Reuters in an interview that allied officials would keep a close eye on military equipment brought in to Belarus for the Zapad 2017 exercise, and whether it was removed later.  People are worried, this is a Trojan horse. They say, 'We're just doing an exercise,' and then all of a sudden they've moved all these people and capabilities somewhere,  he said. Hodges said he had no indications that Russia had any such plans, but said greater openness by Moscow about the extent of its war games would help reassure countries in eastern Europe. Related CoverageRussia: Western worries about Moscow's war games 'buffoonery' - IfxA senior Russian diplomat strongly rejected allegations that Moscow could leave military equipment in Belarus.   This artificial buffoonery over the routine Zapad-2017 exercises is aimed at justifying the sharp intensification of the NATO bloc (activities) along the perimeter of Russian territory,  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told the Interfax news agency on Friday. U.S Army Europe Commanding General Ben Hodges speaks during the inauguration ceremony of bilateral military training between U.S. and Polish troops in Zagan, Poland, January 30, 2017.Kacper PempelNATO allies are nervous because previous large-scale Russian exercises employed special forces training, longer-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Such tactics were later used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and in its intervention in Syria, NATO diplomats say. Hodges said the United States and its allies had been very open about a number of military exercises taking place across eastern Europe this summer involving up to 40,000 troops, but it remained unclear if Moscow would adhere to a Cold War-era treaty known as the Vienna document, which requires observers for large-scale exercises involving more than 13,000 troops. Some NATO allies believe the Russian exercise could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013.  Russia has said it would invite observers if the exercise exceeded 13,000 forces. Hodges said NATO would maintain normal rotations during the Russian war game, while carrying out previously scheduled exercises in Sweden, Poland and Ukraine. The only additional action planned during that period was a six-week deployment of three companies of 120 paratroopers each to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for  low-level  exercises, Hodges said.  We want to avoid anything that looks like a provocation. This is not going to be the 'Sharks' and the 'Jets' out on the streets,  Hodges said in a reference to the gang fights shown  in the 1961 film  West Side Story  set in New York City.

Royalty deals give the owner the right to receive a percentage of revenue or profits from a mining operation, often in exchange for financing. Reuters reported in May that Glencore had hired the Bank of Nova Scotia to sell its royalty assets, including one for the Antamina copper-zinc mine in Peru, which was expected to fetch up to $250 million. The sources said on Friday it was now in talks to create a 50:50 venture for the assets with Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.  A separate vehicle would help Glencore to secure supplies of copper, zinc and nickel for its trading unit. Both companies would also expand the portfolio by purchasing royalties from other miners' operations, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Glencore declined to comment and Ontario Teachers was not immediately available for comment.  Ontario Teachers, Canada's third biggest pension fund with net assets of more than C$175 billion ($139 billion), has some natural resources investments and also royalty interests in oil and gas, according to its website. Glencore is looking to maximize the value of its assets as it moves from cost-cutting to pursuing growth. Last month, it embarked in a bidding war with China's Yancoal for the Australian thermal coal assets being sold by Rio Tinto, while in May the miner approached U.S. grain trader Bunge Ltd over a potential business combination. Glencore, which owns a 33.75 percent stake in Antamina, has already monetized a portion of the mine's output.  Glencore's partners in Antamina are Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton Plc with a 33.75 percent stake, Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd, with 22.5 percent and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp with 10 percent.

Real cracks would only start to appear if rates jumped by 500bp. This reflects the unnaturally low current rate environment and reinforces our focus on refinancing risk as the biggest threat to credit quality. We see the current period of low interest rates in advanced economies as cyclical, rather than structural, and expect real interest rates to gradually normalise. The process will be slow, and Europe is further from this normalisation than the US, but we have stressed for the impact of an immediate rise in variable borrowing costs to gauge the impact on companies' interest coverage ratios. A 200bp stress would leave 19 credits, 6% of our sample of 308 EMEA leveraged high-yield bond and loan credits, with EBITDA below 1.5x interest expense, meaning they would have very little room for underperformance or capex, assuming unhedged exposures. This compares to five credits with a ratio below 1.5x currently. Under a 500bp stress, 19% would have interest coverage below 1.5x and 5% would have a coverage ratio of less than 1x. Lodging and restaurants is probably the most exposed sector as it has one of the lowest interest coverage levels and combines relatively high cyclicality with heavy capex commitments. Cyclicality and capital intensity are key factors in assessing what is a sustainable level of interest coverage. The resilience of the overall portfolio to rising interest rates is largely a function of the low rate environment, which has meant leverage, rather than interest coverage, has been the key benchmark used in assessing credit quality. One risk in a rising rate environment is that companies will need lower leverage multiples to be able to refinance. The reversal of quantitative easing could reduce capital flows to high-yield and leveraged loan funds, putting pressure on spreads, and higher rates could weaken equity valuations and valuation-based lending metrics. But as rising rates would reflect normalising economies, these pressures could be balanced by improving business fundamentals and risk appetite.

The announcement by Magufuli, nicknamed  the Bulldozer  for his forceful leadership style, marks a further escalation of a dispute with foreign companies like Acacia Mining over export revenues.  We have asked them to come for talks ... they have agreed to come. But if they delay those talks, I will close down all the mines,  Magufuli told a cheering crowd at a public rally in the northwestern town of Kigoma. Magufuli has sent shock-waves through the mining community in Africa's fourth-largest gold producer since his election late in 2015 with a series of actions he says are aimed at ensuring that mining companies pay a fair share of taxes. The government has accused Acacia Mining, the country's biggest gold miner, of evading taxes worth billions of dollars by under-declaring export volume and value of its minerals. Acacia denies the allegations. The company said on July 4 it was seeking international arbitration to resolve the dispute. The company's decision to seek arbitration came a day after Tanzania passed new laws to increase mining taxes, force companies to re-negotiate their contracts and allow the state to own up to 50 percent of shares in mining companies. AngloGold Ashanti, which owns Tanzania's biggest open-pit mine, Geita, also said last week that it was filing for international arbitration after the overhaul of the mining laws. Barrick Gold Corp., which owns a 63.9 percent stake in Acacia, agreed last month to hold talks with the government to resolve the tax evasion claims against Acacia. The talks are yet to begin but officials said they could start  soon.  The president said he had taken on multinational companies for the sake of the country.

The veteran theatre actress has made her presence felt in Bollywood, television comedies and indie cinema - even directing plays for her theatre group. The 60-year-old actress has two films opening in cinemas in July. The first is “Lipstick Under My Burkha”, an indie film about four women dealing with life in a conservative society. The other is slapstick comedy “Mubarakan” in which Shah plays the matriarch of a wealthy business family. Shah spoke to Reuters about balancing commercial Bollywood films and indie cinema, the role of art and artists in times of strife, and why being a director’s actor is not a good thing. Q: In “Lipstick Under My Burkha”, you play a woman in her 50s who has to hide her sexual awakening from her family. How did you interpret this character? A: My initial response to the role was - here’s an extremely unusual part for a woman my age. I am not going to get too many such options. A script that was well-written, a director who seems to know what she is doing and a part that is really unusual. But more than that, the character intrigued me. At the beginning of any project, you don’t really know where this character will lead you. Over a period of time, reading it over and over, interacting with other [actors] and finally shooting it, it crystallizes. It is a character that has probably never been seen before. I can say this confidently. There was some fear also, because it is difficult to play scenes like this. I was also concerned about what people would say - not my immediate family, but my extended family. Q: Do you still think of what your family will think when accepting roles in films? A: Partly, yes. It is not enough to stop me from doing anything, but it is a thought that crops up. But having seen the film, I would want my uncles and aunts to watch it. Because it is not offensive. It offends where it is meant to offend. It shakes up pre-conceived notions and if a society has to move forward, we must do that. Otherwise, we will end up like ISIS. We will move backwards, towards medieval ideas. A hundred years after the dawn of modern civilization, the very idea of it is being threatened, not just in our country, but all over the world. We are going to get into the really ugly part of it now … If we can get this movie out to a wide audience, then we are helping our society move in a direction that is required for the stresses and strains of modern life. I mean, artificial intelligence is around the corner and with a population like ours, what will it do to people? Before you know it, the Nazi idea will become acceptable. ‘Get rid of the ones you don’t want’. Dangerous. Related CoverageMovie Review: Lipstick Under My BurkhaQ&A: Konkona Sen Sharma on 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' and the female perspective in filmsQ: Do you think our art and artists are standing up to be counted in these dangerous times? A: I think so. Maybe not popular art as much as it should be. Popular art is a money-making venture, finally. When money is your focus, your whole approach to your work changes. If telling a story is what the artist is interested in, then they will have to find different ways to approach their work. We are bursting with stories in our country today, and we are finding people who are making them today. Even if it’s five-minute stories or three-minute stories. But in this rush to make everyone’s voice heard, what will be the quality of these stories, how sustainable it will be, I don’t know and I cannot predict. But the churn is there, the manthan (churn) has begun. And I don’t think we are going to be able to put a lid on it so easily. Q: Doesn’t popular art have some responsibility though? You have been part of mainstream films that have had something to say. A: Not all of them, I am afraid. (laughs). But let us not name names. But yes, it should be much better. Even if I want to make an adventure film with 20 songs. But at least I should shoot those 20 songs in an interesting manner. And even if it is laugh-a-minute, I should at least write a good script - not this crude, Govinda kind of stuff that we have been putting up with. Today, with internet and the wide accessibility of variety in what people are consuming, there are going to be directors who want to tell different stories. Men and women. Because the whole process of film-making has become easier, cheaper and more democratic. But these things are always one step ahead, five steps back. But either we keep crying about those five steps or choose to cheer that one step forward and build on that. Q: Is that frustrating as an actor? A: Of course it is. It is incredibly frustrating. Q: How do you cope with it? A: Like you cope with other frustrations in life. You throw things around, you beat your head against the wall and then tell yourself “I have to do this.’ … Focus on the paycheck at the end of day. Everyone goes through that. All professions have that. You don’t always get the good things, no? 80 percent of the time it’s gadhamajoori (drudgery). But the problem with young people these days is that they want 80 percent of great stuff. That is exactly what has happened with me. I have spent the best years of my life waiting for things to happen, not being proactive enough maybe. Particularly as an actress, my growth has been so slow and so painful. I don’t think I knew how to act with any confidence over my abilities. I was blundering along. Q: Were you plagued by self-doubt? A: No, it was not self-doubt. I could see what I was doing and I could see that it was wrong. But I didn’t have the skills to correct myself. It took me a long time to develop those skills. That is why I like to talk about it with younger actors because I would like to see someone else short-circuit that process. Mainly, the big mistake we all make is to focus on the trappings, on the fallout of your work. Will I get another film? Will I get money? You are building on this to get somewhere else, whereas this is where you should be focused on. For actors, I really feel, speech and the use of the body are two areas which are neglected tremendously in our country. There are no speech teachers any more. Dramatic speech is not to do with diction alone - sometimes you deliberately spoil your diction to make an impact. The point is, how do you make dialogue sound like conversation? There are others who don’t give as much importance to speech, but I do. Because it has given me a way to get into a role. And I read the “Mubarakan” script as many times as I read the “Lipstick Under My Burkha” script. Because whatever it is, the writer is trying to make a point. And can I help them make that point? Can I communicate that with beauty and intelligence? Focus on the process of how to do it and learn the process. Don’t wait for your director to tell you what to do. A lot of people do that. ‘I am a blank slate. I am a director’s actor’. The director has three thousand other things to think about. Bring something to the table. If you come as a lump of lard, what will your poor director do?","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ratna-pathak-shah-interview-idUSKBN1A61GC"}, 
{"news_time":"2017-07-21 08:19:00","news_title":"Movie Review: Lipstick Under My Burkha","keywords":"India,Konkona Sen Sharma,Rehana,Usha Parmar,MOVIE,REVIEW,LIPSTICKUNDERMYBURKHA,Arts / Culture / Entertainment","sector":"Homepage","content":"REUTERS - If there is one thing you have to credit Alankrita Shrivastava’s latest film with, it is that it throws open the lives of women in a way that we rarely see on Indian celluloid.  The protagonists in “Lipstick Under My Burkha” are not the coy, virginal women Bollywood has long idolised, nor are they emancipated, modern women who don’t need validation from men for the way they live. The four women are somewhere in between – the chasm between conservative backgrounds and modern outlooks that characterise India’s ongoing social churn. Shrivastava bases her world in a crumbling block of flats in old Bhopal. Usha Parmar (Ratna Pathak Shah), who everyone knows as Buaji (aunt), is the landlady and runs her business with an iron hand. She is forced to hide her love of Hindi pulp novels and her crush on a swimming instructor because as a widow, she is not expected to have these “feelings.” In the same block of flats is Shireen (Konkona Sen Sharma), a mother of three who suffers her oppressive husband and hides her working life as a saleswoman from him because he doesn’t believe women should work.  Her neighbour Leela (Aahana Kumra) is about to get into an arranged marriage she doesn’t want while at the same time being involved in a toxic relationship with a man who refuses to commit.  Handout picture from 'Lipstick Under My Burkha'The fourth protagonist is Rehana (Plabita Borthakur), a young college student who loves Led Zeppelin, ripped jeans and drunken parties, but has to hide behind a burkha because of her conservative family. Slideshow (4 Images)The 118-minute film follows these women as they try to find some semblance of freedom and liberty in a world that is otherwise run by men. Its intentions are honest, but the narrative strikes a false note at several key points.  Shireen’s confrontation with her husband’s mistress, Rehana’s issues with her college mates and Leela’s see-sawing emotions all reek of artificiality. The climax, where every single character in the film converges in one place and every single plot point is resolved, is the mother of all contrivances and does the film’s message a huge disservice.  The sense of hope, which pervades most of the film, comes crashing down with the way the film ends. It seem like the characters are right back where they started. The men in the film are wholly one-dimensional – almost as if their only role is to act as hindrances in the path of women’s liberation.  Of the cast, Shah is excellent as Buaji and is wholly responsible for making her story the most compelling of the four. Sen Sharma is predictably pitch perfect. “Lipstick Under My Burkha”, much like the beauty product in its title, is at best cosmetic in its treatment. No wonder then, that its impact doesn’t last for more than a couple of hours.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-lipstickundermyburkha-idUSKBN1A60OE"},

Thierry Vanlancker was named new chief executive on Wednesday after his predecessor Ton Buechner quit abruptly for health reasons. Buechner's departure puts the onus on Vanlancker to deliver the higher sales and margins promised when Akzo Nobel fended off  a 26.3 billion euro ($30.62 billion) bid by U.S. rival PPG Industries (PPG.N).. Shareholders must eventually approve Vanlancker as CEO. But a meeting could give disgruntled shareholders an opportunity to push for a vote on the position of Burgmans -- which they have been demanding for months.  Hedge fund Elliott Advisors, now Akzo's largest shareholder with a 9.5 percent stake, filed a lawsuit in May seeking the ousting of Burgmans, who the hedge fund sees as the mastermind of Akzo's refusal to talk to PPG, which dropped its attempt on June 1. In a preliminary ruling, Elliott's request was rejected, though its legal efforts to remove Burgmans continue. [nL8N1JY1FN} Faced with the shareholders discontent, Akzo has yet to decide when it will ask shareholders to approve Vanlancker as new CEO.   We will go through the shareholder approval process in due course,  Akzo Nobel spokesman Leslie McGibbon said on Friday. Vanlancker, 52, joined Akzo last year and only officially took up his position as head of Akzo's specialty chemicals division in February, raising a technical problem: He is not yet a formal member of the management board.   But that doesn't mean that he is not authorized  to take  major decisions, McGibbon said.  In case a board member falls away, the supervisory board can appoint a temporary replacement ... Together with CFO Maelys Castella he can take any decision.  Burgmans' third term as a member of the supervisory board ends next year. It is unclear whether he might attempt to stay longer.  McGibbon said he could not comment further but the company expects Vanlancker to field a wide range of questions when the company presents second-quarter earnings on July 25. Akzo rivals PPG and Sherwin-Williams (SHW.N) have both reported lackluster earnings for the quarter. PPG announced an acquisition on Thursday and CEO Michael McGarry told reporters that Akzo Nobel is now in the company's  rear view mirror . Under Dutch market law, PPG cannot re-approach Akzo during a six-month cooldown period that ends in December.   Akzo shares were down 2.3 percent on Friday at 75.99 euro.

Morning after pills, which are most effective when taken in the first few hours following unprotected sex, are available without a prescription in most European Union countries. The availability of the pills reflects recommendations from the European Medicines Agency, which says they can be used safely without a doctor's input and that removing the need for a prescription speeds access to the medicine. Women's healthcare charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said women in Britain can pay up to five times more for the pill compared to costs in other European countries. BPAS, which provides abortion care services, urged Boots to stop charging nearly 30 pounds ($39.03) for the pill, calling it prejudicial.  Improving women's access to emergency contraception – including by reducing the price – improves women's physical and mental wellbeing, enabling them to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, which can pose a serious risk to their health,  BPAS spokeswoman Clare Murphy said in a statement.   Boots needs to drop this hugely sexist surcharge.  British pharmacy Superdrug and supermarket chain Tesco recently halved the cost of the morning after pill to about 13.50 pounds ($17.56).  Boots said women could access the morning after pill free of charge through the National Health Service (NHS), and that it was  extremely disappointed by the focus BPAS have taken .  This is a professional healthcare service which, we believe, requires a professional healthcare consultation,  Boots chief pharmacist Marc Donovan said in a statement.  The consultation helps the pharmacist offer important sexual healthcare advice to women and helps us prevent emergency contraception from being misused or overused,  he said. Several female members of parliament have also weighed in on the controversy, with some urging the public to boycott Boots.  Do they feel same about condoms or is male sexuality totally fine. Get over it. Women have sex!  Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted on Friday.  This is awful @BootsUK @BootsHelp & also contravenes consumer rights act,  Stella Creasy, Labour and Cooperative MP, also tweeted.

Trading has been limited so far but prices are falling, it seems to be around 58-60 crowns per kilo in Oslo. Volumes are rising while Europe is going on holiday,  one producer who declined to be named said. An exporter, who also declined to be named, expected prices to drop as well, but by a smaller margin.  We are at about 62 crowns in Oslo for 3-6 kilos salmon,  the exporter said, adding that this would be the average as well.  We can't rule out prices are dropping more at the end of next week,  the exporter said. Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since recovered. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints supported prices in the first half of 2017, ahead of an expected increase in volumes later in the year. Leading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The rating actions follow Fitch's periodic review of the large and mid-sized finance companies in Sri Lanka. Fitch expects capitalisation in the sector to come under pressure as a result of asset quality pressures stemming from a challenging operating environment and unfavourable weather conditions and declining profitability due to higher funding and credit costs. Fitch sees that the shift in the business mix of the entities considered in this peer review has become more apparent given the slowdown in the vehicle financing segment following the increase in import tariffs, imposition of lower allowable loan-to-value ratios coupled with a high interest rate environment. Licensed finance companies have increasingly engaged in term/working capital financing - a segment that we believe is more risky due to larger transaction amounts and poor collateral such as third-party guarantees or post-dated cheques. Fitch's ratings on the finance companies in the peer group are primarily driven by their business model, franchise and risk appetite, which is reflected in their exposure to more vulnerable customer segments. Finance Companies with Institutional Support-Driven Long-Term Ratings PLC's Issuer Default Rating and National Long-Term Rating reflect Fitch's view that PLC's parent, the state-owned and systemically important People's Bank (Sri Lanka) (PB: AA+(lka)/Stable) would provide PLC with extraordinary support, if required. PB's  propensity to support PLC stems from its role in the group as a strategically important subsidiary and the high reputational risk to PB should PLC default as PB owns 75% of PLC and they share a common brand. PB's ability to provide support to PLC is limited, and stems from Sri Lanka's rating of 'B+'/Stable. PLC accounted for 10.1% of PB's assets and contributed 25.5% to PB's post-tax profit for the quarter ended March 2017. In addition to its own branches, PLC has 101 window offices within PB's branches and has board representation from PB. MRF's rating reflects Fitch's expectation of support from its group through MRF's parent Melstacorp PLC (MC). The Rating Watch Negative (RWN) reflects Fitch's assessment that MC's ability to provide support to MRF is dependent on the resolution of the RWN on Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DIST: AAA(lka)/RWN), a significant subsidiary within the group. Fitch expects capital support from MC for MRF to meet the enhanced regulatory minimum capital requirement imposed by the regulator. MRF is of limited strategic importance to the group and the level of its operational integration within the consolidated group's core business is low. MRF accounted for just 1.3% of group pre-tax profit and 5.1% of group assets at financial year end-March 2017. We believe that the disposal of MRF would not significantly alter the group's operations or earnings, although that is not currently in MC's plans. HGL's rating reflects Fitch's expectation of support from its parent, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB; AA-(lka)/Stable), Sri Lanka's fourth-largest domestic commercial bank. This view is based on HNB's majority shareholding (51%), its involvement in the strategic direction of HGL through board representation and the common HNB brand. The two-notch differential reflects HGL's limited role in the group. HGL is mainly engaged in microfinance, which is not a significant product for HNB. Furthermore, there is limited operational integration between the entities. AMWCL's rating reflects Fitch's view that support would be forthcoming from Associated Motorways Private Limited (AMW), which owns 90% of AMWCL, given the finance company's strategic importance to the parent. This is based on AMWCL's role in the group, the common AMW brand and the existence of common creditors, which mean high reputational risk for AMW if AMWCL were to default. About 75% of its advances comprised vehicle finance facilities provided to its parents' clients at end-March 2017 (end-2015: 74% and 2014: 46%). AMWCL also benefits from business referrals from AMW's branch network and has 11 branches within AMW's branches. Siyapatha's rating reflects Fitch's view that support would be forthcoming from its parent, Sampath Bank PLC (A+(lka)/Negative), which owns 100% of Siyapatha and is involved in the strategic direction of Siyapatha through board representation. Siyapatha is rated two notches below its parent because of Siyapatha's limited contribution to the group's core businesses; group leasing book accounted for just 7% of group advances at end-2016, of which Siyapatha provided 42%. In addition Siyapatha's contribution to group profit remains low and Siyapatha is branded independently from its parent. Finance Companies with Long-Term Ratings Driven by Intrinsic Strength CF's rating reflects its strong capitalisation supported by its above-industry profitability and retention rates. CF's regulatory Tier-1 ratio improved to 32.3% at the end of the financial year to March 2017 (29.9% as at end-FY16), maintaining its position as the highest capitalised non-bank financial institution among our rated peers. However, these strengths are counterbalanced to an extent by its still-weak asset quality relative to similar rated peers, high risk appetite stemming from its loan book concentration to registered three-wheelers and potential pressure on profitability from a weakening market share. Even though CF's asset quality and provisioning have been improving, they still remain weaker compared with similar rated peers. LB's rating reflects its established franchise and satisfactory capital levels supported by sound profitability from its higher-yielding products. These are counterbalanced by its higher risk appetite given high exposure to gold-backed lending. Fitch believes this exposure has so far been managed through active monitoring and risk-control measures. However, an unexpected sharp decline in gold prices could pressure its asset quality. The ratings also reflect its increasing liquidity risk given its high loan growth relative to its assets (gross loans to total assets: 89% at end-March 2017), which could potentially reduce its liquidity buffer. Senka's rating reflects the satisfactory credit profile that it has maintained through economic cycles, its relatively strong franchise among finance companies in Sri Lanka and better matched maturity gaps. These positive factors are counterbalanced by its deposit base and capitalisation, which are weaker compared with higher rated peers. Senka's asset quality has been satisfactory with key ratios such as the regulatory gross NPL ratio improving to 1.64% at end-FY17 (end-FY16: 2.02%). However, Fitch sees that there are still downside risks to asset quality given Senka's high gross loan growth of 40% in FY17 (FY16: 24%). A rights issue of LKR580 million in April 2017 helped improve the regulatory Tier-1 capital adequacy ratio to 16.44% after falling to 14.19% at end-FY17 (end-FY16: 15.98%) as a result of high loan growth. SFL's rating reflects its relatively measured risk appetite, weaker-than-peers franchise and overall stable financial indicators. SFL's capitalisation is higher than that of its similar rated peers amid modest loan growth, and its asset-quality metrics have improved. The rating is underpinned by Fitch's view that the rating on SFL's parent, retailing company Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (Singer; A-(lka)/Stable), provides a floor for SFL's rating that is two notches below. This reflects Singer's majority ownership in SFL, the common Singer brand and Singer's influence on SFL's strategic direction through representation on the finance company's board. MIF's rating reflects its high risk appetite, stemming from weaker underwriting standards, declining profitability relative to peers and greater reliance on concentrated and short-term funding. MIF's rating also captures its long operating history, satisfactory capitalisation and loan book exposure to less risky customer segments relative to peers. We estimate the six-month regulatory gross NPL ratio to have increased sharply to nearly 7% by end-March 2017 from 3.4% in FY16 after two new large defaults which are backed by collateral. The company's capitalisation metrics remain supportive to its current rating levels. However, any NPLs without provisions could weaken capital buffers. The ratings on the senior debentures of PLC, CF, Senka, SFL, MIF and Siyapatha are in line with their National Long-Term Ratings according to Fitch criteria. Fitch has not provided any rating uplift for the collateralisation of CF's and SFL's secured notes as their recovery prospects are considered to be average and comparable with those of unsecured notes in a developing legal system. SUBORDINATED DEBT Subordinated debentures of CF, LB, Senka and Siyapatha and the proposed subordinated debentures of Siyapatha are rated one notch below their National Long-Term Ratings to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured creditors. The final rating on Siyapatha's debentures is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Finance Companies with Institutional Support Driven Long-Term Ratings A downgrade of PLC's IDR and National Ratings would occur if PB's ability to support PLC were to weaken or PB were to cede its majority ownership in PLC, or if PLC's strategic importance to its parent were to diminish over time, which would reflect a reduced propensity to support PLC, but Fitch does not anticipate this in the foreseeable future. PLC's ratings are also sensitive to changes in the sovereign rating, as this would affect PB's ability to provide support to PLC. The ratings on AMWCL, Siyapatha, and HGL are similarly sensitive to changes in Fitch's assessment of their respective parents' ability and propensity to provide support, none of which is expected by Fitch to change materially in the short to medium term. The resolution of MRF's RWN will depend on the resolution of the RWN on DIST and the ability of Fitch to form an opinion of the restructuring's full impact on MC's credit profile. Finance Companies with Long-Term Ratings Driven by Intrinsic Strength The rating of CF could be upgraded if its risk appetite moderates, which Fitch does not expect in the medium term. However, CF's rating could be downgraded if it is not able to provide a buffer against further loan quality deterioration through provisioning and further continuous decline in its market share which could pressure future profitability. Downgrade triggers for LB include capital pressures stemming from weaker profitability, increase in liquidity risk or a further increase in risk appetite. This could be  indicated through aggressive loan growth or deterioration in asset quality. An upgrade of LB's rating is contingent on the company achieving stronger capitalisation levels, lower exposure to risky assets and a more comfortable liquidity position. An upgrade of Senka's rating is contingent upon the company sustaining stronger capital levels and a more robust deposit franchise that would allow the company to expand in a controlled manner. Rating could be downgraded if its asset quality weakens, leading to a significant decline in capitalisation or excessive asset encumbrance. An upgrade of SFL's ratings from an improvement in its standalone strength is unlikely as we expect its franchise to remain materially weaker compared with that of its more established, higher-rated peers. The more likely driver of an upgrade of SFL's rating would be its relationship with its parent, in particular its strategic importance to Singer. A sustained deterioration in SFL's standalone credit profile in terms of its capitalisation and asset quality relative to similarly rated peers would not result in a downgrade of SFL's rating unless our assessment of parental support were to also change. MIF's ratings could be downgraded if its large maturity mismatches were to increase or if MIF were to experience an increase in capital impairment risks due to sustained deterioration in profitability and asset quality relative to better rated peers. An upgrade of MIF's ratings is contingent upon a moderation of its risk appetite as seen through better underwriting standards and risk controls alongside improvements in asset quality and profitability. The ratings on the senior debt of PLC, CF, Senka, SFL, MIF and Siyapatha will move in tandem with their National Long-Term Ratings. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The assigned subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with their National Long-Term Ratings.

FamilyMart plans to hire 100,000 for part-time jobs over the next two years as it struggles to cope with a staffing crunch across most of its convenience stores, its president, Takashi Sawada, told Reuters on Friday.  Japan's ubiquitous convenience stores, known as  conbini , typically rely on large numbers of part-time workers to help run the show, but a shrinking population has left them in the lurch. The country's unemployment rate is near a two-decade low while the jobs-to-applicants ratio is at a 43-year high.  Boosting the role of working women is an important plank of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to address labor shortages. The key will be offering flexible working hours in a country where long working days are common, FamilyMart's Sawada says.  If we offer flexibility we will be able to hire many, many more [housewives],  he said.  They really take to the work and stay with us for long periods of time.   The conbini operator, part of FamilyMart UNY Holdings (8028.T), is also moving to make it easier for housewives to take on supervisory positions, he added.     The number of services offered at conbini has ballooned in recent years, with buyers able to pick up their internet shopping, a morning coffee and pay household bills in the store, all of which has added to the workload for store staff.  FamilyMart Co's President Takashi Sawada poses for a photo at a FamilyMart convenience store after an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan July 21, 2017.Toru HanaiAround 80 percent of FamilyMart stores are suffering from labor shortages, a company survey of 12,000 stores found. With the number of parcels arriving in store doubling in the past year, complaints from dissatisfied customers have also risen, Sawada said.  FamilyMart Co's President Takashi Sawada poses for a photo in front of a FamilyMart convenience store after an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan July 21, 2017.Toru HanaiTo address these concerns, FamilyMart has taken measures such as replacing the manual for handling deliveries, which ran to more than 100 pages, with an illustrated 10-page version. As society ages, having staff who are on hand to deal with customers will help maintain the industry's position as indispensable to consumers' everyday lives, Sawada said.   I think there's limits to Amazon Go,  said Sawada, referring to the internet retailer Amazon's (AMZN.O) bricks-and-mortar store which does away with cash registers, using sensors instead to detect purchases and for automatic billing.   We will succeed by offering a human touch.   FamilyMart has said it expects its net profit to more than double to 60 billion yen ($537.83 million) in four years from 24 billion yen in the current fiscal year. To drive this growth, it is converting its Circle K and Sunkus stores into FamilyMart stores, with 2,000 conversions completed since September. FamilyMart UNY, formed last year from the merger with UNY Group to become the No.2 convenience store operator behind Seven & i Holdings Co (3382.T), brought in Sawada to head the post-merger conbini business. He has previously worked at trading house Itochu Corp (8001.T) - FamilyMart's top shareholder - and Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing (9983.T).

Morning after pills, which are most effective when taken in the first few hours following unprotected sex, are available without a prescription in most European Union countries. The availability of the pills reflects recommendations from the European Medicines Agency, which says they can be used safely without a doctor's input and that removing the need for a prescription speeds access to the medicine. Women's healthcare charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said women in Britain can pay up to five times more for the pill compared to costs in other European countries. BPAS, which provides abortion care services, urged Boots to stop charging nearly 30 pounds ($39.03) for the pill, calling it prejudicial.  Improving women's access to emergency contraception – including by reducing the price – improves women's physical and mental wellbeing, enabling them to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, which can pose a serious risk to their health,  BPAS spokeswoman Clare Murphy said in a statement.   Boots needs to drop this hugely sexist surcharge.  British pharmacy Superdrug and supermarket chain Tesco recently halved the cost of the morning after pill to about 13.50 pounds ($17.56).  Boots said women could access the morning after pill free of charge through the National Health Service (NHS), and that it was  extremely disappointed by the focus BPAS have taken .  This is a professional healthcare service which, we believe, requires a professional healthcare consultation,  Boots chief pharmacist Marc Donovan said in a statement.  The consultation helps the pharmacist offer important sexual healthcare advice to women and helps us prevent emergency contraception from being misused or overused,  he said. Several female members of parliament have also weighed in on the controversy, with some urging the public to boycott Boots.  Do they feel same about condoms or is male sexuality totally fine. Get over it. Women have sex!  Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted on Friday.  This is awful @BootsUK @BootsHelp & also contravenes consumer rights act,  Stella Creasy, Labour and Cooperative MP, also tweeted.

Wall Street  was also set to open slightly lower and oil prices dipped, taking the shine off a second week running of gains for global stock indices. But the euro was riding high as concerns over probes into U.S. President Donald Trump's affairs weakened the dollar and investors jumped on signs the European Central Bank is still moving towards tighter policy, even if cautiously.  We can be pretty sure that when ECB President Mario Draghi sat down for his press conference yesterday the last thing he expected to see was the euro hit its highest level in over two years and for equity markets to slide back,  said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.  The strength of the euro does appear to be acting as a bit of a headwind for European stocks as they look to close the week sharply lower, in contrast to the performance of UK and U.S. stocks this week.  The euro hit a high of $1.1676 before retreating as European bond yields fell on a Reuters report suggesting the bank was likely to hold off from any change in policy until October but also viewed December as too late. Thursday's meeting did just enough to show policymakers were on course to rein in their two-year old emergency programme of bond-buying without quite scaring the horses. Investors seem largely to have got over a period of jitters spurred by concerns over the pace of U.S. economic growth and signs that several of the world's major central banks were determined to tighten monetary policy soon. But the rally is not quite as convincing as at some points over the past year. The FTSE index of major European stocks fell around half a percent while Frankfurt and Paris fell by almost 1 percent. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has gained about 5 percent in the past two weeks, eased 0.2 percent, dragged down by falling materials and financial shares. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was steady after rising for a 10th straight session on Thursday, its longest such streak since February 2015. It has advanced around 3 percent in the latest rally.  Strong global growth and (a) decent earnings outlook are supporting shares globally,  said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. U.S. quarterly earnings are expected to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The court is expected to make a decision in a week or two, with analysts split on whether it will dismiss Sharif outright or recommend a fresh investigation and corruption trial by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Few expect the judges to drop the case, since the Supreme Court appointed the investigatory panel that alleged the Sharif family's wealth was beyond its means. It further accused his children, including presumed heir Maryam, of signing forged documents to hide ownership of posh London flats. Sharif has denied wrongdoing and slammed the 254-page report by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) as biased and slanderous. He has also rejected opposition demands to stand down. Sharif's lawyers have been arguing that the JIT overstepped its remit, and disputed its findings. Ejaz Afzal Khan, who heads the three-judge Supreme Court panel hearing Sharif's case, on Friday announced the hearings had been concluded by saying:  Judgement reserved . Khan did not say when the Supreme Court would announce its decision, however. Opposition parties believe Sharif is wobbling and expect the Supreme Court to deliver a knockout blow to his premiership by employing a little-used constitutional provision to dismiss a sitting official.  From our legal perspective it's crystal clear: he can't survive this,  said Shafqat Mahmood, a lawmaker and senior official with the opposition PTI party. Sharif's allies interpret the court's decision not to summon him as indicating that it will order a NAB investigation.     Such an outcome would be seen as something of a victory by the ruling PML-N party because it would probably allow Sharif to finish his term and even contest the next polls in 2018. Sharif has faced numerous investigations since he served his first two terms in the 1990s and now has many pending NAB cases. Both those terms were cut short, and he spent a long time in exile after being deposed in a military coup in 1999. Sharif, son of an industrialist, has denied all the claims against him and his supporters say he has never been convicted of anything despite facing unprecedented scrutiny during three stints in power. Sharif has talked of a conspiracy against him, but has not named anyone. Privately, however, his allies say elements of the military and the judiciary are bent on toppling him. Last week, the army spokesman brushed aside suggestions that the military was the hidden hand behind the investigation. Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting conspiracy claims to save himself, and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he would step down.

The senior government minister in charge of reforms, Maria Leitao Marques, told Reuters the measures by the left-leaning administration, which require over 470 million euros ($547 million) in technology investment, would bring savings for the state and businesses, making the latter more competitive. She also rejected criticism from the International Monetary Fund and some ratings agencies that the pace of reforms has slowed under this administration, in power since late 2015.  There is no waning of the reform effort, quite the opposite,  she said.  If their concept of reform is sacking employees, then the IMF will keep saying that we are not reforming the state.   If the IMF is satisfied just with promises made and bills published, it's their problem. To me, reforms mean results.  The previous center-right government implemented tough austerity measures dictated by the terms of Portugal's 2011-14 international bailout following a severe debt crisis. Many of the reforms designed to permanently rein in spending and boost revenues never left the drawing board, however. The Socialist government reversed many of the austerity policies but has managed to further cut the budget deficit.   It is not this government's understanding that reform means thinning down the state and sacking public servants ... We need public investment,  Leitao Marques said. The interior of a citizen's bureau is seen in Cacem, Portugal July 18, 2017.Rafael MarchanteShe said the only reduction in the public sector workforce is expected to come from closing at least half of positions held by those retiring.  Having an efficient and effective state is good for the functioning of the country as a whole and the market ...    Obviously, we need a state that we can sustain, but we need it to be efficient so that the market can work,  she added.  Portugal's Minister of the Presidency and of Administrative Modernisation Maria Manuel Leitao Marques attends a interview with Reuters in Lisbon, Portugal July 17, 2017.Rafael MarchanteLeitao Marques, who is minister for cabinet coordination and administrative modernization, said measures like simplified online procedures for companies and individuals to obtain legal documents, licenses and other assisted digital services were already saving millions of euros and thousands of man-hours. A flagship program in this field is a network of so-called Citizen Spaces providing a one-stop service for individuals to pay bills, file tax returns or renew a driver's license. The government expects net savings from the new technology investment in 2017-2020 to exceed 1.3 billion euros at the end of the period, adding to already substantial annual corporate  cost savings from simplified procedures of some 560 million.  The Simplex program has always been very focused on helping the competitiveness of companies,  Leitao Marques said.  We do not make them more competitive but we remove the bureaucracy that takes competitiveness away from them during their whole life-cycle.  She said time saved by civil servants, estimated to have already reached 470,000 hours, will be put to better use after they are retrained to work with digital data rather than paper archives.

Duterte was responding to remarks by Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern, who told a hearing of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission that he would protest against such a visit if U.S. President Donald Trump followed through on an invitation to the firebrand Philippine leader. The commission, made up of members of the U.S. House of Representatives, convened on Thursday in Washington for a hearing on Duterte's deadly, year-old war on drugs, which has killed thousands of Philippine citizens. Human rights groups say many of the deaths were executions by police, an assertion the authorities reject.  There will never be a time that I will go to America during my term, or even thereafter,  said Duterte, who has made no secret of his grudge against the United States, his country's oldest ally.  So what makes that guy think I'll go to America?  he told reporters, referring to McGovern.  I've seen America and it's lousy... it would be good for the U.S. Congress to start with their own investigation of their own violations of the so many civilians killed in the prosecution of the wars in the Middle East,  he added.  Otherwise I will be forced to investigate you also. I will start with your past sins.

Britain's Paysafe, which offers pre-paid cashcards and online wallets, said separately it was also planning to buy Merchants' Choice Payments Solutions for $470 million, strengthening its presence in the United States. Payments companies have become sought-after targets as more shoppers switch from cash to paying for purchases by smartphone or other mobile devices and a series of deals has driven share prices in the sector higher in recent weeks. Mastercard made the first move last year by buying Britain's Vocalink and deals have picked up in recent weeks. Danish payment services firm Nets A/S said in early July that it had been approached by potential buyers, while days later U.S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy Britain's Worldpay for 7.7 billion pounds to expand outside the United States. That has been followed by a 1.5 billion euro bid on Thursday for Stockholm-based Bambora by France's Ingenico, and, on Friday, news that private equity firm Permira had bought a stake in Sweden's Klarna. Previous Experience  Paysafe said it had been approached in early May, when its shares were trading at about 450 pence, banking sources said. Shares in Paysafe were up 7.4 percent to 582.5 pence a share at 0955 GMT, leading the gainers in Britain's mid-cap index but slightly below the 590 pence per share proposed offer price. If successful, the private equity bid would mark a return to the payments sector for CVC. It previously owned Skrill, a payments company which was bought by Optimal Payments, the AIM-listed forerunner to Paysafe.  CVC knows the space extremely well,  said a banking source, adding Paysafe had a  very positive  outlook with some strong growth fundamentals given the drive to go cashless. FILE PHOTO --  The ticker and trading information for Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4, 2016.Brendan McDermid/File Photo - RTS135C2 And that's the reason why they (CVC) are interested. They know the actors, they like the dynamics around the sector, which is underpinned by growth.  CVC and Blackstone have until Aug. 18 to make a formal offer. Lazard are lead advisors to Paysafe, while Credit Suisse is working with CVC. Old Mutual on Board Paysafe said that after turning down a number of indicative proposals, it had granted the bidders due diligence access on the basis of the 590 pence per share proposal. The deal is conditional on the buyers being able to sell off Paysafe's Asia Gateway business, with a buyer already lined up, although no further details were given. A source with knowledge of the situation said Blackstone and CVC's experience of a partnership in British group Merlin Entertainments made them a good fit. And a source familiar with CVC's thinking said that Paysafe was potentially a good buy given its current valuation and the consortium's ability to add further value. UBS analyst David Mulholland said the deal value implied a valuation of 14 times Paysafe's estimated 2018 price-to-earnings ratio and 10.4 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Old Mutual Global Investors, Paysafe's largest shareholder with a stake of about 10.3 percent in the group, has signed a non-binding letter of support for the possible offer. Paysafe said its deal for Delta Card Service Inc, the holding company for Houston-based Merchants' Choice Payment Solutions ( MCPS ), will see Paysafe add around 60,000 clients across 50 states and over $14 billion in sales volume annually. The cash deal will be part-funded by $380 million in bank loans and $90 million from existing cash funds, it added.  We would initially highlight that on first impressions the acquisition appears to make sense, (but) is not a particularly high multiple in the context of payments,  UBS's Mulholland said in a note to clients, flagging a 'buy' rating.

The deal marks Schlumberger's second attempt to buy into EDC and the first U.S. stake in Russia's oil and gas sector since sanctions were imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.  I warmly welcome Schlumberger as our majority shareholder. It builds on our strategic alliance with Schlumberger since 2011 and our mutually beneficial business relationship since 2007,  EDC Chief Executive Alexander Djaparidze said in a statement late on Thursday. In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion but the deal fell through after Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service repeatedly postponed its approval. That deal met with resistance in Russia's higher echelons of power who were worried that Schlumberger might seize control of Eurasia, a senior government official said in 2015. EDC then delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The Kremlin declined to say whether Russian authorities had since warmed to the U.S. investor.  If we talk about a global trend, Russia was, is and will be interested in foreign investment and in cooperation with foreign investors in all possible sectors, excluding the areas which are most sensitive,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.  But even in these areas cooperation is still possible, and a relevant decision is to be taken in each separate case by the government's commission on foreign investment.  For Schlumberger, the investment would mean access to the Russian market where producers have sustained their capital spending despite low oil prices. U.S. oilfield service companies have been supported by their operations in North America, where expanding shale production is driving revenue, but their international and offshore operations continue to be pressured by weak oil prices. The Schlumberger agreement is also subject to approval by Russia's antitrust body, EDC said. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Work on this investment remains ongoing and the company expects to enter into a definitive agreement in relation to it in the near future,  EDC said. Xenon Capital acted as financial adviser to EDC, a source close to the deal told Reuters. In June, state-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund said it was buying a minority stake in Eurasia Drilling via a consortium with Chinese and UAE funds.

Fierce competition has resulted in insurance rates either stagnating or falling over the past few years, leading Beazley to invest in growing its U.S. specialty lines business, which carries out professional and management liability for mid-sized and small companies.  Beazley said on Friday that its first half profit had risen 6 percent to $158.7 million, driven by growth in its U.S. specialty business and investment gains.  That was despite premium rates for all of its businesses falling by 2 percent.   The reason we're focusing on specialty lines above the others is generally the rating environment in specialty lines is better than in the property, reinsurance and marine lines,  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Horton told Reuters. Horton said rates in specialty lines have held up over the past few years after all the claims it saw following the financial crash of 2008. Last year, Beazley brought on a team of underwriters to focus on writing specialty line insurance outside the United States, with a specific focus on Europe.  Specialty lines currently account for between 45-50 percent Beazley's revenue and Horton sees the business' contribution hitting the 55 percent mark over the next few years. Expansion Plans The company also received approval to convert its Dublin-based reinsurance company into an insurance company, as part of its European expansion plan and Horton said on Friday that the company hopes to start writing European business on both its insurance company and Lloyd's balance sheet.  Horton said the company had applied for branches in Spain, France, Germany and the UK and expected those to be set up in a couple of months.  By the end of the third quarter, our aim is to be quoting business in the specialty lines arena across Europe,  he said, adding that the moves were not a result of Brexit, which has prompted many financial firms to set up European operations amid concern the UK exit could hamper trade.   It was not a Brexit plan. Now of course with Brexit having happened, its much better having the insurance company in Ireland than it would be having it in the UK,  Horton said.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) has sided with MasterCard's argument that the claims were unsuitable to be brought under a so-called collective actions regime and has not allowed the case to go to trial, the company said.  We welcome the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgment refusing certification for the proposed collective action,  a MasterCard spokesman said in a statement. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in UK legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced U.S.-style  opt-out  collective class actions for breaches of UK or EU competition law in 2015. U.S.-based litigator Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as Mastercard on merchants' banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the class action, said he was considering an appeal. He said he was surprised and disappointed at the ruling. London's High Court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

Thierry Vanlancker was named new chief executive on Wednesday after his predecessor Ton Buechner quit abruptly for health reasons. Buechner's departure puts the onus on Vanlancker to deliver the higher sales and margins promised when Akzo Nobel fended off  a 26.3 billion euro ($30.62 billion) bid by U.S. rival PPG Industries (PPG.N).. Shareholders must eventually approve Vanlancker as CEO. But a meeting could give disgruntled shareholders an opportunity to push for a vote on the position of Burgmans -- which they have been demanding for months.  Hedge fund Elliott Advisors, now Akzo's largest shareholder with a 9.5 percent stake, filed a lawsuit in May seeking the ousting of Burgmans, who the hedge fund sees as the mastermind of Akzo's refusal to talk to PPG, which dropped its attempt on June 1. In a preliminary ruling, Elliott's request was rejected, though its legal efforts to remove Burgmans continue. [nL8N1JY1FN} Faced with the shareholders discontent, Akzo has yet to decide when it will ask shareholders to approve Vanlancker as new CEO.   We will go through the shareholder approval process in due course,  Akzo Nobel spokesman Leslie McGibbon said on Friday. Vanlancker, 52, joined Akzo last year and only officially took up his position as head of Akzo's specialty chemicals division in February, raising a technical problem: He is not yet a formal member of the management board.   But that doesn't mean that he is not authorized  to take  major decisions, McGibbon said.  In case a board member falls away, the supervisory board can appoint a temporary replacement ... Together with CFO Maelys Castella he can take any decision.  Burgmans' third term as a member of the supervisory board ends next year. It is unclear whether he might attempt to stay longer.  McGibbon said he could not comment further but the company expects Vanlancker to field a wide range of questions when the company presents second-quarter earnings on July 25. Akzo rivals PPG and Sherwin-Williams (SHW.N) have both reported lackluster earnings for the quarter. PPG announced an acquisition on Thursday and CEO Michael McGarry told reporters that Akzo Nobel is now in the company's  rear view mirror . Under Dutch market law, PPG cannot re-approach Akzo during a six-month cooldown period that ends in December.   Akzo shares were down 2.3 percent on Friday at 75.99 euro.

The fate of more than half of 41 mines in the Philippines, the world's top nickel ore supplier, has been uncertain since February when then Environment Secretary Regina Lopez ordered their closure for causing environmental damage and violating laws. Lopez led a 10-month industry crackdown until her dismissal in May by the Commission on Appointments following her mining orders, which included a ban on open-pit mining. She was replaced by Duterte's friend, former military general Roy Cimatu.  I'd like to tell you frankly, we will come up with new legislation ... we have to rearrange everything,  Duterte said in a speech at a business conference in his hometown Davao City. Duterte also said he would invite all industry stakeholders to the presidential palace for a dialogue together with his former environment minister Lopez and other anti-mining advocates. Duterte said he has always been supportive of Lopez's pro-environment stance but could not stop mining because there is a law that allows the miners to continue to operate. He also complained that the taxes miners pay are  too low  and lamented the lack of compensation to mining communities that suffer from environmental damage. Duterte did not say when the meeting would take place but he said he planned to show industry stakeholders footage shown to him by anti-mining advocates, including Lopez, about the environmental destruction as well examples of good practices in mining.  I will tell (them), look at the slides about good practices of mining, and I will ask everybody to focus on that,  he said.  Then let's also look at the slides on mining gone awry.  He also urged mining companies to  come up with an arrangement that is fair to everybody.  Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz.

In its first estimates of this year's output, the ministry estimated this year's wine production in France, the world's second-largest producer, at 37 million to 38.2 million hectolitres, down from 45.5 million in 2016. The median value, at 37.6 million hectolitres, would be 17 percent less than last year's output and 16 percent below average. That would be  historically low  and less than the output in 1991, when vines were also badly hit by frosts. The ministry did not say how far back its records go.  This fall in production is primarily due to the severe frosts in the spring, which affected, at a sensitive stage of the vine's growth, all the wine-growing basins to varying degrees,  the ministry said in a note. Wine growers used candles, heaters and even the down-draught from helicopters during the cold snap in April to try to save crops. FILE PHOTO: Heaters are lit early in the morning to protect vineyards from frost damage outside Chablis, France April 28, 2017.Christian Hartmann/File PhotoFrance's wine output had already fallen in 2016 because of bad weather. Champagne was among the worst hit, with the harvest down more than 20 percent from the previous year as spring frosts were followed by other problems, such as mildew. This year's production in Champagne was expected to recover slightly, up 8 percent, but still 9 percent below the 2012-2016 average. Late April, frosts severely damaged the Bordeaux vineyard, which could lose half its output from the large volume produced in 2016 and fall 40 percent below the five-year average, the ministry said.  The Bourgogne and Beaujolais region, which suffered major damage in 2016, were better off this year, with output expected to rise 14 percent. The estimates were provisional and did not take into account the weather until harvest, which usually takes place from August to October in France.

The spot rupee closed at 153.65/70 per dollar, from Thursday's close of 153.70/85.  There were dollar sales by exporters and foreign banks in the latter part of trading,  a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.  We expect a gradual depreciation in the currency with the central bank buying dollars continuously.  Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme. Coomaraswamy told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. Dealers said the market is also concerned that the downward pressure on the rupee is likely to rise due to the fall in government bond yields, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for more monetary policy tightening and measures to curb strong credit growth. T-bill yields fell 4-22 basis points at a weekly auction on Wednesday. The fall in T-bill yields, which move in tandem with market interest rates, will increase the demand for cheap credit and add downward pressure on the currency, dealers said. The IMF, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan on Tuesday, said the country's performance under its programme has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million. Seasonal demand for dollars is expected to pick up from August, dealers said.

Some 41.1 percent of people in Catalonia were in favor of the creation of an independent state, according to a June poll by the regional government's Centre of Opinion Studies (CEO), down from around 44 percent recorded in March and December. The number of people actively against separation from Spain also rose slightly to 49.4 percent in June from 48.5 percent in March. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont is organizing a referendum on northeastern Catalonia's divorce from Spain's other 16 regions for Oct. 1, though the central government has said the plebiscite would be illegal and has vowed to block it. Catalan Regional President Carles Puigdemont attends a news conference at Palau de la Generalitat in Barcelona, Spain July 14, 2017.Albert GeaThe independence drive in the region, the most populous in Spain with its own language and a thriving industrial hub, has been gaining force since a deep national economic slump prompted local leaders to claim Catalonia would be better off alone.  Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, Madrid can directly intervene in the running of the region and force it to drop the vote which, potentially, would involve sending in the police or suspending the government's authority to rule.   Direct intervention, however, is considered a last resort and confrontation between Barcelona and Madrid is more likely to descend into months of legal wrangling and a potential regional election.  Puigdemont has said that if the  Yes  vote wins in October, the regional government will declare independence within 48 hours. A  No  vote would prompt an early election. The region's previous non-binding poll in 2014 - which had a low turnout and was also ruled illegal by Madrid - saw 80 percent in favor of full secession.

While Autoliv has been winning business from Japanese rival Takata Corp (7312.T), slowing car sales in important markets such as the United States have weighed this year and taking on new business has also resulted in mounting costs. The world's largest maker of airbags and seatbelts said full-year like-for-like sales were expected to be up 2 percent, compared with a previous estimate for a 4 percent rise.  We can see that the estimates for global car production has been revised downwards. We are monitoring this tightly and taking the steps we need to,  Autoliv Chief Executive Jan Carlson told Reuters.      The Stockholm-based automotive supplier kept unchanged its full-year outlook for profitability but its shares fell 6.7 percent at 1118 GMT.  We still see high light vehicle inventories, slow sales momentum and continued uncertainty in China and North America,  the company said in a statement. Autoliv said second-quarter operating profit rose to $216 million, roughly in line with the mean analysts forecast and year-ago figure of $213 million. Autoliv picked up business due to a recall scandal that engulfed Takata Corp, which filed for bankrutpcy last month. However, it raised its forecast for research, development and engineering costs this year to above 7.0 percent of sales versus the previous outlook of up to 7.0 percent. Carlson said the firm had recruited around 1,300 engineers over the past year, exceeding a previous target of 1,000. The new staff have been recruited to ensure it can deliver on the new business it has taken from Takata over the coming years, and to add staff to Autoliv's active safety business, which sells products such as radar and vision systems.

A Nigerian court has ordered seven local banks, including Sterling Bank, to transfer a combined $793 million to the government immediately, and a government lawyer said on Thursday the lenders had withheld money collected on behalf of the state. Commercial banks in Nigeria collect grants, taxes, fees and tariffs on behalf of the government which they send to a single treasury account with the central bank in line with a policy introduced in 2015 aimed at curbing corruption. Under the court order, Sterling Bank, a mid-tier lender, was ordered to remit $46.5 million. It said in a statement it had written a letter to clarify its position after the government went to court over the money for the first time since bringing in the policy. Shares in Sterling, which has gained 36 percent this year, shed 4.85 percent on Friday. They slumped 58 percent last year as the banking sector, particularly smaller lenders, was hit by a recession in Africa's biggest economy and currency crisis.

The European Medicines Agency said its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had recommended the product, Lutathera, in a move setting the stage for full approval within a couple of months. The French biotech company has described the new drug as a  multi-hundred million  dollar opportunity, with the potential to transform its fortunes. AAA, which was spun off from Europe's physics research centre CERN 15 years ago and is listed on Nasdaq, had sales from existing diagnostic products of $34.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Lutathera is unusual in harnessing the same molecule that is already used to diagnose cancer to also deliver treatment. The radiopharmaceutical works by hitting cancer cells with high energy electrons, just like radiotherapy, but the injection targets gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) that over-express a certain protein. It has shown impressive results in clinical tests against a disease associated with very poor survival, and one that killed Apple co-founder Jobs in 2011. The path to market, however, has not been easy for the drugmaker, due to technical problems with the drug's filing at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a slower than initially hoped approval timetable in Europe. In a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, Lutathera reduced the risk of disease progression compared to standard care by 80 percent. That compares favourably with existing NETs drugs such as Novartis' Afinitor and Pfizer's Sutent.

North American shale producers have ramped up drilling in recent quarters as oil prices bounced back from their lows in 2016, when they hit about $27 per barrel. Crude in the second quarter averaged $48.15 per barrel, and companies added 506 onshore rigs in the past year, according to a closely watched Baker Hughes report. Schlumberger and rivals such as Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes GE Co (BHGE.N), which help explorers locate oil and prepare drill-wells, are bringing back equipment they stacked during the downturn. Houston-based Schlumberger said on Friday that North American revenue jumped 18 percent and international revenue rose 4 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding. Chief Executive Paul Kibsgaard said on an earnings call he was  somewhat positively surprised  in terms of activity in international markets.  The market has viewed international with the expectation that it will be weak until oil gets up to the $50-$60,  said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst with Edward Jones.   The comment that there are signs of life below $50 (oil)could be positive.     To tap the improving demand in international markets, Schlumberger said it would buy a majority stake in Russia's biggest oilfield services firm, Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC).  The purchase of the Eurasia group is sort of a bet that international markets are going to keep advancing,  said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York.  U.S. onshore revenue soared 42 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding, as fracking revenue was boosted by companies completing more wells and better pricing.  We expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year, with a frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4,  said Patrick Schorn, executive vice president of new ventures at Schlumberger. Total revenue rose 4.2 percent to $7.46 billion in the second quarter, beating the average analysts' estimate of $7.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 35 cents per share, handily beating expectation of 30 cents. The company's shares rose as much as 3 percent to $68.96,  before paring some gains. Gains were limited by a fall in oil prices that dragged down the broader energy index.

Fellow central European power Hungary has stood by Poland's rulers, saying the EU should not overstep its authority.

Earlier this month, Czech Justice Minister Robert Pelikan wrote to his Polish counterpart expressing  concern  about the changes, which includes terminating tenures of Supreme Court judges. Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party says the changes are needed to make courts more accountable and to ensure state institutions serve all Poles, not just the  elites  it says are the support base for the centrist opposition.

Rydapt was also recommended as a treatment for adults with advanced systemic mastocytosis, a rare disease in which the body's mast cells accumulate rapidly. This latest CHMP opinion sets the stage for likely European Commission approval this year. Rydapt, whose U.S. wholesale cost is nearly $7,500 for a two-week supply, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April.

There have been similar attacks in the Philippines since last year, but the duration and ferocity of the fighting in Marawi has alarmed Southeast Asian nations and led to fears the assault could inspire and unite the region's disparate Islamist groups.  The risks won't end when the military declares victory,  said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute of Policy Analysis of Conflict, adding that threats would mount in neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia, both Muslim-majority nations.  Indonesia and Malaysia will face new threats in the form of returning fighters from Mindanao, and the Philippines will have a host of smaller dispersed cells with the capacity for both violence and indoctrination.  The Marawi siege had united two feuding pro-IS factions in Indonesia, the world's most-populous Muslim-majority nation,  and led to soul-searching among militants there  about why they cannot manage to do anything as spectacular , the report said.  Once the battle for Marawi is over, it is possible that Southeast Asian ISIS leaders (in Syria) might encourage Indonesians to go after other targets, including foreigners or foreign institutions – especially if one of them comes back to lead the operations,  the report added, using another acronym for the Islamic State. Asked about an elevated threat in Indonesia, including for foreigners, police spokesman Setyo Wasisto said:  We will stay cautious, increase our alertness and monitor the movement of those who come home from Marawi.  Malaysia's police counter-terrorism chief declined comment. Authorities in the Philippines did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Authorities estimate about 20 Indonesian militants were involved in the fighting in Marawi but it is not clear how many survived. About 565 people have died in nearly two months of fighting in Marawi, according to officials, including over 420 militants, 45 civilians and almost 100 Philippines military and police. After missing several deadlines for re-taking Marawi, Philippine officials say it is not possible to say when the fighting will end. National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon told reporters on Friday a hard core of fighters has been hemmed in to three barangays, or urban villages, down from the 12 they held earlier. Marawi has 96 such barangays. Chain of Command In a key revelation, the IPAC report tracked the chain of command for the Marawi operations. At its apex was Islamic State  Central  in Syria, represented by Katibah Nusantara, the IS military unit made up of fighters from Southeast Asia and led by Indonesian militant Bahrumsyah, likely the highest ranked member of IS from the region, it said. Bahrumsyah organized funding and helped find international recruits, liaising with Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, a former university lecturer and Islamic scholar believed to be in Marawi. Mahmud  controlled recruitment as well as financing and has been the contact person for any foreigner wanting to join the pro-ISIS forces in the Philippines , the report said. Tactical decisions on the ground were made by local militant commanders but the report said  the Syria-based Southeast Asians could have a say in setting strategy for (the) region when the siege is over.  The report warned the devastating damage to the city from  Philippines military air strikes was being exploited by militant ideologues. It cited a post on the social media platform Telegram, a message presumed to be from a militant, that said:  We did not bomb it to ashes .  We ordained good and forbade evil ... but the response of the Crusader Army was brutal.  The Philippines military has defended the use of air strikes in its offensive, noting that militant snipers positioned on top of buildings made it difficult for ground troops to make headway in the dense urban environment.

Toppling Zuma requires 50 of the 249 African National Congress members of parliament (MPs) to support the no-confidence motion and some have said publicly they want him removed, including former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, whose sacking in March triggered damaging debt ratings downgrades. South Africa's national assembly has 400 members. Malema, a firebrand politician known for his colorful language, said in an interview late on Thursday, he had received personal commitments that ANC MPs would dump Zuma. Malema, a former head of the ANC's Youth League before his expulsion from the party, could plausibly still have plenty of contacts in the organization.   I personally spoke to more than 60 MPs of the ANC who have committed that if we give them a secret ballot they will deliver,  Malema told Reuters in his office.   They've asked that this thing must be secret. They are not happy themselves,  said Malema, seated in front of an EFF sign featuring a clenched black fist holding a spear, super-imposed over an African map. Zuma faces the no-confidence motion on Aug. 8, the ninth time the opposition will have tried to unseat him by peeling off dissidents from the ruling party, whose majority has so far protected him. But unlike previous attempts, this time the vote may not be open. The Constitutional Court has cleared the way for the Speaker to allow a secret ballot, though it remains unclear she will. The ANC's official line is that the party will close ranks and back Zuma. Party officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Malema's remarks.     Growing Dissent Julius Malema, the head of South Africa's ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters party (EFF), gestures during an interview with Reuters in Johannesburg, South Africa, July 20,2017.Siphiwe SibekoANC MP Makhosi Khoza chose Nelson Mandela's birthday on Tuesday to denounce Zuma, making clear she would break party ranks.  If you see one person doing that under such a hostile environment you must know that she must have powerful backing. She has a lot of backing,  Malema said. One ANC MP has told Reuters they would vote for Zuma's removal and the South African Communist Party, whose 17 MPs back the ANC in parliament, said in April Zuma should resign. Tens of thousands of people took part in marches in April calling for Zuma, 75, to step down over a string of graft scandals and missteps as the economy is in recession and unemployment rising. Slideshow (2 Images)Malema, whose party supports expropriating white-owned land and the nationalization of mines and banks, said economic misrule under Zuma was deepening apartheid's racial disparities.  The problem is that as the gap widens the blacks become more poor and the whites become richer. As a result then we are two nations in one country, the rich people who are white and the poor people who are black,  he said. Malema said his party was still urging the landless to occupy unutilized land despite charges he faces for inciting property grabs.  It's an EFF resolution and that resolution has not been suspended by any court of law. We are calling upon our people to occupy the land,  he said. Malema formed the EFF, known for its trademark red berets and rowdy behavior in parliament, four years ago, and the party plans to hold a birthday bash next week in the port city of Durban in the heart of Zuma's Zulu political power base. Durban's streets that day will run red with cattle blood.  We are slaughtering 10 cattle because in our African culture it is not a celebration until there is slaughter. There must be some slaughter to thank the ancestors,  Malema said.   Editing by James Macharia and Robin Pomeroy","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-politics-malema-idUSKBN1A61AP"},

Friday's figures showed the rise in prices - fueled by the pound's drop that followed the 2016 vote to leave the European Union - has forced the government to pay more interest on its bonds, around a third of which is linked to inflation. Britain's budget deficit in June stood at 6.854 billion pounds ($8.92 billion), up 43 percent compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics, citing figures that exclude state-controlled banks. The shortfall for June was much bigger than a median forecast of 4.8 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists. In the first three months of the financial year, the budget deficit widened by 8.9 percent compared with the same period in 2016 to 22.8 billion pounds, the ONS said.  Today's figures illustrate the challenges confronting (Hammond) to manage the public finances, as he is faced with a double whammy of slowing growth and rising inflation on one side and calls for greater expenditure on the other,  said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.      Hammond has come under pressure from within the ruling Conservative Party as well as from the opposition Labour Party to loosen his grip on public spending, chiefly by relaxing a cap on pay for public workers. Spending on debt interest jumped an annual 33 percent to 4.9 billion pounds, the highest for any month of June since 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in inflation which has pushed up the cost of index-linked bonds for the government. Retail price inflation, the benchmark for these bonds, is running at a more than 5-year high. On Track? The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has predicted the budget deficit will amount to around 58 billion pounds by the end of the current financial year 2017/18, roughly 25 percent higher than in 2016/17. Despite a disappointing June, Hammond looks broadly on track to meet that goal, helped by the deficit in the previous financial year totaling 5 billion pounds less than the OBR assumed in March, PwC chief economist John Hawksworth said. June's deficit was also widened by higher payments to the European Union budget and bigger purchases of goods and services by the government.    Britain has been struggling to fix its public finances since the budget deficit surged to around 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 after the global financial crisis.  Since then it has been cut steadily to 2.4 percent of GDP in the 2016/17 financial year which ended in March, its smallest since before the financial crisis. But the deficit is expected to widen again to 2.9 percent GDP this year when Hammond will have fewer one-off factors to help him than last year. He is sticking to his plan to balance the budget by the middle of the next decade although he has some room for maneuver, allowing him to spend more if needed to support the economy as the country leaves the European Union.

Police had been investigating the unit, PT Indo Beras Unggul. They raided a warehouse in Bekasi near Jakarta over accusations it had bought lower quality rice labelled as premium rice when sold to consumers, national police spokesman Rikwanto said in a statement. Police were looking at whether laws, including the consumer protection law and the food law, had been broken, he said. If found guilty, employees could face up to five years in jail and the company could be fined up to 2 billion rupiah ($150,000).  We can confirm that our subsidiary PT Indo Beras Unggul (IBU) in Bekasi was recently inspected by Indonesian authorities. The company is fully cooperating and transparent with all of the relevant officials and is also undertaking an internal and external review to ascertain the facts,  Tiga Pilar said in a statement, adding it took  its commitment to its customers and obligations under the law very seriously . A spokesman for Indo Beras declined to comment. The repackaged rice was sold at 20,000 rupiah per kilogram whereas it should have sold for 9,000 rupiah, online news portal Tempo.co reported, citing police. National Police Spokesman Setyo Wasisto said a food task force had been set up with its main target to look at rice prices since the grain is a big component of inflation in Indonesia. He said the task force comprised mainly police officers, but was working with the agriculture ministry, the trade ministry and the anti-monopoly agency (KPPU). Wasisto said the investigation began three weeks ago and could examine the practices of other food companies.  If there are others doing this we'll take action,  he said.

Despite a law banning girls from marrying before they turn 18, the practice is deeply rooted in tradition and widely accepted in society. Yet it is rarely reported as a crime and officials are often reluctant to prosecute offenders. As a result, India ranks among countries with the highest rates of child marriage in the world, accounting for a third of the global total of more than 700 million women, according to UNICEF, the United Nations children's agency.  Despite the policy attention given to child marriage, implementation has remained ineffective in curbing the root causes, and failed to produce a substantial impact on its eradication,  charity ActionAid India said in its report.  Legal efforts have failed to break the stranglehold of tradition and culture that continues to support child marriage.  While boys also marry in childhood, girls are disproportionately affected. Early marriage makes it more likely that girls will drop out of school, and campaigners say it also increases the risks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death in childbirth. While poverty and low levels of female literacy are often blamed for child marriage, the practice is prevalent even in wealthy households. A report released last month showed nearly one in four girls in rural areas and one in five in urban areas married early, challenging a long-held assumption that child marriage is largely a rural phenomenon. This is why the government must be more innovative in getting the message out, using social media and school text books, and starting from a young age, ActionAid said. Boys and men must also be actively engaged, and religious and cultural institutions brought on board, too. Government school teachers should be given legal authority to rescue children at risk of child marriage, it said. Some recent efforts have helped, including a cash incentive, where the state transfers a lump sum to the girl's bank account if she remains in school and unwed at age 18. Community efforts have also succeeded: suppliers of wedding tents in Rajasthan state have stopped dozens of child marriages by alerting officials.

Many of the objects selected to feature in the display were chosen by Diana's sons Princes William and Harry  to reflect their mother's commitment to duty and their personal memories of her , the Royal Collection Trust said on Friday. Diana, the first wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 and a number of commemorative events have been planned to mark her death. William and Harry attended a private service earlier this month to re-dedicate her grave and the brothers have also commissioned a statue to be erected in her honor outside their official London home. Among the possessions to be featured in the display are a leather photo frame with pictures of family and friends, a burgundy leather briefcase, and her school  tuck box , which she used to keep sweets and other treats in while she was away at boarding school, which has the name  D Spencer  written on it. The tribute also includes a case of cassette tapes, featuring albums by artists such as George Michael, Diana Ross and Elton John, who famously sang at her funeral.  The exhibition opens on Saturday and visitors to the palace will also be able to see a collection of more than 200 gifts made to Queen Elizabeth during her 65-year reign including a paperweight made from a dinosaur bone and a Union Flag badge worn in space by British astronaut Major Tim Peake.

Initiatives from a new continental combat jet to a decision by Airbus (AIR.PA) to downgrade its UK representation, as well as the redeployment of some research projects, have left the $90-billion UK sector feeling increasingly sidelined. France and Germany last week announced plans for a joint fighter, catching many in Britain off guard. Though chiefly designed to rejuvenate the Paris-Berlin axis, the move has highlighted questions over Britain's place in the European powerhouse after Brexit and left its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) maneuvering for a place.  Everyone is now simply acting on the basis that Brexit has happened, and let's get on with life,  said former French security adviser Francois Heisbourg, chairman of think-tank IISS. The move coincides with plans by Franco-German-led Airbus to shake up its UK management.  Airbus Group UK President Paul Kahn is leaving as part of wider plans to shed management layers, Airbus said this week. Government affairs chief Katherine Bennett will run the Toulouse-based company's UK arm as senior vice president. Officially, the changes are nothing to do with Brexit. A top executive in Spain is also leaving the slimmed-down firm. But the four-nation giant is aware of the intense focus on Britain's role in flagship European ventures, while Airbus remains represented at more senior levels in France and Germany.  You couldn't say there is no link to Brexit,  a person familiar with the process said. The industry's ADS lobby, of which Kahn remains president, says aerospace and defense support 363,000 direct jobs in Britain and has warned against a 'hard Brexit' that could see trade tariffs and restrictions on movements of workers.    Airbus alone employs 12,000 in Britain where it builds wings for jetliners and campaigned to keep the country in the EU.     Although Bennett will report directly to CEO Tom Enders, Kahn's departure after three years deprives Britain of a strong voice inside Europe's largest aerospace group, insiders said. Drip Feed The reshaping of Airbus's UK presence does not end there. Industry sources say civil planemaking operations chief Tom Williams is unlikely to be replaced when he eventually retires, leaving a significant gap in the firm's UK profile. Williams, who turns 65 on Friday, is Airbus's  national representative  to Britain on key matters and has warned the country is entering a  dangerous phase  over Brexit. No departure date has been set for one of Britain's top industrial managers. Airbus declined to comment. In the long term, Britain faces competition for wings production when design starts on the next generation of Airbus jets next decade. Germany and Spain both want the work. For now, the chill toward Britain is felt mainly though a drip feed of small changes, though these collectively represent what one insider called an  insidious  threat to UK relevance. Britain will have less responsibility for Europe's Galileo satellite program. Some R&D; work has been removed from British universities. And plans for a small but symbolic  Cyber Lab  at Airbus in Britain have been shelved.  You are less likely to see UK leadership of projects with continental content. There will still be UK content but more likely under French or German leadership,  one source said. That partially reverses the trend of recent years with rotary wing research placed in Britain after Airbus recently won a major military services contract. Supporters say Britain remains attractive for investment, with public funding for new technologies and a weaker pound offsetting uncertainty over Brexit. Asked whether she feared a stronger Franco-German defense axis leaving Britain in the cold, Defence Procurement Minister Harriet Baldwin told Reuters:  Far from it ... We are very happy with how things are going with our European friends and allies.  Senior commentators are worried about the health of Britain's industrial base, however, especially if it fails to win a place in the planned Franco-German fighter program.  ...you have a certain critical mass of design and development engineers and if they are not fed with noble work they will dissipate over time,  said defense and aerospace consultant Brian Burridge, ex-commander of UK forces in Iraq. He likened this to years of under-investment in nuclear power stations, which saw Britain turn to foreign partners.  Just as we saw in our nuclear power-generation industry: if suddenly, for strategic reasons, you want to change your indigenous sovereign capability that would be very difficult.

With his 1,048th win, the 32-year-old surpassed former wrestler Kaio's record, in place since 2011.  The Mongolian - who was so small when he arrived in Japan at age 15 only a minor sumo 'stable' would take him in - also holds the record for the most number of tournament wins.  I'm glad that I was able to show this victory to the fans,  the 192cm-framed wrestler said, struggling to catch his breath after the historic win against his 'ozeki'-ranked rival.  If you put something into words, then it can come true. But you can also say my practice before this tournament and my body's condition led to this result.  The historic win came just 16 years after Hakuho's debut, versus the 23 years it took for the previous record holder.  Mongolian-born sumo grand champion Hakuho poses for a photo as he celebrates after he established all-time sumo record with his 1,048th win, at the 13rd day of the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Nagoya, central Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo July 21, 2017. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERSHakuho's success comes as foreign wrestlers increasingly dominate Japan's 15-century-old sport.  Three of the four wrestlers in the sport's top yokozuna rank are Mongolian. The fourth, Kisenosato, became the first home-grown grand champion in nearly two decades when he was promoted earlier in January.

Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERSDespite the prevalence of non-native 'rikishi', or wrestlers, the sumo association forbids foreign nationals from becoming sumo master, or 'oyakata' - a title that successful wrestlers often seek after they retire. Several local media reported on Friday that Hakuho plans to attain Japanese citizenship  in the near future  so he can be oyakata one day - a move that could stir controversy in his native Mongolia.  Hakuho's father is regarded as a national hero as the country's first-ever Olympic medalist, when he won silver for wrestling in 1968. Hakuho was rumored to be seeking an exception to the nationality rule given his achievements in the sport, while the sumo association has repeatedly said it would not change the rule. Six former rikishi have given up their original nationalities to become oyakata, since Japan does not allow adults to hold dual citizenship.

Euro/dollar has been the best performing pair in the G10 FX space so far this year, up more than 10 percent, but market watchers had been wary of pushing the single currency higher before the policy decision was released on Thursday. Concerns that the currency's strength would translate into a tightening of euro zone financial conditions - something policymakers have been wary about as they seek to protect an economic recovery - had prompted traders to take large bets on euro weakness in recent days, betting the rally wouldn't last. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that financing conditions remained broadly supportive, and noted that the euro's appreciation had  received some attention.  However, he did not cite that as a problem nor did he directly try to talk the currency down. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that by avoiding any direct statements on the euro's level,  Draghi has effectively removed the acceptable euro ceiling for the ECB.   Further EUR appreciation could become easier, as the ECB seems to have given up trying to control the currency,  they said in a daily note. The euro's 0.3 percent vault above $1.1650 in early trading on Friday meant that those holding currency options betting on a fall in the single currency after the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday faced heavy losses. It was up 0.2 percent at $1.16495 in midday trades. Of the 65 forecasts for the single currency before the ECB decision, only one - HSBC - was prepared to predict the euro would reach $1.20 this year. Now that level may be just a matter of time, according to some strategists.  If you look at the euro's strength through the prism of euro zone financial conditions, they still remain very accommodative and a test of the 1.20 line is on the cards though that may be taking it near the ECB's danger zone for tolerance,  said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London. Borrowing costs in the euro zone for households and companies remain near record lows according to official data, though the euro's rise would have offset some of those easy borrowing conditions. Notwithstanding the recent bounce in the single currency, analysts at Deutsche Bank say the euro still remains about 15 percent undervalued against the dollar on a purchasing parity basis, so there is more room for the euro to gain. The next target level for the euro was an August 2015 high at $1.17150, according to strategists. The euro's strength pushed the dollar to an 11-month low of 94.089 against a trade-weighted basket of other major currencies.

With a day off to lick their wounds, the Marlins begin a six-game road trip on Friday when they open a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds.  It wasn't a good homestand. It wasn't a good series. It wasn't a good start to the second half,  said Christian Yelich, who saw his team get outscored 36-18 - including 20-11 en route to dropping two of three to lowly Philadelphia - in the 1-5 stretch. Giancarlo Stanton went deep four times against the Phillies to push his home run total to a National League-best 30, and the slugger has five homers in 19 career games at Great American Ball Park. The venue hasn't done much to alter the fortunes of the Reds, who have been outscored 61-20 while going 1-6 on their current 10-game homestand.

The 25-year-old Dominican surrendered two homers in that contest and has been taken deep five times in 13 innings this month after keeping the ball in the park in each of his previous four trips to the mound. Urena doesn't have fond memories of Great American Ball Park, as he surrendered a grand slam and five runs total in an eventual 6-3 loss on Aug. 16. Bailey was blasted in his last outing on Sunday, yielding eight runs on as many hits in four innings of a 14-4 loss to Washington. The 31-year-old surrendered a pair of homers to Daniel Murphy in the shellacking and has been taken deep six times in his last four trips to the mound. Bailey looks to get back on track versus Miami, against whom he owns a 2-1 mark in eight career outings. Walk-Offs 1. Miami traded RHP David Phelps to Seattle on Thursday for four prospects, including highly touted OF Brayan Hernandez. 2.

Aaron Judge - who leads the majors with 30 homers - recorded an RBI single in the opener but is just 4-for-29 since the All-Star break. Thursday's defeat was only the second in the last eight contests for Seattle, which dropped 2 1/2 games behind the Yankees for the second wild card.

Despite the setback, the Tigers are only 5 1/2 games behind Central-leading Cleveland and own a better record inside the division (22-18) than any of their rivals.

Both teams have added reinforcements via the trade market this week, with J.D.

The Nationals had a six-game winning streak snapped with a 7-0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday but are 11 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta in the National League East. Arizona had lost five straight before taking two of three at Cincinnati earlier this week, outscoring the Reds 26-8 including a 12-2 rout in Thursday’s series finale, pulling the Diamondbacks even with Colorado atop the NL wild-card standings. Nationals ace Max Scherzer looks for his second win of the season against his former team, as he struck out 11 and limited the Diamondbacks to one run and two hits over seven innings on May 4 in Washington.

The 32-year-old threw six scoreless innings to win at Cincinnati on Saturday, striking out 10 while allowing three hits and four walks. Scherzer is 5-0 with a 2.41 ERA in six starts against Arizona. Godley’s scheduled start will be bumped up a day as the Diamondbacks juggle the rotation around the birth of Taijuan Walker’s first child.

Los Angeles' 11-game winning streak came to a crashing halt in Thursday's series opener as it fell behind early and went on to drop a 6-3 decision. Yasmani Grandal homered for the second time in three games for the Dodgers, who suffered their first overall defeat since July 2 and first at home since June 26. While Los Angeles still owns a 10 1/2-game lead in the National League West thanks to its current 31-5 stretch, Atlanta sits 8 1/2 out in the wild-card race.

Wood's incredible season continued Saturday as he scattered three hits over six scoreless innings in a victory at Miami.

The update contains no material changes to the criteria, and will have no impact on existing Country Ceilings. Country Ceilings capture the risk of capital and/or exchange controls being imposed that would prevent or significantly impede the private sector's ability to convert local currency into foreign currency and transfer the proceeds to non-resident creditors - transfer and convertibility (T&C;) risk. Country Ceilings are not ratings, but rather a key analytical input and constraint on the foreign-currency ratings of entities and transactions originating in the sovereign's jurisdiction. Fitch assesses the likelihood of the imposition of capital and/or exchange controls or a formal or informal moratorium on private-sector external debt by evaluating the incentives faced by the individual country's authorities to impose such controls and the costs and benefits involved. Country Ceilings are determined by sovereign rating committees for all countries with Fitch-rated sovereign issuers. The Country Ceiling is  notched  from the sovereign's Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), indicating the generally strong correlation between T&C; risk with sovereign risk. The relevant rating committee can decide a maximum uplift over the IDR of three notches, unless the ceiling concerns a member of a currency union or supranational monetary arrangement - when the maximum uplift is six notches. The committee's assessment is aided by the Country Ceiling Model (CCM), a simple scoring model with 16 input indicators that attempts to capture the costs and benefits - and therefore the incentives faced by the authorities in deciding whether to impose exchange and capital controls. The previous version of the criteria dated 16 August 2016 has been retired. The revised Country Ceilings Criteria is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link above.

With the outlook for euro zone inflation still cloudy, policymakers feel too little data will have become available by their Sept. 7 meeting. They are also nervous about making changes just two weeks before elections in Germany, the biggest critic of the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.7 trillion) money printing, the sources told Reuters.  Having been burned by a mini tantrum in financial markets last month when he raised the prospect of tightening, ECB chief Mario Draghi was keen to give as few hints as possible on Thursday about the ECB's next move, emphasizing instead the need for patience and persistence to lift inflation.  All the signs are pointing to October,  one of the sources said.  There will be little to decide on in September... and December is just too far out.  The ECB declined to comment. On Thursday, Draghi said that a decision would come in the autumn and that policymakers deliberately kept the date open. One of the sources pointed to second quarter wage data, due in the weeks after the Sept. 7 meeting, as a potentially vital piece of information. This makes Oct. 26 a more viable date.   It wouldn’t be smart to expect too much in September,  another source added.   Wages have been particularly troubling for the ECB. While growth is beating expectations and unemployment is coming down relatively quickly, wage growth remains muted, keeping a lid on inflation.  This apparent disconnect is likely due to more part-time and temporary work since the global financial crisis and ECB policymakers are still unsure at what point would wage growth kick in. Guidance A third source noted that discussions in the autumn would also involve a review of the ECB's guidance, its stance on the evolution of future policy steps.  This guidance puts interest rates at their current level until  well past  the end of bond purchases - a frame that was kept deliberately vague.  While this sequence is unlikely to change, the source said that the ECB could reassess what  well past  means and either tweak the wording or refine commentary to suggest this means months rather than years.  One of the sources said the Governing Council discussed Draghi's speech in Sintra, Portugal, where he opened the door to policy tweaks, and there was agreement to not walk back on that message. Investors before Thursday's meeting expected the ECB to decide in September, with most predicting the start of a gradual wind down of the program.  Indeed, Draghi has already noted that improving growth would by itself support lending, meaning the ECB could curb its own stimulus and maintain easy financing conditions.

Guidance A third source noted that discussions in the autumn would also involve a review of the ECB's guidance, its stance on the evolution of future policy steps.  This guidance puts interest rates at their current level until  well past  the end of bond purchases - a frame that was kept deliberately vague.  While this sequence is unlikely to change, the source said that the ECB could reassess what  well past  means and either tweak the wording or refine commentary to suggest this means months rather than years.  One of the sources said the Governing Council discussed Draghi's speech in Sintra, Portugal, where he opened the door to policy tweaks, and there was agreement to not walk back on that message. Investors before Thursday's meeting expected the ECB to decide in September, with most predicting the start of a gradual wind down of the program.  Indeed, Draghi has already noted that improving growth would by itself support lending, meaning the ECB could curb its own stimulus and maintain easy financing conditions.

Many of the objects selected to feature in the display were chosen by Diana's sons Princes William and Harry  to reflect their mother's commitment to duty and their personal memories of her , the Royal Collection Trust said on Friday. Diana, the first wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 and a number of commemorative events have been planned to mark her death. William and Harry attended a private service earlier this month to re-dedicate her grave and the brothers have also commissioned a statue to be erected in her honor outside their official London home. Among the possessions to be featured in the display are a leather photo frame with pictures of family and friends, a burgundy leather briefcase, and her school  tuck box , which she used to keep sweets and other treats in while she was away at boarding school, which has the name  D Spencer  written on it. The tribute also includes a case of cassette tapes, featuring albums by artists such as George Michael, Diana Ross and Elton John, who famously sang at her funeral.  The exhibition opens on Saturday and visitors to the palace will also be able to see a collection of more than 200 gifts made to Queen Elizabeth during her 65-year reign including a paperweight made from a dinosaur bone and a Union Flag badge worn in space by British astronaut Major Tim Peake.

U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges told Reuters the large-scale Saber Guardian war game conducted this summer with 25,000 troops and forces from 24 countries showed progress in the logistics needed to respond to a major military threat. Yet more needed to be done to ease the movement of military equipment and forces across Europe in the event of a real crisis, and Germany could play a crucial role, Hodges said in an interview. Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region changed NATO's calculations and triggered this year's rotational deployment of more than 4,500 troops in the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as Poland. The U.S. military and NATO have also increased the scope and complexity of war games and exercises aimed at increasing the ability of troops to respond quickly to threats. Hodges said Germany had shown  great leadership  in Europe and around the world, including its role in trying to end fighting in eastern Ukraine. But he echoed calls by U.S. President Donald Trump who has urged Germany, Europe's largest economy, to do more to bolster security, especially given its importance as a transit zone.  There's not enough rail capacity for U.S., German, Polish and British forces... or for the NATO VJTF rapid response force,  Hodges said.   We'd all be competing for the same rail cars.  Berlin could ensure guaranteed rail access as part of its bid to boost military spending from around 1.2 percent of gross domestic product to the 2 percent NATO target, Hodges said.  Spending more on short- and longer-range missile defense would also help, he said, noting the crucial role that German airports, seaports and other transportation routes would play in any real conflict. Hodges repeated his call for a military free transit zone modeled on the 1996 Schengen agreement that allows passport-free passage for travelers among 28 European countries.  In my view, we need something like a military Schengen zone that allows military formations to move around from Germany to Poland to Lithuania or to Romania through the Czech Republic quickly, and right now that's very difficult,  he said. Currently, military movements are difficult given differing legal requirements, and gaps in infrastructure, such as the fact that many bridges could not support the weight of a tank, and a NATO pipeline does not extend much beyond Berlin. Hodges downplayed the likelihood of an armed conflict with Russia, but said it was imperative to continue improving NATO's logistics to bolster deterrence.  They only respect strength and they despise weakness,  Hodges said.  If we look like we're not connected, that we're not unified, that we don't have capability, and that we cannot move quickly, then I think the potential of a miscalculation is higher.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to cut output by about 1.2 million bpd until March 2018  to reduce inventories and support prices. Compliance with the deal has been high so far but OPEC production has risen in recent weeks, in part on output from Libya and Nigeria, which were exempted from the pact due to conflicts which have curbed their production.  OPEC-14 supply is expected to exceed 33 million bpd in July which represents an increase of 145,000 bpd over June, driven by higher supply in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Nigeria,  Daniel Gerber, chief executive of Petro-Logistics, said in an email.  July volumes represent an increase of more than 600,000 bpd over the first-half 2017 average.  Petro-Logistics is among a number of consultancies that estimate OPEC supply by tracking tanker shipments. In June OPEC's output rose by 393,000 bpd to 32.611 million bpd, according to figures from secondary sources which the organization uses to monitor supply. That rise was led by Nigeria and Libya, with extra supply also from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

The Chinese group Speak Out was due to hold a conference in the city of Chengdu, in Sichuan province, on July 23. But the venue canceled the booking, citing conflicting events, the group said. It is not illegal to be gay in China but LGBT activists say deeply conservative attitudes toward homosexuality in some sections of society have led to occasional government clamp-downs. In May, the lesbian dating app Rela was shut down, though it was not yet clear why. Many people were surprised by the cancellation. Many young Chinese people regard Chengdu as  gaydu , or  the city of the gays , due to its liberal LGBT views.   The conference venue Jinsha theater told us that a government official activity was scheduled to be held on the same day, which left us with no choice but to cancel,  the founder of Speak Out, who gave his name only as Matthew, told Reuters.  An office administrator at the theater told Reuters she was not aware of the situation.  Speak Out ran into similar problems when it tried to organize a gay rights conference in the city of Xian in late May.  The local state security bureau in Chengdu has also been in touch with us by phone in recent days, asking questions such as what is our next move on the arrangement for any event and what we are going to talk about at the event,  Matthew said.  The Chengdu government information office could not be reached by telephone for comment.  The cancellation prompted hundreds of postings on the Weibo social media platform, with many people expressing sympathy.   Cheer up, the dawn comes after hard struggles in the dark. We shall see each other someday,  wrote one Weibo user.  Peng Yanhui, a prominent LGBT activist, was scheduled to call for an end to  gay therapy  at the conference.  Some gay people are forced by their parents or wives to be treated in hospitals where they are diagnosed as having  sexual preference disorder . Many are forced to take drugs or even undergo electro-shock treatments. In 2014, Peng sued a conversion therapy clinic over the suffering he went through and won. Authorities made the clinic remove advertisements for its service from the internet.  I felt very sorry for the cancellation,  Peng told Reuters.  Until 2001, China had regarded homosexuality as a mental disorder.

The single currency’s recent broad-based strength risks depressing import prices when inflation is still too low. Any hint that a stronger exchange rate could prompt European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to leave monetary policy loose for longer will force the euro back down again. The currency rose above $1.1670 for the first time in two years on Friday, extending gains triggered by Draghi’s press conference a day earlier. The reaction is odd, as the ECB chief said the central bank would be patient and prudent rather than rushing to scale back its bond-buying programme. Textbooks suggest loose monetary policy should boost fixed income securities but weaken the currency. Though euro zone bonds duly rallied, currency traders took a different view. One explanation is that foreign exchange markets took comfort from Draghi’s upbeat comments about the economy and his lack of any explicit concern about the euro’s recent gains. The single currency has risen by 5 percent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies since February and twice as much against the U.S. dollar. Asked about those moves, Draghi said only that the repricing of the exchange rate had “received some attention”. However, Draghi also said that the last thing the ECB wants is any tightening of financial conditions that might choke off the euro zone’s economic recovery. The rule of thumb is that a 10 percent rise in the euro’s trade-weighted value eventually shaves between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points off the inflation rate. That’s not what the ECB needs: prices rose just 1.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, still well below the central bank’s target of just under 2 percent. The more the euro strengthens, the greater the risk that the rally brings about its own reversal.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The United States imported an average of 524,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Saudi Arabia in the week ending July 14, the lowest volume for more than seven years (tmsnrt.rs/2vI1iE2). Imports from Saudi Arabia averaged just 810,000 bpd over the last four weeks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the slowest rate since January 2015. Crude arrives on supertankers carrying an average of around 2 million barrels so the weekly import numbers exhibit a lot of volatility linked to the timing of tanker arrivals. Imports are only reported to the U.S. Energy Information Administration when the crude has cleared U.S. customs so weekly volumes are sensitive to the precise timing of customs clearance. But there is no mistaking the downtrend in imports of Saudi Arabian crude since the start of June which seems set to continue until at least the end of August. On July 20, there were 15 very large crude carriers and 3 Suezmax tankers identified en route from Saudi Arabia to the United States, according to Kpler, a global cargo-tracking firm based in Paris. The number included some partially loaded tankers already off the U.S. coast waiting to complete discharging, according to an analysis by Kpler. There are also a couple of Saudi cargoes with unclear final destinations. But at the same point in 2016, there were 25 very large or ultra large crude carriers and 3 Suezmax tankers voyaging from Saudi Arabia to the United States. Saudi officials have openly discussed reducing shipments to the United States in recent weeks. Saudi crude exports to the United States will be below 800,000 bpd in August, a Saudi industry source familiar with production policy told Reuters ( Saudis to cut Aug oil exports to lowest level this year , Reuters, July 12). Crude and product stocks in the United States are the most transparent and high-profile element of global inventories thanks to the weekly records published by the EIA. Many traders and analysts use weekly stock data from the EIA as a proxy for changes in the global supply-demand balance, even though they may not be representative of the whole market. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies are keen to demonstrate to a skeptical market that output cuts are finally drawing down bloated stocks. So it makes sense to curb shipments to the United States to try to accelerate the reduction in the highly visible stocks held in North America. Crude and fuels markets are global not regional, and oil will find a way of flowing to where it is most needed or convenient to store. Total crude imports to the United States have fallen in recent weeks which, coupled with heavy refinery runs, has helped cut domestic crude stocks faster than normal for the time of year (tmsnrt.rs/2ugxa3b). But there are indications reduced Saudi shipments to the United States are being partially replaced by increased shipments from Iraq as refiners seek the closest alternative medium-heavy sour grades. And Saudi shipments have increased to India and Japan, according to vessels and cargoes tracked by Kpler, which may be offsetting some of the reduction to the United States.

The United States imported an average of 524,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Saudi Arabia in the week ending July 14, the lowest volume for more than seven years (tmsnrt.rs/2vI1iE2). Imports from Saudi Arabia averaged just 810,000 bpd over the last four weeks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the slowest rate since January 2015. Crude arrives on supertankers carrying an average of around 2 million barrels so the weekly import numbers exhibit a lot of volatility linked to the timing of tanker arrivals. Imports are only reported to the U.S. Energy Information Administration when the crude has cleared U.S. customs so weekly volumes are sensitive to the precise timing of customs clearance. But there is no mistaking the downtrend in imports of Saudi Arabian crude since the start of June which seems set to continue until at least the end of August. On July 20, there were 15 very large crude carriers and 3 Suezmax tankers identified en route from Saudi Arabia to the United States, according to Kpler, a global cargo-tracking firm based in Paris. The number included some partially loaded tankers already off the U.S. coast waiting to complete discharging, according to an analysis by Kpler. There are also a couple of Saudi cargoes with unclear final destinations. But at the same point in 2016, there were 25 very large or ultra large crude carriers and 3 Suezmax tankers voyaging from Saudi Arabia to the United States. Saudi officials have openly discussed reducing shipments to the United States in recent weeks. Saudi crude exports to the United States will be below 800,000 bpd in August, a Saudi industry source familiar with production policy told Reuters ( Saudis to cut Aug oil exports to lowest level this year , Reuters, July 12). Crude and product stocks in the United States are the most transparent and high-profile element of global inventories thanks to the weekly records published by the EIA. Many traders and analysts use weekly stock data from the EIA as a proxy for changes in the global supply-demand balance, even though they may not be representative of the whole market. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies are keen to demonstrate to a skeptical market that output cuts are finally drawing down bloated stocks. So it makes sense to curb shipments to the United States to try to accelerate the reduction in the highly visible stocks held in North America. Crude and fuels markets are global not regional, and oil will find a way of flowing to where it is most needed or convenient to store. Total crude imports to the United States have fallen in recent weeks which, coupled with heavy refinery runs, has helped cut domestic crude stocks faster than normal for the time of year (tmsnrt.rs/2ugxa3b). But there are indications reduced Saudi shipments to the United States are being partially replaced by increased shipments from Iraq as refiners seek the closest alternative medium-heavy sour grades. And Saudi shipments have increased to India and Japan, according to vessels and cargoes tracked by Kpler, which may be offsetting some of the reduction to the United States.

Yingluck, overthrown in a 2014 military coup, faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty in the trial which has been going on for 18 months. Friday was the last day for witness hearings. Yingluck can make a closing statement on Aug. 1, the court said. Yingluck and her Puea Thai Party say the trial is  politically motivated, aimed at discrediting a populist movement that has helped the Shinawatra clan win every election since 2001. Yingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra first introduced the rice program before he himself was ousted in a 2006 coup. Related CoverageThai court to deliver verdict in ex-PM's rice subsidy case on August 25: judgeBut Yingluck took it a step further by offering to buy rice from farmers at up to 50 percent above market prices. The measure helped her sweep to power in 2011, but government losses from the scheme - which also distorted global rice prices - fuelled protests that led to her removal. Yingluck, however, remains popular among her supporters, particularly in the northeast, Thailand's poorest region. Ousted former Thai prime minister Yingluck greets her supporters as she leaves the Supreme Court in Bangkok, Thailand, July 21, 2017.Athit PerawongmethaHundreds of supporters at the court cheered Yingluck at the court on Friday - defying junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha's request for her followers to stay away.  I hope Yingluck will not be found guilty so she can become prime minister again and bring back the rice scheme,  said Napa, a 56-year-old rice farmer from Ratchaburi province, west of Bangkok. She declined to give her full name. Slideshow (6 Images)Yingluck thanked her supporters, but gave no other comment.  The judges have dismissed a petition by Yingluck's legal team to have the case scrutinized by the Constitutional Court. The trial started in January 2016 after Yingluck's impeachment by the military-appointed Legislative Assembly in 2015. It effectively banned her from politics for five years for the alleged mismanagement of the rice scheme. If found guilty, Yingluck like her brother Thaksin, would be disqualified from becoming premier again. Thaksin has been living in self-imposed exile for 11 years to avoid serving a two-year sentence over a corrupt land deal.

Metso has been experiencing tough market conditions following miners' spending cuts and uncertainty over growth in top metals consumer China, but three months earlier the company said a gradual recovery was underway in the mining market. On Friday, Metso said orders fell two percent, while analysts had expected them to be flat. Metso's adjusted EBITA of 70 million euros ($81.5 million) fell 17 percent short of analysts' average expectations according to Thomson Reuters data.  The share price had already factored in a recovery underpinned by the order book, Morningstar analyst Jeffrey Vonk said.  Orders are definitely not good enough.  Since the company has reported order growth in the last two quarters, eventually those orders have to translate into revenues, he added. Metso is still factoring in a recovery, saying it expects demand for mining equipment to be  satisfactory , having previously said it expected demand to remain  weak . But Kepler Cheuvreux analysts said mining capital expenditure is unlikely to improve until the end of the decade. Swedish peer Atlas Copco forecast flat near-term demand on Monday on the back of the second-quarter results below forecast. Nico Delvaux from Atlas Copco is to replace the current Metso's CEO, Matti Kähkönen on August 1. Shares in Metso recouped some losses to trade down 7 percent at 0930 GMT.

Manufacturing-driven economies are actually looking better as compared to their commodity-driven peers due to some uncertainty over commodity prices for the rest of the year,  said Shim.     United Overseas Bank closed 1.35 percent higher, while real estate investor CapitaLand Ltd closed up 1.36 percent at a near three-month high.      Indonesian shares ended 1.03 percent lower, pulled down by financial and consumer discretionary shares. The benchmark index shed 1.1 percent in its worst week in six.      Recent optimisim over Indonesia's economy has been weighed down with concerns over commodity prices as well as government spending,  added Shim.

South Korean defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told a briefing the military talks proposed for Friday were practically impossible as the North had not responded. A concrete border is seen as a South Korean soldier stands guard at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea July 19, 2017.Kim Hong-Ji It is an urgent needed task for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula to restore dialogue in the military area and to ease military tension between the South and the North,  he said. Moon said the proposal for talks still stood and he urged the North to respond.     It was the first formal overture by South Korea since cross-border ties broke down early last year under the government of Moon's predecessor, who imposed unilateral sanctions on the North for its nuclear tests and missile launches. The North has conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests and a quick succession of missile-related activities since the beginning of 2016, after leader Kim Jong Un had pledged to improve ties with the South in a New Year's address. The South had proposed talks to discuss ways to end activities on the border that have fueled tension.

The Chinese group Speak Out was due to hold a conference in the city of Chengdu, in Sichuan province, on July 23. But the venue canceled the booking, citing conflicting events, the group said. It is not illegal to be gay in China but LGBT activists say deeply conservative attitudes toward homosexuality in some sections of society have led to occasional government clamp-downs. In May, the lesbian dating app Rela was shut down, though it was not yet clear why. Many people were surprised by the cancellation. Many young Chinese people regard Chengdu as  gaydu , or  the city of the gays , due to its liberal LGBT views.   The conference venue Jinsha theater told us that a government official activity was scheduled to be held on the same day, which left us with no choice but to cancel,  the founder of Speak Out, who gave his name only as Matthew, told Reuters.  An office administrator at the theater told Reuters she was not aware of the situation.  Speak Out ran into similar problems when it tried to organize a gay rights conference in the city of Xian in late May.  The local state security bureau in Chengdu has also been in touch with us by phone in recent days, asking questions such as what is our next move on the arrangement for any event and what we are going to talk about at the event,  Matthew said.  The Chengdu government information office could not be reached by telephone for comment.  The cancellation prompted hundreds of postings on the Weibo social media platform, with many people expressing sympathy.   Cheer up, the dawn comes after hard struggles in the dark. We shall see each other someday,  wrote one Weibo user.  Peng Yanhui, a prominent LGBT activist, was scheduled to call for an end to  gay therapy  at the conference.  Some gay people are forced by their parents or wives to be treated in hospitals where they are diagnosed as having  sexual preference disorder . Many are forced to take drugs or even undergo electro-shock treatments. In 2014, Peng sued a conversion therapy clinic over the suffering he went through and won. Authorities made the clinic remove advertisements for its service from the internet.  I felt very sorry for the cancellation,  Peng told Reuters.  Until 2001, China had regarded homosexuality as a mental disorder.

China funds filled the top five places in a league table of emerging equity funds based on Lipper performance data, and India strategies took the other slots in the top 10. It was a turnaround from the end of 2016, when Asia funds brought up the bottom of the rankings which were led by Russia- and Brazil-focused funds.  Russia funds are this year's worst performers. Emerging equities .MSCI rose over 17 percent in the first half of the year, attracting net inflows of $42.3 billion, according to EPFR Global. They had suffered outflows of $7.4 billion in the first six months of 2016. On average, global emerging equity funds tracked by Lipper delivered returns of 14.8 percent, versus 6.56 percent in the first half of 2016.   Chinese stocks .CSI300 gained almost 5 percent in June after MSCI's decision to include mainland A-shares in its emerging equity index fueled a buying spree. But Greg Kuhnert, manager of the Investec GSF All China Equity fund LP68316883, which topped the equity table with a return of over 35 percent, said the announcement was not really a factor in his outperformance.  Instead he cited overweights in consumer discretionary and tech stocks such as Geely Automobile Holdings (0175.HK) and Sunny Optical (2382.HK), which makes lenses for smart phone cameras. Kuhnert was  cautiously optimistic  for the second half despite China's debt burden, which he said the government was addressing:  Investors have been climbing a wall of worry on these issues for a very long time and valuations are cheap while earnings are recovering.  Brijesh Ved, lead advisor to Parvest Equity India LP65006550, which came sixth, also highlighted an expected earnings recovery in the second half, helped by the government's focus on infrastructure projects.  Indian stocks .NSEI have surged to record highs this year,  bouncing back from 2016's demonetization-led correction.  Ved said other reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax should also ultimately benefit listed companies, notwithstanding the potential for short-term disruption. Dollar Decline On the emerging debt side, local currency bond funds took nine of the top 10 places after the U.S. dollar fell almost 7 percent in the first half .DXY.  The U.S. dollar peaked in December 2016 approximately a month after (Donald) Trump was elected president. Since then (it) has sold off versus most developed and emerging currencies,  said Federico Garcia Zamora, manager of the BNY Mellon EM Debt Local Currency Fund LP65101664. Garcia Zamora's fund topped the Lipper table, returning 11 percent, compared with an average fund performance of 5.96 percent.  He has taken profits on some positions, reallocating to countries that lagged the emerging debt recovery. This meant cutting exposure to Russia and Brazil and adding South Africa, Turkey and the Czech Republic, he said. The only hard currency fund to make it into the top 10 was Vontobel's Emerging Markets Debt fund LP68212070 which tied for second place, returning 10.7 percent.  Manager Luc D'hooge said he had taken advantage of cheap valuations in Argentine and Mexican debt.  There were a lot of fears in the market at the end of last year and that created very nice opportunities,  D'hooge said, citing worries about hefty bond sales from Argentina and U.S. protectionist measures against Mexico   Mexico is still a very good credit – they have risks with the U.S., but the bonds sold off to levels that were ridiculous.  Emerging debt funds received net inflows of $43.9 billion in first six months of the year, according to EPFR Global. D'hooge said finding attractive opportunities was now more difficult than a year ago, when valuations were  screamingly cheap . Emerging economies' growth premium over developed peers is widening, tempting back investors after years of negative news:  That is driving flows and we are not at the end yet,  he said.

The 80-year-old lawmaker and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who was elected to a sixth Senate term last November, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. He is vowing a quick return to the Senate.

Asked how the Senate was different without McCain, his close friend Senator Lindsey Graham said:  It's quieter. John is a fighter and John's into every cause no matter how hard it might be.  A Russia hawk, McCain has expressed deep skepticism of Trump's effort to improve ties with Moscow, and emerged, with Graham, as perhaps the most vocal Republican critic in Congress of the president's foreign policy. He chairs the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. McCain has traveled the globe on trips some analysts say are efforts to soothe the concerns of U.S. allies that fear Trump's  America First  policy means a retreat from international engagement.  I realize that some of President Trump's actions and statements have unsettled America's friends,  McCain said in a speech in Australia in May.  They have unsettled many Americans as well.  McCain is also known for an independent streak and a willingness to work with Democrats. He has participated in almost every major bipartisan legislative effort in the Senate in recent years, such as the  Gang of Eight  immigration push in 2013. In 2015, McCain, who was tortured while a POW, worked with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein to pass legislation banning torture. This week, he called for a bipartisan effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system. Defense Spending While McCain has made clear his desire for more spending on defense, he has criticized what he sees as inefficiencies in U.S. weapons programs.

LCS has been one thing that has been in his sights, and arguably there has been an effect,  Cancian said. To carry out Trump's goal of repealing and replacing former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needs the backing of at least 50 of the 100 U.S. senators. Republicans control the Senate by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.

While the 80-year-old Arizona Republican, who was re-elected to a sixth Senate term in November, recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot found to be associated with the cancer, he and his medical team will explore treatment options.  That (recovery) usually takes about 10 to 14 days before starting therapy,  said Dr. Maciej Lesniak, chair of neurological surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a brain cancer with very poor prognosis that took the life of former U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy in 2009. Surgery is performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible, but cancer cells are left behind that infiltrate the brain and quickly grow. The survival rate with standard treatment is generally about 15 months, with only about 25 percent of patients alive after two years. Standard treatment is a combination of 30 doses of radiation administered over six weeks along with the oral chemotherapy Temodar (temozolomide) sold by Merck & Co. After a three-to-four week break, additional four-week cycles of Temodar are given. McCain has vowed to return to his Senate duties soon. Experts said he may well be able to do so. The treatment is usually very well tolerated, Lesniak said.  Generally, people can maintain normal quality of life during therapy including their work in the majority of cases.  Doctors interviewed who are not involved in McCain's care said further combination therapies were likely needed to sharply improve patient outcomes. Debates over when to begin such therapies are ongoing.  Many people feel we need to push the envelope and look at combination therapy as early as possible in addition to the standard of care,  Lesniak said. There are about 150 clinical trials for glioblastoma under way, most at very early stages, and the majority for patients for whom initial therapy has stopped working. McCain could be a candidate for a trial in newly diagnosed patients. 'No Two Tumor Cells Alike' Current immunotherapies that have shown great promise against melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers are unlikely by themselves to work in glioblastoma because the tumors tend not to present the proper target for those drugs.  Glioblastoma tumor cells are incredibly heterogeneous. No two tumor cells are alike,  said Dr. John de Groot, professor of neuro-oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, adding that a multi-pronged approach was likely needed. One promising approach being tested in early stage clinical trials by various institutions and companies involve injecting viruses into the tumor to destroy cancer cells and spur an immune system attack. Duke University generated publicity last year with reports of early success using the polio virus against brain cancer. MD Anderson developed a viral therapy that it outlicensed to a company called DNAtrix for further development, de Groot said. A trial at Northwestern is using neural stem cells to help improve the performance of a cancer-fighting virus.  Stem cells when loaded with the virus can travel to areas we can't resect to deliver the virus throughout the tumor mass in a more uniform fashion,  Lesniak said. In a study published in May in the journal Nature, Duke researchers reported early success with a vaccine that delivers high doses of Temodar to the tumor. Among 11 patients in that study, the median survival was 41.1 months, versus 14.6 months for the standard treatment. Dr. Roger Stupp, co-director of the Northwestern Brain Tumor Institute, who is credited with pioneering the radiation/Temodar combination therapy for glioblastoma, said patients like McCain might be helped by a now-approved device shown to extend survival. Called Optune and sold by Novocure Ltd, it delivers an electromagnetic field that interferes with cancer cells' ability to divide and survive, said Stupp, who led trials of the device. It involves electrodes placed on the scalp operated by a small battery pack. With Optune worn nearly 24 hours a day, the two-year survival rate in the trial that led to its approval jumped to 43 percent, with some patients living four years or more.  My recommendation is to use it early in the disease course,  Stupp said.

China funds filled the top five places in a league table of emerging equity funds based on Lipper performance data, and India strategies took the other slots in the top 10. It was a turnaround from the end of 2016, when Asia funds brought up the bottom of the rankings which were led by Russia- and Brazil-focused funds.  Russia funds are this year's worst performers. Emerging equities .MSCI rose over 17 percent in the first half of the year, attracting net inflows of $42.3 billion, according to EPFR Global. They had suffered outflows of $7.4 billion in the first six months of 2016. On average, global emerging equity funds tracked by Lipper delivered returns of 14.8 percent, versus 6.56 percent in the first half of 2016.   Chinese stocks .CSI300 gained almost 5 percent in June after MSCI's decision to include mainland A-shares in its emerging equity index fueled a buying spree. But Greg Kuhnert, manager of the Investec GSF All China Equity fund LP68316883, which topped the equity table with a return of over 35 percent, said the announcement was not really a factor in his outperformance.  Instead he cited overweights in consumer discretionary and tech stocks such as Geely Automobile Holdings (0175.HK) and Sunny Optical (2382.HK), which makes lenses for smart phone cameras. Kuhnert was  cautiously optimistic  for the second half despite China's debt burden, which he said the government was addressing:  Investors have been climbing a wall of worry on these issues for a very long time and valuations are cheap while earnings are recovering.  Brijesh Ved, lead advisor to Parvest Equity India LP65006550, which came sixth, also highlighted an expected earnings recovery in the second half, helped by the government's focus on infrastructure projects.  Indian stocks .NSEI have surged to record highs this year,  bouncing back from 2016's demonetization-led correction.  Ved said other reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax should also ultimately benefit listed companies, notwithstanding the potential for short-term disruption. Dollar Decline On the emerging debt side, local currency bond funds took nine of the top 10 places after the U.S. dollar fell almost 7 percent in the first half .DXY.

The Outlook on the IDR is Negative. The downgrade and the Negative Outlook reflect Ericsson's warning on a weaker equipment market in 2017, implying heavier pressure on revenue and operating profit. We believe the market outlook is likely to remain challenging for 2018, in view of the lack of clear revenue drivers in the short-to medium-term. We continue to see Ericsson as an investment-grade company. However, a significant financial recovery is unlikely before 2019 as we expect substantial restructuring charges to weigh on cash flow in both 2017 and 2018.The company's efforts to streamline operations and improve profitability involve considerable execution risks and  visibility is limited on its post-restructuring operating profile in a competitive telecoms equipment market. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Market Outlook: Ericsson is facing a negative market outlook for both 2017 and 2018, which will weigh on its revenue and margin and challenge its ongoing cost-restructuring programme. Visibility on the sector's market dynamics remains poor, while the lack of clear growth drivers makes a quick rebound unlikely. Steeper RAN Revenue Decline Forecast: Ericsson changed its outlook for the radio access network (RAN) market to high single-digit percentage revenue decline in 2017 from an earlier estimate of between -2% and -6%. We believe this change suggests a downward revision of the company's 2017 revenue expectations. Lower sales may also have an impact on gross margins in the most important networks segment if high-margin revenue from network capacity upgrades and licensing fees comes under pressure. The company reported that its 2Q17 gross margin declined to 30% from 33% in 2Q16, and its networks division revenue declined  14% yoy on a like-for-like basis. Furthermore, the company expects that it will shed up to SEK10 billion of low-margin revenue by 2019, as announced at its 1Q17 results release. Pressure on Cash Flow: We expect significant restructuring charges, planned short-term increases in R&D; spending, but also impact from the announced contract revisions to weigh on the company's cash flow in both 2017 and 2018. The company accelerated its cost-cutting ambitions with a view to to cutting SEK10 billion of costs over the next 12 months. However, this is likely to be achieved at significant cash restructuring costs, which we estimate at SEK7 billion in both 2017 and 2018, given a SEK3 billion carry-over from 2016, and assuming at least SEK3 billion of additional restructuring costs in 2018. Negative FCF Forecast: Also, the company estimates the cash impact from renegotiating some low profitable customer projects at up to SEK7.3 billion spread over a few years, but we believe the major portion of it will likely be front-loaded. As a result, we expect pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) to become negative in 2017, recovering to slightly positive in 2018. The announced change in the accounting treatment of some R&D; expenses that will be expensed from now on rather than capitalised previously has no impact on cash flow and is neutral to the ratings. Execution Risks: Ericsson's strategy to streamline operations, maintain technological leadership and double operating margin to above 12% after 2018 (6% in 2016) faces significant execution risks, in our view. The company has not yet reached a turn-around point in its financial and operating performance, which is reflected in the Negative Rating Outlook. Efforts to achieve positive momentum are likely to take time, so that Ericsson' credit profile is unlikely to become consistent with the mid-'BBB' rating for at least over the next 24 months. Supportive Industry Structure: The highly concentrated structure of the RAN market protects Ericsson from excessive competition. Although this benefit has been diluted by weak demand for additional network capacity on the back of strong capex discipline exhibited by most telecoms operators, the industry remains consistent with investment-grade ratings. The industry has consolidated to three main companies, with a limited threat of new entrants in the network equipment segment over the medium term. Fitch believes many telecoms operators would want to maintain at least two network supplier relationships. With some key regions effectively closed except to selected operators, further industry consolidation is unlikely, reducing M&A; risk. Ericsson is well-positioned in the mobile telecoms equipment market, and is likely to remain a key industry player, in our view. This backdrop is more consistent with an investment-grade rating. DERIVATION SUMMARY Ericsson is an established telecoms equipment manufacturer, with strong positions in mobile networks - a segment with three main companies with comparable market shares. A significant level of R&D; expenditure and wide service capabilities create barriers to entry in an industry that is intrinsically volatile and driven by technology upgrade cycles. A substantial net cash position helps the company withstand short-term pressures and adjust the business to rapidly evolving customer demand. Ericsson is less diversified and more focused on the mobile network segment than Huawei and Nokia Corporation (Nokia) (BB+/Positive). It lags behind Nokia in cost-cutting, which started an ambitious restructuring programme following its merger with Alcatel. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Double-digit revenue decline in 2017, followed by a high-single-digit decline in 2018; - Cash restructuring costs of SEK7 billion in 2017, and similar restructuring charges in 2018 reflective of carry-over effects; - SEK3 billion of restructuring costs per annum viewed as likely recurring and treated before FFO in the medium-term, including in 2019 and 2020; - Strong dividend discipline, in view of significant strategic challenges; - Maintenance of a healthy net cash position. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action The Outlook may be revised to Stable if the company's revenue and EBIT declines slow and the company's pre-dividend FCF turns positive on a sustained basis, while a substantial net cash position is being maintained on its balance sheet. The industry fundamentals imply intrinsically volatile revenue and rapidly changing technology cycles, making an upgrade to 'BBB' unlikely in the medium term and dependent on developments such as: -Strong market positions in key targeted segments together with improved visibility of revenue and profitability of the global telecoms equipment market; -Pre-dividend FCF margin consistently above 5%; - Maintenance of a strong net cash balance sufficient to withstand short- to medium-term revenue pressures. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Deteriorating market share and increased industry competition, leading to further pressure on Ericsson's revenue and cash flow generation. -Pre-dividend FCF margin expected to be consistently negative. - A change in financial policy leading to a balance sheet that is managed close to a net debt basis. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Despite negative FCF forecast for 2017, Ericsson's liquidity is strong, with readily available cash of SEK50.1 billion (assuming SEK4.2 billion of restricted cash) at end-2Q17 comfortably covering SEK3.2 billion of current debt redemptions.

Benchmark palm oil prices are expected to decline in the second half of the year as production sees seasonal gains. Palm has shed about 17 percent of its value so far this year, and was last down 0.4 percent at 2,566 ringgit ($598.83) per tonne on Friday afternoon. [POI/]  The price differential between palm oil and soyoil on the Chicago Board of Trade, also known as the spread, is currently around $150 a tonne, soyoil's widest premium over palm in a year.  The spread between Malaysian palm olein, or refined palm oil, and U.S. soybean oil for export is $166 per tonne. Against Argentine soybean oil, Malaysian palm olein prices are trading at a roughly $90 per tonne discount.     Soyoil prices have risen 7 percent since the start of June on reports of dry weather damaging crops in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   The wider spread explains why China and Europe are buying more palm... They use more soybean oil, so when the spread widens, they have no choice but to buy palm,  said Brandon Chia, an institutional dealer at Kuala Lumpur-based brokerage Okachi Malaysia.   Soy will remain strong due to the dry weather forecasts. As long as soy remains strong, the spread should remain wide.  Malaysia's palm oil shipments to Europe rose during July 1-20, showed data from two cargo surveyors, up between 38-58 percent from the corresponding period last month, while exports to China surged 37-120 percent.  Low levels of palm oil at Chinese ports are also supporting its demand, as buyers in the world's second largest palm oil consumer replenishes stocks and ramps up consumption during the summer season.   Port stocks in China have been declining since May, and are currently at their lowest levels since the start of the year.  China had held off buying palm oil as ample supplies of alternative edible oils such as soy and rapeseed flooded local markets.  Stocks of palm oil in China are low and we have good demand during the summer here. Import numbers for the next one to two months are looking pretty good,  said a Shanghai-based analyst at an asset management firm.    Although we have big soyoil stocks and bigger soybean crush in the future, the seasonal high vegetable oil demand will support vegetable oil prices,  the analyst said, adding that he expected to see large volumes of palm oil consumption from July to September.

Speaking to troops fighting pro-Islamic State militants on the southern island of Mindanao, Duterte said he would order an offensive against the New People's Army (NPA) after Marawi City is back under government control.  I do not want to talk peace,  Duterte, dressed in a camouflage outfit and combat boots, said on Thursday at an army brigade headquarters about 2 km (a mile) from the battle area.       No more talk, let us fight,  Duterte told businessmen in southern Davao City in a speech on Friday. Automatic gunfire and artillery shelling were heard during the president's four-hour visit, which was kept secret for security reasons. He distributed watches and supplies and promised soldiers pistols, body armor and other equipment.  There is a resurgence in communist activities, and after you finish here, we will re-orient and go after them,  he said, adding that the communist rebels had taken advantage of the crisis with Islamists to attack government forces in Mindanao. A municipal police chief was among six police killed by Maoist-led guerrillas in an ambush on their way to investigate a report of a shooting in the central Philippine town of Guilhungan on Negros Island.

The peace process with the communists, an initiative important to Duterte, has been fraught with breakdowns, with both sides blaming each other for attacks launched during talks. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte arrives at the military camp in Marawi city, southern Philippines July 20, 2017. Malacanang presidential palace/Handout via ReutersDuterte's top peace adviser, Jesus Dureza, canceled informal talks with the National Democratic Front, the rebels' political arm, set for the weekend in the Netherlands after several guerrilla attacks.

Fierce competition has resulted in insurance rates either stagnating or falling over the past few years, leading Beazley to invest in growing its U.S. specialty lines business, which carries out professional and management liability for mid-sized and small companies.  Beazley said on Friday that its first half profit had risen 6 percent to $158.7 million, driven by growth in its U.S. specialty business and investment gains.  That was despite premium rates for all of its businesses falling by 2 percent.   The reason we're focusing on specialty lines above the others is generally the rating environment in specialty lines is better than in the property, reinsurance and marine lines,  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Horton told Reuters. Horton said rates in specialty lines have held up over the past few years after all the claims it saw following the financial crash of 2008. Last year, Beazley brought on a team of underwriters to focus on writing specialty line insurance outside the United States, with a specific focus on Europe.  Specialty lines currently account for between 45-50 percent Beazley's revenue and Horton sees the business' contribution hitting the 55 percent mark over the next few years. Expansion Plans The company also received approval to convert its Dublin-based reinsurance company into an insurance company, as part of its European expansion plan and Horton said on Friday that the company hopes to start writing European business on both its insurance company and Lloyd's balance sheet.  Horton said the company had applied for branches in Spain, France, Germany and the UK and expected those to be set up in a couple of months.  By the end of the third quarter, our aim is to be quoting business in the specialty lines arena across Europe,  he said, adding that the moves were not a result of Brexit, which has prompted many financial firms to set up European operations amid concern the UK exit could hamper trade.   It was not a Brexit plan. Now of course with Brexit having happened, its much better having the insurance company in Ireland than it would be having it in the UK,  Horton said.

Lasitskene won gold at the 2015 world championships under her maiden name Kuchina but the doping scandal that was already enveloping the sport in Beijing means she will not be wearing her country's colors when she defends the title in London. The 24-year-old is one of 47 Russians cleared this year to compete as neutral athletes despite the ongoing suspension of the country's federation over a 2015 report that alleged state-sponsored doping. This special status has been viewed as an affront to Russian patriotism, prompting some to question the loyalty of the athletes. The athletes have had to prove to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) that their training environment meets its anti-doping standards, and that appears to have also satisfied Lasitskene's rivals.  I'm pretty sure there were some rigorous standards for her to have to get through to be able to compete,  former world indoor champion Chaunte Lowe told Reuters.  If she's there, I'm sure she deserves to be there.     Lasitskene said she had not  heard anything bad  and even if some of her rivals have made clear their disgruntlement in private, it has clearly not affected her form. The former Youth Olympic champion has dominated her event this year and is unbeaten in 19 competitions, indoors and outdoors. Earlier this month at a Diamond League meet in Lausanne she jumped a personal best of 2.06 meters, three centimeters off the world record set by Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova in 1987. While the Russian authorities have deplored the absence of the country's flag from major track and field meets, they have generally supported the efforts of athletes to compete as neutrals.  Even if she competes under the neutral flag, everyone perfectly knows that she is from Russia,  Yury Borzakovsky, head coach of the national athletics squad, told Reuters.  And she will prove to the whole world that everything has changed.  Russia has recently ramped up its efforts to overturn the bans against its athletics federation, its Paralympic Committee and its national anti-doping agency RUSADA. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last month allowed RUSADA to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts, a key step for the agency to be reinstated. The Russian government this month approved a plan to curb the use of performance enhancing drugs, while President Vladimir Putin barred dopers and their coaches from receiving Kremlin grants. The impact of the ban on athletes like Lasitskene is undeniable, however, tearing nearly a year and half out of their careers and preventing them from competing in the Olympics and lucrative Diamond League meetings last year.   Had there been a 2016 season, maybe the results now would be different,  Lasitskene said.   But that's a 'what-if'. We accepted this situation, trained and didn't give up.  Lasitskene is the only woman who has jumped 2.00 meters this year, clearing the height 10 times since the IAAF allowed her to compete in April.  We have been advocating that high results can be achieved cleanly,  Borzakovsky said.   Maria is a bright example of this.  Lowe thinks Lasitskene can hit new heights in London, where she will be seeking to join Croatian Blanka Vlasic and South African Hestrie Cloete as the only women to have retained the high jump world title.  It's like her coming of age party,  the American said.  She always showed she had that talent and now she kind of went over the threshold to being known among the top high jumpers of all-time.

Few key data points will become available before the September 7 meeting and policymakers may also be nervous about making key changes before elections in Germany, the biggest critic of the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro quantitative easing (QE), the sources told Reuters.  All the signs are pointing to October,  on of the sources said.  There will be little to decide on in September... and December is just too far out.  The ECB declined to comment. On Thursday, ECB President Mario Draghi said that a decision would come in the autumn and that policymakers deliberately kept the date open. Facing weak inflation and accelerating growth, the ECB needs to resolve a dilemma in the coming months as its 60 billion euro per month asset buys are set to run only until the end of the year. Indeed, Draghi has already noted that improving growth would by itself support lending, meaning the ECB could curb its own stimulus and still keep the level of accommodation unchanged. That has fuelled expectation for an imminent decision and analysts prior to Thursday's meeting had honed in on September as the most likely date.  It wouldn’t be smart to expect too much in September,  another source added.

The photograph is meant to portray a young, modern leader who is also the heir of the general who led resistance to Nazi Germany in World War Two and founded the Fifth Republic in 1958. Cultivating this image from day one of his presidency, Macron rode up the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on May 14 in a military jeep instead of the traditional limousine. He later tweeted a picture of himself being lowered on a winch into a nuclear submarine, and this week forced his military chief of staff to quit for criticizing budget cuts. Macron used the departure of General Pierre de Villiers to show he will brook no dissent from those around him and the depth of his resolve to enforce public spending discipline.  But his action has alarmed military chiefs and highlighted a risk that his strategy could backfire by making him look authoritarian, over-controlling and oversensitive to criticism.  Emmanuel Macron is very keen to take on the clothes of General de Gaulle, he has understood very early on what he had to gain from a personal investment in the military field,  Jerome Fourquet of pollster Ifop told Reuters.  But although he has scored points on the international scene and domestically by showing there's a man at the helm, it's unclear whether public opinion will consider this episode as an example of his capacity to decide, or a case of authoritarianism and an admission of weakness.   Jupiterian  Macron, a centrist, has deliberately chosen a style that sets him apart from predecessors who, according to his staff, he believes had deeply flawed presidencies -- Socialist Francois Hollande and conservative Nicolas Sarkozy. Hollande portrayed himself as the  normal president  during his 2012-2017 term but many voters thought his approachability made him look weak. Voters' memories of the  hyper-president  style adopted by Sarkozy, who preceded Hollande, and widespread dislike of his impulsive and sometimes brash personality scuppered his chances of re-election.  Macron, 39, has reduced interaction with the media, scrapping the off-the-record chats which Hollande liked and cancelling the television interview the president traditionally gives on Bastille Day, France's national day.      We don't want to shut down, but we think responsibility does not necessarily come with what I won't call transparency, but what I will call a total unveiling of the president's each and every move,  a source close to Macron said. On the sidelines of summits, Macron has also refused to answer questions about judicial investigations targeting his ministers. Instead, he tweets and broadcasts videos on Facebook Live that have been filmed by his own media team. FILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron waves from his car on the Champs Elysees avenue after the handover ceremony in Paris, France, May 14, 2017.Francois Lenoir/File Photo We've gone from the extreme permissiveness of Hollande -- during whose term the Elysee was a bit like an open house for the media -- to the exact opposite with Macron, who wants extreme control of every content that comes out of the Elysee,  said Thomas Guenole, a political analyst with Sciences-Po university in Paris. Though he made his name as Hollande's economy minister by speaking out of turn and outside his brief, he has muzzled his own ministers. They rarely appear on television and do not respond to reporters waiting in the Elysee palace courtyard after weekly cabinet meetings, rushing into their chauffeured cars without a word.   Macron has even proofread some ministers' interviews for the press, including one by his veteran foreign minister, a source with knowledge of the matter said.   He has also decided to cap the number of staff each minister can have at 10, curtailing the ministers' political autonomy and forcing them to rely more on bureaucrats.  Staff members are a minister's army. He has sucked out all that was political in politics, the technocracy has tightened its grip,  a former Socialist government advisor told Reuters. Slideshow (6 Images)Macron has also launched a review of the top 180 heads of administrative departments, who may be asked to go before the end of year. Paradox   To be sure, although his team was drawn from across the political spectrum, Macron has avoided the public disagreements between ministers that marred Hollande's first years in office. He has broadly reconciled company bosses with the government and talks on pro-business labor reform have run smoothly so far, without the violent public protests seen under Hollande.  The public has welcomed his performances on the world stage -- from a public rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump over climate policy to his decision to host him for Bastille Day and hold a lavish reception for Russian President Vladimir Putin. But critics see a danger in what they regard as the over-centralization of power in the president's hands and weak checks and balances in a country where the executive holds sway over parliament and the press is sometimes seen as deferential. Hollande's last hopes of winning a second term were ended by a series of interviews with two journalists which were published as a book,  A President Shouldn't Say That . Co-author Fabrice Lhomme says Macron may have gone too far in the other direction.  That's the paradox of 'Macronism': he embodies novelty -- by his age, the path he has taken -- but conversely he uses methods from another era,  Lhomme told Reuters.  He runs the risk of isolation, that of a man who exercises power with only a few close advisers, who doesn't listen to contradiction. He could run into trouble, not immediately but in a couple of years, when he's cut off from reality.   A BVA poll published this week showed Macron's popularity rating was down 5 points on a month earlier to 54 percent.   His Jupiterian approach is perceived by some as a monarchical drift,  the pollster wrote, adding a warning that those against Macron had criticized his  arrogance, authoritarianism, and contempt for the working class.

Research and advisory firm Outsell predicts corporate budgets for business-to-business events in the giant U.S. market will grow 4 percent to $28 billion this year, outpacing overall growth in advertising budgets of 3.5 percent. London-listed Informa, UBM and ITE are among firms organizing events around hot trends such as China's baby boom or cybersecurity.   I don't believe in trade magazines anymore. I don't think anyone ever gets past the polythene. The magazine gets delivered but nobody ever opens it,  said Toby Roberts, whose firm Safety Media runs health and safety courses. Speaking to Reuters at UBM's IFSEC, Europe's largest security event, he said:  There are few ways to get in front of our prospects (and) exhibitions are a great way to get as many people as possible.   Safety Media, which has a 4 million pound turnover, spends half its marketing budget on this exhibition, which last year helped it get 380 leads. While the battle between traditional and online media outlets has grabbed headlines, companies are often skeptical that advertising with either translates into sales -- hence the shift towards events that allow face-to-face contact with potential customers, competitors and talent.  The reality is (other forms of marketing are) getting a lot more mysterious. If you have a marketing budget of a million pounds, half of it is wasted but you don't know what half,  said Errol Taylor, an exhibitor at one of IFSEC's sister events and CEO for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The global events market was worth $25.6 billion in 2015, according to research firm AMR International, which predicts the industry will expand by about 4.6 percent annually to 2020.  The competition is for businesses' marketing budgets,  said Charlie McCurdy, global head of exhibitions at Informa, whose exhibitions unit currently targets annual revenue growth of more than 5 percent versus 3 percent for the group overall.  According to AMR, between 65 and 75 percent of exhibitors at shows like IFSEC take stands every year and such events are highly cash-generative, allowing the likes of Informa and UBM to grow through consolidation. Randy Giusto, Outsell's lead analyst for media, advertising and marketing, said companies were increasingly focusing on online and exhibitions as a way of reaching clients.   We're seeing marketing spending and advertising spending growth start to slow this year ... but it is not as impacting on events, (which) scores relatively high on both regeneration and brand-building,  he said.  Bigger Is Better With the events market split roughly 40 percent Americas, 40 percent Asia Pacific and 20 percent Europe, Africa and Middle East, London-listed events firms are pursuing a global strategy. Informa and UBM have each bought up smaller events and exhibitions to fold into their biggest sector shows as well as taking their largest brands into newer geographies. IFSEC, for example, is now an amalgamation of six trade shows that together draw in over 41,000 visitors, said Simon Mill, UBM's group director, protection & management series. People visit CosmeticTek and PharmaTek China exhibition at Shanghai New International Expo Centre in Shanghai, China July 13, 2017.Aly SongUBM launched its large European pharmaceutical event CPhI in North America this year, while Informa has taken its Dubai-originated event Arab Health to other markets such as Africa, Singapore and the United States.  We're looking at other locations around the world,  McCurdy said.  Building on the brand and presence we have in Dubai, and the experiences (of) our suppliers ... we helped them increase their access to markets around the world.  The industry's prospects are closely linked to overall economic performance, while specific events can be affected by changes in individual countries. India's demonetization drive has impacted jewelry shows there, for example, while restrictions imposed on travel to the United States from some countries are a headache for technology industry events. That reinforces the importance of having a wide geographic spread and top events that most exhibitors will not forego.  Provided that you have strong events in a (sector) in a geography, what tends to happen is that because trade shows are so important, exhibitors still exhibit in 'down' times,  UBM Chief Financial Officer Marina Wyatt said.   But they may take a smaller booth so you need to work harder at selling, you need to get more exhibitors.  Slideshow (5 Images)UBM strengthened its events portfolio by purchasing AllWorld, which organizes exhibitions in Asia, and U.S. fashion events organizer Advanstar, while Informa bought U.S. trade show operator Hanley Wood Exhibitions in 2014. Lone Wolf ITE has focused less on diversity and its shares have underperformed those of UBM and Informa. Valued at 870 million pounds three years ago, it has lost over half its value due to its concentration on a few geographies and even smaller events in sometimes troubled markets such as Ukraine and Turkey. Earlier this year, ITE announced a new strategy that will broaden its footprint beyond the emerging markets.  It's very clear that customers want more and more market-leading shows and we're now not focused by geography, but rather by product. That's a big evolution of our strategy,  ITE co-founder and newly-appointed chief executive Mark Shashoua said. Shashoua was previously head of i2i Events, now known as Ascential Events. Describing the company as  sector-agnostic , he said  we're creating a blueprint that will be the ITE way and that blueprint will then be executed to any event . Its rivals have also shown they are prepared to junk or reinvent events as consumer trends change.  Ascential said in June that it would set up an advisory committee to shape the future of the world's biggest annual advertising industry conference in Cannes after criticism from industry giants WPP and Publicis.   The two advertising firms said the event had become costly and too scattered as deep-pocketed tech giants such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google take a greater part, and should refocus on promoting agencies' creativity. A similar situation saw UBM reinvent its IT event Interop to focus on a niche area after consolidation in the industry reduced the number of exhibitors. UBM said it also continuously sells events it deems 'non-core'.    Events is, as an industry, relatively resilient,  UBM's Wyatt said.

It had initially set itself a 3 year deadline to sell all of Popular's bad property assets, one of the factors that brought down the 90-year-old lender. The sources said private equity funds Blackstone, LoneStar and Apollo were invited to submit binding bids for a 51 percent stake in the portfolio, which includes repossessed assets worth 18 billion euros and 12 billion euros in non-performing loans. With a coverage ratio for losses of 69 percent and a net value of 9.2 billion euros, offers are expected in the ball park of 5 billion euros, although the final price will not be set until a comprehensive due diligence has been completed, the sources said.

Poland's senate was expected to back new powers to enable politicians to appoint supreme court judges, defying the protesters massed in the streets overnight to decry what they see as a move towards authoritarian rule.     Mateusz Sutowicz, an analyst at Warsaw-based Bank Millennium, said the zloty's weakening was partly due to the political turmoil but also due to the strong euro.      The weakening of the zloty is a result of the strong euro  after comments from (ECB chief) Mario Draghi, a technical correction... and partially a result of the current domestic political situation,  he said.     At 0812 GMT, the zloty was trading half a percent lower, while the Hungarian forint, which hit an 8-month highs versus the euro on Thursday, was down 0.1 percent. The Czech crown was also down 0.1 percent.     The forint had led east European currencies higher on Thursday after the European Central Bank left its ultra easy monetary policy stance unchanged.     The ECB's monetary stimulus has boosted Central Europe's emerging assets in recent years. Investors in this part of the world focus on the policy of the ECB but also watch the Fed and U.S. long-term debt yields.      Yesterday's ECB policy meeting was somewhat neutral for domestic markets, despite the possibility of tapering likely to surface again come autumn,  ING said in a note.      That said, in our view, ECB President Mario Draghi still sounded cautious enough to avoid weighing on emerging market currencies, particularly CEE FX. This creates a supportive backdrop for regional currencies in the upcoming period.      Healthy economic growth and stability have underpinned the region's currencies even though the region's central banks are unlikely to lift interest rates this year, except for Czechs.     Stock markets were mostly in positive territory on Friday.     Shares of Unipetrol on the Prague bourse hit their highest since February 2008 after strong second-quarter results, and were up 1.6 percent.

Research and advisory firm Outsell predicts corporate budgets for business-to-business events in the giant U.S. market will grow 4 percent to $28 billion this year, outpacing overall growth in advertising budgets of 3.5 percent. London-listed Informa, UBM and ITE are among firms organizing events around hot trends such as China's baby boom or cybersecurity.   I don't believe in trade magazines anymore. I don't think anyone ever gets past the polythene. The magazine gets delivered but nobody ever opens it,  said Toby Roberts, whose firm Safety Media runs health and safety courses. Speaking to Reuters at UBM's IFSEC, Europe's largest security event, he said:  There are few ways to get in front of our prospects (and) exhibitions are a great way to get as many people as possible.   Safety Media, which has a 4 million pound turnover, spends half its marketing budget on this exhibition, which last year helped it get 380 leads. While the battle between traditional and online media outlets has grabbed headlines, companies are often skeptical that advertising with either translates into sales -- hence the shift towards events that allow face-to-face contact with potential customers, competitors and talent.  The reality is (other forms of marketing are) getting a lot more mysterious. If you have a marketing budget of a million pounds, half of it is wasted but you don't know what half,  said Errol Taylor, an exhibitor at one of IFSEC's sister events and CEO for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The global events market was worth $25.6 billion in 2015, according to research firm AMR International, which predicts the industry will expand by about 4.6 percent annually to 2020.  The competition is for businesses' marketing budgets,  said Charlie McCurdy, global head of exhibitions at Informa, whose exhibitions unit currently targets annual revenue growth of more than 5 percent versus 3 percent for the group overall.  According to AMR, between 65 and 75 percent of exhibitors at shows like IFSEC take stands every year and such events are highly cash-generative, allowing the likes of Informa and UBM to grow through consolidation. Randy Giusto, Outsell's lead analyst for media, advertising and marketing, said companies were increasingly focusing on online and exhibitions as a way of reaching clients.   We're seeing marketing spending and advertising spending growth start to slow this year ... but it is not as impacting on events, (which) scores relatively high on both regeneration and brand-building,  he said.  Bigger Is Better With the events market split roughly 40 percent Americas, 40 percent Asia Pacific and 20 percent Europe, Africa and Middle East, London-listed events firms are pursuing a global strategy. Informa and UBM have each bought up smaller events and exhibitions to fold into their biggest sector shows as well as taking their largest brands into newer geographies. IFSEC, for example, is now an amalgamation of six trade shows that together draw in over 41,000 visitors, said Simon Mill, UBM's group director, protection & management series. People visit CosmeticTek and PharmaTek China exhibition at Shanghai New International Expo Centre in Shanghai, China July 13, 2017.Aly SongUBM launched its large European pharmaceutical event CPhI in North America this year, while Informa has taken its Dubai-originated event Arab Health to other markets such as Africa, Singapore and the United States.  We're looking at other locations around the world,  McCurdy said.  Building on the brand and presence we have in Dubai, and the experiences (of) our suppliers ... we helped them increase their access to markets around the world.  The industry's prospects are closely linked to overall economic performance, while specific events can be affected by changes in individual countries. India's demonetization drive has impacted jewelry shows there, for example, while restrictions imposed on travel to the United States from some countries are a headache for technology industry events. That reinforces the importance of having a wide geographic spread and top events that most exhibitors will not forego.  Provided that you have strong events in a (sector) in a geography, what tends to happen is that because trade shows are so important, exhibitors still exhibit in 'down' times,  UBM Chief Financial Officer Marina Wyatt said.   But they may take a smaller booth so you need to work harder at selling, you need to get more exhibitors.  Slideshow (5 Images)UBM strengthened its events portfolio by purchasing AllWorld, which organizes exhibitions in Asia, and U.S. fashion events organizer Advanstar, while Informa bought U.S. trade show operator Hanley Wood Exhibitions in 2014. Lone Wolf ITE has focused less on diversity and its shares have underperformed those of UBM and Informa. Valued at 870 million pounds three years ago, it has lost over half its value due to its concentration on a few geographies and even smaller events in sometimes troubled markets such as Ukraine and Turkey. Earlier this year, ITE announced a new strategy that will broaden its footprint beyond the emerging markets.  It's very clear that customers want more and more market-leading shows and we're now not focused by geography, but rather by product. That's a big evolution of our strategy,  ITE co-founder and newly-appointed chief executive Mark Shashoua said. Shashoua was previously head of i2i Events, now known as Ascential Events. Describing the company as  sector-agnostic , he said  we're creating a blueprint that will be the ITE way and that blueprint will then be executed to any event . Its rivals have also shown they are prepared to junk or reinvent events as consumer trends change.  Ascential said in June that it would set up an advisory committee to shape the future of the world's biggest annual advertising industry conference in Cannes after criticism from industry giants WPP and Publicis.   The two advertising firms said the event had become costly and too scattered as deep-pocketed tech giants such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google take a greater part, and should refocus on promoting agencies' creativity. A similar situation saw UBM reinvent its IT event Interop to focus on a niche area after consolidation in the industry reduced the number of exhibitors. UBM said it also continuously sells events it deems 'non-core'.    Events is, as an industry, relatively resilient,  UBM's Wyatt said.  The important thing is to have a broad portfolio across different verticals in different geographies. That makes it more resilient to macroeconomic cyclicity.

The pound sank to an eight-month low of 89.91 pence earlier in the day, extending the falls of the previous day after ECB chief Mario Draghi said possible changes to the central bank's expansive stimulus programme would be discussed in the autumn. Though he kept the door open to further easing, investors interpreted Draghi's comments as less dovish than previous ECB meetings and the euro shot up broadly, hitting its highest levels in almost two years against the dollar. The pound has lost almost 2.5 percent against the euro this week - its biggest losses since last October. Against the dollar, sterling was trading up around 0.1 percent at $1.2990, having earlier in the week traded above $1.31 but having slipped on weaker-than-expected inflation data, which poured cold water on expectations that the Bank of England could hike interest rates in the coming months.  Sterling's weakness should not be underestimated in the current dollar-selling backdrop,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.  The stagflation warning signs are flashing for the UK economy after this week's data, while any 'soft' Brexit euphoria is slowly beginning to fade as the reality of difficult negotiations begins to sink in.  Patel added that the pound would continue to underperform, with the euro likely to test the 90-pence level, and with the currency likely to stay under $1.30. Investors are watching Brexit negotiations between Britain and the European Union closely, with any signs that Britain will lose its preferential access to the single market, or that it will not get a deal with the EU, likely to knock the currency.  While it is certainly possible that sterling could remain subdued this summer, the risk is political crosscurrents could leave the currency exposed to sharp moves to the downside,  wrote BNY Mellon strategists in a note to clients.  Given where GBP is currently trading it may therefore be worth keeping a close eye on political developments this weekend.

Yaskawa, which makes AC servo motors, a key component used in machine tools, is among the first to announce quarterly earnings. If it surprises with positive results, that sets the tone for other Japanese companies, market players said. The firm's stock jumped more than 15 percent to a record high of 2,938 yen on Friday, before ending 10 percent higher as its robust profit forecast attracted buyers. Factory automation equipment demand has been strong due to rising demand in China's smartphone market, prompting investors to speculate that other machine tool makers will also benefit from strong Chinese capital expenditure. While the Nikkei share average edged down as a firmer yen soured the mood on Friday, machine tool makers sharply outperformed. SMC Corp climbed 3.3 percent, Keyence Corp 1.2 percent, Nidec Corp 1.1 percent, Fanuc Corp 2.1 percent and Mitsubishi Electric Corp 4.6 percent.  A lot of investors look at Yaskawa's results as a compass to earnings that could potentially come out from Fanuc and other industrial robotics as well as other machine tool makers,  said Kei Okamura, assistant investment manager at Aberdeen Investment Management. Meanwhile, a brokerage study showed that Yaskawa's influence was not limited to one sector but could affect the broader market, though its impact might be short-lived - mostly at the early stage of the quarterly earnings season.  History shows that when Yaskawa's share price rises after it releases earnings, the Nikkei's level five days later is at a higher level than the day before Yaskawa released its earnings,  said Takuya Takahashi, a market strategist at Daiwa Securities. Takahashi has tracked a correlation between Yaskawa's earnings and the Nikkei's performance during quarterly earnings seasons since 2004. His study showed that of a total of 52 quarterly earnings in the past 13 years, Yaskawa's share price rose 27 times the next day, which lifted the Nikkei to a higher level five days later, for 19 times. The math suggests there is a 70 percent chance of the Nikkei being at a higher level at the end of next week. Yaskawa, whose business year ends in February, reported its operating profit jumped 240 percent to 13.2 billion yen ($118.12 million) for the April-June quarter, and raised its profit forecast for the current year. It now expects an operating profit of 45.5 billion yen, up from a previously forecast 37 billion yen. But some market participants warned of Yaskawa's high valuations and a potential correction after earnings momentum is priced in.  Its April-June quarter was way ahead of market expectations. But such an uptrend cannot last forever,  said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management, who pointed to Yaskawa's higher valuation.  There is a recent trend in which investors overlook companies' valuations and bet on their earnings momentum. Who knows when such a trend will see a turnaround.  $1 = 111.7500 yen Editing by Jacqueline Wong","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-stocks-yaskawa-idUSL3N1KC20X"},

China released a national AI development plan late on Thursday, aiming to grow the country's core AI industries to over 150 billion yuan ($22.15 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion yuan ($59.07 billion) by 2025, the State Council said. With this major push into AI, China is looking to rival U.S. market leaders such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp, as it is keen not to be left behind in a technology that is increasingly key from smart cars to energy.  The local and central government are supporting this AI effort,  said Rui Yong, chief technology officer at PC maker Lenovo Group, speaking on the sidelines of an AI conference in Shanghai on Thursday.   They see this trend coming and they want to invest more.  Beijing's AI plan comes as the United States is poised to bolster its scrutiny of investments, including artificial intelligence, over fears that countries including China could access technology of strategic military importance. China's State Council said the  situation with China on national security and international competition is complex , which was part of the incentive for making a domestic AI push.

Robots are displayed at 2017 China International Robot Show in Shanghai, China July 5, 2017.Aly SongThe roadmap says China aims to catch up to global leaders by solving issues including a lack of high-end computer chips, software and trained personnel. Beijing would also play a bigger role via policy support and regulation. China has already invested heavily in AI, while Chinese Premier Li Keqiang named it as a strategic technology in an annual report earlier this year. In February, the country's powerful state planner opened an AI lab in partnership with Baidu Inc, the country's top search engine, which is making a major push in to AI. Lenovo's Rui said official support for AI was because it was seen as the latest  industrial revolution  akin to the advent of the combustion engine, electricity or the Internet.  They see the fourth industrial revolution as coming, (and think) we better invest and support and build a very strong ecosystem,  said Rui.

Leader Marine le Pen vowed to  deeply renew  the party after she lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron in May. A month later, the National Front (FN) won just eight seats in a parliamentary poll, well short of the minimum 15 required to form a group that would have greater influence in the chamber. Both results came despite opinion polls pointing to a strong showing for the anti-EU, anti-immigration party, briefly spooking investors who worried that it would rock France's political establishment and with it the European Union.  We shouldn't cover up issues or look for quick fixes, but must instead get to the bottom of things, to be a challenger to be reckoned with in the next presidentials,  Jerome Riviere, part of Le Pen's presidential campaign team, told Reuters. He will be one of around 40 senior party representatives meeting privately on Friday and Saturday on the outskirts of Paris, but with infighting spilling into the open and divisions over central policies wide, no final decisions are expected. The meeting will be followed by a questionnaire sent to National Front members in September and a party congress early next year. Among the biggest disagreements is the FN's economic policy, and in particular its rejection of the euro, an idea which is unpopular with the majority of the electorate but appeals to the party's core supporters. FN deputy chief Florian Philippot threatened to quit if the party's policy on restoring the franc was dropped, much to the annoyance of some senior colleagues. Le Pen, meanwhile, has left open the possibility of watering down that pledge, and two aides who were key to drafting her presidential platform told Reuters they were pushing in that direction, albeit with important caveats. Jean Messiha, who was in charge of Le Pen's presidential manifesto which included ditching the euro, said he would call at the seminar for the party to focus instead on what he called a  vital  challenge for France: the fight against immigration.

They would then propose steps such as exiting the banking union, a move which they recognize would break euro zone rules. What's in a Name? Political analysts blamed the FN's election defeat on its lack of allies, distrust among voters for some of its hardline policies and a TV debate performance by Le Pen that some party officials admit was damaging. Slideshow (2 Images)For Sophie Montel, a party member for nearly 30 years who will also attend the seminar despite being ousted this month from the FN's group in a regional council, the party must soften its tone and move away from focusing on hardline anti-immigration policies.  We need to come up with an optimistic message, embody hope and stop being caricatures of ourselves, a bit too aggressive,  she told Reuters, urging the party to focus on issues including education. Montel's demotion came after she backed two younger colleagues who were pushing for major reforms and criticizing the party's campaign logistics, and she plans to use the meeting to propose diluting some powers concentrated within the FN's headquarters. Despite tensions, there is one issue that unites most of the party's senior leadership, according to some FN officials: changing its name.  It resonates in France and abroad, in part because people associate it with its founder, Marine's estranged father Jean-Marie le Pen, a politician known for his provocative style and convictions for incitement to racial hatred. It  frightens  people, said Philippot. At a time when opinion polls show the far-left France Unbowed to be a stronger opponent to Macron than the FN, analysts say the party faces one of its greatest challenges and would need time to rebound.  There might be a change in name and a ... repositioning on the euro, but that will not change the fact that this is a solitary party and that without alliances it cannot hope to have 50 percent of the votes,  said Jerome Fourquet of Ifop pollsters.

Chinese stadium builder Lander has been in protracted talks to buy Southampton from current owner Katharina Liebherr since the start of the year, but the deal has hit some road bumps, including Lander's listed unit pulling out of the deal in April.  It is not clear at the moment. The seller is having second thoughts about selling the club,  Lander's founder Gao Jisheng told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Beijing. He declined to comment further on the deal. An external PR spokesman for Lander later said Gao had not made the comments as reported. Southampton was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by German-born Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr in 2009 and his daughter Katharina inherited the club after his death in 2010, becoming non-executive chairman in 2014. Although not one of the traditional powerhouses of English football, the club has finished in the top eight of the Premier League for the last four seasons and has a highly-regarded youth development operation. The Premier League had given Lander's owner Gao clearance to take an 80 percent stake in Southampton's holding company, Lander Sports Development Co Ltd said in June. With support from Beijing, Chinese investors have ploughed billions of dollars into global soccer teams over the past couple of years. However, overseas investments have become riskier business this year amid a crackdown by regulators on  irrational  spending overseas, including in sport. Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd, which bought Italian soccer club Inter Milan last year, saw its shares fall this week after China's state broadcaster cited the 270 million euros ($313.98 million) deal on a show about risky investments. Beijing is on a drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals.

Chief Executive Brad Gordon denied a Reuters report that foreign staff were asked to leave by the government due to a dispute over mining licenses and accusations of tax evasion. He said its local employees had been interviewed by Tanzanian  government agencies  but did not confirm detentions.  We were having difficulty getting work permits renewed. But no foreign nationals have been asked to leave the country. So there may be some confusion in that. That’s a normal part of business,  Gordon told Reuters. Acacia Mining said this month it was seeking an adjudicator to resolve its dispute over mining contracts after President John Magufuli ordered the suspension of any new licenses.   Tanzania passed two laws this month forcing companies to re-negotiate their contracts as Magufuli pushes through reforms he says will distribute revenue to his people.   The government accused Acacia of tax evasion in 2016 in a case that is ongoing. This year, it accused Acacia of operating illegally. The miner denies the allegations.  Acacia is fully cooperating with these investigations and has provided extensive documentation and information to the investigating authorities,  Gordon said.  In addition, employees in Tanzania have been and continue to be interviewed by government agencies as part of the process,  the chief executive said. Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said two senior local staff of the mining firm, Tanzania's largest foreign investor, were detained and interrogated at an airport this week. Acacia Mining shares were down 7.4 percent by 0852 GMT (4:52 a.m. ET). The company, majority owned by Barrick Gold, reported first half results on Friday showing gold production was up 4 percent year-on-year.

A frenetic pace of growth over 13 years, from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars, has left a gaping hole in LeEco's finances. Jia, who has described the cash crunch as  far worse than expected , stepped down from all posts at Leshi earlier this month to focus on LeEco's electric car business and repay debts.  Sun's appointment to Leshi board chairmanship means he now controls what are widely considered to be LeEco's healthier businesses, while Jia focuses on an expensive ambition to rival Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in making electric vehicles via U.S. subsidiary Faraday Future. Sun is the chairman of property developer Sunac, which invested 15 billion yuan(1.70 billion pounds) in LeEco earlier this year, including taking an 8.61 percent stake in Leshi for 6.04 billion yuan. Sunac's investment in LeEco also included a 33.5 percent stake in smart TV manufacturer Leshi Zhixin and a 15 percent stake in LeEco's film production company, Le Vision Picutres.

The British company said the increase in organic service revenue, which beat analysts' consensus forecast for a 1.6 percent rise, boosted its confidence in its prospects for the full year, when it expects to grow core earnings by 4-8 percent.  We made a good start to the year with a robust commercial momentum in Europe and accelerating growth in AMAP (Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific),  Chief Executive Vittorio Colao  said on Friday.  Shares in the group rose to a six-week high of 231 pence.  We see this as a decent performance delivered broadly across Vodafone's markets,  said Citi, which rates the stock  neutral .  However we expect growth to ease next quarter as roaming, UK handset financing, competition in Italy and tougher comparatives in some emerging markets offset an easier comparative in Spain.  Vodafone expects cash flow to jump this year, enabling it to increase dividends, as it eases back on network investment, improves efficiency and tackles intense competition in India by merging with a rival. The company has invested billion of pounds in its networks to meet surging demand for mobile data. Colao said the rise in data traffic seen in the quarter was the equivalent to total data traffic just two years ago. Areas of weakness remained in Europe, however. Growth in Germany halved to 0.6 percent, from 1.2 percent in the previous quarter, which was put down to lower wholesale revenue and accounting changes a year ago. And although its performance in its problematic British market improved, it was still down 2.7 percent, with enterprise revenue declining in what it said was a competitive market. Competition was also increasing in Italy ahead of the arrival later this year of Iliad, the operator that has seized 18 percent of the French market in just four years.  Colao said operators were already  throwing a huge number of very cheap offers to the market .  We are very well prepared both from a network, from a  distribution, and from a commercial point of view to give good value to our mobile customers,  he said.  We are getting prepared for the newcomer.  Editing by Kate Holton and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/vodafone-group-outlook-idUSL5N1KC10Z"},

Gross domestic product (GDP) in North Korea last year rose 3.9 percent from the previous year when the economy contracted due to a drought and low commodity prices, the Bank of Korea said. The expansion, driven by mining and energy, marked the biggest rise since a 6.1 percent gain in 1999. North Korea, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also boosted exports by 4.6 percent, the most since an 11.8 percent jump in 2013. Still, the isolated state's per capita gross national income in 2016 was just 1.5 million won ($1,342), less than 5 percent of the comparable number in South Korea.  North Korea does not publish economic data. The Bank of Korea has released GDP data on North Korea every year since 1991 based on information from government agencies including South Korea's Ministry of Unification and the National Intelligence Service. The estimate is widely used by international organizations and researchers.  North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches. Missiles Likely Boosted Output The robust economic growth may partly be due to the North's active nuclear and missile development program, as the manufacture of components is included when calculating GDP growth, according to Shin Seung-cheol, an official at the BOK.  Shin added North Korea had boosted electricity production in 2016 but could not confirm whether this was linked to missile manufacturing. In February, China banned all imports of coal from its reclusive neighbor, cutting off its most important export. China is also restricting the flow of oil into the North. The United States is mulling new sanctions on Chinese firms and bank doing business with Pyongyang on top of trying to get China and Russia to back a new U.N. Security Council resolution imposing stiffer sanctions on North Korea following its latest missile test. In 2016, China accounted for 92.5 percent of all North Korean trade, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) on Friday.

North Korea can bypass some sanctions but coal is critical for their economy and it is something that's difficult to smuggle. Coal can be spotted easily when it's being moved,  said Kim. Lim Soo-ho, a research head at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said that sanctions didn’t bite hard last year, as China loosened some of its earlier restrictions in the second half after South Korea decided to deploy a U.S. anti-missile defense system.  With expanding sanctions, there are more downside risks to its growth this year than last,  Lim said.  Pyongyang’s heavy industries and manufacturing sectors could be hit hard if China continues to cut fuel sales to North Korea.  The Bank of Korea official declined to comment on how the Chinese coal ban and tightened international sanctions since last year would affect North Korea's economy in 2017. The United Nations' food agency said on Thursday North Korea is facing severe food shortages due to the worst drought since 2001. Kim said it was too early to say whether North Korea's crops will suffer, as the Korean Peninsula has seen much rain in recent weeks. Fraction of s.korea Economy North Korea's 2016 GDP in real terms stood at 32.0 trillion won ($28.50 billion), according to the Bank of Korea data - a fraction of South Korea's 1,508.3 trillion won ($1.34 trillion). Mining and manufacturing make up the biggest portion of North Korea's industry, accounting last year for 33.2 percent of the sector. Overall exports from North Korea, excluding trade with South Korea, rose 4.6 percent last year to $2.82 billion thanks to shipments of fishery products, which soared 74.0 percent, the South's central bank said. North Korea imports rose 4.8 percent to $3.73 billion, led by plant products and textiles. Although trade between the two Koreas plunged 87.7 percent last year due to a shutdown of a joint industrial zone the North shared with the South just north of the border, the North's headline trade numbers were barely affected, the data showed. The Kaesong Industrial Zone was shut down early last year after the North tested a long-range rocket in February defying U.N. sanctions.

And the role they play can have a marked impact on the progress of Boko Haram in establishing new power bases, according to Yunusa Zakari Ya'u, head of Nigeria's Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD), a civil society group that promotes good governance. Ya'u said the role local communities play is often missed in media coverage, and a new book published by the center seeks to set the record straight, exploring communities' role in an 8-year Islamist insurgency that has rocked northeast Nigeria.  Boko Haram, whose name loosely means 'Western education is sinful', has killed more than 20,000 people and uprooted some 2.7 million since 2009 in its bid to carve out an Islamic state. The jihadist group has used religion as a justification for the deployment of women and children as suicide bombers, the torching of churches and mosques, and indiscriminate killings. In response, religious tolerance is part of communities' armory as they try to unite against the militants, said Ya'u. The book tells the tale of two towns with similar demographics whose reaction to the militants could not have been more different. Mubi and Gombi sit in Nigeria's northeastern Adamawa state, one of the poorest parts of the country. Alongside soaring unemployment rates, the area has been blighted by poor harvests and increasing levels of desertification. The state is also very diverse: among a population of almost 4 million, there are approximately 58 different ethnic groups. Yet Mubi and Gombi had very different responses to attacks.  While Mubi crumbled under pressure and briefly became the largest town controlled by Boko Haram, Gombi withstood bombings before vigilantes and security forces drove out the militants.   There (in Gombi), despite the same religious diversities (as in Mubi) - Christians and Muslims, various ethnicities and so forth -  they were able to come together to present one of the most effective responses to Boko Haram,  Ya'u told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  Tale of Two Cities However, in Mubi, religious polarization, economic inequalities and youth unemployment made the radicalization of young people relatively easy, said Musa Shalangwa, political economist and lecturer at the Adamawa State Polytechnic.   Several months before Mubi was attacked and taken over by insurgents in October 2014, strangers, who turned out to be insurgents, were seen in the town openly preaching their extremist views and calling on all Muslims to join their jihad,  Shalangwa wrote in the book.   Meanwhile, in Gombi, youths - both Christians and Muslims - joined vigilante groups, with wealthier residents contributing funds to protect public places, in particular places of worship. Both Muslim and Christian faith representatives held regular meetings to promote peace between religious groups, while also holding security meetings with community leaders.  The role of local leadership is critical in terms of mobilizing members of diverse backgrounds ... to come together and present a united front against the insurgents,  said Ya'u. Poverty and inequality also fueled the violence, he said.  Clearly, a high degree of inequality is needed to turn the disaffected communities into violence. This was the case in Mubi, which has its vast commercial wealth concentrated in the hands of a few,  Ya'u wrote. In order to build community resilience, trust in security forces and the authorities is important, said Ya'u.  At the start of the insurgency, when Boko Haram was attacking police and security forces, some communities were happy, even supporting them, he said.  This was because they saw the police as an enemy. We think the best way to build trust would be by developing community policing (where)the police and community need to work together.

The photograph is meant to portray a young, modern leader who is also the heir of the general who led resistance to Nazi Germany in World War Two and founded the Fifth Republic in 1958. Cultivating this image from day one of his presidency, Macron rode up the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on May 14 in a military jeep instead of the traditional limousine. He later tweeted a picture of himself being lowered on a winch into a nuclear submarine, and this week forced his military chief of staff to quit for criticizing budget cuts. Macron used the departure of General Pierre de Villiers to show he will brook no dissent from those around him and the depth of his resolve to enforce public spending discipline.  But his action has alarmed military chiefs and highlighted a risk that his strategy could backfire by making him look authoritarian, over-controlling and oversensitive to criticism.  Emmanuel Macron is very keen to take on the clothes of General de Gaulle, he has understood very early on what he had to gain from a personal investment in the military field,  Jerome Fourquet of pollster Ifop told Reuters.  But although he has scored points on the international scene and domestically by showing there's a man at the helm, it's unclear whether public opinion will consider this episode as an example of his capacity to decide, or a case of authoritarianism and an admission of weakness.   Jupiterian  Macron, a centrist, has deliberately chosen a style that sets him apart from predecessors who, according to his staff, he believes had deeply flawed presidencies -- Socialist Francois Hollande and conservative Nicolas Sarkozy. Hollande portrayed himself as the  normal president  during his 2012-2017 term but many voters thought his approachability made him look weak. Voters' memories of the  hyper-president  style adopted by Sarkozy, who preceded Hollande, and widespread dislike of his impulsive and sometimes brash personality scuppered his chances of re-election.  Macron, 39, has reduced interaction with the media, scrapping the off-the-record chats which Hollande liked and cancelling the television interview the president traditionally gives on Bastille Day, France's national day.      We don't want to shut down, but we think responsibility does not necessarily come with what I won't call transparency, but what I will call a total unveiling of the president's each and every move,  a source close to Macron said. On the sidelines of summits, Macron has also refused to answer questions about judicial investigations targeting his ministers. Instead, he tweets and broadcasts videos on Facebook Live that have been filmed by his own media team. FILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron waves from his car on the Champs Elysees avenue after the handover ceremony in Paris, France, May 14, 2017.Francois Lenoir/File Photo We've gone from the extreme permissiveness of Hollande -- during whose term the Elysee was a bit like an open house for the media -- to the exact opposite with Macron, who wants extreme control of every content that comes out of the Elysee,  said Thomas Guenole, a political analyst with Sciences-Po university in Paris. Though he made his name as Hollande's economy minister by speaking out of turn and outside his brief, he has muzzled his own ministers. They rarely appear on television and do not respond to reporters waiting in the Elysee palace courtyard after weekly cabinet meetings, rushing into their chauffeured cars without a word.   Macron has even proofread some ministers' interviews for the press, including one by his veteran foreign minister, a source with knowledge of the matter said.   He has also decided to cap the number of staff each minister can have at 10, curtailing the ministers' political autonomy and forcing them to rely more on bureaucrats.  Staff members are a minister's army. He has sucked out all that was political in politics, the technocracy has tightened its grip,  a former Socialist government advisor told Reuters. Slideshow (6 Images)Macron has also launched a review of the top 180 heads of administrative departments, who may be asked to go before the end of year. Paradox   To be sure, although his team was drawn from across the political spectrum, Macron has avoided the public disagreements between ministers that marred Hollande's first years in office. He has broadly reconciled company bosses with the government and talks on pro-business labor reform have run smoothly so far, without the violent public protests seen under Hollande.  The public has welcomed his performances on the world stage -- from a public rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump over climate policy to his decision to host him for Bastille Day and hold a lavish reception for Russian President Vladimir Putin. But critics see a danger in what they regard as the over-centralization of power in the president's hands and weak checks and balances in a country where the executive holds sway over parliament and the press is sometimes seen as deferential. Hollande's last hopes of winning a second term were ended by a series of interviews with two journalists which were published as a book,  A President Shouldn't Say That . Co-author Fabrice Lhomme says Macron may have gone too far in the other direction.  That's the paradox of 'Macronism': he embodies novelty -- by his age, the path he has taken -- but conversely he uses methods from another era,  Lhomme told Reuters.  He runs the risk of isolation, that of a man who exercises power with only a few close advisers, who doesn't listen to contradiction. He could run into trouble, not immediately but in a couple of years, when he's cut off from reality.   A BVA poll published this week showed Macron's popularity rating was down 5 points on a month earlier to 54 percent.   His Jupiterian approach is perceived by some as a monarchical drift,  the pollster wrote, adding a warning that those against Macron had criticized his  arrogance, authoritarianism, and contempt for the working class.

Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 7,501.64 points by 0843 GMT, outperforming European bourses which were flat to slightly lower as a stronger currency weighed. UK mid caps were flat in percentage terms. Vodafone rose 1.4 percent to touch a one-month high after reporting better-than-expected 2.2-percent revenue growth for the first quarter, thanks to a strong performance in Italy and Spain.  Vodafone has never been a growth play, it's all about the dividend,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  Whilst there's nothing here to kick-start a higher quantum of growth in the medium-term, the efficiency programme and the cash generation plans look to have remained on track and that should mean that the company is in a position to carry out its plans to increase the dividend,  Odeluga added. At the sector level, a rise in mining firms also helped support the blue chips, with Antofagasta and Anglo American, both up as the price of copper gained, while gains among oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell also helped. Betting firm Paddy Power Betfair was among the biggest individual fallers, dropping 2 percent to a one-year low following a downgrade from Investec to  sell  from  buy , citing a deterioration in the regulatory outlook for the UK and Australia.  Shorter-term we see downside with tough comps given the Euros, consensus still absorbing punter-friendly sports results and the Draft acquisition as well as a worsening regulatory outlook,  analysts at Investec said in a note. British mid caps offered some more dramatic moves, with shares in Paysafe rocketing around 8 percent after a consortium of Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners made a 2.86 billion pound ($3.72 billion) bid for the firm, the latest move in a spate of deal-making in the payments industry. At the opposite end of the spectrum, shares in Acacia Mining dropped nearly 8 percent after the troubled gold miner said that it was aiming for the lower end of its full-year guidance after its first-half results were hit by Tanzania's export ban.

The maker of Longines, Tissot and Omega watches said it expected  very positive growth in local currency  for the rest of 2017 after net profit rose 7.2 percent in the first six months of the year. Net profit attributable to shareholders rose to 269 million Swiss francs ($282.8 million) from 251 million, but fell short of the 285 million expected by analysts polled by Reuters. Swatch highlighted  significant growth  in mainland China, one of its most important markets, adding that Hong Kong sales had stabilised after a long decline, with data this week showing a rise in Swiss watch exports. Chief Executive Nick Hayek told Swiss news agency AWP that he expected local currencies sales growth of 7 to 9 percent this year.  Having seen the development of Swiss watch exports this year, most people expect the watch market to improve in the second half of the year, but they don't expect any fireworks,  said Jon Cox, luxury goods analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. In recent years Swiss watch sales in China and Hong Kong have been hit by a crackdown on gift giving and corruption under Chinese President Xi Jinpeng. There was also improvement in Europe, a market hit last year by extremist attacks which deterred many visitors from destinations such as Paris. The company reported a strong start to the second half of 2017, saying there had been accelerated growth of all brands in June and the first few weeks of July, particularly among its more expensive brands which include Breguet and Blancpain.  The Swatch Group anticipates very positive growth in local currency in the second half of the year,  the company said in a statement. Apple Watch Competition Remains Swatch said sales of watches and jewellery had been  very positive  in the first half, despite the highly valued Swiss franc taking a bite out of the figures. Sales fell 0.3 percent to 3.71 billion francs versus the 3.73 billion forecast by analysts. With currency effects removed sales rose 1.2 percent. Kepler's Cox said he expected mid single digit sales increases for Swatch for the whole of 2017 in constant currencies after an acceleration to high single digit sales improvement in the second half. But he said problems remained with weak margin improvements at Swatch, while connected watches like Apple Inc's Apple Watch remained a threat to Swatch which generates roughly a third of its revenue from watches which sell for less than 1,000 francs. Swatch shares, weakened after rival Richemont reported disappointing results in May, were trading slightly higher in early trading, up 0.3 percent to reverse earlier losses. Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, remained cautious on the stock, saying the upswing in higher priced watches favoured Richemont - the owner of Cartier - more than Swatch.

Inside, the floors are carpeted, the lights are low, and the gurgling sound of water pipes accompanies hushed conversations between men drinking beer in small groups. It is the first bar to reopen since Islamic State militants were routed from the northern Iraqi town of Qaraqosh nine months ago in the early stages of a campaign to retake Mosul, around 15 km (10 miles) west.  The customers are mainly local Christians tentatively returning home three years after fleeing en masse when the jihadists overran their town and issued an ultimatum: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die.  Some of the bar's patrons, however, are Muslims, savoring the freedom to drink and smoke, which they were denied under Islamic State. They come here for respite from the grim realities of the conflict, but for Muslim and Christian customers alike, the conversation soon turns to the war and its aftermath.   It's hard to forget that until now there are people under the rubble,  said 45 year-old Abu Khalid, a Muslim from Mosul, sharing a bottle of lemon flavored vodka with two friends in the mid-afternoon.   Why do we drink? So we can release our problems,  he said, wearing traditional Arab dress.  Alcohol loosens the tongue . Iraq declared victory in Mosul last week, but it will take longer for people to recover from Islamic State’s occupation.  Many lost relatives, homes and livelihoods, and reconciliation between different communities is a major challenge. New Dangers People have drinks at a bar in the town of Qaraqosh, south of Mosul, Iraq July 18, 2017. Picture taken July 18, 2017.Thaier Al-SudaniFor Christians, who trace their history in Iraq back two millennia, Islamic State has called into question the very future of their community in the predominantly Muslim Middle East. The owner of the bar, Abu Firas, hopes that re-opening it will breathe life back into his town and help reverse the exodus of its Christian population.     He has covered up bullet marks in the wall with posters advertising beer, and filled in a large hole the militants made behind the kitchen sink, which enabled them to move undetected into the shop next door. Slideshow (3 Images) Day by day it (business) is getting better,  he said optimistically. Although Islamic State is expected to revert to insurgent tactics like bombings as its  caliphate  falls apart, Abu Firas is undaunted: “We are not afraid,  he said. Around 400 families have now returned to Qaraqosh -- also known as Hamdaniya -- which was the largest Christian settlement in Iraq until Islamic State took over, with a population of more than 50,000. I love my town. I want it to go back to the way it was,  said a Christian customer who sat with three friends taking a break from repairing homes torched by the militants. The 49-year-old returned to Iraq 15 days ago from Europe, where he fled after Islamic State's invasion.  I haven't decided whether to go back to France or stay here,  said the man, who asked to remain unnamed.  His main concern is security, but it is not Islamic State that worries him. The danger, he says, is of violence between rival paramilitary groups that now patrol the streets of Qaraqosh and the surrounding area. Last week, two Christian militias clashed in the town.          On a more positive note, the customer said the presence of Muslims in the bar showed that peaceful co-existence with Christians was still possible. He later admitted, however, that trust between the two communities was broken because many Sunni Muslims from the surrounding villages had supported Islamic State.          The bar is open to outsiders only until 8 pm. After that, just Christians are welcome.  Editing by Ralph Boulton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-bar-idUSKBN1A60X0"},

The lower purchases by the world's biggest importer of vegetable oils come amid a 13 percent run-off in international crude palm oil prices this year that has also pulled down other edible oil benchmarks and kept domestic oilseed crushing in India unprofitable. India is expected to import 14.3 million tonnes of edible oils in the year to end-October 2017, down 300,000 tonnes or 2 percent from the previous year, Dinesh Shahra, managing director of Ruchi Soya Industries, told Reuters. To prop up domestic oilseed prices the south Asian country is likely to raise the import duty on edible oils, which would further limit overseas purchases of edible oils and help make the crushing of local oilseeds profitable again.  An overall hike in duty on both crude and refined edible oils will promote domestic crushing of oilseeds,  said Shahra, who advocates for nearly tripling crude palm oil import duties to 20 percent from an existing 7.5 percent. Increasing crushing volumes is critical because Indian oilseed output is expected to have jumped 20 percent in 2016/17 to 38.2 million tonnes, according to the Mumbai-based Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA). Already, significant stocks from this year's harvest will be held over for crushing in the next season as many farmers are reluctant to sell at the current prices, Shahra said. That is expected to have farmers shifting to more lucrative crops like cotton in the 2017/18 crop year, pulling down India's soybean planting by 10 percent from this year, he said.  We foresee an overall reduction in soybean output (in 2017/18), but this would not affect our operations due to the carryover stock from the previous year,  he said. India is likely to start the new season with 1.8 million tonnes of soybean stocks to carry forward on Oct. 1, up more than four-fold from this season's 441,000 tonnes. Import Outlook India's edible oil purchases - mainly palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia and soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil - have increased each year since 2010/11, according to SEA. The imports in the decade to 2015/16 rose an average of 12 percent a year, making it the world's biggest importer of palm oil and soyoil. India relies on imports for 70 percent of its edible oils, up from 44 percent in 2001/02. Palm oil accounts for more than half of India's total edible oil imports. Its purchases are likely to be 8.5 million to 8.7 million tonnes this year, compared with 8.44 million tonnes in 2015/16, Shahra said. Imports of sunflower oil, however - perceived to be a healthier option by many Indians - could surge 33 percent to 2 million tonnes this year as it has started trading at a discount to soyoil, Shahra said. In June the landed cost of sunflower oil was $9 a tonne lower than soyoil at Indian ports. A year ago, sunflower oil was $99 a tonne more expensive than soyoil, according to SEA data. That means most of the drop in edible oil imports will come in soyoil purchases, which are expected to fall nearly 17 percent to 3.5 million tonnes, according to Shahra.

This is the beginning of the third quarter and demand picks up in the third quarter and I hope the agreement will have a significant impact in the third and fourth quarter.  Brent crude oil prices remain just under the key $50 per barrel mark on concerns about high supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) despite a pledge to cut output in a bid to tighten the market.

The United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui speaks to journalists in Singapore, July 21, 2017.Darren WhitesideHowever, OPEC's compliance slumped to 78 percent in June as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola, the International Energy Agency said last week.  The UAE is committed to its cut,  Mazroui said.  We have seen some increase in production in some of the countries that were not part of the agreement because of their special stance.  Oil traders are looking ahead to Monday's meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC members to see if it will address rising production from Nigeria and Libya, which have been exempted from the cuts. OPEC's Joint Ministerial Committee monitors compliance with the supply pact and will meet in St Petersburg, Russia. OPEC's supply cuts have also been countered by rising U.S. production, which has increased almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.4 million bpd.

Bieber's lifestyle overseas and his  words and actions  when he last performed in China had generated  public dissatisfaction , Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Culture said, without specifying what behavior had caused offense. Given efforts to  purify  the performing arts environment in China,  it was not appropriate to bring in artists with bad behavior , the bureau said on its website, responding to a question from a fan asking why Bieber was not being allowed to tour.  We hope Justin Bieber will continue to improve his behavior as part of his growth, and become a singer truly loved by the public,  it said. It is unclear whether the comments, which were carried on an official government website, constituted a ban, or if the singer had sought to tour China. Bieber's management company did not immediately respond to request for comment. Justin Bieber performs at iHeartRadio Jingle Ball concert at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Californiam U.S., December 2, 2016.Mario AnzuoniBieber performed in China in 2013 when media coverage centered on him stripping on stage in Beijing to reveal his bare torso, being carried up the steps of the Great Wall of China, and riding a segway, again shirtless, through the streets.  Bieber, 23, has become notorious for a string of indiscretions and scandals in recent years, shedding the clean-cut image he had when he burst onto the scene as a teenager. He also posted a photo on social media showing him visiting Japan's controversial Yasukuni war shrine in 2014. The singer removed the image but not before it had attracted 660,000 likes on Instagram and had been tweeted out to his 50 million-plus followers on Twitter. Chinese media reported in January that Bieber was set to return this year, but no Chinese dates have been announced. He is due to perform in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore in September and October, according to his website.  Several big name musicians have been blocked from performing in China, including Lady Gaga, Bjork and Bon Jovi, who have all met or expressed support for the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.   Justin Bieber has won many big awards, he must have a lot of talent, why have Chinese fans not been afforded the right to appreciate him?  asked He Wenrui, the fan who wrote to Beijing's bureau of culture.

Now, the German chancellor may have to sacrifice him to secure a coalition deal. Merkel's conservatives are likely to win a national election on Sept. 24, but lack of an overall majority could force them to continue their alliance with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). SPD leaders say their price for a re-run of the current 'grand coalition' would be for Schaeuble to vacate the finance ministry and hand it to them. Schaeuble personifies the fiscal discipline and financial stability that many Germans crave. But for the SPD he goes too far. For Merkel's political opponents, Schaeuble's emphasis that both Germany and other EU countries adhere to Europe's budget rules risks denying French President Emmanuel Macron the flexibility to revive his country's economy. Germany is awash with tax revenues but France is in a tighter spot. The SPD worries that insistence on French budget discipline will not give Macron the room for maneuver to foster growth. If Macron fails, the SPD's concern is the EU will fail or that far-right leader Marine Le Pen could win power. SPD Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he had asked Merkel which scenario in her view would be more expensive for Germany: a slightly higher budget deficit in France or Le Pen as president in five years.  We Germans must change our position,  Gabriel said. Softening Schaeuble's approach to the euro zone would not go down well with many Germans.

In May, he flew half way around the world to spend 12 hours in Durban, where he attended several panels at the World Economic Forum on Africa, backed efforts to attract more investment and lectured students on how the EU works. It is this relentless drive that commands the respect of voters and colleagues alike.  When I go to breakfasts and party meetings with him, he is the one who is the most aggressive - ready to take on the Social Democrats,  a senior German government official said. But while polls suggest Merkel will win a fourth term in September, she might end up losing Schaeuble as finance minister. Tricky Talks Merkel faces tricky coalition talks over ministerial jobs in the next parliament. Senior members of the two parties most likely to be her junior coalition partner - the SPD and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - have made clear that they have their eye on the finance ministry this time.  The SPD won't repeat the mistake it made during the coalition talks four years ago,  Gabriel told reporters. In 2013, the SPD focused mainly on domestic issues and pushed for the introduction of a national minimum wage. It consequently got the labor ministry, among other departments such as economic affairs and foreign relations. Now, the SPD's candidate for chancellor, Martin Schulz, has made investment and solidarity with Europe a cornerstone of his campaign, signaling a less rigid stance on the budget. If the Social Democrats are forced into another grand coalition under Merkel, it would be  very important  for the SPD to get the finance ministry, a senior SPD source told Reuters.  If there's one thing we Social Democrats have learned, it's this: We should not enter coalition again without controlling the finance ministry,  SPD budget lawmaker Johannes Kahrs told Reuters.

Keeping the finance ministry will be most difficult to achieve with the SPD as junior partner because the party has put a strong emphasis on finances and Europe,  Rehberg told Reuters.  If we have a similar situation on election night as we did four years ago, the SPD is likely to demand not only the foreign ministry but also the finance ministry,  he added. It remains unclear whether Merkel will have to sacrifice Schaeuble. But his departure would be a blow for the chancellor's goal of strengthening integration within the EU once Britain leaves, or at least within the euro zone. For Merkel, deeper integration is a question of sequencing. This is where Schaeuble could help her: keeping skeptical German voters and lawmakers on board by insisting France and the southern euro zone countries reform first, before agreeing to bind Germany's economic fate closer to theirs.

Investors seem largely to have got over a period of jitters spurred by concerns over the pace of U.S. economic growth and signs that several of the world's major central banks were determined to tighten monetary policy soon. Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank did just enough to show euro zone policymakers were on course to rein in their two-year old emergency programme of bond-buying without quite scaring the horses. The euro surged to its highest against the dollar since August 2015, but government bond yields for Europe's southern governments fell sharply - a reflection of relative confidence in the economic outlook and the cautious line taken by ECB chief Mario Draghi. Euro zone stock markets, however, were lower on the day , with some analysts worrying a stronger euro may do more to undermine growth going forward.  We can be pretty sure that when Draghi sat down for his press conference yesterday the last thing he expected to see was the euro hit its highest level in over two years and for equity markets to slide back,  said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.  The strength of the euro does appear to be acting as a bit of a headwind for European stocks as they look to close the week sharply lower, in contrast to the performance of UK and US stocks this week.  The euro gained around 0.2 percent on the day in morning trade in Europe, hitting an almost two-year high of $1.1676. Signs of steady global growth, which have prompted the ECB and a couple of other major central banks to signal future tightening since last month, have kept the world's shares on firm footing. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has gained about 5 percent in the past two weeks, eased 0.2 percent, dragged down by a fall in material and financial shares. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was steady after rising for a 10th straight session on Thursday, its longest such streak since February 2015. It has advanced around 3 percent in the latest rally.  Strong global growth and (a) decent earnings outlook are supporting shares globally,  said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. U.S. quarterly earnings are expected to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 15 percent of S&P; 500 companies having posted results so far. Brent crude futures traded at $49.31 per barrel, unchanged on day.

With the signature black felt hat and a bandana on his wrist, Munna waltzes his way through nightclubs and dance venues in Mumbai but fails to find fame or money. When he moves to Delhi, he meets Mahendar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a gangster with pots of money but with two left feet. The woman Mahendar is in love with is a dancer, so he hires Munna as his teacher so that he can learn the moves to impress her.  Slideshow (3 Images)However, things get complicated when Dolly (Niddhi Agerwal) falls for Munna, who is torn between his friendship with Mahendar and his love for the girl.  The story is straightforward and merely a device for Shroff to display his washboard abs and ample dancing skills. Siddiqui’s turn as a gangster with a heart of gold and his scenes with Shroff are the funniest parts of the film, and the fight scenes are well-choreographed. But what sticks out like a sore thumb is debutant Niddhi Agerwal’s performance. For a character who is supposed to be a professional dancer and the love interest of both leading men, she doesn’t inspire any confidence. Or maybe it’s because she is paired opposite Shroff, who dances as though his body is made of springs, his skills accentuated by plenty of slow-motion scenes.  Shroff is the perfect old-school hero, with screen presence and action skills to match. Now if only someone would give him a good script to play with.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-munnamichael-idUSKBN1A60UD"},

Despite expectations that Western policymakers will soon start tightening monetary policy, including by clawing back the stimulus they have been pumping into markets for years, flows to emerging debt funds bounced to $1.5 billion in the past week after two weeks of outflow, JPMorgan data showed. Emerging equity funds received $2.4 billion on confidence that developing economies can withstand gradual tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. MSCI's emerging equity index hovered just off 27-month highs, with year-to-date gains surpassing 23 percent. Emerging sovereign dollar bond spreads over Treasuries were at one-month lows around 306 basis points while local debt yields averaged 6.14 percent on JPMorgan's GBI-EM index, having fallen almost half a percent over the week. JPMorgan said its client survey of emerging market funds managing $1.1 trillion showed  risk-on , with funds cutting cash holdings and adding exposure to local bonds. South African bonds extended gains after Thursday's surprise rate cut, with benchmark yields at one-month lows and helping the rand outperform other emerging currencies with a 0.5 percent rise. On most currencies though, there were signs of caution. The lira rose 0.2 percent, while the rouble was flat and Asian currencies firmed only marginally despite the dollar's renewed weakness. Citi analysts noted emerging currencies were on average trading at the highest levels in almost two years while total emerging market inflows were approaching levels seen just before the 2013 taper tantrum.  While very strong inflows by themselves are no indication of an imminent turn, they do serve to increase volatility when the turn does arrive,  Citi told clients, adding it was  lightly positioned  in emerging currencies.  It's plausible some investors are sensing that valuation is becoming stretched. This is something which bears watching.  There is little sign that politics - Turkey's tussle with Germany over the detention of activists or Poland's stand off with the European Union - is affecting investor sentiment.  Although we are concerned about the increasing political isolation of Warsaw within the EU, we remain constructive on Polish assets,  said Societe Generale, which is also overweight the lira.  Continued inflows into (Polish bonds), robust economic data, and strong budget execution may further benefit (the) zloty.  Regional assets which gained after the ECB's dovish comments on Thursday eased back, with the zloty at one-week lows against the euro while the Hungarian forint slipped from eight-month highs.

KEY RATING DRIVERS ASP's National Ratings reflect its robust domestic securities franchise, which the group operates through its key operating subsidiary, Asia Plus Securities (ASPS). Fitch assesses the group on a consolidated basis due to ASPS's large size relative to the group as well as the high level of integration between ASP and ASPS, operationally and financially. ASPS is among the stronger and more diversified securities firms in Thailand, with a large brokerage presence among retail investors as well as significant footprints in capital markets and investment banking. Fitch expects ASP to maintain sound financials and navigate profitability pressure more successfully than its domestic peers. Its brokerage margins are likely to continue to outperform the industry average due to its well-established client relationships. The agency believes ASP's revenue has the potential to become further diversified as it expands its presence in wealth management and other non-brokerage businesses. Its leverage has remained low, with equity-to-assets ratios mostly above 50% over the past several years. The affirmation of FSS's National Ratings reflects its moderate business franchise, sound capitalisation, manageable risk appetite, and adequate funding and liquidity. FSS remains a strong player with 5.4% market share by trading value, ranking fourth among securities firms in Thailand at end-1H17, but its brokerage commission fees have been declining in tandem with industry trends amid stiff price competition. Fitch believes FSS's profitability continues to be constrained by lower brokerage margins and higher expenses from its infrastructure development. However, the company's sound capitalisation, reflected in an equity-to-assets ratio of 48.4% at end-1Q17, and adequate liquidity position should provide sufficient buffer against short-term business shocks. The agency views that FSS's risk controls are acceptable and the risk profile of its assets has been stable. The affirmation of FNS's National Ratings reflects its standalone financial strength, which takes into account its small domestic franchise, volatile profitability as well as acceptable capital and liquidity position. FNS's recent investments in the warehouse and factory rental business will help stabilise its income stream, while profits from the investment banking business continue to be one of the key influences on the company's profitability. FNS's leverage remains high, even though debt slightly declined in 1Q17. Fitch believes that FNS's ability to pay down debt, depending on its operating cash flow and dividend income, is acceptable; however, the company may have a shortfall if the domestic operating environment deteriorates significantly. The company faces refinancing risk due to its dependence on wholesale funding, however, Fitch believes this is mitigated by committed credit lines from lenders, ongoing cash generation, and an established investor base for its debentures. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch may consider downgrading the National Ratings of ASP or FSS if either firm's profitability declines significantly over a sustained period or if either entity aggressively expands its risky assets beyond that of industry peers or the agency's expectations. FNS's ratings could be downgraded if the company has a weaker-than-expected performance that leads to significant deterioration in key financial ratios, particularly in liquidity and leverage. Any deviation from the debt repayment plan that stems from a higher risk appetite, significant losses from core operations of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or signs of a withdrawal in creditors' confidence may result in negative rating action. Conversely, the agency may consider upgrading the ratings on ASP and FSS if the firms improve their key financial metrics through industry cycles while keeping their risk profiles and franchises relatively constant. FNS's ratings could be upgraded if the company successfully executes its debt repayment plan while improving profitability on a sustained basis so that leverage steadily declines.

Note to editors: Fitch's National ratings provide a relative measure of creditworthiness for rated entities in countries with relatively low international sovereign ratings and where there is demand for such ratings. The best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(tha)' for National ratings in Thailand.

Five separate lawsuits have asked a federal court in Washington to force EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to respond to petitions by the groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club. They want the EPA to intervene in permits issued to several companies by Texas's environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The groups are claiming each permit is too weak and does not force the companies to do enough to protect air quality. The permits are for Exxon Mobil Corporation's Baytown Refinery and Baytown Olefins Plant as well as Pasadena Refining System's Pasadena Refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur Refinery and Southwestern Electric Power Company's Welsh Power Plant, according to the court filings. The groups say Texas has not held the companies to a high-enough standard for air quality, a standard set not just by the federal Clean Air Act but by the state's own environmental regulations. The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) on July 6 published a report claiming the state had only 3 percent of companies it found violating its air pollution regulations between 2011 and 2016. Spokespeople for the TCEQ and the EPA both said the agencies would not comment on pending litigation. But Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the TCEQ, referred Reuters to a statement the agency released on July 12 in response to the EIP report calling it  misleading.   The success of the program is not measured in number of enforcement actions but rather by the state of air quality in Texas,  the statement read. Suits like Thursday's filings are not based on any new concept. Previous EPA administrators have faced them as well.  Gabriel Clark-Leach, a lawyer for the EIP, said the group had filed similar suits in the past and gotten the agency to respond to other requests for intervention in Texas's state permitting process. He said the groups' goal in filing the suits was to set a deadline for the EPA to respond to the their petitions.  The only way that we can make them answer our petition is by taking them to court and forcing them to do their job,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-environment-lawsuit-texas-idUSKBN1A52E6"},

The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for  reckless disregard  of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's     chief executive. The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet. Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year. The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region.  Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website.  OFAC said Exxon had  demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements  by signing the deals with Sechin just weeks after the United States blacklisted him, OFAC said in the three-page statement. (For the statement, see: bit.ly/2vnvQf2) The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown  utter loyalty  to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions. Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was  fundamentally unfair,  and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas. In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin  was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity  and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions  applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed.  (For Exxon's complaint, see: exxonmobil.co/2uNRWdr) Tillerson Not Consulted Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions. The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.  A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and  did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson.  Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate. Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role.

Sputnik/Kremlin/Mikhail Klimentyev viaFile PhotoThe back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint.  Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement. The Treasury  is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order  inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said.  OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair.  Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business. In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said. Slideshow (4 Images)And by dealing with Sechin, the company  caused significant harm  to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said. Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama.  You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder,  said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington.  But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself.  Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.  You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO,  said Exxon spokesman Jeffers. Opposition to Sanctions Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals.  Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective  unless they are very well implemented.  Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country.  When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business,  Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them. He also said that Exxon  never directly lobbied against sanctions,  a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms.

The European Central Bank left its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged on Thursday and did not discuss clawing back stimulus, though ECB chief Mario Draghi did signal that those discussions would begin in its next one or two meetings. Euro zone bond yields dropped across the board, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds -- seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's largesse -- proving particularly strong on the day. The euro, meanwhile, jumped to a two-year high against the dollar.  Draghi said that the ECB does not want to cause an unwanted tightening of monetary conditions which could harm the recovery,  said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche said. Not only did a recent rise in yields have that impact, but also the surge in the euro also has a quasi-tightening impact by making life harder for the euro zone exporters. Commerzbank analysts believe that the meeting confirms that the ECB chief does not want to hasten its exit from extraordinary stimulus. This should be positive for  peripheral  government bonds, they said in a note. Indeed, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese 10-year government bond yields fell 4-5 basis points in early trade on Friday. High-grade bond yields also fell, though not quite at the same pace: The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond , the region's benchmark, was down 1.5 basis points to 0.52 percent. The gap between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing costs is at its narrowest level since March 2015 at 94 bps. The move represents a reversal of the trend of the last three weeks. Euro zone government bond yields rose after Draghi signalled in late June in a speech in Sintra, Portugal, that he is open to policy tweaks. Expectations grew that the ECB would announce a tapering of its 2 trillion euro bond-buying scheme this autumn, and Germany's 10-year borrowing costs doubled over the course of a fortnight. Greece Review Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund on Thursday approved in principle a 1.8 billion dollar standby loan arrangement for Greece, making a conditional commitment to help underpin the country's long-running bailout programme for the first time in two years. Greece's 10-year government bond yields themselves were a touch higher on the day as a potential bond market return approaches, but at 5.33 percent are well off this year's highs of over 8 percent. The country is believed to be considering a bond issuance next week, a deal that would represent its first foray in debt markets since 2014. Greece's debt agency has appointed banks for the deal according to International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters publication. Ratings agency S&P; Global is due to review its B- rating on Greece on Friday evening.

Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea this month said it test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead.

Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said he would not give into pressure at home or abroad on the judicial reform bill, setting up a confrontation with the EU, which has given Warsaw a week to drop the plans, calling them a challenge to democracy. + Tens of thousands gathered in cities across Poland into the early hours of Friday, some carrying Polish and European Union flags and chanting,  Free Poland, European!  Opposition groups and other critics say the draft legislation up for debate in parliament's upper house later on Friday is part of a power grab by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party that would undermine the EU's liberal standards.  There is a lot of disappointment with Poland (in Western Europe),  Judy Dempsey, an analyst with the Carnegie Europe think-tank told liberal Gazeta Wyborcza daily in an article published on Friday.  There is a sense we need to put a stop to this destruction of European values.  The government of the EU's biggest eastern member state says the judicial bill is needed to make courts more accountable.  We will not give into pressure. We will not be intimidated by Polish and foreign defenders of the interests of the elite,  the prime minister said in an address on state television. PiS has offered no concessions, instead presenting the criticism as unacceptable foreign meddling in the domestic affairs of the country, which overthrew communism in 1989 and joined the EU in 2004. Once the legisoation passes in the senate - where PiS has a majority - the bill will go to President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, for final approval. Since being elected in 2015, PiS has tightened government control over courts and prosecutors, as well as state media, and introduced restrictions on public gatherings and the activity of non-governmental organisations. Despite criticism, the PiS government remains broadly popular, benefiting from increased social spending, record low unemployment and robust economic growth. Its brand of patriotic rhetoric infused with Catholic piety resonates strongly with many Poles who feel frustrated by a gap in standards of living with the west, nearly three decades after the collapse of communism.

The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals.  There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance toward deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential.  CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome,  a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks at the U.S. - China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.Yuri GripasMost of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp (INSG.O), which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS.  CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. Key Vacancies A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC's $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O). In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra Corp (XCRA.O) are also with the watchdog.  Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed.

ACS confirmed it was considering making an offer for Spain's Abertis after Italian infrastructure group Atlantia (ATL.MI), controlled by the Benetton family, bid more than 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion) in May.  Atlantia had offered 16.50 euros per share, looking to create the world's biggest toll road company.  One of the sources also said that the deal, which was not seen as imminent, is likely to involve ACS taking a leading position in Abertis and one or several funds being part of the equity structure.  Negotiations with funds from Australia and Canada, including sovereign funds, are ongoing, although no agreement has been reached yet,  the source said on condition of anonymity. Related CoverageSpain government says following Abertis takeover news very closelyIn its statement to Spain's market regulator on Friday, ACS said it had not yet decided whether to bid for Abertis, which it was studying with external advisers. Key Capital Partners, Lazard and JP Morgan are the company's advisers on the potential deal, the source said. ACS and Lazard declined to comment, while representatives of JP Morgan and Key Capital Partners were not immediately available to comment. Expansion newspaper reported that ACS had been working on its own offer for weeks and could use its German subsidiary Hochtief (HOTG.DE) to launch the counter-bid. One of the sources said it was too early to say if Hochtief would be part of the deal and there had been no discussions with the German subsidiary. Analysts said that the most likely scenario now is for Atlantia to improve its offer price because the bid undervalues Abertis. ACS's counter-bid makes strategic sense, they said, because Abertis is a low-risk asset that would complement its own operations. The market regulator is still looking at whether to approve Atlantia's bid -- a process that usually takes two or three months -- and the Spanish government can block the transaction if it does not fit with Spain's strategic interests. The Spanish government is following developments very closely, government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said on Friday. Atlantia said in a June prospectus that it could consider making a full cash offer for Abertis instead of the initial proposal for a cash-and-shares deal with at least 10 percent of Abertis shareholders taking payment in shares.  News of ACS's possible bid sent its shares down more than 5 percent to the bottom of Spain's blue-chip IBEX index .IBEX. Atlantia shares fell 1.8 percent, while Abertis was up 1.4 percent at 16.70 euros. A Hochtief spokesman declined to comment on Expansion's report and said it was a matter for ACS, which owns 72 percent of the business. Hochtief shares were down about 6 percent, the biggest faller on Germany's MDAX .MDAXI index of medium-sized companies.

Asia's fourth-largest economy is pushing ahead with a 2014 plan to turn Ulsan and Yeosu ports into northeast Asia's oil shipping and storage cluster, a potential challenge to the long-established Asian oil trading centre in Singapore. South Korea's government approved legislation earlier this year that will allow trading companies to blend refined fuels at the country's oil terminals, although technical aspects and guidelines needed for implementation are still being formalised. The new regulation is to be implemented from Oct. 18, said an energy ministry official who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. He said the ease on blending rules is confined to oil products such as gasoline and diesel.  The idea of the new regulation is to allow international oil traders to blend petroleum products and chemicals freely in bonded areas like tank terminals,  said Jong Yeol Kang, president of South Korea's Ulsan Port Authority (UPA), in response to emailed questions from Reuters. Traders with storage tanks in South Korea's bonded areas are currently only able to store and export fuels they have on hand and are not allowed to mix fuels into new blends to meet clients' specifications. Until the new regulation takes effect, fuel blending is restricted to South Korean refiners alone. Feedback on the new regulation from traders has so far been positive, Kang said. Details of regulatory terms and guidelines will be released shortly, he said, without specifying a date. South Korea's ambitions could quickly divert some oil trade away from Singapore, said Ellen Ruhotas, managing director at Ratio Group, a Singapore-based advisory firm specialising in bulk liquids storage.  With this new capability traders could, for example, supply the near-by Japanese market with various fuels that would have otherwise come from places like Singapore, and so it would be interesting to see how that unfolds,  Ruhotas said. South Korea's project is one of the world's few major greenfield commercial tank farm developments. The country is aiming to increase oil product exports to serve the Asian market, where the 2017 BP Statistical Review of World Energy says demand will grow to 2.1 billion tonnes of oil equivalent by 2035, from 1.5 billion tonnes in 2015.  For the moment, we are focused at the northeast Asia market including China, Japan and Korea. We believe there is a strong demand growth within that region,  Kang said. Tank terminals at Ulsan have 23 million barrels of storage capacity, while Yeosu has an additional 8.2 million barrels, according to Korea National Oil Company's website. South Korea's oil hub project will add another 28 million barrels of capacity by 2026, Kang said. Singapore has about 79 million barrels of oil storage capacity, with 30 million barrels available in nearby areas of Malaysia and Indonesia, Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows.

International benchmark Brent crude futures were up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $49.40 per barrel at 0658 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 7 cents, or 0.2 percent at $46.99 per barrel. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since early June in choppy trading the previous trading session, having been pushed higher by data showing U.S. crude and fuel inventories fell sharply last week.  The impact of strong drawdown in inventories announced earlier this week was still lingering in the market,  ANZ bank said. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said the decline in inventories could continue in the near term, although overall stock levels this year would likely be higher than in 2016. U.S. oil stocks, at roughly 490 million barrels, remain well above the five-year average, while U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA has increased almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.4 million bpd. An abundance of global crude supplies has put pressure on oil prices and key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are scheduled to meet non-members in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday to discuss market conditions and whether more action is needed to support prices.  Market participants seem to be convinced that the supply glut is here to stay and that the market is unlikely to rebalance anytime soon,  said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta. OPEC, together with some non-members like Russia, has pledged to reduce the global glut by cutting production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said  actions from the next OPEC/non-OPEC working committee meeting seem unlikely,  although it added that  if OPEC is to achieve its objective of bringing OECD inventories back to normal levels it will need to take further steps.  Traders have been watching reports that the world's top crude producer Saudi Arabia is working to draw down bloated stocks, particularly as other OPEC members - including Iraq and Libya - are raising output.

The calm in the former Portuguese enclave, now a special administrative region of China, is partly the result of a multi-decade effort by Beijing to exert its authority over the territory. In the decade before the handover in 1999, the Chinese government handpicked a group of about 40 young graduates from across China and placed them in key government departments, according to former officials familiar with the process.   Those young graduates, armed with a fluency in Portuguese and legal training, swiftly rose through the ranks. They eventually assumed powerful positions that have helped align Macau more closely to the mainland at a time when infighting and instability plagues Hong Kong, said Jose Luis de Sales Marques, Macau’s mayor from 1993 to 2001.   “They were given positions when they were still very young, very leading positions,” said Marques, who now heads Macau’s institute of European studies.  Half of Macau’s most senior officials have origins in China, in stark contrast to Hong Kong, where no mainland Chinese occupy top government posts. Among those officials is Wong Sio Chak, who was appointed Macau’s security chief in 2014. He has been tipped as a potential leader when elections for Macau’s chief executive take place in two years, according to sources in the civil service.  Cheong Weng Chon, head of Macau’s anti-corruption body, and Ip Son Sang, Macau’s public prosecutor general, are other officials sent from the mainland in the 1990s to help Portugal and China prepare for the post-handover administration. Details of the officials’ careers have been corroborated through interviews with over a dozen former officials and civil servants and official public records. Soon after the officials from the mainland were appointed to top positions in 2014, Macau launched a cleanup of the territory’s $30 billion gambling industry, responding to a call by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to stamp out corruption in China. Chinese rule has been generally welcomed in Macau, which has seen economic growth soar and a period of stability - in contrast with the years preceding the handover when there were a series of mobster wars.  More than half of Macau’s population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born in the territory. Macau’s calm has been noticed in Beijing. In July, Xi visited Hong Kong and lavished praise on Macau. In contrast, he delivered a stark warning to Hong Kong that Beijing would not tolerate any challenge to its authority. Still, as China’s influence in Macau becomes more overt there are growing fears that its autonomy is threatened.   I think Macau is losing that autonomy quite fast. I think we have lost two thirds of it in fifteen years,” said a civil servant who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Eroding Liberties Hong Kong and Macau operate under a framework that allows them to enjoy certain liberties not permitted on the mainland, such as a free press and an independent court structure. However, lawyers have been increasingly vocal that liberties are being eroded and there are growing worries that media freedoms are being undermined. There are also concerns that Beijing's liaison office in Macau has been expanding its activities, co-opting local associations and monitoring political activities. “Now there is a tendency to impose self censorship to not raise the attention of the liaison office,” said Bill Chou, a former professor at the University of Macau and civil rights activist who was fired in 2014 for his political activities, referring to local academia and the media. Wong, the security chief, said in a 2015 interview with Reuters that Macau remained faithful to the ”one country, two systems” model that defines its status but added that the government had daily communications with mainland authorities.  The central government will not meddle or intervene but they will of course want to understand our policies and from what angle we are considering,” Wong said. One official who declined to be named said China was becoming more involved in Macau affairs as a result of events in Hong Kong. “They want to make sure the same thing doesn’t happen in Macau,” the official said. “Macau is a good student, we listen well.” In Hong Kong, some activists see the situation in Macau as a cautionary tale as they protest increasing intervention by Beijing. “We will be the second Macau sooner or later,” said Chan Chun-kit, a 20-year-old university student who was attending a protest following a court ruling that expelled four democracy activist lawmakers from Hong Kong's legislature. “Our freedom has been gradually stifled.”   Additional reporting by William Ho; Editing by Philip McClellan in Singapore","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-macau-china-policy-idUSKBN1A60R4"},

A near 2 percent rise in the euro           this week pinned the dollar to multi-month lows against a trade-weighted basket of its rivals.            The euro rose to its highest since August 2015 in early European trade on Friday as the single currency's bounce prompted some investors to cover short positions.     It climbed 0.3 percent to $1.16650 as markets bet the European Central Bank would tweak its policy stimulus in the autumn.                    The dollar weakness should continue to support gold around current levels and we look to a break through the 100- and 50-day moving averages as a pivot point for further gains,  MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.     A weaker dollar makes U.S. dollar-denominated gold more attractive for buyers using other currencies.     Spot gold        was up 0.2 percent at $1,247.17 per ounce as of 0732 GMT, after hitting its highest since June 29 at $1,248.30. It has gained about 1.5 percent so far this week.         U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,246.50 per ounce.      What we're seeing right now is the overhang from political risks in the United States,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at OANDA in Singapore.     The Republican Party's repeated failures to overhaul the healthcare system and multiple congressional and federal investigations into President Donald Trump's campaign ties to Russia have cast a shadow over his first six months in office.     Spot gold may test a resistance at $1,250 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a further gain to $1,261, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                   If the downside is limited at $1,200, any large disappointment in the (economic) growth story will lead to an increase in gold prices  said Dominic Schnider at UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong.      The appeal of gold as an insurance asset is greater today than it was at the beginning of the year.      Gold is often perceived as an insurance against economic and financial concerns.     Among other precious metals, silver        rose 0.6 percent to $16.38 per ounce after touching $16.42 in the previous session, the highest since July 3.      The grey metal is encountering some resistance toward  $16.40, once again testing the figure during Asian trade on Friday, however unable to break through,  said MKS PAMP trader Laughlin.     Platinum        fell 0.4 percent to $923.00 per ounce, but was set for a weekly gain.     Palladium        rose 0.7 percent to $848.75 per ounce, but was down over 1 percent for the week.

Investors started to question if the market is turning to oversupply from short supply. The previous optimistic attitude has gone, which also reflects market concern over high margins at mills,  wrote analysts at Orient Futures in a note. Stockpiles of rebar in 35 major cities in China rose 123,600 tonnes to 4 million tonnes by Friday compared with the previous week, according to data on the Mysteel Consultancy website. That's up from 3.9 million tonnes a month ago. The current margin on rebar was 1,128 yuan ($166.72) a tonne for this week, according to Mysteel. That was steady from last week but up from about 300 yuan a year ago. The most-active rebar futures contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 3.2 percent to 3,467 yuan a tonne on Friday. It closed at 3,525 yuan, down 1.6 percent.

Spot rebar rose 0.1 percent to 3,945.06 yuan a tonne on Thursday, according to Mysteel data.  The increasing inventory in steel products along with the heatwave across the country curbing demand for steel products will fuel a bear market for steel and the ferrous metal market,  Orient Futures wrote. The most-traded iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange dropped 0.9 percent to 521 yuan a tonne on Friday. Open interest in the September contract has fallen to 1.4 million lots as of Friday, down from 1.8 million lots on Tuesday and the lowest since March 31. Analysts said mills have been slowing down their restocking process, which put pressure on demands for raw materials.

The stock fell 3.4 percent in early session trading, making it one of the worst performers on the pan-European, benchmark STOXX 600 index, which was down 0.1 percent. Valeo shares also underperformed a 0.8 percent rise at rival Faurecia, whose shares touched a 10-year high after Faurecia - in which carmaker PSA has a stake - raised its guidance on Friday. Valeo reported late on Thursday a 20 percent profit gain and 16 percent revenue increase for the January-June period. Yet despite an orders  blowout , those numbers revealed  disappointing yet explainable lower organic growth and low free cash flow , said Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally. Stripping out acquisitions and currency effects, Valeo's 9.464 billion euros ($11 billion) in revenue represented a 9 percent gain but missed the 9.558 billion expected by analysts, based on the median of nine estimates polled for Reuters. Operating and net income figures also fell slightly short. Under Chief Executive Jacques Aschenbroich, Valeo is positioned to benefit from a widespread regulatory emissions crackdown thanks to its push into electric-car and other fuel-saving technologies. It has also become a significant autonomous driving player in partnership with Israel's Mobileye . The order intake, up 16 percent at 14.9 billion euros, promises strong sales on a two- to three-year horizon, but a near-40 percent jump in capital expenditure had some analysts worried about nearer-term margins.  Valeo is an equity market darling,  said Max Warburton of Bernstein. But the results  may again raise questions about the pace, cost and ultimate profitability of growth,  he added.

The ECB, which uses the survey in policy decisions, kept its ultra easy policy unchanged on Thursday, calling for patience and persistence in getting inflation back up to its target. The survey, based on responses from 56 forecasters, sees inflation at 1.5 percent this year, 1.4 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, all 0.1 percentage point below previous projections made three months ago. The longer-term expectation for five years out was unchanged at 1.8 percent.  To two decimal places, however, these revisions were actually much smaller (typically less than 0.05 p.p.) across rounding thresholds,  the ECB said about the revisions. It added that the balance of risk to longer-term inflation expectations remained to the downside. The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent and its staff projections indicate it will continue to miss this target at least through 2019. Expectations for core inflation were revised up to 1.1 percent for this year from 1.0 percent but were left unchanged further out with forecasters predicting 1.3 percent next year, 1.5 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent over the longer term.

A company spokeswoman added he was intending to attend the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in Madrid in September, assuming that AstraZeneca had clinical data on its new immunotherapy medicine ready to present at the event. Soriot did not comment on whether he had received a job offer from Teva in the internal memo to staff, which was sent out at the start of this week. Rumors were  part of everyday business , he said, and AstraZeneca had a policy of not commenting on speculation.   Together, we are poised to achieve something remarkable and that few thought possible,  he wrote.  Nothing can break the momentum you have established, and certainly not rumors.  The spokeswoman confirmed the content of the memo to staff. A report in the Israeli media last week said Soriot was in talks to join Teva, the world's biggest generic drugmaker. That hit shares in AstraZeneca hard, since it would leave the British drugmaker without a leader at a pivotal moment. The company is awaiting for all-important data from a lung cancer drug trial called MYSTIC, which is viewed as crucial for the company's long-term success. AstraZeneca is hoping to secure a substantial slice of a multibillion dollar market by proving its combination of two immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, can help previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. It has already proved in a separate trial called PACIFIC that durvalumab alone can help some patients with earlier-stage disease. Detailed findings from both studies could be presented at the ESMO meeting, if scientists are able to prepare them for presentation in time. That would make the cancer meeting a key event for AstraZeneca. Soriot is a regular attendee at such medical meetings and the 58-year-old Frenchman has made research-based drug discovery the central focus of his time at AstraZeneca. Moving to a generics drugmaker like Teva would therefore be a big change in direction. During his five years at AstraZeneca, Soriot successfully defended the company against a takeover approach from Pfizer and has rebuilt the drugs pipeline through both in-house research and acquisitions.

This is the beginning of the third quarter and demand picks up in the third quarter and I hope the agreement will have a significant impact in the third and fourth quarter.  Brent crude oil prices remain just under the key $50 per barrel mark on concerns about high supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) despite a pledge to cut output in a bid to tighten the market. OPEC, together with some non-members like Russia, has extended a deal to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to March 2018.  The United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui speaks to journalists in Singapore, July 21, 2017.Darren WhitesideHowever, OPEC's compliance slumped to 78 percent in June as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola, the International Energy Agency said last week.  The UAE is committed to its cut,  Mazroui said.  We have seen some increase in production in some of the countries that were not part of the agreement because of their special stance.  Oil traders are looking ahead to Monday's meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC members to see if it will address rising production from Nigeria and Libya, which have been exempted from the cuts. OPEC's Joint Ministerial Committee monitors compliance with the supply pact and will meet in St Petersburg, Russia. OPEC's supply cuts have also been countered by rising U.S. production, which has increased almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.4 million bpd.

The calm in the former Portuguese enclave, now a special administrative region of China, is partly the result of a multi-decade effort by Beijing to exert its authority over the territory. In the decade before the handover in 1999, the Chinese government handpicked a group of about 40 young graduates from across China and placed them in key government departments, according to former officials familiar with the process.   Those young graduates, armed with a fluency in Portuguese and legal training, swiftly rose through the ranks. They eventually assumed powerful positions that have helped align Macau more closely to the mainland at a time when infighting and instability plagues Hong Kong, said Jose Luis de Sales Marques, Macau’s mayor from 1993 to 2001.   “They were given positions when they were still very young, very leading positions,” said Marques, who now heads Macau’s institute of European studies.  Half of Macau’s most senior officials have origins in China, in stark contrast to Hong Kong, where no mainland Chinese occupy top government posts. Among those officials is Wong Sio Chak, who was appointed Macau’s security chief in 2014. He has been tipped as a potential leader when elections for Macau’s chief executive take place in two years, according to sources in the civil service.  Cheong Weng Chon, head of Macau’s anti-corruption body, and Ip Son Sang, Macau’s public prosecutor general, are other officials sent from the mainland in the 1990s to help Portugal and China prepare for the post-handover administration. Details of the officials’ careers have been corroborated through interviews with over a dozen former officials and civil servants and official public records. Soon after the officials from the mainland were appointed to top positions in 2014, Macau launched a cleanup of the territory’s $30 billion gambling industry, responding to a call by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to stamp out corruption in China. Chinese rule has been generally welcomed in Macau, which has seen economic growth soar and a period of stability - in contrast with the years preceding the handover when there were a series of mobster wars.  More than half of Macau’s population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born in the territory. Macau’s calm has been noticed in Beijing. In July, Xi visited Hong Kong and lavished praise on Macau. In contrast, he delivered a stark warning to Hong Kong that Beijing would not tolerate any challenge to its authority. Still, as China’s influence in Macau becomes more overt there are growing fears that its autonomy is threatened.   I think Macau is losing that autonomy quite fast. I think we have lost two thirds of it in fifteen years,” said a civil servant who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Eroding Liberties Hong Kong and Macau operate under a framework that allows them to enjoy certain liberties not permitted on the mainland, such as a free press and an independent court structure. However, lawyers have been increasingly vocal that liberties are being eroded and there are growing worries that media freedoms are being undermined. There are also concerns that Beijing's liaison office in Macau has been expanding its activities, co-opting local associations and monitoring political activities. “Now there is a tendency to impose self censorship to not raise the attention of the liaison office,” said Bill Chou, a former professor at the University of Macau and civil rights activist who was fired in 2014 for his political activities, referring to local academia and the media. Wong, the security chief, said in a 2015 interview with Reuters that Macau remained faithful to the ”one country, two systems” model that defines its status but added that the government had daily communications with mainland authorities.  The central government will not meddle or intervene but they will of course want to understand our policies and from what angle we are considering,” Wong said. One official who declined to be named said China was becoming more involved in Macau affairs as a result of events in Hong Kong. “They want to make sure the same thing doesn’t happen in Macau,” the official said. “Macau is a good student, we listen well.” In Hong Kong, some activists see the situation in Macau as a cautionary tale as they protest increasing intervention by Beijing. “We will be the second Macau sooner or later,” said Chan Chun-kit, a 20-year-old university student who was attending a protest following a court ruling that expelled four democracy activist lawmakers from Hong Kong's legislature. “Our freedom has been gradually stifled.”   Additional reporting by William Ho; Editing by Philip McClellan in Singapore","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/macau-china-policy-idUSL3N1K93B1"},

Although Phelps missed the 2013 and 2015 championships, it is his farewell after his final competitive race at the Rio Olympics which still resonates.

Nearly one year on, his departure has left a void as the sport searches for the next global star to take over the 32-year-old's mantle. A mixed medley relay, along with a men's 800m and women's 1500m freestyle races were last month added to the Tokyo 2020 program by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in a radical shake-up of the Games program. However, if those changes were implemented to ensure gender parity across the sport, it is women's elite swimmers who are likely to receive top billing in Budapest.

Like Hosszu, she is entered into six events - and unless she scratches some races, the 20-year-old collegiate will undertake her most active schedule yet in a major meet. Along with Hosszu and Ledecky, Swedish sprint star Sarah Sjostrom, 23, will be vying to win her first freestyle world title, having come to the fore with Olympic gold in the 100m butterfly, her signature event. Top male swimmers to look out for in Budapest include Britain's Olympic breaststroke champion Adam Peaty and South African Chad le Clos, who is aiming to put a disappointing Rio Games behind him after the defending champion finished outside of the medals in the 200m Olympic butterfly final. Away from the pool, Julio Maglione will be seeking re-election at the helm of the sport's international body, FINA, when a presidency vote is held on Saturday. Maglione, 81, is considered favorite for a fourth term when he stands against Italy's Paolo Barelli, the European Swimming Federation president.

The euro's 0.3 percent vault above $1.1650 in early trading on Friday meant that those holding currency options betting on a fall in the single currency after the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday faced heavy losses. The next target level for the euro was an August 2015 high at $1.17150, according to strategists. The euro rose to $1.16765 as markets bet the European Central Bank would tweak its policy stimulus in the autumn, although ECB President Mario Draghi was careful to give few hints about the bank's next move after Thursday's policy meeting.  There is really nothing in Draghi's remarks yesterday that calls for this kind of bullishness on the euro and markets may end up getting disappointed before long,  said Adam Cole, head of G10 FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. The euro's strength pushed the dollar to an 11-month low of 93.994 against a trade-weighted basket of other major currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to garner enough support for his healthcare bills in the Senate this week also weighed on the dollar, as it raised concern about similar obstacles in passing his stimulus and tax reform agendas. The dollar was broadly flat against the yen at 111.79 after touching an overnight low of 111.48, its lowest since June 27. It was on track to shed 0.4 percent for the week. The dollar's losses against the yen were mitigated by market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep its massive stimulus programme in place far longer than other major central banks amid stubbornly weak inflation. The Australian dollar plunged after a top central banker said on Friday that the Reserve Bank of Australia doesn't need to follow the leader when it comes to global monetary tightening. The Aussie fell 0.8 percent to $0.7893 after falling as low as $0.7875 earlier.

A company spokeswoman added he was intending to attend the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in Madrid in September, assuming that AstraZeneca had clinical data on its new immunotherapy medicine ready to present at the event. Soriot did not comment on whether he had received a job offer from Teva in the internal memo to staff, which was sent out at the start of this week. Rumors were  part of everyday business , he said, and AstraZeneca had a policy of not commenting on speculation.   Together, we are poised to achieve something remarkable and that few thought possible,  he wrote.  Nothing can break the momentum you have established, and certainly not rumors.  The spokeswoman confirmed the content of the memo to staff. A report in the Israeli media last week said Soriot was in talks to join Teva, the world's biggest generic drugmaker. That hit shares in AstraZeneca hard, since it would leave the British drugmaker without a leader at a pivotal moment. The company is awaiting for all-important data from a lung cancer drug trial called MYSTIC, which is viewed as crucial for the company's long-term success. AstraZeneca is hoping to secure a substantial slice of a multibillion dollar market by proving its combination of two immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, can help previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. It has already proved in a separate trial called PACIFIC that durvalumab alone can help some patients with earlier-stage disease. Detailed findings from both studies could be presented at the ESMO meeting, if scientists are able to prepare them for presentation in time. That would make the cancer meeting a key event for AstraZeneca. Soriot is a regular attendee at such medical meetings and the 58-year-old Frenchman has made research-based drug discovery the central focus of his time at AstraZeneca. Moving to a generics drugmaker like Teva would therefore be a big change in direction. During his five years at AstraZeneca, Soriot successfully defended the company against a takeover approach from Pfizer and has rebuilt the drugs pipeline through both in-house research and acquisitions.

China released a national AI development plan late on Thursday, aiming to grow the country's core AI industries to over 150 billion yuan ($22.15 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion yuan ($59.07 billion) by 2025, the State Council said. With this major push into AI, China is looking to rival U.S. market leaders such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp, as it is keen not to be left behind in a technology that is increasingly key from smart cars to energy.  The local and central government are supporting this AI effort,  said Rui Yong, chief technology officer at PC maker Lenovo Group, speaking on the sidelines of an AI conference in Shanghai on Thursday.   They see this trend coming and they want to invest more.  Beijing's AI plan comes as the United States is poised to bolster its scrutiny of investments, including artificial intelligence, over fears that countries including China could access technology of strategic military importance. China's State Council said the  situation with China on national security and international competition is complex , which was part of the incentive for making a domestic AI push.

Beijing would also play a bigger role via policy support and regulation. China has already invested heavily in AI, while Chinese Premier Li Keqiang named it as a strategic technology in an annual report earlier this year. In February, the country's powerful state planner opened an AI lab in partnership with Baidu Inc, the country's top search engine, which is making a major push in to AI. Lenovo's Rui said official support for AI was because it was seen as the latest  industrial revolution  akin to the advent of the combustion engine, electricity or the Internet.

Tepco detected black-colored material that dangled like icicles that could be nuclear debris near the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel that contained the fuel rods, the report said, citing unnamed sources. Finding the highly radioactive melted fuel rods may pave the way for Tepco to develop methods to remove the melted fuel. Tepco launched its first attempt to probe the inside of the No. 3 reactor using a submersible robot on Wednesday, the company said in an e-mail on Thursday.

Following local favorite Katinka Hosszu's trio of Olympic titles at last summer's Olympics, an expectant nation will now be anticipating more bounty in the pool where she has been training for multiple individual tilts. 2016 Rio Olympics - Swimming - Victory Ceremony - Women's 800m Freestyle Victory Ceremony - Olympic Aquatics Stadium - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 12/08/2016.

Like Hosszu, she is entered into six events - and unless she scratches some races, the 20-year-old collegiate will undertake her most active schedule yet in a major meet. Along with Hosszu and Ledecky, Swedish sprint star Sarah Sjostrom, 23, will be vying to win her first freestyle world title, having come to the fore with Olympic gold in the 100m butterfly, her signature event. Top male swimmers to look out for in Budapest include Britain's Olympic breaststroke champion Adam Peaty and South African Chad le Clos, who is aiming to put a disappointing Rio Games behind him after the defending champion finished outside of the medals in the 200m Olympic butterfly final. Away from the pool, Julio Maglione will be seeking re-election at the helm of the sport's international body, FINA, when a presidency vote is held on Saturday. Maglione, 81, is considered favorite for a fourth term when he stands against Italy's Paolo Barelli, the European Swimming Federation president.

The Detwiler Fire, which is menacing the former gold rush town of Mariposa in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is only 10 percent contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said on its website.  We're doing everything we can to protect that town and all the other communities in that area,  Amy Head, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire, said by telephone. Mariposa is 50 miles (80 km) outside Yosemite National Park and largely dependent on tourism. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County on Tuesday. More than 3,000 firefighters, working in temperatures of 90 to 96 Fahrenheit (32 to 36 Celsius), were battling the fire, which has charred 70,596 acres (28,570 hectares), Cal Fire said.  It has expanded by more than 22,000 acres (8,903 hectares) since Thursday morning. Cal Fire said it has burned 45 buildings and damaged another six since it began on Monday. The cause of the fire is under investigation. A chimney stands amidst remains of a home destroyed by the Detwiler fire in Mariposa, California U.S. July 19, 2017.Stephen LamThe fire came within a half-mile of Mariposa on Wednesday, said Cal Fire spokeswoman Shanelle Saunders. The town's 2,000 residents were ordered on Tuesday to evacuate.  Yosemite National Park remained open. Saunders said the biggest concern with the park on Thursday was air quality due to heavy smoke.    The community of Coulterville was evacuated on Wednesday, Saunders said.  Slideshow (10 Images)The Detwiler Fire, named after a road near where it started, was threatening 1,500 structures, Cal Fire said.  Meanwhile, in Montana, officials said that a 19-year-old firefighter was killed on Wednesday when part of a tree fell on him while he was combating the so-called Florence Fire north of Seeley Lake. A total of 44 large fires across 11 western states were burning on Thursday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center's website. As firefighters handled those blazes, the National Science Foundation announced that a study it had underwritten had found wildfires create their own weather, such as updrafts and eddies, which cause flames to spread out of control.  The findings from researchers at San Jose State University, who took measurements near a 2014 wildfire, confirm previous discoveries which were done through computer simulations, instead of in the field, the foundation said in a statement.

Tepco detected black-colored material that dangled like icicles that could be nuclear debris near the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel that contained the fuel rods, the report said, citing unnamed sources. Finding the highly radioactive melted fuel rods may pave the way for Tepco to develop methods to remove the melted fuel. Tepco launched its first attempt to probe the inside of the No. 3 reactor using a submersible robot on Wednesday, the company said in an e-mail on Thursday. The company plans to continue its probe until Saturday.     A Tepco spokesman said on Friday the company has yet to analyze the findings from the probe. The company in January spotted possible nuclear fuel debris below the damaged No. 2 reactor at the plant. In the world's worst nuclear calamity since Chernobyl in 1986, three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant melted down after a magnitude 9 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that devastated a large area and killed more than 15,000 people.

The assignment of the final ratings follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final ratings are in line with the expected rating assigned on 26 June 2017. The notes are rated at the same level as Baidu's Issuer Default Rating as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and general obligations of the company. The proceeds from the notes will be used for debt repayment and for general corporate purposes. The RWN will be resolved when management has provided further information on its wholly owned Financial Services Group's (FSG) expansion plans, risk control policies and procedures, and capital structure. We may affirm the ratings at their current level or downgrade the ratings, although any downgrade is likely to be a single notch. Our review will take into account Baidu's strong net cash position, which provides a cushion to fund potential losses in the FSG. KEY RATING DRIVERS Placed on Negative Watch: Fitch placed Baidu's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and 'A' foreign-currency senior unsecured rating on RWN on 31 May 2017. The RWN reflects Fitch's belief that the rapid growth in Baidu's financial services activities under its FSG has increased Baidu's overall business risk. The risk profile of the financial services activities is significantly higher than the risk profile of Baidu's core internet services, such as search services, online video and transaction services. Elevated Business Risk: The FSG sells wealth management products (WMPs), which are mostly fixed-income products with short tenors of up to 12 months, and operates a micro-lending business. Baidu's wealth management business is similar to that of many Chinese banks and WMPs are part of the shadow banking system in China. As with Chinese banks, Baidu does not need to set aside large capital against potential defaults on its WMPs. Baidu sells WMPs to retail investors and reinvests most of the funds via a third-party trust company into money market investments, other fixed-income investments and corporate borrowers. Although we understand that Baidu is not legally bound to pay the target return on the WMPs to investors, we believe the potential damage to the company's reputation can be large. Therefore, we think Baidu may have to compensate WMP investors if the WMPs fail to achieve the target returns. We also believe the risk profile of Baidu's micro-lending business is higher than Baidu's core business, as its loans and cash credits to consumers are unsecured. Rapid Growth in WMPs: Baidu's FSG business has grown from assets of CNY12 billion at end-2016 to CNY25 billion at end-March 2017, and we expect both the FSG's WMP assets and micro-loan book to continue expanding rapidly, at least in the short term. WMPs continue to proliferate in China as there is abundant liquidity, but a scarcity of high-yielding assets in which to invest. WMPs have become an alternative form of financing for projects or investments that would not qualify for bank loans. A large exposure to WMPs may make Baidu vulnerable to asset-quality shocks, especially as loss events rise. Contingent Loss-absorption Capacity: Our review to resolve the RWN will address Baidu's capacity to absorb losses in the FSG operations to ensure that if the FSG underperformed, the additional funding required would not be a big enough drain on cash from Baidu's core operations to threaten the 'A' rating. We believe Baidu's net cash position will be increasingly important, as it will be the primary source of contingent loss-absorption capacity. At end-2016, Baidu's net cash totalled CNY23 billion, excluding payables to WMP customers of CNY7 billion, which were funds from retail investors entrusted to Baidu to invest in WMPs. DERIVATION SUMMARY Baidu's credit profile compares favourably with its internet peers, such as eBay Inc. (BBB/Stable) and Expedia, Inc. (BBB-/Stable), but is weaker than Alibaba Group Holding Limited (A+/Stable) and Tencent Holdings Limited (A+/Stable). Baidu's cash-generation ability is weaker than that of Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu's ratings benefit from its dominance in China's search engine market, but it faces challenges to diversify its business lines and revenue sources from its core search services. It has assumed higher risk in the expansion into transaction services and financial services activities, which has resulted in high gross leverage and lower profitability than Alibaba and Tencent. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue compounded annual growth rate of about 17% in 2016-2019 - Operating EBIT margin of 16%-17% in 2017-2019 - Annual capex of CNY16 billion-19 billion in 2017-2019 - No cash dividend and the USD2 billion share buyback programme to be completed by end-2017 - Net cash position to be sustained in 2017-2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Positive rating action is currently not envisaged. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Fitch plans to resolve the RWN when it has further information on the FSG's expansion plans, risk control policies and procedures, and future capital structure. The final ratings will depend on Baidu's risk control of its financial services activities, the pace of the FSG's growth and the availability of loss-absorption capacity in terms of net cash position. We may affirm the ratings at their current level or downgrade the ratings, although any downgrade is likely to be a single notch. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: We expect Baidu to continue to maintain a large net cash balance. At end-March 2017, Baidu had cash and short-term investments of CNY91 billion. This compared with total debt of CNY58 billion, which included redeemable non-controlling interests at subsidiaries. Mostly US Dollar Unsecured Debt: Excluding payables to WMP customers of CNY20 billion, Baidu's total debt was about CNY58 billion, with the vast majority unsecured and denominated in US dollars at end-March 2017. US dollar unsecured notes totalled USD4.75 billion and US dollar unsecured bank loans amounted to USD1.5 billion. In addition, iQiyi, a majority-owned online video subsidiary of Baidu, issued USD1.5 billion convertible notes to third parties in January 2017. Of the US dollar debt, USD750 million of 2.25% unsecured notes and USD500 million of unsecured bank loans will be due in the next few months before end-2017.

Hermes, known for its $10,000 Birkin bags and $400 printed silk scarves, made the forecast after sales growth slowed in the second quarter, broadly in line with expectations, and reflecting mostly challenging year-ago comparables. Chief Executive Axel Dumas told a conference call that sales momentum remained  quite good  with sustained demand for Hermes' Birkin, Kelly, Constance and Lindy bags, robust demand for shoes, while the silk business continued to rebound.  Everybody is quite optimistic for the future,  he said. In China, Hermes sales were still growing in double digits in the quarter, while Europe benefited from a rebound in tourist flows, which was particularly strong in Italy and in London thanks to a weaker pound, he said. France was broadly flat, while growth in America also slowed due to high year-ago comparisons. Hermes reported an 8.3 percent rise in revenue at constant exchange rates to 1.361 billion euros ($1.58 billion), compared with 11.2 percent growth in the first quarter. Analysts had forecast about 9 percent growth on average. Sales growth at its leather goods division, which makes up 50 percent of group sales, slowed to 9.7 percent from the 15 percent rise achieved in the first quarter. For full-year 2017, Dumas said he expected sales growth at the leather goods division to be close to its average annual growth of 10 percent. The luxury industry has suffered in the past couple of years as demand in China slowed and attacks in France deterred some tourists from travelling to Europe. A recovery in tourism in Europe and stronger Chinese consumption are expected to lead a rebound in the luxury sector this year, the Bain consultancy predicted in May. By 0702 GMT Hermes shares gained 0.2 percent at 441.15 euros, having gained 13 percent so far this year. RBC Capital markets kept a  sector perform  rating on the stock saying second quarter revenues yielded no surprises.  Hermes remains the closest brand in our coverage to the 'perfect luxury paradox', simultaneously balancing characteristics like timeless, modernity, growth and high profitability,  RBC analysts wrote.  These strengths seem to us to be now properly reflected in its premium valuation at 34 times estimated 2018 P/E (price-earnings ratio), on our current numbers,  they said. Hermes said it was keeping an  ambitious  medium-term goal for revenue growth at constant exchange rates despite growing economic and geopolitical and monetary uncertainties. $1 = 0.8595 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Leigh Thomas and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hermes-sales-salesfigures-idUSL5N1KC10A"},

Two former bankers with Lloyds' HBOS unit in the English town of Reading were among those jailed for their involvement in the scam, which affected 67 people including Noel Edmonds, a TV presenter and former disc jockey. Lloyds said in a statement it has made offers to 16 customers and is in the final stages of assessment to make 14 more, although only 5 offers have been accepted.  We are continuing to make progress in getting offers to victims of the HBOS Reading fraud,  said Adrian White, Lloyds' chief operating officer for commercial banking. Lloyds announced the deadline for its 100 million-pound ($130 million) compensation scheme in April after six people were jailed in February for a scam that involved siphoning money from struggling businesses. Victims of the fraud have accused the bank of dragging out the compensation process and underestimating the final amount it will have to pay. The jailed bankers pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy as a condition for receiving loans and, in some cases, hand over ownership.

She directed her first feature film, “A Death In The Gunj”, last year and is now back with a role in Alankrita Shrivastava’s “Lipstick Under My Burkha”. Sen Sharma, who plays a Muslim mother who is desperate to break the shackles of her conservative existence, spoke to Reuters about the film, why a female perspective is important in movies and whether she thinks she will sit behind the camera again.  Q: How did you come to be a part of “Lipstick Under My Burkha”? A: I knew (director) Alankrita from earlier on because we had common friends. I heard she was writing this film and when I read the script, I loved it. It was very well thought-out and felt like a recounting of lived experiences even though she could not have lived these four lives. It felt like an intimate glance at the lives of these four women, and we don’t see that very often in our cinema. Q: We see Bollywood films about the bond between men but hardly anything that showcases sisterhood… A: The discrimination that women face cuts across nationality, caste or class and age. It doesn’t matter where you live or how much money you have, women have always been dictated to about what they should wear and how they should behave. That is what we have in common with these characters and women across the world. Also, I think we don’t get to see the lives of older women (in our films). We see women in their late teens or early 20s, which is such a small section of society. There are so many more complex stories to tell. Shireen Aslam, the woman I play in the film, is in her 30s and has three children. That kind of context is not seen very often in films. She’s not a shrill feminist – she has to pick her battles. These are her givens and she has to see how she can achieve her goals in finding loopholes. It is a very interesting way of trying to reclaim agency. Q: A lot of the conversation around the success of the new “Wonder Woman” film revolved around the female gaze and the politics of how women are portrayed in films. Do you think the female perspective matters? A: I think the female gaze is important because we cannot have just one perspective on anything. We have been seeing cinema from a male perspective for a very long time and there are things which are given, which are allowed and things which are normalised, like harassment or stalking - not just in films, but in ads or music videos. We haven’t seen as much from a female perspective. But one of the most important things in feminism is choice. And because women should have choice, we cannot force them to be feminists. They can choose to be regressive if they want. Therefore, it is not incumbent on women to make feminist films or films about women, but there should be a lot more women film-makers, regardless.  Q: Do you find it difficult to accept roles that don’t conform to your views on feminism or gender? A: As a working actor, I don’t have a lot of choice. There was a time when I got varied film offers. But nowadays, I don’t get a lot interesting characters to play at all. Q: Why is that? A: So many things (Sighs). It could be that I have been around for longer and am older. It could be that we are not interested in telling stories about women in their 30s. Some films follow a certain formula. If you see films which have been successful over the last 10 years, the women in them have been in their 20s. “The Dirty Picture” and “English Vinglish” are two I can think of. But there are very few good roles for women in their 30s. Q: Are you looking to direct again? A: I would like to, but I hope I find something that I feel strongly about as I did about Shutu and McCluskieganj. I don’t want to make just anything. I also want to do some interesting acting work, so I hope I get that. Many times, one does get interesting work, but it is also work that doesn’t get funded because one sure-shot way to get funding is to take a big star… People who fund films have to be able to take risks, even if they are smaller risks. And audiences have to go out and watch these films. Otherwise we cannot make them.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.5 percent, to 3,728.60 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,237.98 points. For the week, the two indexes gained 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, erasing losses earlier this week when investors dumped start-ups stocks.  Blue chips found favour with investors as they attach great importance to performance and valuations at listed firms due to curbed risk appetite amid tighter financial regulations and liquidity conditions,  said Xu Wei, analyst with Hongxin Securities. Xu expects tighter regulations to continue as a largely stable economy allows Beijing more leeway to tackle bubbles. Among blue chips, Shanghai-listed China Molybdenum Co Ltd , a major non-ferrous metals producer in China, has gained 16.8 percent this week. The stock is up more than 45 percent so far this month. China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, defying expectations for a slight loss of momentum in growth. Fitch Ratings said on Thursday China's renewed commitment to contain financial risks signals a possible shift away from high economic growth targets, though policymakers are likely to remain cautious about tightening too aggressively. China's opening up its stock market to foreign investors by the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong connect programmes, as well as by the MSCI's decision to include China stocks, also helped prompt a rotation into blue chips, Xu added. U.S. index provider MSCI has agreed to add 222 China-listed large-cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion. China Molybdenum is among them. In sharp contrast with strong gains in blue chips, the tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext lost 3.2 percent for the week, hovering around 30-month lows after a 5.1 percent slump on Monday, as market participants shunned firms that feature dim performance and higher valuations. The index is almost 60 percent below a record high hit in June 2015. For the week, materials shares far outperformed the broader market, with an index tracking those firms leaping 5 percent, after they forecast surges for mid-year earnings growth, helped by expectations China would continue to push supply-side reforms and keep its economy largely stable.

Behind the scenes, however, the U.S. and European militaries have been more effective in adapting to the actions of President Vladimir Putin and Moscow’s aggressive new military doctrine.  It’s now just over three years since Russia’s war in eastern Ukraine redefined how Western states see conflict. The result increasingly looks set to revolutionize the U.S. and European armed forces as much as any combat lessons learned in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The process is still in its infancy. Still, troops, aircraft and warships from leading NATO states - most importantly the United States - have become a permanent presence in much of Eastern Europe. And for all the worries about President Donald Trump’s possible Russia links and lukewarm commitment to NATO’s Article 5, U.S. military and diplomatic leaders have been robust in stressing America’s commitment to European security.  NATO’s top priority is defending the most vulnerable northern and eastern European countries, particularly the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - once part of the Soviet Union, now within the Western alliance.  READ MORE COMMENTARY FROM REUTERS Jordan Michael Smith: Justin Trudeau masters the Trump two-step Paul Waldman: The number that explains why Congressional Republicans won't turn on Trump This summer has seen NATO conducting cutting-edge anti-submarine and electronic warfare exercises in the North Atlantic, near daily flights by surveillance aircraft operating in the Baltic and a host of other war games from the Black Sea to the Arctic.  Moscow's swift, largely bloodless annexation of Ukraine’s Russian-speaking Crimea region grabbed Europe's attention. That’s been even truer of the deadlier war in the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine - where Russian-backed separatists declared the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in 2014.  For residents there, the results have been devastating. The United Nations estimates more than 2,700 civilians have been amongst an estimated 10,000 killed since April 2014. More than 1.6 million people in the conflict area have fled their homes.  These victims are, of course, the very Russian-speaking Ukrainians Moscow says it is trying to help with its actions. Still, Ukraine has enabled Putin to re-establish Russia’s reputation as a top-tier global power.  This now goes well beyond the deliberately ambiguous Russian strategies of information warfare and hybrid confrontation that have preoccupied many analysts in the West since 2014. Russia may still be reluctant to acknowledge that it has used conventional forces in Ukraine, but evidence on the ground is overwhelming.  When the Ukraine war started, Kiev’s military used U.S.-style military techniques honed against relatively unsophisticated insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. These tactics proved disastrous, particularly for armored vehicles, after Russian artillery batteries used drones and other advanced surveillance equipment to inflict horrific losses.  Russian cyber attacks and electronic jamming also disabled Western-provided equipment, including what Washington had considered state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles.  The effectiveness of Moscow's techniques shocked U.S. strategists, many of whom had come to believe Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya-style insurgent foes were all they would ever confront.  The challenge now for Western militaries is to devise effective counters to Russia’s actions in Europe while simultaneously building on the lessons learned from the success of the U.S.-backed Iraqi military campaign in Mosul and advances against militants in Syria, Somalia and Nigeria.  That, in turn, leads to tension over resource allocation. France’s top military officer resigned Wednesday, citing dissatisfaction with defense cuts. U.S. and other militaries continue to face an awkward balancing act between ever more expensive high-end equipment such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and money for personnel and training.  Much planning revolves around finding techniques to counter Russia’s so-called “Gerasimov doctrine,” which focuses on political operations rather than conventional military confrontations. But Western strategists have also put renewed focus on classic Cold War-style military deterrence aimed at persuading Moscow of the risks of attacking a NATO member are simply too great.  In its posturing over the last three years, the Kremlin has aggressively used the threat of direct military action - both conventional and nuclear - to intimidate other countries. Major military drills planned for September will be the next example of that. In doing so, however, Putin may have shot himself in the foot.  Western planning means that Moscow would find it harder to mount any attack than only a few years ago - and the more Putin makes aggressive noise, the more this will be true. Moscow’s forces might outnumber NATO troops in the region, but the alliance hopes it now has enough presence for Moscow to realize it cannot hope to overrun a NATO state without sparking a much wider war.  Any such conflict, all sides realize, might well turn nuclear.  Germany, which is gradually upping its military spending towards the NATO target of two percent of gross domestic product, has made it clear it sees Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a game-changer. Germany’s military is now keen to restore skills in neglected areas such as ground-based air defense and combat engineering. It is also working more closely with other European allies.  Growing numbers of Western strategists believe Putin hopes Russia’s propaganda and political disruption efforts may ultimately cause both NATO and the European Union to collapse. Few see that as likely - but countries most vulnerable to Russia, such as the Baltic states and Finland, are taking few chances.  In the event of an invasion, the plan is for many of their troops - mostly conscripts - to withdraw into forests and mount hit-and-run attacks against Russian troops.   In addition, several Nordic and European nations - Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Denmark - have quietly come together to form the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force. It’s a framework that could deploy a substantial, sustainable force to defend the Baltic states - and would still exist even if the NATO and U.S. commitment to Europe vanished.  That may not be enough to stop Russia launching a surprise assault on a slice of NATO territory. However, even that would likely just further intensify Europe’s commitment to defending the rest of its territory.     The fact is that Europe is now better defended than at any point in decades. If Russia feels threatened by that, then Putin has only himself to blame.  About the AuthorPeter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist.

Wages for temporary workers are  clearly on the rise  as companies struggle to lure employees, with the job market having tightened to levels not seen since Japan's asset-inflated bubble era in the early 1990s, the BOJ said. But permanent workers' pay remains stagnant because labor unions representing these employees, who enjoy better benefits than those on the temporary roll, tend to prioritize job security over higher pay, it said in a report on Friday. Japan's unique pay scale, where salaries rise according to seniority, also discourages job hopping and prevents a tight job market from pushing up overall wages, the central bank said. The slow growth in permanent workers' income, which makes up nearly 70 percent of total wage-earners' income, partly explains why wage growth is subdued despite a strong economy, it said.  Companies are taking various steps to address a shortage of labor,  such as introducing robots to automate operations and cutting back on extra services, the BOJ said. Restaurant chain operators like Royal Holdings, which used to open their outlets 24 hours, are shortening opening hours due to a paucity of staff. Such efforts will raise labor productivity and could weigh on inflation, though the downward pressure exerted on prices will be temporary as Japan's potential growth heightens, it said. The disparity between strong growth and low inflation is a common puzzle for global central banks though the problem is more pronounced in Japan, where inflation remains ground to a halt despite four years of aggressive money printing. In a show of alarm over the problem, the BOJ included a rare analysis on wage and job growth in a full version of its quarterly report, which is issued a day after a summary of it that focuses on the long-term growth and price projections. At a two-day rate review that ended on Thursday, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady but once again pushed back the timing for achieving its ambitious inflation target, reinforcing views it will lag well behind other major central banks in scaling back its massive stimulus program. Japan's jobless rate rose to 3.1 percent in May, while the availability of jobs rose for the third straight month to reach the highest since February 1974. But core consumer prices in May rose just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's 2 percent target.

Core consumer prices were seen likely to maintain a moderate increase in June led by energy costs, but the prices of other items were expected remain soft - emphasizing the economy's lack of inflationary pressure.   The poll showed household spending was expected to grow 0.6 percent in June from a year earlier with retail sales seen rising 2.3 percent for the month.  Consumer spending is picking up as higher share prices helped consumer sentiment and wages were relatively good,  said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  There is a high chance consumer spending will contribute positively to economic growth in April-June.  Japan's economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in  January to March and analysts see the economy continuing to grow in the April-June quarter. GDP data is due mid-August. The poll found that Japan's unemployment rate was seen likely to fall to 3.0 percent in June from 3.1 percent in May, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen at 1.5, the highest level since February 1974.  The economy is recovering and firms' labor shortages remain severe. So the jobless rate could go back to below 3.0 percent again in coming months,  said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. The poll forecast the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices,  would rose 0.4 percent in June from a year ago, unchanged from May. The internal affairs ministry will announce the CPI, employment data and household spending data at 2330 GMT on Thursday (8:30 a.m. on July 28 Japan time). The trade ministry will issue the retail sales at 2350 GMT the same day. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday but once again pushed back the timing for achieving its ambitious inflation target, reinforcing views it will lag well behind other major central banks in scaling back its massive stimulus program.

The company has been hit by weak global industrial demand, heavy price pressure and intense competition in recent years, but growth returned at the end of 2016, and has since accelerated.  As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to see continued broad-based industrial activity and growth,  SKF Chief Executive Alrik Danielson said in a statement. Gothenburg-based SKF's second-quarter operating profit, adjusted for one-time items, rose to 2.44 billion Swedish crowns ($297 million) from 2.02 billion in the same period last year, beating a mean forecast for 2.36 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts. SKF, which counts Germany's Schaeffler AG and Timken of the United States among its rivals , said it expected higher demand, by which it typically means sales volume growth of 4-8 percent, in the current quarter compared with the same quarter in 2016. It forecast higher demand in Europe, North America and Asia, and significantly higher in Latin America. Like-for-like sales grew 7.5 in the quarter, ahead of a 7.1 percent mean forecast. A profit warning from Schaeffler in late June citing rising pricing pressure in the automotive business as well as a temporary supply chain shortage in the automotive aftermarket business, has weighed on SKF shares. SKF shares are down 4 percent in the past month, compared with a 17 percent drop for Schaeffler and a 2 percent decline in the STOXX Europe 600 Industrial Goods & Services Index. But while Schaeffler generates the vast majority of its sales in its automotive business, SKF's automotive division accounts for only around 30 percent of its group sales. 1 = 8.2198 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom; editing by Niklas Pollard)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/skf-results-idUSL5N1KC114"},

The 23-year-old right-hander lived up to the billing Thursday night. Severino pitched seven scoreless innings, and Gardner hit a solo home run as the Yankees defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-1 in the opener of a four-game series at Safeco Field.  He's been unbelievable,  said Gardner, the Yankees' left fielder.  Not just tonight but last week in Boston and the whole first half.  It's been fun to watch him grow. He makes it easy on the defense because there's not much action for us. He's only going to continue to get better. He's got a great arm.  In his past two starts, Severino has matched up against the Red Sox's Chris Sale and the Mariners' Felix Hernandez. Severino didn't get a decision Saturday against Sale in a game the Yankees won 4-1 in 16 innings, but he beat Hernandez on Thursday.  When he's on the mound, we feel comfortable,  Gardner said. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at MarinersNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchSeverino (6-4), who didn't pitch in the All-Star Game despite being a member of the American League team, allowed eight hits to the Mariners but got out of several jams. He walked one and struck out six.  I knew it was going to be tough,  Severino said of facing Hernandez.  That's who I compare myself to. Any chance you get to face a guy like that ... it gives me a chance to (get) better.  Seattle's only run came on a two-out double by former Yankee Robinson Cano in the bottom of the ninth inning against Aroldis Chapman. The Mariners wasted a strong start by Hernandez, stranding 12 runners and going 2-for-14 with runners in scoring position. Hernandez (5-4) allowed just one run on three hits and two walks in seven innings. He struck out a season-high nine.  It was an outstanding pitching performance from both sides,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Felix was really sharp and gave us everything he had. ... Unfortunately, the other guy was a little better. Severino was about as good as we've seen all year.  Gardner broke a scoreless tie with his homer with one out in the top of the sixth inning. He hit a 2-1 pitch from Hernandez into the right field seats, a shot estimated at 406 feet. It was Gardner's 16th home run of the season.  He gave me a fastball and kind of left it in the middle,  Gardner said.  You don't want to miss a pitch like that.  New York added three unearned runs over the final two innings. With one out in the eighth, Chase Headley singled to center off left-handed reliever James Pazos, and Gardner reached on an error by Seattle shortstop Jean Segura. Right-hander Tony Zych relieved Pazos and walked Gary Sanchez to load the bases for Aaron Judge. Judge, who was in a 3-for-28 slump since winning the Home Run Derby in Miami during the All-Star break, hit a run-scoring single to right field to make it 2-0. Zych got out of the jam by getting Matt Holliday to ground into an inning-ending double play. The Mariners threatened in the bottom of the eighth against Dellin Betances, as Kyle Seager was hit by a pitch with one out and Danny Valencia grounded a single to right field, putting runners at first and second. Mitch Haniger hit a comebacker to the mound, with Betances throwing to second baseman Starlin Castro to get a force on Valencia. Castro bobbled the ball, and the Mariners challenged the call by second base umpire Rob Drake, but the out was confirmed after video review. With runners at first and third, Betances struck out Jarrod Dyson to end the inning. The Yankees scored twice more in the ninth. With one out, Didi Gregorius and Todd Frazier singled off right-hander Max Povse. After Jacoby Ellsbury flied out to left, Headley hit a ground ball between first and second. Mariners second baseman Cano went into shallow right field to field the ball, but his throw to first was errant, allowing both runners to score. In the bottom of the ninth, Chapman walked leadoff hitter Mike Zunino and threw a wild pitch before striking out the next two batters. Cano spoiled the shutout bid with run-scoring double to right-center field. Chapman got Nelson Cruz to fly out to right field to end the game. NOTES: The Mariners acquired RHP David Phelps from Miami on Thursday in exchange for four prospects: CF Brayan Hernandez and RHPs Brandon Miller, Pablo Lopez and Lucas Schiraldi. Phelps was 2-4 with a 3.45 ERA in 44 relief appearances for the Marlins this season. ... First base umpire Tony Randazzo was hit in the head by a line drive from Yankees SS Didi Gregorius in the fifth inning. Mariners 1B Danny Valencia made a diving attempt for the foul ball, and the ball glanced off Randazzo's head, sending the umpire tumbling to the ground. Valencia and Yankees first base coach Tony Pena helped Randazzo to his feet, and Randazzo was checked by Mariners trainer Rick Griffin before play resumed. ... Yankees LHP CC Sabathia (8-3, 3.54 ERA) is scheduled to take on Mariners rookie RHP Andrew Moore (1-1, 5.25) in the second game of the series Friday night.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED7LFEVJ6L"},

The first full round of talks to extricate Britain from the EU ended on Thursday with few compromises and differences over how to protect the future of expatriate citizens. Britain is due to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, after a June 23 referendum last year in which many Britons backed Brexit to restrict immigration and regain powers from Brussels. Some senior members of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, including finance minister Philip Hammond, have been pushing for a transitional period designed to protect the economy and reassure businesses. As part of Hammond's plans, EU citizens would still be able to move to Britain for up to two years, The Times newspaper reported on Friday. The Guardian newspaper cited a senior cabinet source as saying free movement could last for up to four years. A spokeswoman at May's office did not offer an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday.

The Braves beat the Dodgers 6-3 on Thursday night, snapping Los Angeles' season-high, 11-game winning streak.  To win something like that, it takes a well-pitched ballgame, and we got it,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said. With some timely offense mixed in. Mike Foltynewicz threw 6 1/3 strong innings, Kurt Suzuki hit a two-run homer, and Freddie Freeman had two RBIs as Braves cooled off sizzling Los Angeles. The Dodgers lost for just the fifth time in 36 games. It was also only their second defeat in 20 games at Dodger Stadium.  It gives us a little more momentum for this weekend,  Foltynewicz said.  The guys are excited because they played good and overall it was just a good team win. The offense set the tone by getting some early runs, and then I got away with mistakes here and there.  Foltynewicz (8-5) surrendered three runs and six hits, struck out five and walked two. The right-hander, who began the season 0-4, won his career-high fifth consecutive decision in his first career outing against Los Angeles. The Braves ended a five-game losing skid to the Dodgers. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at DodgersAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch It's a weird feeling,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about losing.  We need to start another streak tomorrow.  Los Angeles starter Brandon McCarthy (6-4) didn't do much in his bid to remain in the rotation. For a fourth straight start, McCarthy didn't get a win. He gave up season-high six runs and nine hits over four innings. He had five strikeouts and a walk. The Braves struck quickly, scoring twice in the first. Freeman squirted a single past first baseman Cody Bellinger to send in Ender Inciarte for a 1-0 lead. Inciarte had opened the game with a single. Matt Adams' double chased home Freeman. Los Angeles pulled within 2-1 in the bottom of the first when Bellinger collected his team-high 63rd RBI, driving in Corey Seager. A one-out double extended Seager's hitting streak to 10 games. Atlanta went ahead 3-1 in the third, when Brandon Phillips opened with a triple past diving right fielder Yasiel Puig. Freeman singled to knock in Phillips for his second RBI of the game. The Braves put a three-spot up in the fourth to surge in front 6-1, as McCarthy continued to struggle. Suzuki hit a two-run shot, his eighth homer of the year, and Inciarte added an RBI single.  They just stayed aggressive, put that bat on the ball and made some things happen,  McCarthy said. It was the last inning for McCarthy, as he stretched his winless streak to a month after entering the game with three straight no-decisions. Roberts said McCarthy's mechanics and command weren't sharp, and the right-hander had a developing blister as well, which aided in the decision to lift him.  I wouldn't say it was a big issue, but it's just been there and I've had to deal with for a while,  McCarthy said.  It's not something that when I'm out there that I'm noticing. It's just something I want to get past.  The Dodgers tried to climb back into the game when Yasmani Grandal clubbed a two-run homer in the sixth, slicing the deficit to 6-3. Chris Taylor was aboard after a one-out double. However, Foltynewicz quickly retired Joc Pederson and Puig to quell the threat. Foltynewicz said he has been working on slowing the game down when things go haywire.  Today I was really taking my time and really battling by butt off,  he said.  I'm also glad the offense gave me some breathing room.  After Foltynewicz left following his 100th pitch, the Dodgers had limited success against three relievers. They got one runner to third over their final five outs. Jim Johnson collected his 22nd save by working the ninth, but not before allowing the tying run to come to the plate. NOTES: Atlanta 2B Brandon Phillips left the game in the sixth inning due to a strained right hamstring. He is expected to play on Friday. ... Braves 1B Freddie Freeman was in the lineup after leaving the Wednesday game against the Chicago Cubs with flu-like symptoms. ... LHP Jaime Garcia is listed as Atlanta's starter for Friday against the Dodgers, but reports are he will be traded to the Minnesota Twins. LHP Alex Wood will start for Los Angeles. ... Dodgers RHP Sergio Garcia was designated for assignment, and LHP Grant Dayton (neck) was activated from the disabled list. ... Los Angeles 2B Chase Utley got his first start since the All-Star break, and he went 1-for-3. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-braves-dodgers-recap-idUSMTZED7LFDZU5U"},

The Nikkei ended down 0.2 percent at 20,099.75 points. For the week, the benchmark index dipped 0.1 percent. A firmer yen also soured the mood as the dollar continued to lose tractiion, though analysts said small gains would not undermine support for the Nikkei around the psychologically important mark of 20,000. The Nikkei has managed to stay above 20,000 for most of the time since July 10, in which time the dollar dropped to below 112 yen from mid-114 yen. In the broader market, the Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,629.99.  On a daily basis, the market gets emotional about currency levels, but we don't have to worry too much about the dollar-yen level so often because it has been proven that the Japanese stock market downplayed it in the past few weeks,  said Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  Investors would rather focus on how listed companies such as Yaskawa make profits in emerging markets and other places -shrugging off the currency impact.  Yaskawa Electric jumped more than 15 percent to hit a record high of 2,938 yen after raising its profit forecast. It expects an operating profit of 45.5 billion yen for the fiscal year through February 2018, up from previously forecast 37.0 billion yen thanks to better than expected demand from China and Korea. Yaskawa's strong earnings lifted shares or other electronic machinery shares, which rose 0.9 percent, the best performance among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sibindexes. Machinery shares also gained 0.8 percent. Canon Inc also attracted buyers, rising 1.4 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that the company's operating profit for the year ended December 2017 likely was likely to be about 330 billion yen, compared with the company's expectations of 270 billion yen. Steelmakers, one of best performers so far this month, succumbed to profit-taking, falling 1.2 percent.

The spot rupee was trading at 153.70/75 per dollar at 0645 GMT, unchanged from Thursday's close.  There was a dollar sell-off from foreign banks and exporters. But dollar demand from importers offset the supply,  a currency dealer said asking not to be named.  We expect a gradual depreciation in the currency with the central bank buying dollars continuously.  Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme. Coomaraswamy told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. Dealers said the market is also concerned that the downward pressure on the rupee is likely to rise due to the fall in government bond yields, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for more monetary policy tightening and measures to curb strong credit growth. T-bill yields fell 4-22 basis points at a weekly auction on Wednesday. The fall in T-bill yields, which move in tandem with market interest rates, will increase the demand for cheap credit and add downward pressure on the currency, dealers said. The IMF, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan on Tuesday, said the country's performance under its programme has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million.

Britain is due to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, after a June 23 referendum last year in which many Britons backed Brexit to restrict immigration and regain powers from Brussels. Some senior members of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, including finance minister Philip Hammond, have been pushing for a transitional period designed to protect the economy and reassure businesses. As part of Hammond's plans, EU citizens would still be able to move to Britain for up to two years, The Times newspaper reported on Friday. The Guardian newspaper cited a senior cabinet source as saying free movement could last for up to four years.

Although ECB President Mario Draghi set no date for changes to the bond-buying plan, investors took his comments on Thursday as confirming their expectations that the discussions would lead to monetary tightening next year.  Although bond markets didn't take his comments as something particularly new, the currency market liked the fact that Draghi confirmed his stance towards tapering,  said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. By late Asian trade, the euro stood at $1.1630, maintaining its 1 percent gain on Thursday, its biggest since June 27, when Draghi first sparked expectations that the ECB will dial back its bond buying scheme. Signs of steady global growth, which have prompted the ECB and a couple of other major central banks to signal future tightening since last month, have kept the world's shares on firm footing. European shares are expected to be flat to slightly lower, with spread betters looking at a flat opening in Britain's FTSE and a 0.1 percent fall in Germany's DAX and France's CAC. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has gained about 5 percent in the past two weeks, eased 0.2 percent on Friday, dragged down by fall in material and financial shares. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was down slightly after rising for a 10th straight session on Thursday, its longest such streak since February 2015. It has advanced 3.1 percent in the latest rally.  Strong global growth and decent earnings outlook are supporting shares globally,  said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. U.S. quarterly earnings are expected to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 15 percent of S&P; 500 companies having posted results so far. Still, the major U.S. indexes were almost flat on Thursday, not helped by concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's inability to push his through healthcare reform bills, the passage of which will be needed to finance his tax cut plans. The dollar was also dogged by similar concerns, with its index against a basket of major six currencies hitting its lowest level since August on Thursday. It last stood at 94.22, compared to Thursday's low of 94.09. Against the yen, the U.S. currency hit a three-week low of 111.48 yen on Thursday even after the Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda dropped no hint of following other central banks in curtailing many years of stimulus. It last stood at 111.92 yen. While the euro gained sharply on Draghi's comments, global bond markets reacted more calmly, partly as he did not give a clear signal on when the ECB will announce its tapering. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.238 percent, its lowest in three weeks, on Thursday and last stood at 2.261 percent. The 10-year German Bund yield held at 0.537 percent, little changed from its levels before Draghi's news conference.  I think it is unlikely that Draghi will announce tapering in September. Before the ECB reduced its bond purchase in April, Draghi had asked his staff to look into options in September, and three months later in December he made an announcement,  said Hideki Kishida, a senior economist at Nomura Securities.  This time he hasn't even tasked his staff to prepare options,  he added. In commodities, oil prices were little changed after choppy trading the previous day, as nagging worries about abundant global crude supplies sank prices after an early rally had boosted Brent above $50 per barrel for the first time since June 7. Traders predicted prices would hold near current levels ahead of Monday's meeting between key OPEC and non-OPEC producers in St. Petersburg, Russia. Brent crude futures traded at $49.31 per barrel, unchanged on day. Editing by Kim Coghill and Sam Holmes","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL3N1KC04L"},

The fingerprint sensor maker has warned on profits three times since the end of 2016, eroding confidence in the company, which - combined with sector oversupply and weakened demand from smartphone makers - has dented shares. FPC said in Friday's report that the industry-wide inventory build-up of sensors, which had a negative impact on second quarter results, was now back to normal.  We have continued to secure important orders which will result in increasing market shares with some major customers,  CEO Christian Fredrikson said in a statement. In a separate statement FPC said its technology would be included in low- and mid-tier Snapdragon mobile platforms from Qualcomm. The company posted an operating profit of 72 million Swedish crowns ($8.75 million), lower than the 155 million seen by analysts in a Reuters poll, and sharply down from 710 million in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin, excluding provisions for an obsolescence reserve, remained at 42 percent. FPC scrapped its full-year guidance and stopped giving forecasts in March, after warning first-quarter revenues would decline by more than 50 percent due to weakened demand and inventory build-up. FPC's customers are mainly Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Oppo. It made its big breakthrough in 2015 as demand for fingerprint sensors in smartphones and tablets soared.

Hundreds of people from Hai Duong, 50 km (30 miles) east of Hanoi, have kept watch in shifts day and night since April to stop work at the Pacific Crystal Textiles mill, operated by Hong Kong-based Pacific Textiles. Among those affected by the stoppage is Japanese clothing giant UNIQLO. The blockade marks another challenge to the communist state's authority stemming from industrial pollution at a time when Vietnam is seeking more foreign investors to maintain one of Southeast Asia's highest growth rates. A toxic spill from a Taiwanese-run steel mill in central Vietnam last year sparked unprecedented protests.       The factory in Hai Duong opened in 2015 as a venture between Pacific Textiles Holdings Ltd and garment maker Crystal Group. Initial investment in the plant was reported at the time to be least $180 million. Villagers said they started to notice a bad smell last year.  It was an unbearably rotten, foul, pungent smell,  said 60-year-old war veteran Vu Dinh Vinh. It got worse at night. When he and others investigated, he said, they found the smell came from water discharged from the factory.  The company was fined 672 million dong ($30,000) for that December spill, according to a statement on the Hai Duong authority's website in February. Water was found to have breached limits for acidity and alkalinity balance, color, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand.  But villagers said they were still concerned, accusing the factory of continued pollution and setting up their blockade on April 12.  When a delegation from the local authority visited on Wednesday to give the villagers a three-day deadline to move, they said they were not going anywhere.  We want to expel the factory and never let it produce again,  said 70-year-old Bui Van Nguyet.         Pacific Textiles said there had been only one discharge of waste water, on Dec. 24, 2016, and that it had not reached the nearby river. Villagers were wrong to say pollution had continued, it said. Pacific Textiles' head of corporate social responsibility, Eugene Cheng, told Reuters steps had been taken to stop any discharge of waste water with the help of the local government.  We did not understand the reason or motive behind them to shut down the factory as some of the villagers' relatives are also working for our factory,  Cheng said. Picture shows a protesting camp set by villagers to block entrance of Hong Kong's Pacific Crystal textiles factory after villagers accused the company of polluting local water in Hai Duong province, outside Hanoi, Vietnam July 13, 2017.StaffFinancial Impact In regulatory announcements, the company has reported a  significant financial impact  because of the blockade at the factory, which had accounted for 10 percent of its sales.  This week, Pacific Textiles said it was waiting for the local People's Committee and industrial park to  clear the blockage . Local authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Slideshow (2 Images)UNIQLO owner, Japan's Fast Retailing, told Reuters it indirectly sourced fabric from the mill and had shifted production elsewhere for now. It said it had verified the steps Pacific Crystal had taken to remedy the situation after the spill.   Fast Retailing is serious about running an ethical, sustainable business, and operates all supplier relationships under a strict code of conduct,  spokesman Aldo Liguori said. Fast Retailing believed the dispute with farmers related to the initial terms of the sale of the land, he said, adding that neither it nor Pacific Crystal was involved in discussions. Villagers said the dispute with the local government over the sale of the land, which had been going on for more than a decade, was a separate issue.   This is entirely about pollution,  said Vinh. Pacific Textiles did not specify which customers it supplied from the factory but its website says it has relationships with brands including Calvin Klein and Victoria's Secret. The latter's owner, L Brands, told Reuters no production for any of its brands came from the plant. Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Gap Inc said it worked with both Crystal Group and Pacific Textiles, but did not source from or work with this plant. Attention to pollution in Vietnam has grown since last year, when a spill from a Formosa Plastics Group steel plant poisoned sea life along more than 200 km (125 miles) of coastline, prompting long-running protests. The government has told companies they must meet environmental standards in order to stay in the country. The state has also shown a readiness to tackle environmental campaigners, whose protests have tested the limits of strict laws to limit criticism and maintain public order. One of Vietnam's most prominent bloggers, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, who is known by her pen name of Mother Mushroom, was jailed for 10 years this month for anti-state propaganda.

Chinese stadium builder Lander has been in protracted talks to buy Southampton from current owner Katharina Liebherr since the start of the year, but the deal has hit some road bumps, including Lander's listed unit pulling out of the deal in April.  It is not clear at the moment. The seller is having second thoughts about selling the club,  Lander's founder Gao Jisheng told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Beijing. He declined to comment further on the deal. Southampton was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by German-born Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr in 2009 and his daughter Katharina inherited the club after his death in 2010, becoming non-executive chairman in 2014. Although not one of the traditional powerhouses of English football, the club has finished in the top eight of the Premier League for the last four seasons and has a highly-regarded youth development operation. The Premier League had given Lander's owner Gao clearance to take an 80 percent stake in Southampton's holding company, Lander Sports Development Co Ltd said in June. With support from Beijing, Chinese investors have ploughed billions of dollars into global soccer teams over the past couple of years. However, overseas investments have become riskier business this year amid a crackdown by regulators on  irrational  spending overseas, including in sport. Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd, which bought Italian soccer club Inter Milan last year, saw its shares fall this week after China's state broadcaster cited the 270 million euros ($313.98 million) deal on a show about risky investments. Beijing is on a drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year.

Hundreds of people from Hai Duong, 50 km (30 miles) east of Hanoi, have kept watch in shifts day and night since April to stop work at the Pacific Crystal Textiles mill, operated by Hong Kong-based Pacific Textiles. Among those affected by the stoppage is Japanese clothing giant UNIQLO. The blockade marks another challenge to the communist state's authority stemming from industrial pollution at a time when Vietnam is seeking more foreign investors to maintain one of Southeast Asia's highest growth rates. A toxic spill from a Taiwanese-run steel mill in central Vietnam last year sparked unprecedented protests.       The factory in Hai Duong opened in 2015 as a venture between Pacific Textiles Holdings Ltd and garment maker Crystal Group. Initial investment in the plant was reported at the time to be least $180 million. Villagers said they started to notice a bad smell last year.  It was an unbearably rotten, foul, pungent smell,  said 60-year-old war veteran Vu Dinh Vinh. It got worse at night. When he and others investigated, he said, they found the smell came from water discharged from the factory.  The company was fined 672 million dong ($30,000) for that December spill, according to a statement on the Hai Duong authority's website in February. Water was found to have breached limits for acidity and alkalinity balance, color, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand.  But villagers said they were still concerned, accusing the factory of continued pollution and setting up their blockade on April 12.  When a delegation from the local authority visited on Wednesday to give the villagers a three-day deadline to move, they said they were not going anywhere.  We want to expel the factory and never let it produce again,  said 70-year-old Bui Van Nguyet.         Pacific Textiles said there had been only one discharge of waste water, on Dec. 24, 2016, and that it had not reached the nearby river. Villagers were wrong to say pollution had continued, it said. Pacific Textiles' head of corporate social responsibility, Eugene Cheng, told Reuters steps had been taken to stop any discharge of waste water with the help of the local government.  We did not understand the reason or motive behind them to shut down the factory as some of the villagers' relatives are also working for our factory,  Cheng said. Picture shows a protesting camp set by villagers to block entrance of Hong Kong's Pacific Crystal textiles factory after villagers accused the company of polluting local water in Hai Duong province, outside Hanoi, Vietnam July 13, 2017.StaffFinancial Impact In regulatory announcements, the company has reported a  significant financial impact  because of the blockade at the factory, which had accounted for 10 percent of its sales.  This week, Pacific Textiles said it was waiting for the local People's Committee and industrial park to  clear the blockage . Local authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Slideshow (2 Images)UNIQLO owner, Japan's Fast Retailing, told Reuters it indirectly sourced fabric from the mill and had shifted production elsewhere for now. It said it had verified the steps Pacific Crystal had taken to remedy the situation after the spill.   Fast Retailing is serious about running an ethical, sustainable business, and operates all supplier relationships under a strict code of conduct,  spokesman Aldo Liguori said. Fast Retailing believed the dispute with farmers related to the initial terms of the sale of the land, he said, adding that neither it nor Pacific Crystal was involved in discussions. Villagers said the dispute with the local government over the sale of the land, which had been going on for more than a decade, was a separate issue.   This is entirely about pollution,  said Vinh. Pacific Textiles did not specify which customers it supplied from the factory but its website says it has relationships with brands including Calvin Klein and Victoria's Secret. The latter's owner, L Brands, told Reuters no production for any of its brands came from the plant. Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Gap Inc said it worked with both Crystal Group and Pacific Textiles, but did not source from or work with this plant. Attention to pollution in Vietnam has grown since last year, when a spill from a Formosa Plastics Group steel plant poisoned sea life along more than 200 km (125 miles) of coastline, prompting long-running protests. The government has told companies they must meet environmental standards in order to stay in the country. The state has also shown a readiness to tackle environmental campaigners, whose protests have tested the limits of strict laws to limit criticism and maintain public order. One of Vietnam's most prominent bloggers, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, who is known by her pen name of Mother Mushroom, was jailed for 10 years this month for anti-state propaganda.

The company said the sale of its networked home lighting systems, a small but fast-growing part of its business, got a boost from the adoption of voice-activated home technology platforms such as Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, and Google Home. The company's adjusted earnings before interest and amortization (EBITA) rose 8 percent to 174 million euros ($202 million) in the quarter from a year earlier, on sales of 1.70 billion euros, down 2 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated adjusted EBITA at 160 million euros. Philips reiterated its full-year 2017 goals of a return to sales growth this year and a 50-100 point improvement in adjusted EBITA margin, which rose to 9.2 percent in the quarter from 9.1 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Income from operations at the company's traditional lamps business fell to 98 million euros from 117 million euros, as sales fell 20 percent. The division, traditionally Philips' cash cow, no longer accounts for more than half of its income from operations. Meanwhile, LED sales rose 23 percent to 246 million euros, but income from operations rose just 14 million euros to 41 million euros, due to price erosion. The company's professional lighting arm, now its largest by sales, struggled, with sales down 2.3 percent and income from operations a loss of 1 million euros. The company said the U.S. market  continued to be soft, particularly for small-to-medium sized projects.  The company's home lighting division grew sales by 15 percent to 146 million euros, and income from operations swung to 9 million euros in profit from a loss of 33 million euros, helped in part by a 15 million euros gain on real estate.

Analysts had expected PKN to report a rise in net profit to 1.87 billion zlotys in the second quarter, due to higher sales and margins as well an insurance payment related to a 2015 refinery accident. PKN said its sales in April-June rose 19 percent to 23 billion zlotys on new regulations passed in August last year to curb the black market of fuel sales. The refiner also received 500 million zlotys in another tranche of insurance payments. However, the second-quarter result was burdened by the cost of sales rising by 24 percent year on year and a write-down related to revaluation of oil inventories. The group's adjusted operating profit, the so-called EBIT LIFO which removes the impact of crude oil price changes, came at 2.46 billion zlotys versus 2.49 billion zlotys expected by analysts.

Lukaku struck first in Houston in the 37th minute with his second goal for his new club after moving to Old Trafford from Everton last week in a deal reported in the British media to be worth nearly $100 million. The Belgian found the net with a sensational finish on the half-volley from a narrow angle which exposed the positioning of goalkeeper Ederson, who recently joined City from Benfica for around $45 million. Two minutes later, Rashford took Henrikh Mkhitaryan's pass all alone to the right of the City penalty area and placed the ball beyond Ederson to ensure the red half of Manchester prevailed in the first derby played outside England. The strike duo gave the United faithful hopes of a more explosive attack in the upcoming season by creating numerous chances against City, who were playing their first match of the pre-season in the International Champions Cup opener. Lukaku missed two more tantalizing opportunities early in the second half, misdirecting a header off a corner from Rashford and then rattling the frame of the goal with a rocket off his left foot.

Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Guy Debelle, speaking at an event in Adelaide, quashed talk of domestic interest rate hikes which had gathered momentum after the Bank of Canada increased its policy rate to 0.75 percent last week.   Just as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase,  he said.  The Australian dollar, which was perched near a two-year peak of $0.7992, sunk almost 1 percent to as low as $0.7875 as markets recalibrated their positions following Debelle's comments. The speculation of a turn in Australian monetary policy had been further fueled after the RBA's minutes of July policy meeting revealed board members had discussed the neutral rate of interest - that which neither stimulates nor retards the economy. But Debelle emphasized that the recent outbreak of hawkishness by policymakers in the western world does not automatically mean that interest rates need to rise in Australia.  Debelle has clearly taken the opportunity to hose down interest rate expectations for a rate rise and take some of the heat out of the currency,  said Kristina Clifton, an economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.   We don't yet see a case for rate rises sooner than late 2018.  Market attention now turns to second quarter inflation data followed by Governor Philip Lowe's speech next Wednesday.  The deputy governor said the resurgent Aussie was complicating the economy's transition following the end of a decade-long mining investment boom.  A rising local currency could  counteract  the benefits of low cash rates and faster global growth, he said.  While an easier monetary policy elsewhere in the world should lead to faster growth in the world economy, which is good for the Australian economy, an appreciating exchange rate works against this.  Debelle also talked at length about the neutral policy interest rate which the RBA sees at 3.5 percent compared to the record-low 1.50 percent for official cash rate.  The discussion around neutral rates at its policy meeting this month was interpreted by some in the market as a hawkish message, a conclusion that Debelle rejected.  He said the policy rate in Australia was low because the neutral rate was lower than it used to be, meaning the current policy setting was not as expansionary as a 1.50 percent cash rate would have been in 1990s or early 2000s.  No significance should be read into the fact the neutral rate was discussed at this particular meeting.

{"news_time":"2017-07-21 01:39:00","news_title":"Australia's central bank in no hurry to raise rates: deputy governor","keywords":"Australia,Guy Debelle,Kristina Clifton,Philip Lowe,US,AUSTRALIA,ECONOMY,RBA,Americas,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Currencies / Foreign Exchange Markets,Corporate Events,Interest Rates / Policy,Economic Events,Asia / Pacific,Australia,Major News,Europe,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Economic News (3rd Party),Canada","sector":"Markets","content":"ADELAIDE (Reuters) - A top Australian central banker gave a clear signal on Friday that interest rates in the country were set to remain at record lows for a while yet, wrong-footing hawks and sending the local currency sliding from a two-year peak.   Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Guy Debelle, speaking at an event in Adelaide, quashed talk of domestic interest rate hikes which had gathered momentum after the Bank of Canada increased its policy rate to 0.75 percent last week.   Just as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase,  he said.  The Australian dollar, which was perched near a two-year peak of $0.7992, sunk almost 1 percent to as low as $0.7875 as markets recalibrated their positions following Debelle's comments. The speculation of a turn in Australian monetary policy had been further fueled after the RBA's minutes of July policy meeting revealed board members had discussed the neutral rate of interest - that which neither stimulates nor retards the economy. But Debelle emphasized that the recent outbreak of hawkishness by policymakers in the western world does not automatically mean that interest rates need to rise in Australia.  Debelle has clearly taken the opportunity to hose down interest rate expectations for a rate rise and take some of the heat out of the currency,  said Kristina Clifton, an economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.   We don't yet see a case for rate rises sooner than late 2018.  Market attention now turns to second quarter inflation data followed by Governor Philip Lowe's speech next Wednesday.  The deputy governor said the resurgent Aussie was complicating the economy's transition following the end of a decade-long mining investment boom.  A rising local currency could  counteract  the benefits of low cash rates and faster global growth, he said.  While an easier monetary policy elsewhere in the world should lead to faster growth in the world economy, which is good for the Australian economy, an appreciating exchange rate works against this.  Debelle also talked at length about the neutral policy interest rate which the RBA sees at 3.5 percent compared to the record-low 1.50 percent for official cash rate.  The discussion around neutral rates at its policy meeting this month was interpreted by some in the market as a hawkish message, a conclusion that Debelle rejected.  He said the policy rate in Australia was low because the neutral rate was lower than it used to be, meaning the current policy setting was not as expansionary as a 1.50 percent cash rate would have been in 1990s or early 2000s.  No significance should be read into the fact the neutral rate was discussed at this particular meeting.

Mike Moustakas had three hits and drove in three runs, and Brandon Moss had four RBIs as the Kansas City Royals trounced the Detroit Tigers 16-4 on Thursday night to gain a split of a four-game series. The Royals inched within 1 1/2 games of idle American League Central front-runner Cleveland.  It's where you want to be,  Moss said.  Obviously, you'd want to be a game and a half up. From where we started the season (10-20 record on May 7) and how well we've been playing lately, I definitely feel this is attainable. We all feel that. To be in the mix of it, to have a chance at the end of the season to get there and be in the postseason is what you play for all year.  Eric Hosmer and Whit Merrifield homered for the Royals, Hosmer and Alcides Escobar each drove in a pair of runs. Danny Duffy (6-6) picked up the victory, going five innings plus three batters. He allowed four runs and nine hits to snap his personal two-game losing streak. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at RoyalsDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch Danny did a good job the first five innings, keeping his pitch count down,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  I'm thinking man he may go the whole way. But the heat finally got to him in the sixth inning. He really struggled to keep the ball down. He was very efficient with his pitches.  Michael Fulmer (10-7) lost for the first time since June 23 and had the briefest outing of his big league career. He allowed eight runs (five earned) and seven hits in 2 2/3 innings. A four-run Kansas City sixth, which included Merrifield's eighth home run, made it 12-4 and led to both managers substituting freely. The Royals sent 10 men to the plate in a four-run eighth, capped by Moss' two-run single. Kansas City jumped out to an 8-0 lead after three innings. In the first inning, the Royals took advantage of three Detroit errors to score four runs (one earned). Third baseman Nicholas Castellanos and shortstop Jose Iglesias committed throwing errors, while center fielder Mikie Mahtook was charged with a fielding error. The Tigers have not committed more than three errors in a game this season. Moustakas and Escobar had RBIs in the first, while the other two runs came home on errors. The errors caused Fulmer to throw 37 pitches in the inning.  It was tough but like I said, it comes all back to me,  Fulmer said.  I think that I tried to strike more guys out because I had second and third and less than two out or whatever it would be. I threw a lot of balls and just didn't really attack the zone like I usually do.  They put some swings on balls that I thought were good pitches and I got a few soft-contact hits. Obviously, a few hard-hit balls, too, but some days are just going to be like that. There's really not much you can do.  Fulmer failed to make it through the third inning when he yielded another four runs. Hosmer hit a 444-foot blast off Fulmer for his 14th home run, a solo shot. After Perez was struck by a pitch and Escobar hit a two-out single, Moss doubled to the right-center to bring both home. Alex Gordon's double brought Moss home and chased Fulmer. The Tigers got to Duffy for three runs in the fifth. Iglesias' single to right scored Andrew Romine, and Ian Kinsler drove in a pair of runs with a two-out double.  We looked good in the middle innings there,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.  We scored three then followed up with another run. We were back in the game, but the Merrifield home run and the three more tack-on runs that inning in the bottom of the sixth that was the final nail.  NOTES: Upon a review, the league changed Kansas City CF Lorenzo Cain's game-winning single in the ninth inning Sunday to an error on Rangers RF Shin-Soo Choo, who lost the ball in the sun. ... Detroit's Andrew Romine started in right field for the first time in his career. He finished the game at first base. ... Royals RHP Nathan Karns had thoracic outlet syndrome surgery, ending his season. ... Royals C Salvador Perez stole his first base since April 8, 2015, and the third of his career. ... White Sox RHP James Shields and Royals RHP Ian Kennedy are the probables Fridayat Kauffman Stadium. ... The Tigers will start RHP Anibal Sanchez on Friday in a series opener at Minnesota. RHP Ervin Santana will pitch for the Twins.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED7LFAFJ3R"},

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.8770 percent, up about 3 basis points from the previous day's closing average rate.      The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 140 billion yuan into money markets on Friday, bringing total injections for the week to 510 billion yuan. It was the biggest net injection since the week of Jan. 16, when the central bank injected 1.13 trillion yuan to avert a cash crunch before the Lunar New Year.     This week's net injection compares with a net drain of 70 billion yuan a week earlier.     Despite the injections, market participants said overall liquidity remained relatively tight as banks sought to meet tax and reserve requirement obligations. A Shanghai-based trader said that 835 billion yuan in local government bond issuance this month was also affecting market liquidity.     Tight conditions are likely to remain as regulators continue to push for deleveraging throughout the financial system.      I don't see much liquidity improvement in the next few weeks. As the leverage in the bond market is not reducing, the PBOC has no reason to make leverage takers' life easy,  said the trader.     The tightening bias is expected to continue beyond the next several weeks.      In general, I think the PBOC will implement monetary policy with a tightening bias. Even though it is injecting cash it is not sufficient to cause a decline in the market rate,  said Ding Shuang, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.     He expects the market rate to remain relatively stable, though at a higher level than earlier this year.     The seven-day Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) fell less than one basis point from the previous close to 2.8470 percent.     The one-day or overnight rate stood at 2.7001 percent and the 14-day repo stood at 4.0484 percent.     The spread of the five-year credit default swap rate on Chinese sovereign debt  fell 1.85 percent to 66.41.

Shikoku Electric said the ruling was appropriate because the court acknowledged that the company has boosted safety at the reactor. The Otsu District Court in March 2016 ordered Kansai Electric Power Co, Japan's second-biggest utility, to shut down reactors at the Takahama plant, in the country's first injunction to halt an operating nuclear plant. The decision was overturned by a high court in March and two reactors at Takahama plant have since resumed operations.

Investors started to question if the market is turning to oversupply from short supply. The previous optimistic attitude has gone, which also reflects market concern over high margins at mills,  wrote analysts at Orient Futures in a note. Stockpiles of rebar in 35 major cities in China rose 123,600 tonnes to 4 million tonnes by Friday compared with the previous week, according to data on the Mysteel Consultancy website. That's up from 3.9 million tonnes a month ago. The current margin on rebar was 1,128 yuan ($166.72) a tonne for this week, according to Mysteel. That was steady from last week but up from about 300 yuan a year ago. The most-active rebar futures contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 3.2 percent to 3,467 yuan a tonne on Friday. It was at 3,501 yuan, down 2.3 percent, at the mid-day break. Open interest in the most-active rebar futures contract fell to 3.85 million lots, equivalent to 38.5 million tonnes, on Friday, down from 4.83 million lots the week before. Spot rebar rose 0.1 percent to 3,945.06 yuan a tonne on Thursday, according to Mysteel data.  The increasing inventory in steel products along with the heatwave across the country curbing demand for steel products will fuel a bear market for steel and the ferrous metal market,  Orient Futures wrote. The most-traded iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange dropped 2.3 percent to 513.5 yuan a tonne on Friday. Open interest in the September contract has fallen to 1.3 million lots as of Friday, down from 1.8 million lots on Tuesday and the lowest since March 28. Analysts said mills have been slowing down their restocking process, which put pressure on demands for raw materials. China's June iron ore output rose to 124.7 million tonnes, its highest level since October 2015, the National Bureau of Statistic reported on Wednesday. Coking coal futures dropped for a second day on Friday, falling 1.6 percent to 1,232.5 yuan a tonne.

They now face Jamaica, who beat Canada 2-1 in the evening's other quarter-final. Group C winners and tournament joint favorites Mexico brought a second-string team but started brightly against a nation that progressed to the knock-out stage despite not scoring a goal in any of their three group games. Jesus Duenas' inviting cross was missed by the entire Honduran defense and Pizarro nipped in at the back post to side foot home from three yards out. The game took place in a 90-degree Fahrenheit heat in Arizona and neither side was able to dominate a scrappy match. Mexico had the better of the first half and Honduras improved in the second period, almost grabbing an equalizer direct from a corner kick when keeper Jesus Corona had to look smart to punch out Alex Lopez' inswinger.

We knew it would be a hard game and difficult to get behind them as they play deep,  Pizarro told TV cameras after the game.  We are getting better each game and the object now is to reach the final.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsJamaica's Shaun Francis put his side ahead after just six minutes with a powerful side-footed shot and Romario Williams doubled their leader five minutes into the second period when he curled the ball into the far corner from just outside the box. Canada's David Junior Hoilett scored an almost identical goal five minutes later but the Reggae Boyz held on to progress to Sunday's semi-final at the Rose Bowl. The match will be a repeat of the 2015 final, which Mexico won 3-1 to lift their seventh Gold Cup. Costa Rica will face hosts the USA in the first semi-final in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday.  The final will be played in Santa Clara on July 26. Writing by Andrew Downie; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-goldcup-idUSKBN1A60D0"},

Chinese stadium builder Lander has been in protracted talks to buy Southampton from current owner Katharina Liebherr since the start of the year, but the deal has hit some road bumps, including Lander's listed unit pulling out of the deal in April.  It is not clear at the moment. The seller is having second thoughts about selling the club,  Lander's founder Gao Jisheng told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Beijing. He declined to comment further on the deal. Southampton was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by German-born Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr in 2009 and his daughter Katharina inherited the club after his death in 2010, becoming non-executive chairman in 2014. Although not one of the traditional powerhouses of English football, the club has finished in the top eight of the Premier League for the last four seasons and has a highly-regarded youth development operation. The Premier League had given Lander's owner Gao clearance to take an 80 percent stake in Southampton's holding company, Lander Sports Development Co Ltd said in June. With support from Beijing, Chinese investors have ploughed billions of dollars into global soccer teams over the past couple of years. However, overseas investments have become riskier business this year amid a crackdown by regulators on  irrational  spending overseas, including in sport. Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd, which bought Italian soccer club Inter Milan last year, saw its shares fall this week after China's state broadcaster cited the 270 million euros ($313.98 million) deal on a show about risky investments. Beijing is on a drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year.

But the Australian dollar skidded against the greenback after contrastingly dovish comments from a Reserve Bank of Australia official. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was flat on the day at 94.322, not far from its overnight low of 94.090, its deepest nadir since August 2016. It was down 0.9 percent for the week. The euro caught its breath and steadied at $1.1626 after climbing as high as $1.1659 on Thursday, its loftiest level since August 2015. Draghi said that no exact date had been set for discussing any changes to the ECB's ultra-easy monetary programme but did say policymakers would revisit the topic in the autumn. His comments were perceived as  hawkish, even though the ECB didn't tip its hand as to when it will begin balance sheet normalisation and in fact left the door open to additional easing if needed,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana. The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.06 , after touching an overnight low of 111.48, its lowest since June 27. It was on track to shed 0.4 percent for the week. The euro crept 0.1 percent higher against its Japanese counterpart to 130.32 yen, within sight of last week's high of 130.76 yen, its highest since February. It was on track to gain 1 percent for the week. The dollar's losses against the yen were mitigated by market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep its massive stimulus programme in place far longer than other major central banks amid stubbornly weak inflation. On Thursday, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady as expected and postponed the timeframe to achieve its ambitious inflation target for a sixth time, though it slightly raised its economic growth forecasts. Concerns over low inflation will likely keep the Federal Reserve from raising U.S. rates at its policy meeting next week, analysts said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signalled caution in her congressional testimony last week, with disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data a week ago adding to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening even as it has vowed to do so.  When you look at dollar/yen, the Fed has explicitly said they're on a rate-hiking curve, and the BOJ has said this week that they still have a specific 2 percent inflation figure in mind, and they're going to hit it,   said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.  So I would have expected the dollar to be even higher than where it is against the yen now, and this background is definitely limiting the dollar's losses,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to garner enough support for his healthcare bills in the Senate this week also weighed on the dollar, as it raised fears about similar obstacles in passing his stimulus and tax reform agendas. The Australian dollar plunged after a top central banker said on Friday that the Reserve Bank of Australia doesn't need to follow the leader when it comes to global monetary tightening.  Just as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase,  RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech in Adelaide. The Aussie tumbled 0.9 percent to $0.7889 after falling as low as $0.7875 earlier. The New Zealand dollar added 0.4 percent to $0.7423 after rising as high as $0.7429, its highest level since September 2016, after New Zealand Finance Minister Steven Joyce told Bloomberg in an interview that he was not worried about the strength of the local dollar.

The CSI300 index fell 0.3 percent, to 3,736.13 points at the end of the morning session, retreating from an 18-month high, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,238.15 points. Both indexes were set to end the week higher, erasing losses earlier this week when investors dumped start-ups stocks.  Blue chips found favour with investors as they attach great importance to performances and valuations at listed firms due to curbed risk appetite amid tighter financial regulations and liquidity conditions,  said Xu Wei, analyst with Hongxin Securities. Xu expected the tighter financial regulations to continue as a largely stable economy allow Beijing  more leeway to tackle bubbles. Among blue chips, Shanghai-listed China Molybdenum Co Ltd , a major non-ferrous metals producer in China, has gained 14.8 percent this week. The stock is up more than 40 percent in July. China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, defying expectations for a slight loss of momentum in growth. Fitch Ratings said on Thursday China's renewed commitment to contain financial risks signals a possible shift away from high economic growth targets, though policymakers are likely to remain cautious about tightening too aggressively. China's opening up its stock market to foreign investors by the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong connect programmes, as well as by the MSCI's decision to include China stocks, also helped prompt a rotation into blue chips, Xu added. U.S. index provider MSCI's has agreed to add 222 China-listed large-cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion. China Molybdenum is among them. In sharp contrast with strong gains in blue chips, the tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext still hovered around 30-month lows after slumping 5.1 percent on Monday, as market participants shunned firms that feature dim performance and higher valuations. The index is almost 60 percent below a record high hit in June 2015. For the week, materials shares are set to be the best performers, helped by expectations China would continue to push supply-side reforms and keep its economy largely stable. An index tracking major raw material firms has leapt nearly 5 percent this week, far outperforming the broader market, after they forecast surges for mid-year earnings growth. Hong Kong stocks edged lower, as investors paused for a breath after the benchmark index hit a fresh two-year high on Thursday. The Hang Seng index dropped 0.1 percent, to 26,706.31 points. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.6 percent, to 10,777.54 points. Most sectors lost ground, while utilities sector gained 1.8 percent, aided by a strong rally in Power Assets Holdings after the company declared a dividend of HK$8.27 per share.

That could all be about to change. The firm plans to raise up to $3 billion for its first Asia private equity fund and could raise more, according to Reuters. The timing looks smart, but it won’t be a cakewalk.  Asia-focused private equity funds have scooped up a combined $32.5 billion so far this year, nearly 80 percent of the $42.5 billion raised for all of 2016, according to Preqin. It’s a turnaround from last year, when Asia, unlike North America and Europe, suffered its worst year for fundraising in three years. This was likely due to China’s slowdown and the corresponding effects on currency and equity markets earlier on in the year. Some worry that there is too much money chasing too few deals in Asia. Yet KKR hasn't struggled to put its money to work, and raised a further $9.3 billion in June. TPG is said to be looking to add more than $4 billion to that figure for its own offering, Reuters reported. U.S. markets have become very expensive for private equity firms as equity markets have rallied, making Asia look comparatively attractive. Rich equity market valuations are luring big institutional investors like Temasek to invest more in private markets, and less resourced investors such as public pension funds tend to follow along. This should also benefit private equity firms. Corporate buyouts in Asia, a market famous for growth investments, are also on the rise.  Blackstone's global private equity fund has previously invested predominantly in the U.S. and Europe; there was little pressure for it to invest in Asia. However, Reuters reported that the global fund will contribute around 40 percent to the investments that the Asia fund makes, meaning any volatility or correction in Asia – which some worry is imminent after a long liquidity-fuelled rally - could skew the global fund’s returns.  Blackstone does come a bit late to this party. KKR, Carlyle and TPG have all raised dedicated funds for Asia already. Yet Blackstone’s brand is likely to make its fundraising relatively painless. It remains to be seen whether performance will put the firm ahead of its rivals. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Liu, who died in state custody last week, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and was regarded as China's best-known dissident. But the other three have largely faded from the public eye and none have publicly commented on Liu or his death. Liu's death came as a campaign under President Xi Jinping to quash dissent is gathering strength. Xi has overseen a raft of legislation to bolster national security ahead of a Communist Party congress to be held later this year, where he is expected to further consolidate power.  The best known of the  Four Gentlemen  in 1989 was Hou Dejian, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China before the Tiananmen protests and was later exiled for almost two decades. Zhou Duo, the oldest of the group, remains under police surveillance. The fourth, Gao Xin, lives in the United States.  I am sorry, I've decided not to talk,  Hou told Reuters after learning of Liu's death. His song  Descendants of the Dragon  was a huge hit in the Chinese music world when it was first released in Taiwan in 1980 and became an anthem of the Tiananmen protests. After the protests, Hou was sent back to Taiwan, his songs banned on Chinese state radio and television and his assets seized. But he was quietly allowed back in 2006, and now lives in Beijing, working as a music adviser to a Chinese cable television network. The ban on  Descendants of the Dragon  was eased and Hou appeared on stage at a concert at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing in 2011. Hou, who turns 61 on October 1 this year, is unwell, said Australian author Linda Jaivin, who has written a book on him.   He basically retired from public life,  she said in an interview, adding that his health began to suffer soon after he was sent back to Taiwan.  I think his health also mandated him taking steps back.  Forced Holidays Zhou Duo, who also lives in Beijing, has been forced by police to go out of town on an all expenses paid  holiday  since June 29, ostensibly to prevent him from speaking to foreign media as Liu's condition deteriorated, fellow dissidents said. Forced  holidays  and house arrest have become the norm for Zhou in the run-up to politically sensitive events, they said. Reached via China's instant messaging app WeChat, Zhou, 70, declined a Reuters interview request. Zhou said in a 2009 essay that he has staged a one-day hunger strike at his Beijing home on June 4 every year to commemorate the Tiananmen victims.  He has written three books about  gradual democracy , that are available in electronic form but have not been published. The fourth hunger striker, Gao Xin, then Liu's fellow lecturer at Beijing Normal University and a Communist Party member, has been out of touch with the dissident community. Gao left China in 1991 and was once a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Fairbank Centre for Chinese Studies. He writes a column for U.S.-based Radio Free Asia. A prolific writer, Gao has published about 10 Chinese-language books on elite Chinese politics, including co-authoring  Communist China’s Princelings , a best seller about the sons and daughters of China’s incumbent, retired and late political leaders. He could not be reached for comment. An Internet search showed he has not written anything about Liu’s death. Last to Leave In June, 1989, the four men were among the last to leave Tiananmen Square.  China's Communist rulers sent troops and tanks to quell the protests in and around the square on the night of June 3/4. No official death toll has been given but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand. Zhou has said he and Hou walked up to martial-law troops the evening before the crackdown and negotiated with the soldiers to allow protesters to leave the square before they swept in. They may have saved hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives.  On the square, Liu and Gao pleaded with student protesters and a  suicide squad  of angry civilians armed with rocks, clubs, kitchen knives, petrol bombs and a submachine gun snatched from troops to leave the square. It was a  miracle  the four men pulled it off, Zhou wrote in 2009, referring to negotiations with the troops. After the crackdown, the four men regrouped in the apartment of Nick Jose, a counselor at the Australian embassy. On June 6, Liu declined an offer of asylum at the Australian embassy, Jose said in an interview, and was arrested the same evening.  A year later, Hou, Zhou and Gao were detained before a scheduled joint news conference at which they planned to appeal for amnesty for political prisoners, in particular Liu. They were released about three weeks later but Hou was soon deported back to Taiwan.  Liu spent nearly 13 years in custody before he died of liver cancer.     Chinese authorities denied his request to receive medical treatment abroad and his cremated remains were scattered at sea, a move described by a family friend as an attempt to erase any memory of him.          We are just a tiny band,  Zhou wrote last year, although it was unclear if he was referring to Chinese dissidents or to the  Four Gentlemen .  Do not think we represent the will of the people. At most, we can console ourselves and say: We represent the future - the distant future.

No official death toll has been given but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand. Zhou has said he and Hou walked up to martial-law troops the evening before the crackdown and negotiated with the soldiers to allow protesters to leave the square before they swept in. They may have saved hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives.  On the square, Liu and Gao pleaded with student protesters and a  suicide squad  of angry civilians armed with rocks, clubs, kitchen knives, petrol bombs and a submachine gun snatched from troops to leave the square. It was a  miracle  the four men pulled it off, Zhou wrote in 2009, referring to negotiations with the troops. After the crackdown, the four men regrouped in the apartment of Nick Jose, a counselor at the Australian embassy. On June 6, Liu declined an offer of asylum at the Australian embassy, Jose said in an interview, and was arrested the same evening.  A year later, Hou, Zhou and Gao were detained before a scheduled joint news conference at which they planned to appeal for amnesty for political prisoners, in particular Liu. They were released about three weeks later but Hou was soon deported back to Taiwan.  Liu spent nearly 13 years in custody before he died of liver cancer.     Chinese authorities denied his request to receive medical treatment abroad and his cremated remains were scattered at sea, a move described by a family friend as an attempt to erase any memory of him.          We are just a tiny band,  Zhou wrote last year, although it was unclear if he was referring to Chinese dissidents or to the  Four Gentlemen .  Do not think we represent the will of the people. At most, we can console ourselves and say: We represent the future - the distant future.

Asian markets edged down, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has gained about 5 percent in the past two weeks, easing 0.2 percent.      The ECB did not even discuss clawing back stimulus at its meeting on Thursday, suggesting it may delay an inevitable decision on tapering bond buys until the last possible moment.      The Bank of Japan once again pushed back the timing for achieving its ambitious inflation target, with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda arguing that maintaining its massive stimulus alone would help boost growth and inflation.      With both the ECB and BOJ sounding a tad cautious, financial markets may revert to business as usual mode today,  OCBC Bank said in a research note.     In Southeast Asia, Philippine stocks dropped to their lowest in more than one week, led by financials.     Metropolitan Bank and Trust posted its biggest intraday percentage drop since November 2016, while GT Capital Holdings fell to a near two-month low.     Indonesian stocks shed as much as 0.5 percent, dragged down by consumer discretionary and financial stocks.     Indonesia's central bank held benchmark interest rates unchanged, although it said the economy likely grew more slowly than initially expected in the second quarter.      Thursday's statement offered no strong hint that BI (Bank Indonesia) is about to tweak its policy stance anytime soon,  said DBS Bank said in a research note.  As long as rupiah stability is maintained, it is likely that BI will stand pat in August as well.       An index of the region's 45 most liquid stock fell as much as 0.7 percent.     Astra International dropped to a more than two-month low, while Bank Mandiri shed as much as 2.2 percent.    Singapore stocks however rose as much as 0.4 percent, led by real estate and telecommunication shares.     CapitaLand Ltd hit a near three-month high, while  Singapore Telecommunications posted its biggest intraday percentage gain in one week.
