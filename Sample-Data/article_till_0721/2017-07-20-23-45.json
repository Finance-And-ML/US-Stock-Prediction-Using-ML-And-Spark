[{"news_time": "2017-07-20 20:18:00", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday imposed a $2 million fine on             Exxon Mobil Corp.       for what it called a \u201creckless disregard\u201d of U.S. sanctions on Russia while Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       was the oil giant\u2019s chief executive, a finding the company immediately said it would challenge.Exxon, under Mr. Tillerson, in early 2014 deepened the company\u2019s longstanding partnership with the Kremlin despite Washington levying sanctions against Russia for annexing Crimea and supporting pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. In May of that year, the Treasury Department said the company signed eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. The Treasury said Thursday those deals violated U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who had close business ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state.The $2 million fine, the Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it would fight the Treasury\u2019s findings, saying they are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration when the sanctions were enacted. The Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit started its probe of the alleged sanctions violation several years ago. Exxon said it was first notified in 2015 by the sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, that it had violated sanctions regarding its interactions with Mr. Sechin. In a filing in a Texas court Thursday, the company said it had challenged the notification about a month later.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin signed company documents in his capacity as CEO, Exxon said. According to the company, under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and the Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal.On Thursday afternoon, the Irving, Texas, company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, seeking to toss the fine. In a court filing, Exxon said the sanctions unit \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and the Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today.\u201dThe Justice Department declined to comment about Exxon\u2019s legal challenge.The U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice against Exxon that the company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions. The Treasury unit said one of the \u201caggravating factors\u201d it considered was that Exxon is a globally sophisticated company that routinely deals with sanctions compliance concerns.\u201cNo materials issued by the White House or the Department of the Treasury asserted an exception or carve-out for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons, nor did any materials suggest that U.S. persons could continue to conduct or engage in business with such individuals,\u201d the Thursday notice said.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President       Donald Trump\u2019s       cabinet this year, he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He has stood by the current sanctions regime. In Ukraine earlier this month, Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2014imposed along with sanctions from the European Union\u2014would remain \u201cuntil Moscow reverses the actions that triggered these particular sanctions.\u201dMr. Tillerson, as Mr. Trump\u2019s top diplomat, has been leading administration efforts to improve relations with Russia.\u201cThis is a big black eye for Tillerson,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow and Russia expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank and Russia critic.Though the State Department referred most questions about this specific matter to Exxon, spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said Thursday that Mr. Tillerson is committed to the objectives of the Ukraine-related sanctions. She said the State Department wasn\u2019t involved with the decision to fine Exxon. She said Mr. Tillerson is \u201cliving up to his ethical commitments,\u201d including his recusal from Exxon-related matters.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev said signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation. \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully,\u201d he said.The penalty comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special counsel, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion.\u201cExxon Mobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, the Treasury said.Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for a partial waiver from Russia sanctions in 2015. The application was never acted upon at that time but was again circulating among government departments earlier this year. The Trump administration said in April that it wouldn\u2019t grant the waiver, two days after the application was reported by The Wall Street Journal.Exxon and other big energy companies also recently joined Mr. Trump in voicing concerns about congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Mr. Tillerson opposed ramped-up sanctions being considered in Congress, saying the White House needs flexibility on the matter.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers in recent weeks that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-exxon-2-million-over-russia-sanctions-breaches-1500570876", "news_title": "U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions Violation ", "keywords": "exxon, legal challenge,obama,oil ,putin,rosneft,russia,sanctions,tillerson, treasury department,ukraine sanctions,Exxon Mobil,XOM,U.S. Treasury Department,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 17:52:00", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating possible money laundering by       Paul Manafort,       Donald Trump\u2019s      \u00a0former campaign manager, as part of his criminal investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.The inquiry into the issue by Mr. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his team began several weeks ago, this person said.\u00a0A spokesman for Mr. Manafort,       Jason Maloni,        declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is focusing on Russian meddling as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said. Mr. Trump has said he has no such ties.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant, spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine.

MSFT 0.49%       continued its rebirth as a force in cloud-computing, posting stronger-than-expected gains in its business of selling web-based services to corporate customers.The software giant has been working to expand the business selling web-based services to corporate customers, and now has solidified its spot as the No. 2 provider of on-demand computing processing and storage behind market pioneer             Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.18%       In its fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft notched gains in its Azure cloud-computing business and Office 365, the online version of its widely used productivity software.The Redmond, Wash., company said Thursday that its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 11% to $7.4 billion. In the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes the Office franchise, revenue climbed 21% to $8.4 billion.Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue figures for its Azure and Office 365 businesses, but it said Azure revenue jumped 97% and Office 365 revenue rose 43%.\u201cAzure was the primary source of our outperformance in the quarter,\u201d Microsoft finance chief       Amy Hood       said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s higher than I was expecting.\u201dOverall, Microsoft posted $6.51 billion in fourth-quarter net income, or 83 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding the impact of revenue deferrals and other items, adjusted earnings climbed to 98 cents from 69 cents a year earlier. Per-share earnings in the most recent quarter included a 23-cent tax benefit related to Microsoft winding down its mobile-phone business.Revenue rose 13% to $23.32 billion and was $24.7 billion when adjusted to reflect Windows 10 revenue deferrals.Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report adjusted per-share earnings of 71 cents, a figure that didn\u2019t include the 23-cent tax benefit, on $24.29 billion in adjusted revenue.Shares rose 3.1% to $76.50 in after-hours trading after results beat expectations. The software giant\u2019s shares closed at a record on Thursday, after setting its previous high a day earlier.Microsoft\u2019s growth in the so-called hyperscale public cloud market was faster in the quarter than investors anticipated. The cloud unit is still smaller than Amazon in the market but appears to be pulling away from its nearest rival, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst       Brad Reback.\u201cThey are the undisputed No. 2 in the hyperscale public cloud market, and it will be extraordinarily difficult for anyone to catch them,\u201d Mr. Reback said.Two years ago, Microsoft forecast its commercial-cloud run-rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014would top $20 billion in the 2018 fiscal year that began July 1. At the end of the fourth quarter, the run-rate stood at $18.9 billion.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about hitting\u201d the target, Ms. Hood said.The strides Microsoft has made in the cloud come as its legacy Windows operating-system business shrinks. Revenue in its More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows as well as the mobile-phone and gaming businesses, slid 2% to $8.8 billion. Last week, International Data Corp. reported world-wide PC shipments fell 3.3% in the second quarter, while             Gartner Inc.       estimated the drop at 4.3%.Revenue for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line of computers also fell 2%. Three months ago, that business was hit hard, registering a 26% revenue decline, which the company attributed to older Surface computers in the market, as well as increased price competition.Since then, Microsoft has introduced a new Surface laptop for the education market and an update to its Surface Pro tablet-laptop hybrid device, though those products made their debut with just a few weeks left in the quarter.LinkedIn Corp., the professional social network Microsoft acquired last December for $27 billion, added $1.07 billion in revenue and posted a $361 million operating loss. Microsoft is working to connect its business products to LinkedIn, giving sales representatives using its Dynamics software, for example, tools to easily mine the professional social network to prospect for leads.Like its cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Microsoft is spending lavishly to build giant and expensive data centers around the world to deliver its cloud services. In the quarter, Microsoft spent $3.3 billion on capital expenses, with much of that money going toward its data center expansion. A year ago, Microsoft had $3.1 billion in capital expenses.In the current quarter, Microsoft expects revenue in its Intelligent Cloud business of between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, up from $6.38 billion a year earlier. Revenue in its Productivity and Business Processes segment should land between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion, including about $1.1 billion from LinkedIn. A year earlier, that segment posted $6.66 billion. Microsoft said the More Personal Computing segment\u2019s revenue will be between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion, compared with $9.29 billion a year ago.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Microsoft Forges Ahead In Cloud.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloud-computing-helps-power-microsoft-earnings-1500583095", "news_title": "Microsoft Profit Jumps, Fueled by Cloud Computing", "keywords": "cloud computing,microsoft earnings, on-demand computing , tech earnings, web-based software,Amazon.com,AMZN,Microsoft,MSFT,Alphabet,GOOG,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,computing,e-commerce,online service providers,productivity software,technology"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:27:00", "content": "At one point in his remarkable run through the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2000, Sen. John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

SHLD 10.60%       said Thursday it will start selling its Kenmore appliances on Amazon, loosening its grip on one of its historic product lines and becoming the latest big American brand to capitulate to the online-retail giant.News of Amazon\u2019s move into appliances, one of the categories it hasn\u2019t deeply penetrated, rippled through the industry. Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat. Lowe\u2019s Cos. tumbled;             Home Depot Inc.        HD -4.09%       and             Best Buy Co.        BBY -3.93%       fell 4% apiece.Amazon\u2019s rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.             Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.60, while Amazon, based in Seattle, closed at an all-time high of $1,028.70. Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion, Sears\u2019s hovers near $1 billion.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.\u201cAmazon is a continual improvement machine, and Kenmore is a brand with extraordinary heritage and awareness,\u201d something that could transform it into a major winner in an online category currently lacking a dominant player, said Ken Seiff, a venture capitalist at Beanstalk Ventures and a former retail executive. \u201cThere\u2019s no positive outcome\u201d for brick-and-mortar competitors.While major appliances are a fraction of Home Depot and Best Buy\u2019s sales, Amazon is now increasingly targeting their bread-and-butter business of services, says Forrester Research analyst Brendan Witcher. \u201cFor years we believed the defensible margins were those in services, because it\u2019s not easy to do online,\u201d he said. But as Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant Alexa is installed in more devices\u2014including Kenmore\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s changing.A Home Depot spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective.\u201d Best Buy declined to comment.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. The company\u2019s Prime subscription program, which according to UBS has an estimated 63 million North American members, also offers companies broad access to customers.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to expand our selection,\u201d said Matt Furlong, general manager of home improvement and appliances at Amazon.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. And for years, the only place Americans could buy a Kenmore stove or washing machine was at their local Sears or Kmart.But there are fewer of those sprawling stores these days\u2014nearly 1,000 have closed since 2009\u2014and people aren\u2019t buying as much from them.The brand is now produced by Whirlpool Corp.,             Electrolux                   AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s share of major-appliance sales in the U.S. fell to 22% in the 12 months ended March, down from 30% four years earlier, according to TraQline, a market research firm. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The Kenmore brand\u2019s share of the market fell to 10.3% from 16.7% during that same period.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to             Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on             Amazon.com        AMZN 0.18%       will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit line that Sears announced Monday.Although that line was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor. The Sears spokesman said the company is in ongoing discussions with various parties with respect to the loan facility.\u2014Andrew Scurria and Imani Morse contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Sears Links With Amazon, Jolting Appliance Industry.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-to-sell-kenmore-brand-on-amazon-1500556366", "news_title": "Sears to Sell Kenmore Brand on Amazon", "keywords": "amazon appliances,sears amazon sales,sears kenmore amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Best Buy,BBY,Home Depot,HD,Sears Holdings,SHLD,Lowe's Cos.,LOW,Whirlpool,WHR,General Electric,GE,Matt McGinley,Howard Riefs,Dev Mukherjee,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,real estate,property,machinery,retail,wholesale,household goods,hardware stores,electronics,appliance stores,decorating,diy,specialty stores,mixed retailing,etailing,e-commerce,industrial goods,online service providers,technology"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:12:00", "content": "Blackstone Group        BX -1.44%       LP recently made a roughly $3 billion bid to acquire             RLJ Lodging Trust,        RLJ -1.71%       a move that if successful would end RLJ\u2019s agreement to acquire rival hotel investor             FelCor Lodging Trust Inc.

That party was Blackstone, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. It isn\u2019t clear if Blackstone intends to make another offer.RLJ and FelCor, both real-estate investment trusts, in April agreed to merge in a deal that would create an entity worth about $4.2 billion and house about 160 hotels.RLJ, which owns\u00a0which owns about 120 hotels with brands like Marriott and Hilton, disclosed that it had received the unsolicited proposal on June 12 from a private-equity investor that offered to buy the lodging company without FelCor.After RLJ rejected the bid as \u201cnot reasonably likely\u201d to be superior to its plan to acquire FelCor, the private-equity firm twice raised its offer, eventually reaching $25.50 a share on June 23, the filing said. RLJ\u2019s board then said it would consider the offer.But after the private-equity firm conducted an additional examination of RLJ, it resubmitted its bid on July 6 at the original price of $24.

He said he was honored to serve as attorney general and the position was \u201cbeyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201dMr. Sessions was at the White House as recently as Wednesday, for a National Security Council meeting, according to White House spokesman       Sean Spicer.On Thursday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       told reporters that Mr. Trump was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself earlier this year but that he didn\u2019t regret keeping him in the role. The two haven\u2019t spoken in the last 24 hours, she said.\u201cClearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the news conference, scheduled to announce a major takedown of the largest online marketplace for illicit goods, AlphaBay, Mr. Sessions was asked only about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, fielding no questions about the case. Aides ended the gathering after they solicited, but didn\u2019t receive, any questions on the AlphaBay operation.Mr. Sessions pointed to the AlphaBay case and a health-care fraud takedown announced last week, as well as a gathering with state and local law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, as evidence the agency was continuing to enforce administration priorities in combating transnational crime and spikes in drug use and violent crime.\u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.In the interview with the Times, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201dSome prominent Republicans had called on Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), as well as many Democrats. Legal ethics experts said that because Mr. Sessions had played a key role in the Trump campaign, it could raise questions if he oversaw an investigation that examined, among other things, whether that campaign coordinated with Russia.On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had been a vocal proponent of appointing a special counsel, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time right before our eyes,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest; said Mr. Comey had provided congressional testimony \u201cloaded up with lies\u201d; and questioned Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s neutrality since he was from Baltimore, a city Mr. Trump said had \u201cvery few Republicans.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment, and Mr. Comey declined to comment through an associate. At the news conference, Mr. Rosenstein said he was working to \u201cadvance\u201d the administration\u2019s priorities.\u201cI was proud to be here yesterday, I\u2019m proud to be here today, I\u2019ll be proud to be here tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Trump aimed much of his frustration in the interview at Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator who endorsed Mr. Trump early in the campaign, when few Republicans were getting behind their eventual nominee. Mr. Trump described the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as \u201cextremely unfair\u2026to the president.\u201dHe also blamed Mr. Sessions for \u201cbad answers\u201d to Congress that set him down a path that led to his recusal. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he hadn\u2019t had \u201ccommunications with the Russians\u201d even though he had met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergey Kislyak.\u201cJeff Sessions gave some bad answers\u2026He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The recusal came one day after reports of those discrepancies emerged. Mr. Sessions said at the time that he was recusing himself from all investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign on the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials.\u2014Byron Tau, Michael C.

These cross-genre blends of beer, wine, booze and soda bring playful irreverence to summer refreshment.Experimenting with wild yeasts and natural fermentation, brewers have found common ground with winemakers. Once the staff at Texas\u2019s Jester King Brewery saw neighboring Hill Country wineries using the same natural-fermentation tricks they did\u2014barrels, open tanks, local microbes\u2014borrowing fruit from them seemed a logical next step.Jester King SPON Albari\u00f1o & Blanc du Bois is a Belgian-style lambic beer refermented with wine grapes. \u201cWe had to develop our palate,\u201d said Jester King founder       Jeffrey Stuffings,        \u201clearn to identify what flavors are good, what\u2019s bad, what just needs time.\u201d One early experiment with Blanc du Bois grapes gave off \u201cthis funky, overripe-fruit smell,\u201d Mr. Stuffings said, \u201cbut then we drank some Sauvignon Blanc made with those grapes and tasted the same flavor. That gave us confidence we weren\u2019t off course.\u201dAll these beer blends are born of exploration, made by brewers chasing exotic yeasts once limited to cider, mead and even sake. Unity Brewing Co. ferments a gluten-free beer using the bacteria and yeast normally found in kombucha. Cambridge Brewing uses sake\u2019s unique mix of yeast and koji (a mold). To produce its Bitches Brew, Dogfish Head studied the traditional honey fermentation that makes ancient African t\u2019ej wine.Before the advent of modern brewing, with its clearly delineated styles and designated yeast strains, brewers worked with a splash of this, a pinch of that and a hefty helping of respectful resignation to the mysteries of fermentation. There\u2019s an element of improvisation to these new brews, and that\u2019s what makes them fun. \u201cIn the early days, we were crushing grapes with baseball bats,\u201d said Allagash brewmaster       Jason Perkins.They\u2019ve grown up, somewhat. Dogfish Head plans to release its Bitches Brew in canned six packs this year\u2014big news for a beer once available only as a centerpiece-size shareable bottle. Will that workaday packaging detract from its distinctiveness? Allagash\u2019s Mr. Perkins believes these beers deserve attention, not affectation. \u201cWhen I\u2019m drinking wine, it\u2019s usually out of grandma\u2019s juice glasses,\u201d he said. And he drinks these beers from nothing more pompous than a short, wide-mouth glass to direct and disperse their aromas. \u201cI\u2019m practical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re brewers at heart.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beer-and-wine-in-the-same-glass-its-actually-delicious-1500569946", "news_title": "Beer and Wine in the Same Glass?
