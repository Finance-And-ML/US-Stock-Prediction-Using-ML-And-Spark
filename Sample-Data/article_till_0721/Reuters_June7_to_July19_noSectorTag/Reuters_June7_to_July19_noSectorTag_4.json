{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Irish rock group U2 kicked off the European leg of  The Joshua Tree  tour on Saturday by returning to the album that tackled their love-hate relationship with America and propelled them to superstardom when it was released 30 years ago. The band, led by 57-year-old singer Bono, is playing the entire record to 2.4 million fans on their 2017 tour, including hits  With or Without You  and  I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking For . But they started the London show with early songs  Sunday Bloody Sunday ,  New Year's Day ,  Bad , and the Martin Luther King Jr-inspired  Pride (In the Name of Love) , which Bono dedicated to the  Rainbow people of London  who took part in the annual Pride LGBT march in the city earlier on Saturday.  The Joshua Tree  was played in sequence against a backdrop of video of U.S. landscapes such as Death Valley, and Americans standing in front of the Stars and the Stripes, shot by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn who created the imagery on the original record. The group's best-selling album was released in 1987 when Ronald Reagan was U.S. President and his ideological soul mate Margaret Thatcher was in power in Britain. The tracks  Bullet the Blue Sky  and  Mothers of the Disappeared  were inspired by trips Bono made to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where he saw the impact of U.S. foreign policy, while  Red Hill Mining Town  was about the impact of the socially divisive miners' strike in Britain in the 1980s. Lead guitarist The Edge said in an interview with Rolling Stone in January that politically  things have kind of come full circle .  U2 perform during their U2: The Joshua Tree Tour, at Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain, July 8, 2017.Dylan Martinez It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago',  he told the magazine.  Bono largely let the music speak for itself on Saturday, although a character called  Trump  was called a liar by the  good guy cowboy  in a Western movie-style clip.  The Joshua Tree , which sold more than 25 million copies, marked the pinnacle of the band tackling social and political issues through rock music.  Slideshow (19 Images)Their next album,  Rattle and Hum , did not match its success critically or commercially, and the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s by incorporating electronic and alternative rock into their sound. Seven of their later songs, including  Ultraviolet  and  One , were played as an encore, before Bono invited support act Noel Gallagher back on stage to sing  Don't Look Back in Anger , a song he wrote for his band Oasis.  The track became an anthem for Manchester after 22 people were killed by a suicide bomber in the city in May, and Gallagher also dedicated it to the victims of further attacks and a devastating tower block fire in London in June. U2, Gallagher and thousands of fans united in singing the anthem, ending a show that proved the enduring relevance and appeal of 1980s and 1990s rock music.    The Joshua Tree  tour plays seven other European cities before returning to the United States in September.

{"content":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering selling state-owned Air India in parts to make it attractive to potential buyers, as it reviews options to divest the loss-making flagship carrier, several government officials familiar with the situation said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet gave the go-ahead last month for the government to try to sell the airline, after successive governments spent billions of dollars in recent years to keep the airline going. Air India - founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot - is saddled with a debt burden of $8.5 billion and a bloated cost structure. The government has injected $3.6 billion since 2012 to bail out the airline. Once the nation's largest carrier, its market share in the booming domestic market has slumped to 13 percent as private carriers such as InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo and Jet Airways (JET.NS) have grown. Previous attempts to offload the airline have been unsuccessful. If Modi can pull this off, it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems. His office has set a deadline of early next year to get the sale process underway, the officials said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. The timeline is ambitious and the process fraught, with opinion divided on the best way forward: should the government retain a stake or exit completely, and should it risk being left with the unprofitable pieces while buyers pick off the better businesses, officials said. Already, a labour union that represents 2,500 of the airline's 40,000 employees has opposed the idea of a sale even though it is ideologically aligned to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Related CoverageFactbox: Air India subsidiariesOfficials who have to make it happen are grappling with the sheer scale of the exercise. Air India has six subsidiaries – three of which are loss-making – with assets worth about $4.6 billion. It has an estimated $1.24 billion worth of real estate, including two hotels, where ownership is split among various government entities. No one has properly valued the company's various businesses and assets before, two officials with direct knowledge of the process said. Earlier this month, about $30 million worth of art, including paintings by artist M. F. Husain, went missing from its Mumbai offices, chairman Ashwani Lohani said.  The exercise is complex and there is no easy way out,  said Jitendra Bhargava, operational head of Air India in 1997-2010.  At this juncture, selling even part of Air India is far from certain.  Lohani declined to comment on the sale process. The prime minister's office and the civil aviation ministry also declined to comment. An Air India aircraft takes off from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, India, July 7, 2017.Amit DaveBack to Tata? A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the plan. Besides deciding about the size of the stake sale, the panel will set the bidding norms. It will also take a call on the carrier's debt, demerger and divestment of its three profit-making subsidiaries. Modi's office has said the government has no business being in hospitality and travel, suggesting the prime minister wants to sell as much of Air India as possible, the officials said. Analysts say the government may prefer to keep the airline in Indian hands. At least two potential Indian suitors – the Tata Sons conglomerate and IndiGo - have shown early interest. Slideshow (2 Images)In recent weeks, officials in Modi's office and from the civil aviation ministry met Ratan Tata, the patriarch of the $100 billion-a-year Tata Sons, to gauge the company’s interest in a deal, a close aide to Modi said. Tata would be an attractive buyer for the government. The company founded and operated Air India before it was nationalised in 1953.  Seems like Tata will come forward and make the best offer,  the aide said, adding the government would be keen to see that jobs are not lost. Tata, however, already has two other airline joint ventures in India, and it's not clear what parts of Air India it would be interested in. A Tata spokeswoman declined to comment. IndiGo said on Thursday it was interested in the international operations and in Air India Express, a low-cost carrier. Modi's office has told officials to work out exactly how much each of Air India's subsidiaries are worth to make it easier to break up the carrier if needed, two of the officials said. The government is expected to appoint outside consultants to help with the exercise. Anshuman Deb, aviation analyst at ICICI Securities, said splitting the airline will maximize value for the government.  Let us be realistic. It's very clear that a single buyer cannot buy an entire state-owned company,  said a senior aviation ministry official involved in the process.

{"content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is due on Sunday to inaugurate at a French shipyard work on a new fleet of submarines that will form the centerpiece of Australia’s defense strategy for decades to come. Australia selected French naval contractor DCNS in April 2016 to build its fleet of 12 submarines, ahead of other offers from Japan and Germany, sealing one of the world's most lucrative defense contracts. At a joint press briefing with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, Turnbull said he would open the project office at the DCNS Cherbourg shipyard.  This is the largest and most ambitious military project in Australia’s history,  Turnbull told reporters at Élysée Palace in Paris on Saturday. Macron said France would do everything necessary to meet the requirements of the contract, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. DCNS was left reeling after details from more than 22,000 pages of documents relating to submarines it is building for India were published in The Australian newspaper, leading to concerns about its ability to protect sensitive data. Australia's new fleet of submarines is the centerpiece of its defense strategy unveiled in February 2016, which called for an increase in military spending of nearly A$30 billion over the next 10 years to protect strategic and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The first submarines are expected to enter service in the early 2030s, with the remainder commissioned by 2050. Construction will be done primarily in the southern Australian city of Adelaide. Turnbull, whose visit to France came after a G20 summit in Hamburg, also suggested a free trade agreement could be struck between the Australia and the European Union (EU) by the end of 2019. “That is a realistic but ambitious objective,” he said. Australia and the EU agreed in November 2015 to start the process towards a comprehensive trade pact. Two-way trade between Australia and the EU was AU$95.6 billion in 2015-16, making it Australia’s second largest trading partner as well as its largest source of foreign investment. A removal of trade barriers would be a boon to Australian exporters, including its growing services sector which did business with Europe to the value of $10.4 billion in 2015–16.

{"content":"(The Sports Xchange) - Katherine Kirk continued her torrid play at the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic on Saturday in Oneida, Wis. Kirk expanded her lead to four shots with a 7-under-par 65 in the third round that left her at 20-under 196. Ashleigh Buhai of South Africa moved into solo second place at 16 under through 54 holes after matching Kirk's 65. Ayako Uehara of Japan also shot a third-round 65 and was tied for third with Jodi Ewart Shadoff of England, who posted a 66. The 35-year-old Kirk couldn't match her career-best 63 from Friday but remained on a roll. After a birdie-bogey start and another bogey at No. 5, she birdied eight of her final 13 holes and saved par on the closing hole by making a long putt.  I know I can putt well, but I think I'm like pushing the limits right now,  Kirk said.  It's fun. I mean, I made, I think, a 19-footer on 17 and a 19-footer there for par. It's unexpected, but you certainly take them when you can.  In the final round on Sunday, the Australian will have a chance to break the LPGA Tour's 72-hole record of 27 under by Annika Sorenstam at the 2001 Standard Register Ping in Phoenix and equaled by Sei young Kim in the 2016 Founders Cup in Phoenix. Kirk's last victory on the tour came in 2010.  I've been playing pretty well lately, trending at least in the right direction, so I mean, I like this golf course,  Kirk said.  It suits my eye, and I think it's going to take another low one tomorrow. You saw some really good scores out there today. It's not over until it's over, right?  Buhai recovered from a bogey start at No. 1 with eight birdies, including two stretches with three in row from Nos. 7 to 9 and Nos. 11 to 13.  I had birdie chances just about on every hole after the first hole, and I missed a few and I was still even, and then I just had to stay patient,  Buhai said.  I knew I was hitting good shots, and then I birdied 7, 8 and 9, and that kind of got me going, and then made four birdies on the back. Yeah, it was good fun.  Three of the top four players in the world rankings are sitting out this event ahead of the U.S. Women's Open next week.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's eldest son, son-in-law and former election campaign manager met with a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin soon after Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination last year, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan on June 9, 2016, was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the newspaper reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. Donald Trump Jr. confirmed the get-together in a statement, describing it as  a short introductory meeting  that focused mainly on the issue of child adoption. He said he also asked Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort to take part in the meeting. A lawyer for Kushner said Trump's son-in-law  briefly attended  the meeting. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian representatives, as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Times article appeared a day after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany.  Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was held primarily to  discuss a popular program to help Americans adopt Russian children, which the Russian government had ended. FILE PHOTO: White House senior adviser Jared Kushner at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, U.S. June 19, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/File Photo But it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,  he said in the statement.  I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.  Kushner attorney Jamie Gorelick said Trump's son-in-law  briefly attended  the meeting, adding that Kushner had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives from more than 20 countries during the campaign and post-election transition.    As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows,  Gorelick said in a statement. A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to a Reuters query.  The Times said the Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is known for campaigning against a U.S. law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law enraged Putin, who retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children, the newspaper reported.

{"content":"GOA, India (Reuters) - In 28 years in India's pharmaceuticals sector, Rajiv Desai has never been busier.  Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met.  In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,  Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai.      Often dubbed  the pharmacy of the world , India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008.  Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said.  However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures.  A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,  Lupin’s Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not  comment on compliance matters , but said generally:  India’s regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.   Form 483  India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe. Employees work at the pharmaceutical plant of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, in Verna, in the western state of Goa, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Danish Siddiqui India's standards are different,  CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office.  Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards.  The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483 – a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a  warning letter  and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health.      Slideshow (3 Images)Don't Tell Anyone Industry watchers say Lupin, which specializes in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban.  On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often  don't tell anyone , he said.  We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,   said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site.     As recently as three years ago, training was a  formality , Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.   I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,  said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices.  The quality control role is key.   They (Lupin) have had a practice where company’s quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),  said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities.  Some other companies have also started doing that now.       The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour.  These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,  a third quality control officer said.  So we are always auditing.

With traditional financing drying up in Hong Kong at a time when property prices are at a record high, home buyers like Fu are looking to non-bank lenders, many of them the financing arms of developers, to get in on the boom. Under Hong Kong law, these  shadow banks  can loan legally as long as interest rates do not exceed 60 percent per annum, according to industry officials and an official document seen by Reuters.  The system is a life-saver for those who have found it harder to secure loans, particularly mortgages, due to curbs imposed by the central bank to dampen home prices, which are up 137 percent since the start of the financial crisis in 2008.  But it also puts the broader system at risk if property prices turn around or borrowers start to default, because many of these lenders have themselves raised financing by borrowing from big banks or selling bonds. Because they are not banks -- they do not take deposits -- shadow lenders in Hong Kong are monitored by the police, and not financial regulators.     The manager of one such lender said his firm, founded by a mainland Chinese entrepreneur, lends on average HK$8 million to HK$10 million for a first mortgage and up to HK$300 million for a villa, with down payments much smaller than a regular bank.  I can lend you 90 percent for a property, for example, no problem,  he told Reuters from his office in the Central business district, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The share of shadow banks in Hong Kong's mortgage business is still small - in the low single digits - but industry officials say it is growing fast, up at least 30 to 40 percent a year over the last couple of years. That's no surprise given that mainstream lenders like HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) have capped mortgages at just 51 percent at the end of last year, according to Standard & Poor's. That was after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) gradually lowered the property financing ratio, raised interest rates, hiked the risk capital buffer for new loans and discouraged banks from making large loans to developers with big mortgage lending operations.  Regulators have got us to this situation,  said Richard Wong, a professor in the Hong Kong University's school of economics and finance.  The money lenders are not deposit-taking companies ... but that doesn't mean there is no risk because the (property) market could correct.  Monitoring Closely While non-bank financing companies play a major role in mortgage lending in many developed economies, regulators have been tightening their scrutiny of these lenders, especially after the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. Visitors look from a balcony at a new flat in Park Yoho Genova, developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, in Hong Kong, China July 3, 2017. Picture taken July 3, 2017.Bobby YipThe Hong Kong regulator, the HKMA, told Reuters it had given guidance to banks to ensure they boost their  credit risk management  when it comes lending to property developers.  The HKMA will continue to monitor the property and mortgage markets closely, and will introduce appropriate measures to safeguard the stability of the banking system as necessary,  it said in a statement.      In addition to the financing units of developers, another 1,800 entities have a license to operate in Hong Kong as money lenders, the bulk of them in mortgages, double the number five years ago, according to the official Companies Registry data.  Another 100 firms had applied for a money lender's license as of end-May this year, according to a review of data at the Hong Kong Companies Registry. Mortgage loans granted by the dozen or so financing units of Sino-Land Company Ltd (0083.HK) more than doubled in 2016 from the year before to HK$1.02 billion, according to its annual report, in a year when turnover nearly halved and profit dived by nearly 25 percent. Other top developers, including Cheung Kong Property Holdings Ltd (1113.HK), controlled by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd (0016.HK) and Henderson Land Development Co Ltd (0012.HK) also have financing units. Loans from one of Sun Hung Kai financing arms for its latest development in the New Territories started at 80 percent of the property price and went up to 120 percent for people who already had a home and wanted to upgrade, according to its price list. About 5,000 people applied to buy the 234 units put on sale on July 1 in the first phase of the development, where a 721-sq-feet unit costs as much as HK$10 million. Interest rates from shadow lenders vary widely, but typically start at around 5 percent and go up to 20 percent or higher, versus 2-3 percent at regular banks, which also lend for longer terms of 25-30 years, industry sources said. Sun Hung Kai told Reuters it was always  prudent :  While the package helps our buyers, it does not affect the company's financial position as the loan exposure is very small and well-secured.  Sino-Land, Cheung Kong and Henderson did not respond to requests for comment.  The Hong Kong police, the de-facto regulator, said it did not have any data on buyer complaints against non-bank financing companies, but added that it maintained a  close liaison  with the financial industry.  Enforcement action will be taken by the police if there is evidence implicating any money lender engaged in illegal practices,  it said in a statement. Some bankers and analysts say the growth of shadow banking in the mortgage sector could be a ticking time bomb, especially if there's a correction in the market, as is widely expected.  The potential for defaults was also a concern although the  delinquency ratio in the main banking sector, at least, remains low at just 0.03 percent in May, unchanged from April, according to the HKMA's latest available data. Brokerage Nomura expects prices to peak in the first half of this year, and said that local economic fundamentals do not support further price rises.

{"content":"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian lender Desjardins is considering no longer funding energy pipelines, a spokesman said on Saturday, citing concerns about the impact such projects may have on the environment. Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, on Friday temporarily suspended lending for such projects and may make the decision permanent, spokesman Jacques Bouchard told Reuters by telephone.  He said the lender would make a final decision in September. Dejardins, a backer of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's high-profile expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline, has been evaluating its policy for such lending for months, Bouchard said.          If it makes the decision permanent, that would likely mean Desjardins would not help finance other major Canadian pipelines projects, including TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East and Enbridge Inc's Line 3. Such a move would follow that of Dutch lender ING Groep NV, which has a long-standing policy of not funding projects directly related to oil sands, and is the latest sign that pipelines could have a harder time getting funding as banks face increasing pressure to back away. Patrick Bonin, a campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace, praised Desjardins for temporarily halting pipeline funding, but called on the lender to make it permanent and reconsider its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Trans Mountain. Desjardins is among 24 financial institutions that agreed to lend money to a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, according to regulatory filings. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, in June called on 28 major banks to pull funding for Trans Mountain, citing the risk of pipeline spills and their potential contribution to climate change. ING, which was targeted by the coalition, clarified it will not fund any of the major Canadian pipelines. The same month, Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

{"content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Corn traders have been back and forth for a month now on whether the weather forecasts are threatening to the U.S. crop, but potentially damaging hot temperatures have been absent since mid-June. The forecast for the next two weeks is largely devoid of heat but is also lacking rainfall, which is not viewed favorably by the market as many areas of the Corn Belt have had below-normal precipitation in recent weeks. But without a significant heat event in the forecast through the first three weeks of July, when corn is pollinating, national corn yield is unlikely to fall too far below the long-term trend - despite the expected dryness. Most of the U.S. Corn Belt has not dealt with unseasonable heat since the first half of June and notably cooler temperatures have prevailed ever since. Weather forecasts as of Wednesday call for the continuation of average-to-cooler conditions for the next two weeks – but without abundant rainfall. The situation in the Dakotas is different, though, as farmers there are dealing with a significant drought that has been laced with frequent bouts of extreme heat. And unfortunately, considerable relief may not be on its way anytime soon. Some weather forecasters have been calling for widespread heat to return – and possibly stick around – at some point this month. But weather models have not yet validated the forecasters since the heat has remained on the western fringe of the Corn Belt, and Chicago corn futures have struggled to move much higher as a result.       How Far Below? Assuming that for the next month or two significant heat remains largely absent from the core Corn Belt - which extends roughly from the Dakotas in the west to Ohio in the east - national yield in the vicinity of 167 or 168 bushels per acre is plausible even if it remains dry.  Final corn yield has fallen below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's initial trend yield 10 times since 1993. July and August temperatures were average or below average in only three of those years, one being 1993, which is among the country’s worst corn harvests.  Further investigation and some hindsight re-evaluation of USDA’s past trend yields would suggest that given the state of the 2017 corn crop and the weather forecasts as of early July, final yield would be unlikely to fall more than 3 or 4 percentage points below USDA’s trend of 170.7 bpa – everything else being equal. A loss of 4 percent would place 2017 yield at 164 bpa, well off last year’s record of 174.6 bpa, though the comfortable domestic carryout levels north of 2 billion bushels would certainly limit the impact of a lower yield.  But a yield in the mid-160 bpa range would surely cut down on the new-crop carryout and place just a little more pressure on the 2018 harvest to perform in order for the stocks to avoid being pared down even further.      2017 Wild Cards North and South Dakota have undoubtedly drawn the short straw this year in terms of weather, and national yield could be further affected based on how far the Northern Plains crop falls. South Dakota grows 6 percent of the U.S. corn crop and North Dakota accounts for just over 3 percent. South Dakota corn yields typically come in around 9 percent below the national figure while yields in North Dakota land closer to 20 percent below. Aside from the hot and dry forecast that continues to plague the Dakotas, the soil moisture situation is already fairly dire. North Dakota soils are among the driest since August 2008 and South Dakota has not been this dry since May 2013. A freeze event also moved through late in June, piling on the problems for the young corn. As of July 2, some 42 percent of the South Dakota corn crop was rated in good or excellent condition. In North Dakota, it was 55 percent, well below the national rating of 68 percent.    Another unknown right now is in the Eastern Corn Belt, where good-to-excellent ratings have been well below previous years from the start. Indiana in particular – which grows 7 percent of the national crop – has had particularly low ratings despite having what has seemed like decent weather. Some 47 percent of the Indiana corn is in good or excellent condition, up slightly from 46 percent in the week prior. Ratings have climbed more notably in No. 2 Illinois and Ohio, but are still below last year’s levels.  Many farmers in Illinois have wanted a good rain for a while now. Showers and storms have been moving through the state over the past several weeks, but the sporadic and localized nature of the events means that while some growers have finally received the needed relief, a lot of others have not been so lucky. The issue of variable rainfall has also prevailed in parts of the Western Belt, as June precipitation fell short of normal in many spots across top grower Iowa.  If the dry pockets within the Corn Belt add up to a sufficiently large area, lower yields potentially observed in those areas may drag another bushel or two out of national yield if the impact becomes severe enough (reut.rs/2sMIiT0).

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The zinc funds-fundamentals pendulum has swung again.  Back in May funds were beating a collective retreat from the London zinc market after a second failed attempt at the big-number $3,000-per tonne resistance level. The London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month price troughed at $2,427.50 on June 7, since when it has bounced back to a current $2,783.00.  Funds have returned with a vengeance, according to LME broker Marex Spectron, which estimates they have gone from net short at the start of June to net long. Indeed at over 20 percent of open interest speculative length is back to levels last seen in January.  What's caused this sharp shift in positioning?  The short answer is LME stocks. While the headline number continues to tick lower, now down by 146,600, or 34 percent, on the start of the year,  live  on-warrant tonnage has slumped to levels not seen since 2007.  There were 109,100 tonnes of net new cancellations over the course of June, leaving on-warrant inventory standing at a depleted 70,350 tonnes.  LME time-spreads have tightened accordingly, the benchmark cash-to-three-months period trading close to level after being in relatively comfortable $19-per tonne contango just a month ago.  Disappearing visible inventory has rekindled zinc's stop-start bull narrative of supply shortfall.  Fooled Again?  LME inventory levels have been a false friend for zinc's many bull admirers in recent times.  Stocks have for years now been highly concentrated in New Orleans, a location that has seen mass movement between on- and off-market storage driven not by physical market but by financing drivers.  The most recent manifestation was the appearance of 22,100 tonnes of zinc in LME sheds in New Orleans at the start of May.  Since then, however, total inflow into the LME storage system has amounted to just 125 tonnes and that at Port Klang in Malaysia.  There are still grounds for caution, particularly in the form of the large short position sitting on the LME's July prime prompt date (July 19).  Representing between 30 and 40 percent of open interest <0#LME-FBR>, will it be closed out, rolled or physically delivered?  We won't have to wait long to find out, but countering the potential for more smoke and mirrors is a real tightening in the zinc supply chain in the North American market Although it's dropped out of the headlines, the strike at the CEZ refinery in Canada, North America's second-largest producer of refined zinc, is rumbling on into its fifth month.  CEZ is majority owned by the Noranda Income Fund (NIF_u.TO) but is in essence a tolling plant for Swiss powerhouse Glencore and members of Canada's United Steelworkers union were making their views heard at Glencore's annual meeting on May 24.  Noranda Income Fund has been tight-lipped about the impact. Its last official comment in March, one month into the strike, was that it was maintaining production at 50-60 percent of 275,000-tonne per year capacity.  First-quarter production, only partly reflecting the impact of the Feb. 12 walk-out, slid to just over 50,000 tonnes from 73,000 tonnes in the previous quarter.  Second-quarter results are now pending but the ongoing loss of units is somewhere in the mix at New Orleans, which holds the only LME-registered zinc stocks in the United States.   Shanghai Stocks Slump There's more in the mix as well.  Everyone's watching China. As the world's largest processor of mined concentrates into refined zinc, the country is on the front-line of the tightening in the raw materials segment of the supply chain.  The collective betting is that it is only a matter of time before China's import demand heats up as domestic production fails to keep pace with demand.  That hasn't happened yet.  Refined zinc imports are running at subdued levels. Despite an acceleration in April and May, the cumulative year-to-date tally is 138,700 tonnes, down 46 percent on last year's levels and 2016 wasn't a bumper import year either.  That said, there are signs of stress in China's zinc market.  Stocks held in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses have, like the LME, been rapidly depleted since the start of the year.  Despite a small week-on-week bounce to 66,947 tonnes, the headline figure has fallen by 85,877 tonnes since January. The last time ShFE stocks were this low was all the way back in 2009, when the Shanghai zinc contract was still in its infancy. National refined metal production was down by almost 10 percent in May with several large operators taking maintenance downtime.  Zinc concentrate imports have surprised on the upside with inbound flows up 25 percent so far this year.  That partly reflects strong imports from Peru (up 40 percent) but also higher imports from second-tier suppliers such as Russia (up 218 percent), Myanmar (up 149 percent) and Iran (up 55 percent).  The overall impression is of a smelter sector that is actively thrifting and simultaneously trying to tap new sources of supply.  Hoarding physical metal in anticipation of stronger Chinese zinc import demand is the other dimension of the LME stocks picture.  Pendulum Swings The zinc pendulum has swung from poor technicals to constructive fundamentals over the space of the last month and the funds are responding by getting back in on the long side.  There is still a lot of uncertainty out there as to the real state of play in the physical market and LME stock levels are only one component of the puzzle and an historically unreliable one at that.  But at current levels the London zinc market is starting to look like an increasingly tight space, particularly for short-position holders.  But there is one in particular, that one sitting on the July date, that merits attention. Its actions will determine the next swing of the funds-fundamentals pendulum.

{"content":"CHANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Global sewage and water treatment firms are eyeing opportunities in an unsavory place: a growing pile of waste in China, the world's most populous nation. The country has been for years battling contamination from fertilizer run-offs, heavy metals and untreated sewage. A survey in 2015 showed nearly two thirds of China's underground water and a third of its surface water was unfit for human contact.  To reverse this, China has pledged to lay 126,000 kilometers of new sewage pipes by 2020, enough to circle the globe three times, and raise urban wastewater treatment by 50 million cubic meters a day, equal to 20,000 Olympic-size pools. This has opened the floodgates to sewage specialists, like Israel's Emefcy (EMC.AX), RWL Water - controlled by Ron Lauder from Estee Lauder (EL.N) and France's Veolia (VIE.PA), who want to grab a share of the market with China's annual environmental spend estimated at 3 trillion yuan ($441 billion) over the next five years.  Right now the problem of wastewater from agriculture and the countryside is very serious and wastewater treatment work is a weak link,  said Tong Weidong, vice-chairman of the legal work commission of China's parliament. Recently, there were reports of villages dumping sewage into the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's biggest power station spanning the Yangtze River in central Hubei province. But change is afoot, Tong said. Local officials will be forced to improve sewage capacity under new legislation that make them directly responsible for water quality. Cities need to hike treatment rates to 95 percent by 2020 from 92 percent in 2015, while rural regions in central and western China need to reach 50 percent.  The market is massive,  said Wong-Jin Yong, China CEO for Emefcy, which estimates the potential market opportunity in Beijing and nearby provinces at over $1 billion. Foreign players have been in China for a while, such as Veolia that has water projects across the country, but the focus on a large-scale clean-up has gained impetus recently. China's latest five-year plan released in 2016 emphasizes tackling pollution, while in an action plan published in 2015 the government vowed to improve water quality nationwide by 2030, pledging to spend billions of dollars.  Water purification equipment by Emefcy is seen at a school campus in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, China June 20, 2017. Picture taken June 20, 2017.David StanwayLocal authorities, meanwhile, have struggled to fund their plans, opening the door for more private sector involvement. Firms Rush in Emefcy plans to put eight small-scale sewage treatment units into operation in China by the end of this year and is currently building a local factory. It has installed a mobile plant around the size of a van at a school in southern Changzhou and runs another at a sewage works in Wuxi. Emefcy says its small-scale units can treat 20,000 liters a day, take two months to install and have significantly lower energy costs, making them ideal for the rural market.  Water purification equipment by Emefcy is seen at a school campus in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, China June 20, 2017. Picture taken June 20, 2017.David StanwayRWL Water venture is set to merge with Emefcy in July to  accelerate penetration  in China's rural wastewater sector. They will be competing with local players such as state-run Beijing Enterprises Water Group and China Water Investment, and others like Beijing Sound Environment (0967.HK) and Kangda International (6136.HK). Stricter environmental standards are drawing in companies of all sizes, but big state-owned firms still dominate major projects, said Xue Xiaohu, general manager at Jiangsu Greenway that sells water treatment technology to the textiles industry. China has promised to give environmentally friendly projects a leg up by providing banks more incentives to lend and encouraging green financing. Offshore players have the added hurdle of navigating local rules and typically also need to team up with local partners.  There are challenges in dealing with local governments and that's why our partners kick in,  said Yong from Emefcy, which has a number of Chinese partners including Zhejiang Provincial Energy Group and Jiangsu Jinzi.

{"content":"GOA, India (Reuters) - In 28 years in India's pharmaceuticals sector, Rajiv Desai has never been busier.  Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met.  In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,  Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai.      Often dubbed  the pharmacy of the world , India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008.  Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said.  However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures.  A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,  Lupin’s Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not  comment on compliance matters , but said generally:  India’s regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.   Form 483  India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe. Employees work at the pharmaceutical plant of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, in Verna, in the western state of Goa, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Danish Siddiqui India's standards are different,  CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office.  Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards.  The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483 – a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a  warning letter  and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health.      Slideshow (3 Images)Don't Tell Anyone Industry watchers say Lupin, which specializes in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban.  On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often  don't tell anyone , he said.  We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,   said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site.     As recently as three years ago, training was a  formality , Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.   I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,  said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices.  The quality control role is key.   They (Lupin) have had a practice where company’s quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),  said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities.  Some other companies have also started doing that now.       The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour.  These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,  a third quality control officer said.  So we are always auditing.

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the options market are betting that shares of U.S. steel makers will get a boost when the U.S. Commerce Department unveils findings from its investigation into cheap steel imports, according to data and analysts on Friday. The investigation was ordered by President Donald Trump in April under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and could clear the way for restrictions on steel imports. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is expected to announce the outcome of the steel inquiry after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the July 7-8 summit in Germany. A decision that results in a material reduction in the current level of domestic steel imports could provide a near-term boost to shares of U.S. steel companies, according to Wall Street analysts. Recent trading data in options on top steel companies, including United States Steel Corp, Nucor Corp and AK Steel Holding Corp show traders are counting on some good news.  Everything looks pretty bullish. Every factor you would look at is sort of aligned in the same direction,  said Jim Strugger, MKM Partners derivatives strategist.  Traders have shown a marked preference for loading up on call options. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options convey the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. For U.S. Steel Corp, there are 1.1 calls open for each open put contract, close to the most in more than five years, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. Other steel stocks also exhibit similarly elevated positioning in call contracts.  They are not trying to pick a winner within the industry. It seems like it is more of a sector bet,  said Steve Claussen, vice president of trade strategy at E-Trade Financial in Chicago. Much of the bullish positioning is concentrated in contracts set to expire over the next two weeks.  The implied expectation is that you are expecting a short-term move very quickly. These are definitely event-driven trades in my opinion,  Claussen said. Several of these steel companies are set to report quarterly results before the end of July. Trump's election initially boosted steel stocks, with the S&P; 1500 steel index surging 36 percent in the month after the Nov. 8 vote. The index has given up most of those gains and is up 10 percent since the election.

{"content":"NEW DELHI/CARACAS (Reuters) - Cash-hungry Venezuela has offered Indian oil company ONGC Videsh an increased stake in an oil field, according to two sources close to the proposal, as the country seeks to shore up its bruised energy industry and strengthen ties with New Delhi. State oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has proposed selling a 9 percent stake in the San Cristobal field to ONGC Videsh (OVL), a subsidiary of India's state-owned top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), the sources said this week. ONGC Videsh already holds a 40 percent stake in the field, which produces around 22,000-23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil. While the amount of the sale would be relatively modest, according to analysts, any extra income would be welcome for PDVSA. Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, has been hit hard by the falling price of oil, its economic lifeline. The OPEC nation's oil output has slipped and PDVSA PDVSA.UL is struggling to maintain investment in its oilfields, which hold the world's largest crude reserves.  The state company already offered Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) a stake in a joint venture in an extra-heavy crude project in the Orinoco Belt, sources told Reuters in March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak about the negotiations, said PDVSA was still negotiating with ONGC and no deal was certain.  Under Venezuela's hydrocarbon law, the state must maintain more than 50 percent of all oil ventures, hence PDVSA can only offer up to 9 percent to the Indian firm.   ONGC is still evaluating the options,  one of the sources said, adding the purchase could be challenging given the Indian company's revenues are suffering due to lower oil prices. ONGC Videsh managing director N. K. Verma declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Legal Quandary Another potential complication is Venezuela's murky legal framework during a power struggle between the opposition and the unpopular leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro.  A controversial decision by the Supreme Court in April gave the government the right to cut oil deals but the constitution mandates that the National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, must approve contracts of  national public interest.   Opposition lawmakers say oil deals which bypass the legislature are therefore null. They have been warning foreign companies away from what they say are firesale deals that throw a lifeline to Maduro's government.  Any change to the shareholding structure of a joint venture should be approved by (congress),  wrote Jose Guerra, president of the congressional finance committee, in a message to Reuters.  Asked if such a change would be approved by the legislature, he responded  I don't think so. The government has refused to present those issues to (Congress).  The business climate remains poor in the volatile and violent South American country, which is laboring under shortages of food and medicine. More than three months of protests have left at least 90 people dead.  Recent comments by a Socialist Party candidate about a new legislative superbody created by Maduro have also spooked some in the oil sector. Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer, suggested during a speech at PDVSA that the future constituent assembly could rewrite parts of the constitution that allow joint ventures with foreign oil companies.  Still, as Maduro's government has no easy sources of financing beyond the oil sector, foreign oil companies stand to get a good price for assets on sale.  The second source said there was no clear figure for the potential deal, although a decision was expected this year.  Although it is tricky to estimate a price without full details, a 9 percent stake in San Cristobal could be worth $50 million to $100 million, estimated Luisa Palacios, senior managing director at Medley Global Advisors. She based her estimate on Rosneft paying $500 million to raise its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture last year.  The number is likely to be on the lower end of that range due to Venezuela's political turbulence and business climate, she added.  Boost to Bilateral Relations?  The potential deal could also help once closer relations between Caracas and New Delhi that have taken a hit as Venezuela's economy unraveled. PDVSA spent at least a decade trying to build business ties and boost shipments to refineries in India.  But the Caracas-based company was forced to abandon the fight for coveted market share there because of its declining output and heavy obligations under oil-for-loan deals with China and Russia, a Reuters analysis showed in March. Changing trade routes, triggered by rising shale oil production in the United States, turned New Delhi to cheaper oil from Africa and the Middle East. Venezuela's downward spiral also hurt Indian oil companies, which are owed late dividends.  There are signs the situation may be improving, however.      After years of negotiations, PDVSA last year agreed to clear a pending dividend of $540 million on ONGC Videsh's investment in San Cristobal. In return, the first source said, ONGC Videsh was now aiming to arrange a $325 million loan for development of the block this year.

{"content":"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian lender Desjardins is considering no longer funding energy pipelines, a spokesman said on Saturday, citing concerns about the impact such projects may have on the environment. Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, on Friday temporarily suspended lending for such projects and may make the decision permanent, spokesman Jacques Bouchard told Reuters by telephone.  He said the lender would make a final decision in September. Dejardins, a backer of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's high-profile expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline, has been evaluating its policy for such lending for months, Bouchard said.          If it makes the decision permanent, that would likely mean Desjardins would not help finance other major Canadian pipelines projects, including TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East and Enbridge Inc's Line 3. Such a move would follow that of Dutch lender ING Groep NV, which has a long-standing policy of not funding projects directly related to oil sands, and is the latest sign that pipelines could have a harder time getting funding as banks face increasing pressure to back away. Patrick Bonin, a campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace, praised Desjardins for temporarily halting pipeline funding, but called on the lender to make it permanent and reconsider its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Trans Mountain. Desjardins is among 24 financial institutions that agreed to lend money to a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, according to regulatory filings. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, in June called on 28 major banks to pull funding for Trans Mountain, citing the risk of pipeline spills and their potential contribution to climate change. ING, which was targeted by the coalition, clarified it will not fund any of the major Canadian pipelines. The same month, Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - If Angelique Kerber hopes to become the first German to win the Wimbledon title since Steffi Graf in 1996, she will have to draw up an emergency game plan as she cannot afford to keep flirting with danger as she did against American outsider Shelby Rogers.

That Kerber eventually landed safely in the fourth round was more down to Rogers's lack of grasscourt experience than the German suddenly finding her range. Rogers belted down 48 winners compared with just 25 from Kerber but she was eventually undone by her unforced errors -- the final tally totaling 47.  She was hitting the balls very hard.

{"content":"Markakis fuels Braves in rout of Nationals WASHINGTON -- Nick Markakis had a double and scored in the second inning before lining a solo homer to right in the seventh. But the at-bat that impressed his manager, Brian Snitker, was the grind-it-out appearance that became a run-scoring single in the ninth as the Atlanta Braves crushed the first-place Washington Nationals 13-0 on Saturday. It was the first time this year the Nationals were shut out.  He's a pro. He's a pro's pro,  Snitker said of Markakis, who had three hits, scored four runs and made a diving catch in right field.  He does everything the right way, regardless of the situation. That was a really good at-bat.  Markakis also drove in two runs and owns a .287 average as the Braves beat All-Star pitcher Stephen Strasburg, who lasted just three innings.  We know what type of pitcher (he is) and know what he has,  Markakis said of Strasburg.  It is a battle up there every time. We have to play well together as a team to beat a team like that. We did today; probably the best defense we have played all year.  Markakis was also at the plate in the top of the third when he lined the ball off the hip of Strasburg, the All-Star right-hander for the Nationals. Strasburg (9-3) stayed in the game but was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the last of the third inning after yielding seven hits, six runs (three earned) with two walks and no strikeouts. It was his shortest outing of the year and first time he did not record a punchout. Washington manager Dusty Baker said Strasburg was taken out mostly since he was hit by the liner. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch Mainly because he was hurting,  Baker said. Strasburg insisted he could have remained in the contest.  I feel fine. I definitely could've kept going, but I just got singled to death,  said Strasburg, who said the hip won't affect his All-Star status.  I know some guys want to lobby for it, but I feel like that's their decision. And I'm going to keep going until they take the ball out of my hands. And that's when they decided to take it out of my hands.  Starter Julio Teheran was 2-for-2 with three RBIs and pitched seven shutout innings while the Braves banged out 15 hits. Teheran (7-6) is now 6-0 on the road this year and 1-6 at home after he gave up just four hits with two walks and five strikeouts.  Everything was working today,  he said.  Guys were making good plays behind me.  He had plenty of offensive support. Kurt Suzuki (two hits) had an RBI single in the second before Teheran followed with one of his own to give the Braves a 2-0 lead off Strasburg. Nationals nemesis Freddie Freeman had an RBI double in the third to make it 3-0. Two batters after Strasburg was hit by a comebacker, Suzuki had an RBI single and later in the inning Teheran slashed a two-run single to make it 6-0. Strasburg allowed four runs (one earned) in the third and was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the inning. Atlanta All-Star Ender Inciarte delivered an RBI single in the sixth off Tanner Roark for a 7-0 advantage. Markakis lined that homer into the Nationals bullpen in right off Roark to make it 8-0 in the seventh. Inciarte drove in a run with a groundout in the eighth. Markakis had that impressive RBI single in the ninth and Matt Adams crushed a 0-2 pitch from Sammy Solis for a three-run homer to make it 13-0. Johan Camargo was 3-for-4 and Matt Kemp also had two hits for the Braves, who are 4-2 in Washington this year. The Braves also got strong defensive play from second baseman Brandon Phillips.  You know how he is. He showed it today,  Markakis said.  Couple of big plays right there. We made some good defensive plays. Julio threw one of his best games this year.  Roark made his first relief outing of the year after 17 starts. He took over in the fourth and gave up three runs in five innings. The second-place Braves improved to 42-44 while the Nationals fell to 51-36.  Everyone is good to go tomorrow,  said Snitker, whose team has won two of three in the series.  It is good to see the guys bounce back after extra innings  on Friday. NOTES: Washington manager Dusty Baker was drafted by the Braves in 1967 and played eight seasons in Atlanta. ...

{"content":"Rays blank Red Sox as Cobb outduels Porcello ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Alex Cobb had spectacular defense behind him -- on one play, his own glove, literally, behind him -- and held the Boston Red Sox to two hits as the Tampa Bay Rays held on for a 1-0 win on Saturday afternoon at Tropicana Field.  What the defense was able to do behind me -- Hechy (shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria) was making two of the top 10 plays of the night for (ESPN's) SportsCenter,  Cobb said. Cobb (7-6) pitched a gem, giving up only two singles while striking out three to outduel defending Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello. Tampa Bay (46-43) is assured of a winning record at the All-Star break while Boston (50-38) lost to its division rival for the second time in three days, with the series finale coming Sunday. Rays closer Alex Colome came in for the final four outs for his 24th save, matching Minnesota's Brandon Kintzler for the American League lead. Colome gave up a walk and a double in the ninth -- the first time the Red Sox had runners in scoring position -- but got out of the jam, first by striking out Hanley Ramirez. After an intentional walk to load the bases, Colome got Chris Young to pop out to shallow left-center field to end the game with the tying run at third. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RaysBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchCobb held the Red Sox to two hits in 7 2/3 innings -- Xander Bogaerts had an infield single in the first inning, and Mookie Betts had a single up the middle in the third. From there, Cobb retired 11 batters in a row until Mitch Moreland reached on an error in the seventh. He fielded a comebacker behind his back, getting a key out to help his own cause.  I think his determination has been the most impressive,  manager Kevin Cash said of Cobb's recovery from 2015 Tommy John surgery.  You find out a lot about a guy when they're coming through an injury and how they handle that. He was determined he was going to get it right.  After giving up runs in five straight appearances entering this series, Colome earned saves in both wins by Tampa Bay. Cobb had his second dominant outing in three starts -- he had eight shutout innings on June 27 in what ended up a 10-inning win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, but he had allowed six earned runs in his last start before bouncing back nicely. Porcello (4-11) nearly matched Cobb, holding Tampa Bay to one run in eight innings. The Rays scrapped together their only run in the second -- Steven Souza and Brad Miller singled to start off the inning and Shane Peterson was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Jesus Sucre's sacrifice fly made it 1-0, but Porcello got Mallex Smith to strike out to end the inning.  Hats off to Alex Cobb. He threw an incredible ballgame,  Porcello said.  When their guy is throwing that well, runs are at a premium. It was a tough one, but we'll get back at it tomorrow.  The Red Sox dropped to 2-22 this season when scoring less than three runs -- they've been shut out seven times in 2017. The Rays got just their second shutout of the season, following a May 25 game against the Los Angeles Angels.  It was a great game from both sides,  Boston's Mookie Betts said.  You can't ask for a better pitcher's duel than that.  The two teams split the first two games of the series with lopsided wins. NOTES: Red Sox SS Xander Bogaerts was back in the lineup after missing Friday's game. He had left Thursday's game in the first inning after being hit in the right hand with a pitch. He had an infield single in the first inning. ... The game drew 23,419 fans -- the third straight strong crowd at Tropicana Field -- with fans getting an Evan Longoria  Game of Thrones  bobblehead. ...

{"content":"KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (Reuters) - Some 180 wildfires raged over a massive section of Western Canada's British Columbia on Saturday, prompting the evacuation of 3,000 households and the province's first state of emergency in 14 years.  The blazes were scattered across hundreds of kilometers of the interior portion of the province, burning through bone-dry forests used for logging and rolling grasslands that are home to ranches. High temperatures and winds complicated firefighting efforts.   The weather situation is not favorable,  said John Rustad, provincial minister in charge of firefighting operations.  There is very aggressive fire behavior that makes it very difficult to directly attack.  The spate of wildfires began on Friday, when 138 new fires were reported, most of them sparked by lightning in dry electrical storms. No injuries or deaths were reported. Provincial officials said they did not know how much damage had been caused, though evacuees said they had left behind farm animals and witnessed destruction of homes and other buildings. Some evacuees made their way to a make-shift emergency center at a sporting facility in Kamloops, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northeast of Vancouver.

We are bringing a tremendous amount of resources to bear,  he said, noting that their main priority was  to keep people safe.

{"content":"NASHVILLE (Reuters) - United States' English-born striker Dom Dwyer got his second goal in two internationals before Panama's Miguel Camargo levelled as the teams drew 1-1 in their Group B Gold Cup opener on Saturday.  The home side took the lead after 50 minutes when Dwyer, who was only granted U.S. citizenship in March, got his second goal on his second appearance. Kelyn Rowe whipped in a cross from the left and Dwyer did well to create space and fire home from close range. The goal spurred Panama into action and, after coming close on two occasions, they got the equalizer they deserved 10 minutes later through Camargo.  U.S. goalkeeper Brad Guzan made a good stop but could not hold the ball and Camargo seized on the rebound to fire home through a sea of legs from less than 10 meters.

{"content":"Surging Padres get to Nola, edge reeling Phillies PHILADELPHIA -- When an offense is struggling to score like that of the Philadelphia Phillies, it only takes one inning and a few bad pitches to ruin a starting pitcher's day. The San Diego Padres were stymied by starter Aaron Nola for much of Saturday, but the two runs they scored in the seventh inning made the difference in a 2-1 win over the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park.  No offense again,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  It was a tough loss.  The Phillies (28-58), who set a club record with 23 one-run losses before the All-Star break, have lost five in a row while the Padres (38-49) have won five of six. San Diego will try for a sweep Sunday before Major League Baseball pauses for the All-Star break. Nola (6-6) was staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to a fifth-inning solo homer by Maikel Franco. The right-hander was cruising through six innings, having thrown just 74 pitches through the shutout frames with six strikeouts and one hit allowed. At one point, he retired 12 straight between the second and sixth innings. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at PhilliesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchHunter Renfroe doubled down the right-field line to start the seventh. Two batters later, Carlos Asuaje laced a two-out double off the wall in right-center field to tie the game at 1-1. Austin Hedges, who homered twice in San Diego's 4-3 win in Philadelphia Friday, singled home Asuaje for the eventual winning run. While Nola had his afternoon spoiled by a few mistakes, the late-inning magic for San Diego gave starter Jhoulys Chacin (8-7) a deserved victory. The righty allowed one run on just three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.  He was really good,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  He located when he needed to locate, made one mistake all day to Maikel Franco. ... Outside of that, he kept us in the game and he was getting matched pitch-for-pitch with Nola over there.  The Phillies, after Nola surrendered the lead in the top of the inning, put runners on second and third with one out on a Tommy Joseph double in the bottom of the seventh. But reliever Kirby Yates got Franco to pop out to shortstop and induced an inning-ending lineout to left field off the bat of Andrew Knapp to escape trouble. Lefty Ryan Buchter shut down the Phillies in the eighth, paving the way for Brandon Maurer to earn his 19th save. Chacin didn't allow a hit for the first three innings and faced the minimum through 4 1/3 before Franco stepped into the box in the fifth and launched his 13th homer on a no-doubt blast to left field. Chacin then retired the next six batters he faced before a walk to Nick Williams and Joseph's double ended his outing.  I didn't feel my stuff was that (good) today but I made some good pitches,  Chacin said.  Keeping the ball down was the biggest thing. Nola was pitching a really good game so I knew it was going to be a close game. I was trying to keep my team in there and give them a chance to score some runs for me.  Nola had his fourth straight positive outing. Just three weeks ago he had a 4.76 ERA. His ERA dropped to 3.59 after allowing two runs, four hits and nine strikeouts in eight innings. Going into the All-Star break, it's as good a finish to the first half as he could have hoped.  Nola was as sharp as I've seen anybody all year,  the opposing manager Green said. Said Mackanin:  Nola was great. What a performance. He's been good for a while now.  Saturday, though, it wasn't enough. NOTES: San Diego C Austin Hedges tallied his 40th RBI Saturday, second-most among catchers in the National League. ... Phillies GM Matt Klentak, in a pregame media session, said he expects 2B Cesar Hernandez, IF/OF Howie Kendrick and RHP Vince Velasquez all to be activated at some point during the club's road trip following the All-Star break. ...

{"content":"Schoop, Miley carry Orioles past Twins MINNEAPOLIS -- Despite an 11.69 ERA over Wade Miley's previous six starts, Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter stood by his left-hander and gave him one more start before the All-Star break. Miley overcame his recent issues -- mainly control of his pitches -- to provide a boost for Baltimore on Saturday. Jonathan Schoop hit a towering two-run homer, Manny Machado reached base three times and Miley bounced back with a strong effort on the mound in the Orioles' 5-1 win against the Minnesota Twins.  It's a good way to end it,  Showalter said of Miley.  That's why these guys are what they are, they don't run away from their struggles. They want to get back and make the contributions that they're asked to make. That's very typical of Wade.  Mark Trumbo added a solo homer for Baltimore. Machado had two hits, a walk, two runs scored and an RBI a day after his four-hit, two-homer performance on Friday as the Orioles snapped a five-game losing streak and beat Minnesota for the first time in six games this season. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchMiley (4-7) earned his first win in four starts, giving up eight hits and three walks. The only blemish on his line came from a solo homer by All-Star slugger Miguel Sano. Miley had allowed 29 earned runs and passed out 16 walks in 22 1/3 innings in his previous six starts after starting the season with a 2.82 ERA after 11 starts.  Definitely a lot better, something to build on,  Miley said.  Felt like I was in a way better place out there mechanically. Staying back over the rubber longer and it allowed me to do more out front. Definitely, it's something positive.  Adalberto Mejia (4-4) allowed four runs on five hits and three walks in 6 2/3 innings for the Twins. He struck out six batters.  Mejia had a good day,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  He hung the changeup to Schoop there, but other than that I thought he pitched fairly well. He got us deep into the game. We couldn't solve their pitching enough to get enough runs to get back into the game.  Miley wasn't particularly sharp but managed his way out of big innings. Minnesota left 10 runners on base through the first six innings and was 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position. The Twins had at least two runners on base in four of Miley's innings. Sano's homer with two outs in the third opened the scoring and Robbie Grossman and Kennys Vargas followed with singles, but Miley got Eddie Rosario to ground out to end the threat. Vargas grounded out in the fifth after Miley walked Sano and Grossman. On the other side, Mejia might have deserved a better fate. He retired nine batters in a row before Machado singled in the fourth. Schoop, named an All-Star for the first time this week, followed with his 18th homer to the third deck in left field, an estimated 455 feet.  Everything worked today,  Schoop said.  We're looking for it to work tomorrow. Win tomorrow and then get a little bit of a break, and come into the second half stronger. Better than the first half so we got to push for the playoffs.  Joey Rickard and Machado hit back-to-back doubles to open the sixth against Mejia. Machado plated Rickard and came around to score when Trumbo's ground ball went off third baseman Eduardo Escobar's glove.  He says he feels a lot better,  Mejia said through an interpreter.  That's what his work is for. He's listening to coaches. He prepared himself really good. That's why he's getting stronger every day, and everything's coming together.  NOTES: Miguel Sano's 21 homers are the most by a Twins player before the All-Star break since Justin Morneau also hit 21 in 2009. ... Baltimore reinstated RHP Chris Tillman from the paternity leave list and designated SS Paul Janish for assignment. Tillman was available out of the bullpen. ... Jonathan Schoop started his first major league game at shortstop. The Orioles are trying to fill shortstop with J.J. Hardy on the disabled list with a right wrist fracture and Baltimore started Johnny Giavotella in Schoop's normal second base spot. ... Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said the Twins will go with RHPs Jose Berrios, Ervin Santana, Kyle Gibson and LHP Adalberto Mejia in order through the rotation after the All-Star break. ... Molitor said he's still hopeful 1B Joe Mauer (left side low back/lumbar strain) will be ready for the second game out of the break when he's first eligible to come off the disabled list.","keywords":"Adalberto Mejia,Buck Showalter,Chris Tillman,Eddie Rosario,Eduardo Escobar,Ervin Santana,J.J.

{"content":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's best-known jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez celebrated a surprise return to his family after being granted house arrest on Saturday with a promise to fight on following three years' imprisonment for leading anti-government protests.   Hours after his pre-dawn transfer from the Ramo Verde military jail, Lopez appeared over a wall of his Caracas house, waving the Venezuelan flag and punching the air before a crowd of supporters who cheered and cried upon seeing him. In a message released by his party, the 46-year-old hardliner urged opposition supporters to continue street protests against President Nicolas Maduro, which are in their fourth month and have led to at least 90 deaths.   If maintaining my fight for freedom means running the risk of returning to a cell in Ramo Verde, I am more than happy to take it,  he said in the message read by Freddy Guevara, the No. 2 in Lopez's Popular Will party.  Today, I am a prisoner in my house, but so are the Venezuelan people. What kept me going in the toughest days was knowing that whatever suffering I endured was nothing compared to our people.  Lopez's release, aided by foreign pressure, gave some rare cheer to Venezuela's opposition who have otherwise seen Maduro give few concessions in their demands for freedom of activists, general elections and fixes for an economic crisis.  Despite being under house arrest, he showed his face to the country,  said Maria Garcia, 36, a business consultant, outside his house.  What we need to do now is stay in the street, because we need to achieve not just the freedom of Leopoldo but also the freedom of the Venezuelan people.  Fresh opposition street rallies were planned for Sunday. Presidential Ambition A photogenic, Harvard-educated former mayor and economist, Lopez would likely be a popular opposition presidential candidate if able to run in any future vote.  Related CoverageVenezuela's Lopez waves to supporters outside home: witnessesHe is serving a sentence of nearly 14 years. While the socialist Maduro may be calculating Lopez's return home will ease pressure on him, opposition leaders presented it as a triumph for their protest strategy and a sign the government was caving.   It was not clear, however, how Lopez's presence at home could materially weaken Maduro, who is plowing ahead with a plan to create a parliamentary superbody that will be able to rewrite the constitution and even dissolve state institutions. The opposition has long called Lopez a political prisoner, and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Donald Trump, had been pressing for his full freedom. The U.S. State Department called the decision a  significant step in the right direction,  while urging full freedom for Lopez and another 400 opposition prisoners. Maduro for years opposed measures to release Lopez, describing him as a dangerous terrorist who sought to overthrow him through street violence. Government supporters also often note Lopez's role in a short-lived 2002 coup against the late former leader Hugo Chavez when he helped arrest a minister. Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been granted house arrest after more than three years in jail, salutes supporters, in Caracas, Venezuela July 8, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresOn Saturday, Maduro extended an olive branch of sorts.  I as head of state accept the (Supreme Court's) decision, and what's more, I support the decision. And you all know my absolute and profound differences with LL,  Maduro said, referring to Lopez only by his initials.  God willing this decision ... will be understood, and Mr. LL, after almost four years in Ramo Verde, will give a message of rectification and peace.  Venezuela's Supreme Court said Lopez had been given the measure due to health problems, but his family countered that he is in good shape and he looked robust as he waved enthusiastically. The release was aided in part by the involvement of former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has for years maintained talks with the Maduro government, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Venezuelan officials said. Slideshow (16 Images)At Maduro's behest, Venezuela on July 30 will elect a controversial Constituent Assembly.  The opposition says that is a power grab meant to keep the socialists in office and annul the existing opposition-controlled legislature against the will of the people.    Supporters Thrilled Several hundred supporters rallied through the day outside Lopez's home in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes, some wearing shirts emblazoned with Lopez's face.  They waved Venezuela's flag, chanted slogans and set off fireworks to celebrate.  I think this is the first day of the transition,  said Maria Antonieta Witzka, 57, a physical therapist.  The government is realizing that we are the majority.  Though a hero to many, Lopez has also faced criticism from some within the opposition for at times being headstrong and domineering. He founded the Popular Will party after splitting with the First Justice party that he had also helped found. Though Lopez had publicly called for peaceful resistance to Maduro in 2014 and was behind bars during most of the unrest that year which killed 43 people, prosecutors said his speeches sent subliminal messages and constituted a call to violence.  One of the prosecutors who led the case later fled the country and said the proceeding had been a mockery of justice. Lopez is the scion of wealthy families and a direct descendant of the sister of Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar as well as of Venezuela's first president, Cristobal Mendoza. Pro-government critics paint him as a dangerous radical in the pocket of Venezuela's wealthy elite and the U.S. government.

{"content":"Donaldson, Tulowitzki homers power Blue Jays past Astros TORONTO -- Josh Donaldson can help the Toronto Blue Jays win with his glove and with his bat. He did both Saturday, leading the Blue Jays to a 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros. Donaldson started a double play in the third inning after spearing a line drive and hit the go-ahead three-run home run in the fifth as the Blue Jays assured themselves of at least a split in the four-game series.  I've always considered myself to be good on both sides of the ball,  Donaldson said. Troy Tulowitzki added a three-run homer in the seventh for the Blue Jays (41-46) and Marcus Stroman held the Astros to one run over seven innings.  The Donaldson homer and us not being unable to break through against Stroman (determined) the outcome,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. Marwin Gonzalez hit his 16th home run of the season for the Astros (59-29) in the ninth off Joe Biagini, who has returned to the Toronto bullpen after a stint as a starter. Houston shortstop Carlos Correa was 0-for-3 with a walk to end his hitting streak at a career-best 15 games, but extended his streak of reaching base safely to 24 straight games. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchStroman (9-5) allowed six hits, three walks and one run while striking out six to earn his second win in his last five starts. He left his start Monday after five innings because of a raw spot on his finger.  They're a very good team over there,  Donaldson said.  In all phases of the game, they're pretty solid and it's important for us to play well to beat those guys. So far in two of the three we've played pretty well, and let one kind of get away from us early (a 12-2 loss Friday). We were able to bounce back, which is important, especially after a loss like (Friday).  Houston starter Mike Fiers (5-4) allowed five hits, four walks and three runs in six innings. The right-hander struck out six.  He had a short leash, I wasn't going to let him go too long, but he came up with the big double play to end his outing,  Hinch said.  He was throwing the ball better at the end of his outing.   Overall, I thought I threw well and one big at-bat from Donaldson changed the game,  Fiers said.  Other than that, I pitched well and Stroman pitched better. No matter what the average says, (Donaldson, who is batting .252) can hit no matter what, so I'm always going to be careful with him. I walked him early on but, I was in counts to get him out, but just didn't make the right pitch. I ended up walking him and he got me in the fifth.  George Springer hit an RBI double in the third inning to give the Astros a 1-0 lead. It followed a leadoff walk to Norichika Aoki. Josh Reddick singled after Springer's double to put runners at the corners. Stroman avoided further trouble when Donaldson made a leaping catch at third base of a line drive by Correa and threw to first to double up Reddick.  It was huge,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  They had a run and that could open it up. But I've seen him do that many a time. ... After that I thought Stroman really settled in.  The Blue Jays took the lead in the fifth on Donaldson's ninth homer of the season. It scored Jose Bautista, who was hit by a 3-and-2 pitch from Fiers, and Russell Martin, who followed with a single for Toronto's second hit of the game. Fiers' first pitch to Donaldson was high and inside and sent the Blue Jays third baseman reeling. Donaldson answered by belting a 2-and-2 changeup over the left-field fence.  That was a situation where I don't think the guy was trying to do it intentionally,  Donaldson said.  By the same token, it was up around the head area and I didn't appreciate it. At the end of the day I was glad to help our team win.  Donaldson missed more than five weeks because of a calf injury and did not return until late May.

{"content":"Yankees walk-off on Frazier's homer NEW YORK -- For Clint Frazier, the magnitude of what his swing achieved did not sink in until he began rounding third base and saw his teammates waiting to greet him at the plate and shower him with water. Once Frazier touched the plate, the celebration was on for the Yankees. Frazier hit a three-run homer with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Yankees rallied for a dramatic 5-3 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.  You don't really know what's going on until you cross third base and you see all them standing there with the Gatorade, with their hats off, (and) screaming,  Frazier said.  It's a real cool moment.  A week after hitting a home run in his major league debut at Houston, Frazier went 3-for-4 with four RBIs as his average went from .188 to .300. Frazier gave the Yankees their seventh win in 24 games since June 24 by staying back on a 1-0 fastball from Corey Knebel (0-2), and there was little doubt he cleared the left field fence.  That's a big win,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  Clint's at-bats all day were good and to hit a three-run walk-off homer, we needed that.  Frazier said it was his first walk-off home run since becoming a professional as a first-round pick of the Cleveland Indians in 2013, and it occurred with his mother and girlfriend in the stands. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at YankeesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchAt 22 years, 305 days, he became the youngest Yankee to hit a game-ending homer since Melky Cabrera (21 years, 341 days) did it in the 11th inning on July 18, 2006, against Seattle's Julio Mateo.  We went wild, I went wild,  Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said.  I almost tripped over the rail right there. It's awesome to see him succeed.  Before Didi Gregorius and Jacoby Ellsbury drew walks off Knebel, the Yankees succeeded little offensively against soft-tossing left-hander Brent Suter. Only Frazier experienced success against a pitcher who didn't throw one pitch over 90 mph. Frazier broke up Suter's no-hit bid with a single to right in the fifth and added an RBI triple in the seventh after Suter allowed a run on a throwing error during a pickoff attempt. While Frazier succeeded all day at the plate, Yankee pitching did enough to set up the comeback. Luis Severino allowed a three-run homer to Domingo Santana in the first but little else in seven solid innings. Aroldis Chapman (0-2) struck out the side in the ninth after Dellin Betances fanned two in the eighth. When Knebel walked off the mound after blowing his fourth save, Milwaukee's five-game winning steak had ended and the Brewers lost a chance to go 10 games over .500. The Brewers lost for the second time in 10 games and were handed their fifth walk off loss.  All of it,  Knebel said when asked how much of his outing was based on poor location. Before Knebel faltered, Suter allowed two earned runs and five hits in a career-high 6 1/3 innings while working so quickly that the Yankees rarely had chances to step out of the batter's box between pitches.  He pitched wonderfully,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  It was fun to see, and it was really important moving forward that we found a guy who can fill in that spot and did a really nice job.  The Brewers started quickly when Eric Thames doubled with one out in the first and Travis Shaw was awarded first base when a pitch grazed his jersey. After the Yankees challenged, the call was upheld following an 80-second review. Two pitches later, Santana lifted a 1-and-0 fastball into the right field seats for his 15th home run. The Yankees ran themselves out of the second inning. Gregorius, who reached on a fielding error by shortstop Orlando Arcia, was tagged out between second and third. Headley, who hit the soft grounder to Suter, was tagged out by Thames after rounding first. NOTES: The Yankees played the game with nine relievers after recalling RHPs Ben Heller and Jonathan Holder from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. New York optioned RHP Luis Cessa and LHP Jordan Montgomery, who started Friday, to Triple-A. ... 1B Jesus Aguilar got the start as the designated hitter for Milwaukee after setting the team's rookie record with seven RBIs on Friday. ... Yankees' DH Matt Holliday (viral infection) is slated to begin a rehab assignment Saturday night. ... Milwaukee LF Ryan Braun exited the game because of left calf tightness. He also saw his nine-game hitting stopped, although he was robbed of hits by 3B Chase Headley and 1B Ji-Man Choi in his final two at-bats.","keywords":"Aaron Judge,Ben Heller,Brent Suter,Chase Headley,Clint Frazier,Corey Knebel,Craig Counsell,Didi Gregorius,Domingo Santana,Eric Thames,Jacoby Ellsbury,Jesus Aguilar,Ji,Man Choi,Joe Girardi,Jonathan Holder,Jordan Montgomery,Julio Mateo,Luis Cessa,Luis Severino,Matt Holliday,Melky Cabrera,Orlando Arcia,Ryan Braun,Travis Shaw,BBO,BREWERS,YANKEES,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-08 17:52:00","news_title":"Yankees walk-off on Frazier's homer","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED78SFXN6O"}

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - It was never likely that tennis's grand old master Roger Federer would be taken by surprise when serve-volleyer Mischa Zverev came at him with a blast from Wimbledon's past. Zverev was billed as an intriguing conundrum for Federer and a potential third-round banana skin with his old-school style harking back to a bygone era of the grasscourt game.  Yet, unfortunately for the German, the seven times champion has a flair for such puzzles and, after a testing opening set, swept home 7-6(3) 6-4 6-4 in Saturday's Centre Court clash. That saw Federer safely into the second week at the All England Club for the 15th time and gave him a few days to recover from a head cold that has been bothering him before he takes on Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16 on Monday.  I had more problems with my cold than my opponents,  he said after a third successive match without dropping a set.   Perhaps the only positive for Zverev was that it was not as bad as the first time he played Federer on grass four years ago when he lost without winning a game.  The result on Saturday, however, never really looked in doubt for Federer, who is seeking a record eighth Wimbledon men's singles title. Zverev's relentless charging of the net posed few issues for third seed Federer, who stayed on course for a record eighth Wimbledon title by using the German as a target and relentlessly picking him off. Federer hit 61 winners to Zverev's 20, while the German won only 55 percent of points at the net, usually a prime position of strength. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017   Switzerland’s Roger Federer celebrates winning the third round match against Germany’s Mischa ZverevAndrew CouldridgeOldest Player   With Federer seeking to become the oldest player to win Wimbledon in the professional era, this was the sort of stress-free workout he would have enjoyed.   He did, however, have a minor wobble in the first set that sent it to a tiebreak.  Slideshow (8 Images)Having broken for a 3-1 lead, Federer failed to pick a volley off his shoelaces to hand Zverev a break point that the German took when the Swiss shanked a forehand.  Any frustration Federer may have felt was channelled in a clinical tiebreak, which he won without dropping a point on his serve.  From then on it was easy going for Federer, who did not face a break point in the remainder of the encounter.  He broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set with a clinical forehand put-away and again at the same point in the third, when 27th-seeded Zverev double faulted. Having not been pushed to his brilliant best, Federer at least finished with a flourish, wrapping up the match after an hour and 49 minutes with his 13th ace.  Thirteenth seed Dimitrov, now aged 26, may provide a sterner challenge, although he is another player who has never beaten Federer in five previous efforts.

The leader of the ATP's NextGen pack has long been tipped as a future grand slam champion and he is desperate to prove that he can back up the soaring exceptions.

{"content":"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian police officers have shot dead 16 gunmen in two shootouts, the country's Interior Ministry said on Saturday, adding that most of those killed were fugitive militants linked to recent attacks on security forces in Northern Sinai. Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State group in the restive Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013. At least two policemen were killed and nine wounded when their armored vehicle was hit by an explosion in the Sinai on Saturday, Egypt's state news agency MENA said. Saturday's attack came a day after at least 23 soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs tore through two military checkpoints in the region in an attack claimed by Islamic State. It was one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years.[nL8N1JY1M6] The Interior Ministry said that gunmen had opened fire on police as they approached a desert training camp for militants in Ismailia. The officers returned fire, killing 14 militants, five of whom have been identified so far. The camp was used to  subject (recruits) to military training programs on the use of various types of firearms and manufacture explosive devices...,  the ministry said in a statement.  In a separate statement the ministry also said its forces killed two men described as fugitive terrorists in an exchange of gunfire in the city of Giza. The men, who were inside an apartment, opened fire on security forces as soon as the officers approached to arrest them, it said. The ministry said the pair were members of a newly emerged militant group called Hasm, which claimed responsibility for the killing of a homeland security officer outside his home in Qalubiya, a province just north of Cairo, while on his way to prayers on Friday. Hasm has claimed several attacks around Cairo targeting judges and policemen since last year. Other militant groups such as Hasm, which the government says are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, are active in Cairo and other cities where they have targeted security forces, judges and pro-government figures. The Brotherhood was outlawed in 2013 after the military ousted one of its leaders, Mohamed Mursi, from the presidency following mass protests. It maintains that it is a peaceful organization. Islamic State has also intensified attacks on security forces and Coptic Christian civilians in the mainland in recent months, killing about 100 Copts since December.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Berating the umpire at the start and bellowing to the sky as he closed out a third-set tiebreak on Centre Court, it was hard to argue with Novak Djokovic's assertion that the passion is back. The three-times Wimbledon champion continued to look much more like his old self as he recovered from an early wobble to beat unpredictable Latvian Ernests Gulbis 6-4 6-1 7-6(2) and take his place in the fourth round for a 10th time.  Obviously when you're playing well, then you're feeling well, then you're even more motivated, passionate to see how far it can take you,  30-year-old Djokovic told reporters. His former coach Boris Becker, commentating for the BBC, had picked up on Djokovic's feisty on-court mood, saying it was a sign that the 12-times grand slam champion was emerging from a 12-month funk that began after winning the 2016 French Open.  Boris knows me very well. So he's right when he says that the passion is back. I've been feeling better on the court,  said Djokovic, who will next face 51st ranked Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, who he beat in last year's second round. Djokovic dropped his serve in the third game when Gulbis let rip with three clean winners and was clearly not happy with the work of American umpire Jake Garner and was clearly heard to tell the official to  focus .  Maybe it wasn't right me doing that and I apologize,  Djokovic said.  He is trying to do his job as best he can, as am I. Sometimes it can just be said in the heat of the match.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria (Reuters) - Williams could not explain their lack of pace in Austrian Grand Prix qualifying on Saturday, with Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa shocked by his worst performance of the season. Massa, who started on pole position for Williams at the Red Bull-owned circuit in 2014, will line up in 17th place while Canadian rookie team mate -- on the podium in Azerbaijan two weeks ago -- qualified 18th of 20 cars.  We were immediately slow, starting yesterday,  said technical head Paddy Lowe.  It was obvious that the pace wasn't in the normal ranking.  We changed the balance of the car but we didn't actually make it any quicker.  We tried a few more things going into qualifying which also didn't make it quicker. So the honest answer is we are not quick here but we don't know why.  The former champions, who last won a race in 2012, were by far the slowest of the teams with Mercedes engines at a track that has favored the German manufacturer since it returned to the calendar in 2014 after a decade's absence. Valtteri Bottas took pole position for Mercedes while team mate Lewis Hamilton and the two Mercedes-powered Force Indias qualified in the top 10. Williams have brought aerodynamic upgrades to Austria and Lowe said the package had performed as intended.  The long run pace yesterday didn't look too bad so hopefully it's simply a matter of single lap performance rather than general race performance, but I don't want to speak too soon about that,  he added. Massa, who might have won in Baku but for a suspension failure, said he had no answers either.  It was the worst qualifying we had during the whole season,  he said.  Really disappointed.  Something is not working on the car. And we need to understand what.  With the new tyres, I was just struggling to make the tyres work and lacking overall grip, especially in the front.

{"content":"STATION DES ROUSSES, France (Reuters) - If one day on the Tour de France is going to sort the men from the boys it will be Sunday when an already worn-out peloton embarks on a punishing trek in the Jura mountains. The 181.5-km ninth stage from Nantua to Chambery features 4,700 meters of climbing with three out-of-category climbs, with gradients much steeper than the Tour usually includes.  After the final climb, the riders will need to stay alert as the descent from the Mont du Chat (8.7km at 10.3 percent) is among the most dangerous in the area. To top it all, possible thunderstorms are forecast.  It's a fast, tricky descent but, in my opinion, it's more about the climbs tomorrow, that climb (to the Mont du Chat) is savage,  Britain's race leader Chris Froome said.  We could see some really big differences. I expect the GC (general classification) to be blown to pieces.   Before the last climb to the Mont du Chat, the riders, who have been suffering from the heat and endured a hectic hilly eighth stage on Saturday, will go up the Col de la Biche (10.5km at nine pct) and Col du Grand Colombier (8.5km at 9.9 pct). Froome leads Sky team mate and compatriot Geraint Thomas by 12 seconds and Italian Fabio Aru (Astana) by 14. The top contenders are all within a minute of Froome, but the time gaps should be much bigger on Sunday night. And by then some will already have lost the Tour.  Those who want to be on the podium in Paris must be in the top three in the GC on Sunday night after a very hard, very selective stage,  Nairo Quintana's team manager at Movistar, Eusebio Unzue, told Reuters.   It was a very hot first week, with long stages. the conditions are hard.  Contador Factor Froome's outfit have had a relatively smooth build-up to the much-feared stage and the Briton will hope that his team mates will be in control as attacks are likely to come from all sides. Aru, who won the first summit finish at La Planche des Belles Filles, should be the main threat for Froome, but twice champion Alberto Contador, Quintana, in-form Australian Richie Porte and last year's runner-up Romain Bardet are all aggressive riders and cannot be discarded.  The strongest will win,  Bahrain-Merida sports director Philippe Mauduit, who managed Contador in 2014, told Reuters.  Maybe a team will invent something unexpected. There will be a clear hierarchy between the top favorites.  The one who will lose more than 15 seconds will probably not win the Tour.  According to Mauduit, Contador could be a real danger despite his ageing legs.  He's less sharp than he was but he has had no troubles so far. Not a crash, not a mechanical problem, and he had not been spared from bad luck for a very long time,  the Frenchman said.  He's a force to be reckoned with.

The sixth seed, runner-up last year to Andy Murray, was given a decent workout by Spanish claycourt specialist Albert Ramos-Vinolas on a sunny Court One but his extra firepower proved decisive as he won 7-6(3) 6-4 7-5.

I was holding serve pretty comfortably so I had a little bit of freedom to experiment there,  he said. While pleased with his serving -- he won 84 percent of his first-serve points and 81 percent on second serve -- Raonic also proved more than capable at the baseline, often engaging in long rallies with a man well-used to the claycourt grind. Slideshow (6 Images) I think I've always, over the last few years, been there from the baseline aspect,  he said.  It's not like I'm rushing to the net because I can't take care of my own from the back.  But I think it does send a positive message, at least on my behalf, across the net when I can be there, (I've) been winning a good amount of those important points.

{"content":"(Reuters) - It will take a big personality to shake things up on the Tour de France on Sunday and Spaniard Alberto Contador, rather than Colombian Nairo Quintana, is more likely to be that man, according to three-time champion Greg LeMond. The ninth stage is a punishing 181.5-km trek through the Jura mountains, with the steepest gradients of recent Tour history, and Britain's overall leader Chris Froome believes the general classification could be  blown to pieces .  It is the day we will see where Contador and Quintana (who lost time in the first summit finish) are,  LeMond, on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in a daily chat with Reuters.  My feeling is that Quintana has got a little bit intimidated and he will race very conservatively.  American LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, '89 and '90, believes the stage will be lit up by Froome, Australian Richie Porte, Italian Fabio Aru, France's Romain Bardet, and daredevil Contador.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria (Reuters) - Ferrari's Formula One leader Sebastian Vettel would face  very severe  consequences if he committed any more 'road rage' offences on track, International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Jean Todt said on Saturday. The German was handed a 10 seconds stop-and-go penalty during the race in Azerbaijan last month for deliberately banging wheels with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton while they were behind the safety car. Vettel was summoned to an FIA hearing in Paris last Monday, which then decided to take no further action after he apologized and accepted full responsibility. It was the second time in a matter of months that Vettel   faced possible sanction for his on-track behavior, with the Ferrari driver warned in Mexico for abusing race director Charlie Whiting over the team radio.  Mexico was a completely different offence, and we have seen Sebastian is not always able to control himself as much as he should,  Todt, a former Ferrari team boss, told Sky Sports television.  I used to run drivers and they are in a very tense situation -- and I think you must try to interpret the situation well. This does not give them the right to do anything but you must try and understand it. Formula One - F1 - Austrian Grand Prix 2017 - Red Bull Ring, Spielberg, Austria - July 8, 2017   Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel ahead of qualifying   Reuters/Dominic Ebenbichler This was a completely different matter but, clearly, Sebastian has had some very strong warnings. Clearly, it won't happen again and, if it does, the consequences would be very severe,  added the Frenchman. Todt dismissed a suggestion that Formula One had a different approach to other sports such as cycling, with Slovakia's world champion Peter Sagan kicked out of the Tour de France for sending Briton Mark Cavendish crashing to the ground. The Frenchman said it was  irrelevant  to compare that incident, as some have done, with what happened in Baku. Todt also expressed some sympathy for Vettel's refusal to apologize on the day, with ample opportunity to do so in television interviews.  He was digesting the scene and the emotion was such that he did (make) a big mistake. He slowly understood that he did (make) a big mistake and at least he assured me that it would never happen again,  he said.  Time will tell if it never happens again but, if it does, the consequences will be very severe.

{"content":"VECSES, Hungary (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hungarian right-wing militants gathered in a Budapest suburb on Saturday to launch a new political movement they hope will run in next year's parliamentary elections on a ticket that includes open racism. Hungary's main opposition party, Jobbik, has been moving away from its far-right roots and is staking out a more centrist position. This has created space for new hard-right initiatives.  Three groups held a rally in the suburb of Vecses labelled  unfurling the flag of the far right . Although attendance was limited its leaders have reached a national audience in the media and plan to take part in the 2018 elections. The movement, to be called Force and Determination, looks to be more radical than any political organization targeting a serious political role since the fall of Communism, and uses openly racist language to oppose liberalism and immigration. Balazs Laszlo, one of the movement's leaders, told the crowd of mostly black-clad muscular, tattooed men that Europe showed an ill-conceived tolerance in the face of peril from its existing minorities and the influx of millions more people.  Tens of millions are added to the ranks of the Arabs, Africans and Gypsies who will show no tolerance once they realize the power that their demographic significance lends them,  he said.  Our ethnic community must come first... there is no equality.

Echoing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's frequently touted ideal of an illiberal state, he said:  We declare war on liberalism. They are our main enemy and we will do everything to destroy their ideals in our public... These people lose their nationality, their race awareness and soon their sexual identity.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Leaders from the world's leading economies broke with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate policy at a G20 summit on Saturday, in a rare public admission of disagreement and blow to multilateral cooperation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, keen to show off her skills as a mediator two months before a German election, achieved her primary goal at the meeting in Hamburg, convincing her fellow leaders to support a single communique with pledges on trade, finance, energy and Africa. But the divide between Trump, elected on a pledge to put  America First , and the 19 other members of the club, including countries as diverse as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, was stark. Last month Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark international climate accord clinched two years ago in Paris.  In the end, the negotiations on climate reflect dissent – all against the United States of America,  Merkel told reporters at the end of the meeting.  And the fact that negotiations on trade were extraordinarily difficult is due to specific positions that the United States has taken.   The summit, marred by violent protests that left the streets of Hamburg littered with burning cars and broken shop windows, brought together a volatile mix of leaders at a time of major change in the global geo-political landscape. Trump's shift to a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has left a void in global leadership, unsettling traditional allies in Europe and opening the door to rising powers like China to assume a bigger role. Tensions between Washington and Beijing dominated the run-up to the meeting, with the Trump administration ratcheting up pressure on President Xi Jinping to rein in North Korea and threatening punitive trade measures on steel. Related CoverageErdogan says U.S. stance stalls Turkish ratification of Paris climate dealFrance's Macron says will continue to press Trump on climate agreementMerkel says G20 communique makes differences with U.S. on climate clearTrump-Putin Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg, a hotly anticipated encounter after the former real estate mogul promised a rapprochement with Moscow during his campaign, only to be thwarted by accusations of Russian meddling in the vote and investigations into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin said at the conclusion of the summit on Saturday that Trump had quizzed him on the alleged meddling in a meeting that lasted over two hours but seemed to have been satisfied with the Kremlin leader's denials of interference. Trump had accused Russia of destabilizing behavior in Ukraine and Syria before the summit. But in Hamburg he struck a conciliatory tone, describing it as an honor to meet Putin and signaling, through Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that he preferred to focus on future ties and not dwell on the past. Delegates attend the official dinner at the Elbphilharmonie Concert Hall during the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017.Kay Nietfeld It was an extraordinarily important meeting,  Tillerson said, describing a  very clear positive chemistry  between Trump and the former KGB agent. In the final communique, the 19 other leaders took note of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and declared it  irreversible . For its part, the United States injected a contentious line saying that it would  endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.  French President Emmanuel Macron led a push to soften the U.S. language.  There is a clear consensus absent the United States,  said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  But that is a problem. Without the largest economy in the world how far can you go?   Slideshow (15 Images)Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace, said the G19 had  held the line  against Trump's  backward decision  to withdraw from Paris. On trade, another sticking point, the leaders agreed they would  fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard.  The leaders also pledged to work together to foster economic development in Africa, a priority project for Merkel. Violent Protests Merkel chose to host the summit in Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. It was held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the  Rote Flora  which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Over the three days of the summit, radicals looted shops, torched cars and lorries. More than 200 police were injured and some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody. Some of the worst damage was done as Merkel hosted other leaders at for a concert and lavish dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a modernist glass concert hall overlooking the Elbe River.  Merkel met police and security force after the summit to thank them, and condemned the  unbridled brutality  of some of the protestors, but she was forced to answer tough questions about hosting the summit in Hamburg during her closing press conference.

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) has been championed by both sides as a landmark deal for open markets against a protectionist tide, but last-minute wrangles over cheese and pharmaceuticals were holding up its start.  Meeting at the G20 in Hamburg, reconfirming our joint commitment to the rules-based international trading system, we agreed to set the date of 21 September 2017 to start the provisional application of the agreement, thus allowing for all the necessary implementing measures to be taken before that date,  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement.  It is by opening up to each other, by working closely with those who share the same values that we will shape and harness globalization,  the joint declaration said. The agreement will enter definitively into force once all 28 EU member states and parliaments ratify it. The EU had not been satisfied that Canada would effectively open up its markets to 17,700 additional tonnes of EU cheese and provide guarantees for the patents of European pharmaceuticals. A spokesman for Canadian trade minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the allocation of the cheese tariff rate quota would be made before the September deadline.  So what happens now is that both sides will complete their internal processes and closely consult one another on how the agreement will be implemented. This is about ensuring a smooth transition to a strong start for CETA,  the spokesman said. Both sides had been hoping for the provisional implementation of the agreement this month.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The quality of Wimbledon's courts have been criticized by some players but the head groundsman at the All England Club says there are not significantly different to previous years. The courts came under fire when French player Kristina Mladenovic slated the Court 18 surface after her defeat by American Alison Riske on Thursday. Mladenovic said she and Riske had both asked not to play on the court after the first two games, describing the surface as slippery. The All England Club issued a statement defending the courts and said Court 18 had been  playable as normal . The French woman's comments came just two hours after American Bethanie Mattek-Sands had been carried off a different court on a stretcher, screaming in pain with a serious knee injury after stumbling while approaching the net.  Obviously we listen to players, because their feedback is important. But the data shows to us those courts that are in question are within range of the other courts, and they are within the range of previous years,  said All England Club head groundsman Neil Stubley.  That's all we can work to, is the data that we feel is best for the health of the courts  We set them up to the exact standard that we've done in many previous years. So I'm not quite sure.   They (the players) have their reasons why they're saying that. More slippery? I don't know if there's been more slips this year or there's just been a couple of high-profile ones. I'm not sure,  he added. Conditions in SW19 have been hotter and drier than for many years and the roof on Centre Court was closed before play on Friday in a bid to protect the turf from the blazing sun. Stubley said that they had plans established to deal with the temperatures.  Obviously we're dealing with the extreme heat, which we're not used to every single championships. So from one championships to another you will get variations in temperatures which will actually have an effect on how you manage the courts.  We go into the championships with as healthy of grass as we possibly can so we can endure those extremes.   So if we get extreme heat, or last year with the extreme wet, we can deal with it. We have the mechanisms in place that we can add water, we can dry them a little bit more. We can actually be in control of how the plant is surviving.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday promised $639 million in aid to feed people left starving because of drought and conflict in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. Trump's pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a  godsend  to the United Nations' World Food Programme, the group's executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.  We're facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,  said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the U.N. agency fighting hunger worldwide. The new funding brings to over $1.8 billion aid promised by the United States for fiscal year 2017 for the crises in the four countries, where the United Nations has estimated more than 30 million people need urgent food assistance.  With this new assistance, the United States is providing additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, life-saving medical care, improved sanitation, emergency shelter and protection for those who have been affected by conflict,  USAID said in a statement. Rob Jenkins, acting head of the USAID's bureau of democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance, said of the funding, over $191 million would go to Yemen, $199 million to South Sudan, $121 million to Nigeria and almost $126 million for Somalia. Conflict in all four countries had made it difficult to reach some communities in need of food, he noted.  We're in a dire situation right now,  said Jenkins, adding that USAID was also concerned with the situation in southern Ethiopia.  The situation in southern Ethiopia fortunately does not rise to the dire situation of the other four, but the situation is deteriorating and might very well be catastrophic without additional interventions,  he said, adding that Washington had already provided some $252 million this year to Ethiopia,  but the needs continue to grow.  Beasley said the U.S. funding was about a third of what the WFP estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries in crisis as well as in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst-affected zones stemming from wars and  man-made  crises, Beasley said.  We estimated that if we didn't receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,  he said. Trump's announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the U.S. State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his  America First  policy.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Garbine Muguruza is one of only four women left in the women's draw to have made it to a Wimbledon final but two years on from that feat, she still wonders quite how she did it. The Spaniard, who thrashed Romania's Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-2  on Saturday, will meet Angelique Kerber in the fourth round on Monday in a battle of the last two Wimbledon runner-ups. Like Kerber, she was felled by Serena Williams in the final but the fact that she even got a chance to play the title match in 2015 continues to amaze her.  I never feel that comfortable in grass. Every time I start the grass season, I'm like, 'how the hell did I (reach) that final? This kind of feeling,  said the 2016 French Open champion.  The experience I have now ... for sure helps me. But it's tough.  Her grasscourt know-how has certainly been in evidence this week as she has reached the second week without dropping a set. Cirstea, who reached the third round after American opponent Bethanie Mattek-Sands suffered a horrible knee injury on Thursday, matched Muguruza for power but made too many errors to pose a serious threat to the 14th seed. The Romanian held on to her opening service game with an ace but Muguruza was quickly into her groove and reeled off the next five games before Cirstea managed to stem the tide briefly. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza in action during her third round match against Romania’s Sorana CirsteaStefan WermuthThe same happened in the second set. Cirstea again held in the opening game with a backhand winner, before Muguruza changed gear and went on a five-game streak. Muguruza, 23, showed there was more to her game than power with some silky dropshots as she cruised to victory in a little over an hour on Court Two. Slideshow (3 Images)While Muguruza has avoided any on-court drama this week, the same cannot be said about her cooking skills. On Friday she thought she was in danger of being hauled out of her rented accommodation near the All England Club after setting off the smoke alarm in the house.   I love red meat. We were doing nice steaks. I did a lot of steaks. It was so much smoke that the ... alarm (went off),  she said laughing.   It was like this for 20 minutes. We didn't know what to do ... I felt scared. I'm like 'Are they going to come just because of steak?'  While the Spaniard plans to enjoy a more chilled out Sunday, on Monday she will be back hoping that it will be her smoking groundstrokes that will put Kerber off her stride.  I'm motivated. I have toughest rounds to come. I'm just looking forward for it,  added Muguruza.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Saturday said that the U.S.-Mexico relationship cannot be defined by  murmurs,  the day after U.S. President Donald Trump said Mexico would  absolutely  pay for his proposed southern border wall.  Speaking at the end of his trip to Hamburg for the G20 meeting, Pena Nieto told reporters that the relationship with the United States, Mexico's top trading partner, should instead focus on more positive ends - a view that he believed Trump also shared.   Given what happened after this meeting (with Trump), clearly our bilateral relationship cannot be defined by murmurs like those that took place yesterday,  Pena Nieto said.   Our relationship needs to be based on searching for ways to generate mutual respect, build confidence and work with a positive attitude. I can say that I saw that willingness in President Trump.  For the first time since becoming president in January, Trump met Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday. Trump has accused Mexico of stealing U.S. jobs, and complex talks over renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are due to begin on August 16. The meeting at the Hamburg leaders' summit of the Group of 20 economies was keenly anticipated in Mexico, and officials were quick to stress talks had been productive, despite Trump repeating that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall. In response to a shouted question from a reporter about whether he still wants Mexico to pay for the border wall, which aims to keep out illegal immigrants, Trump said,  Absolutely.  Disputes over immigration, Trump's border wall - which Mexico has repeatedly said it would not pay for - and his claim that free trade with Mexico costs jobs in the United States, have strained relations between the two neighbors. Trump has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. industry, and to pull out of NAFTA altogether if he cannot rework it in the United States' favor. Pena Nieto also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday, according to a readout of the meeting, in which Pena Nieto said he was working closely with Canada to come up with a better, mutually beneficial update to NAFTA. Pena Nieto also said he met with Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi and agreed to possibly making a trip to the Asian nation next year, with a view to deepening trade links.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Belgium soccer player Romelu Lukaku, who is close to joining English Premier League club Manchester United, was arrested in southern California and issued a citation after failing to heed noise warnings, Beverly Hills police said on Saturday. The arrest was made on July 2 at about 8 p.m. local time after police responded to noise complaints at the Beverly Hills home that Lukaku, who is negotiating a deal to join United from their top-flight rivals Everton, was staying in. “Beverly Hills Police Department officers arrested a 24-year-old male subject by the name of Romelu Lukaku Bolingoli,” the department said in a press release emailed to Reuters. “Bolingoli received a misdemeanor citation for... Excessive Noise. The citation was issued after officers responded to five other noise complaints from the same location, which resulted in verbal warnings. “These noise violations occurred at a residence in Beverly Hills where Bolingoli was temporarily residing. Bolingoli was released at the scene with the citation and was not physically arrested.” Lukaku is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Airport courthouse on Oct. 2, police said. The news comes less than a day after United announced they had agreed a transfer fee to buy the Belgium international forward from Everton, subject to a medical and personal terms. The prolific goalscorer will have his medical in Los Angeles, British media reports say, before joining United there for the club's pre-season tour, which starts with a game against North American Major League Soccer team LA Galaxy next Saturday.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The prospect of Pat Cash guiding Coco Vandeweghe to a shock Wimbledon title 30 years after his own success may be edging closer to reality as the American moved seamlessly into the fourth round on Saturday. Vandeweghe, who hired Cash as her coach in the leadup to the tournament after splitting with Craig Kardon, stormed into the last 16 with 6-2 6-4 win over fellow American Alison Riske. In women's draw in which all 16 survivors will fancy their chances, Vandeweghe's credentials stack up well. The 24th seed has yet to drop a set in her three opening matches and hits winners for fun -- 87 so far. She had a brief wobble against 46th-ranked Riske but was comfortably in control on Saturday. While her form this year has swung between the extremes of a semi-final run to the Australian Open in January and a first round exit at the French Open in May, she has some pedigree on grass, having reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2015. She has hired Cash hoping he can give her an extra edge, three decades since the head-band wearing Australian lifted the trophy at the All England Club and after her build-up to Wimbledon was marred by a split with Kardon. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017   USA’s Coco Vandeweghe waves during her third round match against USA’s Alison RiskeTony O'Brien He's (Cash) present at all my practices, all my matches. He's made a commitment to the working team. So I think a pretty big impact,  she told reporters on Saturday.  Vandeweghe has many of the tools needed to succeed on grass, principally a booming serve that regularly approaches the 120mph mark. In her three victories at Wimbledon this year, she has won 88 percent of points on her first serve. She also has form when it comes to causing an upset as she showed by beating world number one Angelique Kerber at the Australian Open in January. Against Riske, she broke twice to race through the opening set and twice more at the start of the second to take a 4-0 lead. The wheels threatened to come off at that stage as her compatriot fought back to level at 4-4.  Vandeweghe, however, steadied her nerves to break again and set up three match points with an ace before checking out with another service winner. With the pregnant Serena Williams missing this year's Wimbledon and many of the other top women's players struggling for form or fitness, the draw is opening up.  I think there is some very solid depth (in the women's game) of players that can make an impact against a top player,  she said.  I'm an example of that myself.

{"content":"(Adds reaction) By Ehab Farouk CAIRO, July 8 (Reuters) - Egypt's deputy finance minister Mohamed Meait said on Saturday he expected the rise in interest rates to control inflation would be temporary as he sees inflation falling early next year. The central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, on Thursday raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change.  We expect the interest rate decision to be a temporary measure to target inflation,  Meait told Reuters.  We expect inflation to fall in early 2018 and thus (we can) begin cutting interest rates.  Egypt floated the pound in November, and since then the currency has roughly halved in value, sending inflation surging. Although the core inflation rate slipped in May, it remains at almost 30 percent year-on-year. Meait also said the two increases in base lending rates this year were not taken into account in the state budget for the 2017/18 fiscal year, which parliament passed last week. The interest on current and future debt was calculated at 381 billion pounds, said Meait, who expected adjustments to that figure in the light of the change in borrowing costs. The budget has yet to be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The central bank raised interest rates by three percentage points after the currency flotation, which helped Egypt clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending programme tied to reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts. The IMF has said lowering inflation is crucial to keeping the reform programme on track and that raising interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. The central bank has said it aims to cut inflation to 13 percent by the end of next year. The government last week increased fuel and electricity prices by up to 50 percent for the second time since November in another step towards narrowing its budget deficit. More rises are expected.  The average interest rate on domestic borrowing rate is currently between 19 and 20 percent and this average may fall in the second half of 2018 to 18 percent,  Meait said. Interest on debt costs for 2016-2017 had exceeded the target but cannot be announced at the moment,  he added. Thursday's move drew criticism from businessmen working in different industrial sectors who say they still haven't recovered from May's interest rate hike. The interest rate increase  will have a devastating impact on industry (in general) and the pharmaceutical sector,  said Hossam Aboul El Enein, SEDICO Pharmaceutical Company chief executive officer. He told Reuters that the cost of borrowing had increased and energy prices had risen while the prices of medicines could only be changed by ministerial decision.  I expect a shortage of medicines in the coming period,  he said, adding that he wondered how drug companies would make a profit given current prices.

Philippe has said that France's objective was is to reduce the budget deficit below an EU-agreed cap of 3 percent of economic output this year.  We are going to do it without increasing taxes in 2017,  Philippe told a convention of LREM, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Republic on the Move party.  We will therefore, thanks to savings measures to control the spending, keep commitments imposed on France by Brussels,  he added. Philippe's commitment to stick to the deficit target despite over-spending this year by the previous government has raised concern among some economists that tax cuts promised by Macron may have to be pushed back, diluting their positive impact on the economy.

The 28-year-old Bacsinszky, playing on Centre Court for the first time, mixed up the pace of her shots well to take the first set, but had to call a medical time-out at the end of the second set and received heavy strapping on her thigh. The injury, picked up when sprinting to the net, clearly affected the Swiss in the third set.   It's quite frustrating, because I think I played a great first set.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria (Reuters) - Finland's Valtteri Bottas kept champions Mercedes on pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix on Saturday after title-chasing team mate Lewis Hamilton was hit with a five-place grid penalty. Hamilton, who is 14 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel after eight races, qualified third fastest but will start in eighth place due to the automatic drop resulting from an unscheduled gearbox change. Vettel will share the front row with Bottas, with Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo on the second row.  I really enjoy driving here. The car was getting better and better as the grip was coming,  said Bottas, who now has a golden opportunity to take a second career win.  A decent lap at the end, it wasn't perfect, but it was enough.  Hopes of a crackling showdown between the Mercedes and Ferrari rivals in the final seconds were blown away when Romain Grosjean's Haas broke down on track and brought out the warning flags. Related CoverageLewis Hamilton aiming for second place on SundayThe pole was the second of Bottas's Formula One career after Bahrain in April. Vettel won that race but Mercedes have triumphed in Austria in every year since the Red Bull Ring returned to the calendar in 2014.    Congratulations to Valtteri, he did a fantastic job and Sebastian has been very quick. It just wasn't meant to be today,  said Hamilton, whose gearbox was swapped out after the team discovered a problem from the previous race in Azerbaijan.  I'll do the best job I can. I want to get up there and get a one-two with Valtteri.  Hamilton won last year with now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg triumphant in 2014 and 2015.

Vettel had to make a public apology after accusing his rival  of 'brake-testing' him after the Ferrari driver drove into the back of the Mercedes and then banged wheels while they were behind the safety car. Although Hamilton has accepted the apology and said he still has  the utmost respect  for Vettel, he refused to play along when asked to shake hands with his rival in post-qualifying interviews. Television images showed, however, that he and Vettel had done so unprompted after they stepped out of their cars in the pit lane.  The car was really good. I was hoping for the last run but it was a bit of an anti climax with the yellow flags,  said Vettel, who will fancy his chances of a fourth win of the season.  It's a great track, the car has been phenomenal.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow, it should be a good race.  Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen starts fifth with Grosjean sixth.

RHP Seth Maness was outrighted to Triple-A Omaha on Friday. He was 1-0 with a 3.72 ERA, but opponents were hitting .381 against him. 3B Mike Moustakas landed a spot on the American League All-Star team Friday, winning the final five voting among fans with 15.6 million votes.

The Royals and Dodgers merged their efforts to earn a spot for Moustakas and 3B Justin Turner, with their fan voting volunteers urging votes for both third basemen. Moustakas has hit 25 home runs in 2017, and six in his last nine games. He's tied for second in the majors and has already surpassed his career best of 22 in 2015. He's on pace to break the Royals' team record for most home runs in a season (Steve Balboni, 36, 1985). He's the third Royal to be invited to compete in the Home Run Derby, the others being Danny Tartabull (1991) and Bo Jackson (1989).

He's hitting .333 against the Twins this season after entering the season with a lifetime .347 average against Minnesota. Friday was Machado's ninth career four-plus hit game.

He opened the season on the disabled list with a concussion, incurred while playing for Canada in the World Baseball Classic. In his first game with Triple-A Buffalo on his first rehabilitation assignment, he injured his knee. He played his third game with Buffalo Thursday and was 1-for-4 with a double and an RBI. It was his first hit in the three games. He did not playFriday. RHP Eric Pardinho, a 16-year-old Brazilian, was signed as an international free agent for $1.4-mlliion. He was ranked No. 5 on MLB Pipeline's list of 30 international amateur prospects.  We really like his arm action, delivery and his athleticism,  assistant general manager AndrewTinnish said during a media conference.  He is one of the most advanced I've seen at this age. This is a very mature 16-year-old.  RHP Roberto Osuna became the youngest Blue Jay to be selected for the All-Star Game Friday when he was added to the American League team. Osuna is 22 years and 154 days. RHP Dave Stieb previously had been the youngest Blue Jay at 22 years, 352 days. Osuna has converted 21 consecutive save chances, the longest active streak in the majors and second overall to 23 by RHP Greg Holland April 3-June 9. Osuna had earned the save in three straight games entering Friday. RHP Marcus Stroman is expected to make his scheduled start Saturday in the third game of the four-game series against the Houston Astros at the Rogers Centre. He left his start Monday at Yankee Stadium after five innings when he developed a raw spot on a finger of his right hand. He is 2-3 with a 3.82 ERA in his past five starts. In three career starts against the Astros he is 1-1 with a 3.86 ERA. RHP Aaron Sanchez allowed eight runs (five earned) in 1 2/3 innings in the 12-2 loss to the Houston Astros Friday in his first start since May 19. Sanchez allowed seven hits and four walks and failed to record a strikeout for the first time in his career as a starter.  Not enough strikes, but in saying that I thought he was close a lot of the time,  manager John Gibbons said.  They got couple of scratch hits early right out of the gate, the first two guys and he got the big (double play) groundball   and then (Carlos) Correa hit one (a homer) that was pretty impressive because i don't think it was  too bad a pitch.  Said Sanchez:  I felt great, I think the best part about tonight is that I didn't think about my finger once. I went out there, I was aggressive I felt like I was who I was before all this stuff happened. l think that's s a plus. I think it was just one of those days where things didn't go my way. A couple of hard-hit balls, a couple of soft-hit balls, and walks they will always kill you. I thought there were a lot of close calls.  RHP Dominic Leone was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo to make room for RHP Aaron Sanchez, who was reinstated from the disabled list to make the start Friday against the Houston Astros. Leone is 1-0 with a 2.95 ERA in 34 appearances with Toronto this season, allowing 28 hits and striking out 42 in 39 2/3 innings. This is the fourth time the 25-year-old has been optioned to Buffalo this year, starting March 30. In two games covering two innings with Buffalo, he has a 4.50 ERA.

Prior to this season, Pirela had only hit one major league home run while hitting .226 in 137 at-bats sprinkled over three seasons, but he's batting .300 in 106 ABs since a June call-up with the four homers and 14 RBIs. INF Chase d'Arnaud, batting .190 in 58 at-bats for the Padres this season, was outrighted to Triple-A El Paso on Friday. The utility infielder was designated for assignment on July 4. C Austin Hedges returned from two missed games due to neck stiffness on Friday night against the Phillies and looked plenty healthy, knocking two solo home runs and driving in the game-winning run with a sacrifice fly in the 4-3 victory. It's the first career multi-homer game for Hedges, who entered the weekend with 11 home runs on the season and just 14 in his MLB career. The former 2nd-round selection back in 2011 flashed some power with Triple-A El Paso last year, knocking 21 homers in 82 games, including a string of five games in a row with one leaving the ballpark.  It was good to see him swing the bat well,  Green said.  He's been working hard in the cage, he's been kind of scuffling a bit lately. I'm sure the two days [off] helped him reboot the system, too.  RHP Jhoulys Chacin will take the mound on Saturday afternoon as the Padres continue their series against the Phillies. Chacin, who is 7-7 with a 4.52 ERA on the season, hasn't allowed more than three earned runs in any of his last seven starts, a stretch during which he's 3-3 with a 2.98 ERA. His last time out he threw five scoreless innings against the Dodgers before leaving due to a high pitch count, but that was the fifth straight outing he'd allowed two runs or fewer. This will be the eighth time Chacin will face the Phillies over his nine-year MLB career, and sixth as a starter. He's fared well against the club, going 2-1 with a 2.25 ERA, but hasn't faced them since 2014 when he was with the Colorado Rockies. LHP Clayton Richard limited the Phillies to five hits and one run over six innings on Friday night before a rain delay forced the Padres to go to the bullpen, which ended up costing Richard the win in a game his teammates eventually won 4-3. Richard threw just 82 pitches, 55 for strikes, striking out two and walking one. It's the first time in eight starts that he gave up one run or fewer, as he'd been 2-3 with a 5.66 ERA in his previous seven outings.  He was outstanding,  catcher Austin Hedges said.  First couple of innings he was on point, he was as good as he's been, and he lost a little bit of command later but he's such a good competitor that we made an adjustment and he was able to give us six great innings.

It was his longest outing since he threw a career-high eight innings May 10 against the Cubs. He did not walk a batter for the first time this season and third time of his career. He entered the game 2-for-25 but went 2-for-3 with a double _ his first career extra-base hit _ and scored twice. Marquez had scored one run before this game. RHP Antonio Senzatela could return to the Rockies rotation after the All-Star break. The 22-year-old rookie logged 88 1/3 innings in 15 starts, the last on June 22. He subsequently made two two-inning relief appearances and worked one inning Friday and allowed a run Friday. Manager Bud Black sid Senzatela pitching in relief  has given him a nice break.  He was 7-1 with a 3.19 in his first 10 career starts but is now 9-3 with a 4.63 ERA in 18 games (15 starts). While he pitched 154 innings at High Class A Modesto in 2015, Senzatela pitched 34 2/3 innings last year at Double-A Hartford due to shoulder inflammation. So the Rockies want to carefully monitor his workload in his first season in the majors. OF Mike Tauchman was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. The Rockies selected his contract from that club June 27, Tauchman made his major league debut that night. He played seven games (two starts) with the Rockies and went 2-for-9 with one RBI and was 0-for-3 as a pinch hitter. In 70 games this season with Albuquerque, Tauchman is hitting .313 with 10 home runs, 55 RBI, 50 runs scored and 11 stolen bases. 3B Nolan Arenado went 3-for-5 with a season-high five RBI. He has had two four-RBI games, the last on June 18 against San Francisco. Arenado hit his 16th homer and his first since his three-run walk-off homer completed the cycle June 18. Arenado's streak of 15 games without a home run was his longest since a 19-game homerless streak from June 29-July 25, 2015. RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) is scheduled to begin a minor league rehab assignment Thursday at Double-A Hartford and throw two innings or 30 pitches. A minor league rehab can last 30 days for a pitcher. Bettis, who is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Sunday, threw 40 pitches in two innings Friday in a simulated game, facing Pat Valaika, Trevor Story and left-handed hitter Alexi Amarista and was 87-92 mph with his fastball.  It was nice to get back out there and actually try to really simulate what it feels like to go through a game, pitch to counts,  said Bettis who threw 25 pitches Tuesday in batting practice.   I felt strong through it all, so it was a good step.  OF/1B Gerardo Parra (right quad strain) was reinstated, started in left field after playing his third rehab game Thursday for Triple-A Albuquerque and went 3-for-5 with a double and one RBI. Parra was injured June 6 and missed 28 games while on the 10-day disabled list. The Rockies went 13-15 in his absence.

McGwire hit 33 of his 49 homers by the All-Star break in 1987 for Oakland. Judge also set a club record for homers by a rookie. The previous mark was held by Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who hit 29 in 1936.

OF Jess Winker struck out as a pinch-hitter after being recalled Friday to add a bat to the roster before the All-Star break. Winker was slashing .305./.386/.391 with 16 doubles, two homers and 37 RBIs. It is his third stint with the Reds this season, his first in the majors. Winker, 23, was a sandwich pick after the fist round of the 2012 draft. RHP Sal Romano, who got his first major league victory at Colorado on Thursday, was optioned to Triple-A Louisville on Friday, but manager Bryan Price said he could rejoin the rotation after the All-Star break. He would be eligible to return July 17, the fourth game after the break.  I think it's very likely you'll see him pitching the fourth or fifth game of the second half of the season,  Price said. Romano gave up two runs and six hits in five innings of a 6-3 victory. He struck out six. RHP Hunter Greene, the second overall pick in the 2017 June draft, agreed to sign for a $7.23 million bonus on Friday, final day drafted players could sign. Greene, who also played the shortstop at Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks, Calif., is expected to join the Reds' Billings affiliate in the rookie Pioneer League.  I don't think it's exaggerating that it came down to seconds, not minutes,  general manager Dick Williams said. The Reds have said Greene will begin his career as a pitcher but could be used as an occasional designated hitter. LHP Brandon Finnegan (left shoulder) underwent labrum surgery on his non-throwing shoulder Friday after suffering the injury when he attempted to jump from a boat onto a dock, manager Bryan Price said. Finnegan is expected to miss 4-6 months. He has been on the disabled list twice this season because of a strained teres muscle.

In Iowa, he has gone 2-1 with one save and a 3.00 ERA in 21 appearances -- 19 in relief and two as a starter. RHP Jake Arrieta (8-6, 4.33 ERA) makes his 18th start of the season and just his sixth at home in Saturday's middle game of a series against the Pirates. He had his best outing of the season in his last start on July 2 in Cincinnati, holding the Reds to one hit in seven shutout innings in the Cubs' 6-2 victory. It was the fewest hits allowed since he no-hit Cincinnati on April 21, 2016, and his fist scoreless outing since Sept. 23, 2016, against St. Louis. Arrieta is 1-0 with a 4.35 ERA in two starts against the Pirates this season. 1B Anthony Rizzo slammed a two-run homer in the fifth inning for his 20th home run of the season. It's the fifth straight season he has had 20-plus and third time with at least 20 before the All-Star break. His 22 career homers against the Pirates are tied for his most against any team. He also has 22 against the Reds. LHP Jack Leathersich was optioned to Triple-A Iowa on Friday. The move came less than 24 hours after he allowed two runs, four hits and four walks in two-thirds of an inning against Milwaukee, his first big league appearance. Leathersich is 0-2 with a 4.56 ERA in 22 relief outings with Iowa this season, including a 0.64 ERA in his last 10 appearances. 3B Kris Bryant went 4-for-5 with two home runs, a triple and a single on Friday against the Pirates. It was his first Wrigley Field homers since June 8 against Colorado. He's now had 10 career multi-homer games and it was his fourth with at least four hits and two homers. Bryant is now batting .384 with 15 doubles, a triple, 10 homers and 34 RBIs in 44 career games against Pittsburgh.

RHP Eddie Butler had a no-decision in his 11th start of the season on Friday against the Pittsburgh Pirates. But he did have his third scoreless outing, although it was also his fifth of fewer than five innings pitched.  I would have liked to have been more effective with my pitches, but I was able to do enough to keep us there, knotted a zero for a while,  Butler said.","keywords":"Anthony Rizzo,Dylan Floro,Eddie Butler,Jack Leathersich,Jake Arrieta,Kris Bryant,BBO,CUBS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-08 13:01:00","news_title":"Chicago Cubs - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-playerwatch-idUSMTZED78S79P2U"}

Siegrist pitched an inning and gave up a hit while fanning one and throwing 13 of 16 pitches for strikes. RHP Carlos Martinez struggled for the second straight start against an National League East opponent. Unable to marry velocity with location, Martinez gave up seven hits and five runs in five innings, walking three and fanning four. One of the team's two All-Stars, Martinez is 0-3 in his last four starts and is the first St. Louis pitcher since Shelby Miller in 2014 to lose eight games before the All-Star break. RHP Adam Wainwright makes the start Saturday when St. Louis continues its weekend series with the New York Mets in Busch Stadium. He's coming off a 14-6 win over Miami on Monday night in which he rolled through four scoreless innings and then coughed up six runs in the fifth, although he did qualify for his ninth victory.

This will be his first career start against the Cardinals. RHP Jacob deGrom allowed four homers in a game for the first time in his career Friday night -- and still emerged with his fifth consecutive victory. All four homers were solos, so deGrom was able to maneuver around them to work seven innings, giving up eight hits and four runs with no walks and five strikeouts.

All things considered he gave us seven innings when it looked like he might give us four, and really should have given up one run,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  There are times when he doesn't have his good stuff, and he ends up pitching like that. For a young kid, he's come a long way and now he's able to battle and get through tough stretches. He pitched well enough to win that game, for sure.  2B Marcus Semien hit a two-run double Friday in his second game since coming off the disabled list. Semien had missed 74 games since April 15 with a broken scaphoid bone.  Any time you came back it's going to be a little rusty to start, I think he felt that way (Thursday),  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  I think (Friday) he looked a lot more comfortable. You know, your first game back it's going to be shake off the cobwebs a little bit, minor leagues are minor leagues. But I think he looked and felt a lot better.  CF Rajai Davis allowed Seattle to score the go-ahead run with one out in the third inning Friday on Kyle Seager's shallow fly ball with the bases loaded. Mariners 2B Robinson Cano, who has been nursing a sore quad, tagged from third and scored to make it 3-2 on the sacrifice fly as Davis double-pumped before throwing in the ball.  He just thought there were two outs,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Davis. RHP Chris Smith, 36, admits when he got the call to start Saturday for the A's, he thought someone had made a mistake. He was summoned into the office of Triple-A Nashville manager Ryan Christenson with the Sounds playing in Colorado Springs and told he wouldn't be starting Friday's Pacific Coast League game.  He told me I wasn't going to throw Friday, but throw Saturday in Seattle,  Smith said.   I'm like, ‘What? They know I've never started a game in the big leagues in my life? Sure they've got the right guy?' He checked the e-mail and said, ‘Yes, you idiot.'  And that's how Smith, a veteran of 15 professional seasons with 63 career relief appearances in the major leagues, learned of his first start. RF Matt Joyce went 1-for-2 and was hit by a pitch Friday. Joyce has reached base safely in 26 of his past 27 games, including 15 in a row. He's batting .275 during the streak with four home runs and eight RBIs.","keywords":"Bob Melvin,Chris Smith,Kyle Seager,Marcus Semien,Matt Joyce,Rajai Davis,Robinson Cano,Ryan Christenson,Sean Manaea,BBO,ATHLETICS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-08 13:01:00","news_title":"Oakland Athletics - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED78S79P2K"}
{"content":"INF Shawn O'Malley, on the 60-day DL recovering from appendix surgery, is scheduled to begin his rehab Saturday as DH in an Arizona League game. An August return to the Mariners is possible. RHP Sam Gaviglio, who took the loss Thursday against Oakland, was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma. The rookie is 3-4 with a 4.31 ERA in 11 appearances this season, including 10 starts. Manager Scott Servais said the move was planned even before Gaviglio's last start, in which he lasted a season-low 4 2/3 innings, because he wouldn't be needed until the fifth game after the All-Star break, July 18 at Houston. RHP Emilio Pagan was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma after long reliever Yovani Gallardo pitched 7 1/3 innings over the previous three games. In two stints with the Mariners this season, Pagan is 0-1 with a 4.22 ERA. He pitched four scoreless innings in each of his past two major league games, allowing a total of just one hit. 1B Danny Valencia went 3-for-4 Friday against his former Oakland team. Valencia has eight games with three or more hits this season, tied with LF Ben Gamel for the second-most on the team. LHP James Paxton (7-3) allowed just two runs on two hits in seven innings and matched his season-high with nine strikeouts Friday.  Paxton was really good. He turned up the dial,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  That's what ace-type pitchers do.  Before the game, Servais announced Paxton is scheduled to pitch the first game out of the All-Star break, Friday in Chicago against the White Sox. RHP Nick Vincent pitched a perfect eighth inning Friday. He hasn't allowed a run in 18 innings at home this season, spanning 19 appearances. DH Nelson Cruz hit his 300th career home run as the Mariners snapped an eight-game home losing streak by beating Oakland 7-2 Friday night.  It's special,  said Cruz, who drove in five runs to take the major league lead with 68 RBIs this season.  It's a long way from the Dominican. Never in my dreams would I hit 300 home runs in the big leagues.  2B Robinson Cano was named to the American League All-Star team as an injury replacement, his eighth career selection for the All-Star Game and third with the Mariners. Cano is batting .279 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs.  I'm happy for him, he's very deserving of it,  manager Scott Servais said.  His first-half numbers deserve to be there. The game is for the elite and he's one of them. It's a great honor to be among the best in the world.

The last Detroit player to lead the league in triples was OF Austin Jackson, with 10 in 2012. DH Victor Martinez slapped a single to left field in the second inning for the 2,000th hit of his career. Ironically, he got it against the Indians, for whom he got the first 900 hits of his career.  That's special. There aren't a lot of people who can say they've done that,  said manager Brad Ausmus. Only eight other active players in the majors have 2,000 hits: Ichiro Suzuki (3,054), Adrian Beltre (2,975), Albert Pujols (2,901), Carlos Beltran (2,681), Miguel Cabrera (2,589) Robinson Cano (2,295), Matt Holliday (2,056), and Jose Reyes (2,030). RHP Justin Verlander will start Saturday's game, his second consecutive start against Cleveland. His last start against the Indians was ugly. In an 11-8 loss to the Indians on July 2, Verlander gave up seven runs on nine hits, with three walks and no strikeouts. Verlander has more starts (52) and more losses (career record: 20-23) against Cleveland than against any other major league team. RHP Jordan Zimmermann pitched just three innings, his shortest start of the season and his shortest outing since pitching one inning in a start against Baltimore on Sept. 10, 2016. In his three innings of work, Zimmermann gave up five runs on eight hits.  When he is inconsistent, it's usually because of a lack of movement on his slider, and that was the case tonight,  said Manager Brad Ausmus.

When you look at his workload the last two years, the fact that he missed a month this year with a back strain, and because we're playing Sunday night, he won't arrive in Miami until four o'clock Monday morning, we just felt it made sense for him not to pitch,  Indians president Chris Antonetti said. 1B Carlos Santana is expected to rejoin the Indians on Saturday. The Indians will have to make a move to get Santana back on the roster. He was placed on the Paternity List on July 5. RHP Danny Salazar made his second minor league rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Columbus. In a 21-1 Columbus loss to Indianapolis, Salazar started and pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up three runs on three hits, all of them home runs, with four strikeouts and two walks.  Hopefully that was a step forward for him,  said Indians president Chris Antonetti.  His velocity was good, but there are still some inconsistencies in the mechanics of his delivery he needs to work on.  Salazar has been on the disabled list since June 6 with right shoulder soreness. RHP Carlos Carrasco struck out the side on nine pitches in the fifth inning, fanning 3B Nicholas Castellanos, CF Mike Mahtook and SS Jose Iglesias consecutively.  When you see big-league hitters missing the ball by five feet, that means he's doing something right,  said SS Francisco Lindor of Carrasco. LHP Andrew Miller said Indians players are relieved and excited that manager Terry Francona's health problems have been addressed and that he'll be rejoining the team in a week. Francona underwent a successful cardiac ablation procedure on Thursday at the Cleveland Clinic to correct an irregular heartbeat. After a week of rest and recovery, Francona is scheduled to return to the team on July 14.  Selfishly. we want him back. He's a big part of the mood in the clubhouse and the way things go,  said Miller.  I'm happy he's getting this sorted out. You could tell he wasn't quite right and it was kind of eating at him.  OF Michael Brantley might be the most excited of the five Cleveland players selected for the All-Star team. Brantley made the team after missing virtually all of last season with a shoulder injury. It was a long road back, and his All-Star selection validates that journey.  There were some dark days, some long nights,  he said.  Nothing was guaranteed, not even coming out of spring training. I didn't know if I was going to make the opening day roster. But it all paid off. The shoulder's doing great.

Hildenberger relieved starter Felix Jorge with the Twins down 6-0. He allowed just two hits and struck out three batters. He's now pitched 7 1/3 scoreless in four games to start his career. RHP Felix Jorge was optioned to Double-A Chattanooga after Friday's start as the Twins recalled OF Zack Granite.  Jorge's second major league start didn't go as well as his debut. He allowed six runs on seven hits and a walk in 2 2/3 innings against Baltimore. Jorge (10.57 ERA) had earned a win against Kansas City in his debut while making a spot start in a doubleheader. OF Zack Granite was recalled from Triple-A Rochester following Friday's game. Granite will be making his major league debut after hitting .360 with 14 doubles, four triples, three home runs, 24 RBIs, 40 runs scored and 15 stolen bases in 59 games this season for Rochester. He was recently named the International League player of the month for June and a Triple-A All-Star. Granite will miss the All-Star game after being recalled.

RHP Bartolo Colon was signed to a minor-league contract by the Minnesota Twins. Colon could possibly become a starting option as Minnesota has struggled at the back end of its rotation this season. Colon, who was 2-8 with an 8.14 ERA in 13 starts for Atlanta, will report to Triple-A Rochester to make a few starts. Coincidentally, Twins manager Paul Molitor faced Colon in his final game in 1998. Molitor was 2-for-8 against Colon in his career. 1B Joe Mauer was placed on the 10-day disabled list, the team announced Friday. Mauer has missed the past two games and was diagnosed with a lumbar strain in his lower back. The move was made retroactive to Wednesday.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton set his sights on second place after Saturday's Austrian Grand Prix qualifying left the Mercedes title contender languishing in eighth on the starting grid for Sunday's race. A winner three times so far this season, and in Austria last year, the triple world champion told reporters he was thinking only as far as the second step of the podium after a penalty for a gearbox change dropped him five places. His team mate Valtteri Bottas will start from pole position, for the second time in his Formula One career, with Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel joining the Finn on the front row. Vettel leads Hamilton by 14 points after eight races and looks likely to extend that advantage in Austria.    I will do the best job I can. Obviously, I want to get up there and try and get a one-two with Valtteri so I will do the best job I can to get further up,  said Hamilton, who will start on the slower supersoft tyres.  It makes no sense for Valtteri to slow down,  he added when asked whether the Finn might slow the pace at the front to give Hamilton an advantage with tyres that will enable him to do a longer opening stint than his rivals.

It makes sense for him to push as hard as he can to win the race,  said Hamilton. Bottas, who is third overall and 28 points behind Hamilton, said the Mercedes pre-race strategy notes did not envisage any action on his part to help Hamilton.  We need to focus on having a good start of the race and we need to win the race. And for sure Lewis can fight back from where he’s starting,  he said.  If you start playing games like that here it's quite tricky... it only needs one mistake and you can lose the win. So I'm not planning on that at the moment.  Hamilton qualified ninth in Austria in 2014 and finished second behind then-team mate Nico Rosberg -- with Bottas third for Williams -- but, as the Briton pointed out, Mercedes enjoyed a greater performance advantage then. Sunday, he said, would be mostly about damage limitation. The chance of rain over the Red Bull Ring could help him, however, given his record of shining in slippery conditions.

{"content":"(Corrects full name of former Spanish prime minister in 12th paragraph.) By Brian Ellsworth and Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, July 8 (Reuters) - Venezuela's best-known jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was out of prison and hugging his family on Saturday after being granted house arrest following three years in jail for leading anti-government protests. Lopez's return to his Caracas home comes as Venezuela is once again convulsed by demonstrations against socialist President Nicolas Maduro, struggling with an economic crisis and global censure for overriding the powers of the country's opposition-led congress. Lopez, 46, a photogenic, Harvard-educated former mayor who has been barred from holding elected office, left the Ramo Verde military jail before dawn and was reunited with his wife and two young children, relatives said.  A few days ago they had punished him with solitary confinement without light or water for three days,  said his father, of the same name, in an interview with Spanish radio.  (Now) he's hugging his children, he's with his wife ... I'm happy, he's happy of course,  he added, adding that his son was wearing an electronic tag for authorities to track him. The opposition has long called Lopez a political prisoner, and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have pressed for his release. Maduro, who for years refused to pardon Lopez, has described him as a dangerous terrorist who sought to overthrow him through street violence. Government supporters often note Lopez's role in a short-lived 2002 coup against the late former leader Hugo Chavez when he helped arrest a minister. Venezuela's Supreme Court said Lopez had been granted house arrest due to health problems, but his family members were unable to identify what those were. Opposition leaders applauded Lopez's return home, but said he should be granted complete freedom, along with several hundred other jailed opponents of Maduro. The government says all imprisoned activists are being held on legitimate charges, including coup-plotting. State ombudsman Tarek Saab said in an interview with CNN that the measure was the result of efforts by a state-backed truth commission, which he said is also studying the release of other citizens detained amid protests. The release was aided in part by the involvement of former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has for years maintained talks with Venezuela's government, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told reporters at the G20 meeting in Hamburg. Supporters Gather The president could be seeking to ease pressure with Lopez's return to home, but there was no sign of concessions to the opposition on other fronts. At Maduro's behest, Venezuela on July 30 will elect a legislative superbody that can rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions, a move the opposition calls a naked power grab meant to keep the socialists in office against the will of the people. Dozens of supporters stood outside Lopez's home in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes, some wearing shirts emblazoned with Lopez's face. Lopez's mother Antonieta arrived, beaming and dressed in white. About 100 people were gathered outside the house, waving Venezuela's flag, chanting slogans and setting off fireworks to celebrate.  I think this is the first day of the transition,  said Maria Antonieta Witzka, 57, a physical therapist.  The government is realizing that we are the majority.  Lopez has faced criticism even within the opposition for at times being quick-tempered and domineering. He founded the Popular Will party after splitting with leaders of the First Justice party, which he also helped found. Though Lopez had publicly called for peaceful resistance to Maduro in 2014 and was behind bars during most of the unrest that year which killed 43 people, prosecutors said his speeches sent subliminal messages and constituted a call to violence. He was sentenced to nearly 14 years. One of the prosecutors who led the case later fled the country and said the proceeding had been a mockery of justice. The case has long been a cause celebre for opposition supporters over what they deem the Maduro government's trampling of human rights. Lopez is the scion of wealthy families and a direct descendant of the sister of Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar as well as of Venezuela's first president, Cristobal Mendoza. Pro-government critics paint Lopez as a dangerous radical in the pocket of Venezuela's wealthy elite and the U.S. government. He has ambitions to become Venezuela's president and would likely be one of the most popular opposition aspirants in any future election.

In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaii's attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Court's ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Court's opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trump's policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Court's ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trump's guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Lebanese military prosecutor ordered forensics to examine the bodies of four Syrians who died in army custody last week following calls for an inquiry by rights groups, a judge said on Saturday. The four, who the army said had died due to chronic illness, were among several hundred people arrested in a raid at Syrian refugee camps in the Arsal area of northeastern Lebanon. The Lebanese Center for Human Rights said torture had led to the deaths of at least four detainees. The Syrian National Coalition -- a Turkey-based opposition group -- said 10 people had died in custody, some as the result of torture, and 19 others had died in the raid around Arsal town. A military source denied the allegations, which prompted Lebanon's human rights minister to call for an investigation into the deaths this week. New York-based Human Rights Watch also demanded an independent probe, saying anyone responsible for wrongdoing should be held to account. Judge Dany Zeeny said on Saturday three doctors appointed by military prosecutor, Judge Sakr Sakr, had taken samples from the bodies on Friday to a medical laboratory in Beirut. The army said five suicide attackers blew themselves up while attacking soldiers during last week's raid, killing one civilian. Lebanon's military has received hundreds of millions in military assistance from the United States and Britain in recent years, as part of efforts to bolster Lebanon against a threat from militants across the Syrian border. The Lebanese army says it regularly stages operations targeting Islamic State and former al Qaeda-linked militants in the mountainous border region near Arsal. A U.S. State Department official said Washington was committed to helping the army  secure Lebanon's borders... and maintain overall security.   We have seen reports of Syrians who recently died while in custody of the Lebanese army and look forward to an official investigation into these deaths,  the official added. More than one million registered refugees fleeing the six-year Syrian war have poured into Lebanon, a quarter of its population, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The number is widely put at closer to 1.5 million refugees.

{"content":"ROME (Reuters) - Italian police said on Saturday they had arrested a Chechen man suspected of being a militant of Islamic State and involvement in attacks in the Chechen capital Grozny in 2014. The 38-year-old man is accused of crimes of international terrorism and is now in prison in the south Italian town of Foggia, a police statement said.  The man, called Eli Bombataliev according to a court document, is believed to be linked with 2014 clashes in the capital of Russia's southern province of Chechnya, in which media offices and a school were burnt and which left at least 20 dead, the police said. The investigations started out of a collaboration with Belgium, where the man was part of a network of people who recruited foreign fighters.   The moment (he) left (Russia) he started wandering in Europe, counting on the fact that he had a refugee status... he then reached Syria where he fought between 2014 and 2015,   prosecuting magistrate Giuseppe Gatti, who worked on the case, said in a televised news conference.   Some 450 people have left Belgium to fight in Syria and Iraq, the highest country contribution in Europe on a per capita basis. Returning Syria fighters have also been involved in militant attacks in Belgium, France and elsewhere in Europe. Bombataliev, based at an Islamic cultural center in Foggia,  was involved in indoctrinating and radicalizing potential new foreign fighters, the document added.   The police also expelled from the country two Albanian brothers, aged 26 and 23, and a 49-year-old Russian woman, who then later became Bombatiliev's second wife.  All three were being indoctrinated and trained by Bombataliev.  He frequently told his wife that he could not have a family because he was ready to sacrifice himself, and was waiting for an order to do so,  prosecutor Giuseppe Volpe told reporters.     The police added that the investigations were led by the country's special operations police as part of a broader effort to search for foreign fighters from Chechnya.

{"content":"STATION DES ROUSSES, France (Reuters) - Lilian Calmejane fought off a bout of cramp to claim a solo win in the eighth stage of the Tour de France on Saturday, as the overall favorites stayed quiet on the eve of a punishing day in the Jura mountains. The 24-year-old Calmejane, in only his second year as a professional, dropped his breakaway companions in the last climb of the day and despite cramping up in the closing stages, held off Dutchman Robert Gesink for a second grand tour stage win. Another Frenchman, Guillaume Martin (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), took third place. Britain's Chris Froome had a minor scare when he went off the road in a descent, but the Team Sky rider kept his cool in sweltering heat to retain the overall leader's yellow jersey.  Me and (team mate) Geraint (Thomas) took the wrong trajectory in a corner and we went off the road, it happens sometimes,  said Froome. Thomas crashed but he was quickly back on his bike. Calmejane of Direct Energie kept his strategy close to his chest in the day's breakaway, but barely looked back after pulling away in the 11.7-km climb to La Combe de Laisia. Gesink (LottoNL-Jumbo) chased hard but the Frenchman had too much power in the finale.

{"content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A firm part-owned by Germany's Siemens has been hired to help install electricity turbines in Crimea, a region subject to European Union sanctions barring EU firms from supplying it with energy technology, three sources close to the project told Reuters. Reuters exclusively reported earlier this week, citing sources with knowledge of the delivery, that Russia had delivered Siemens-made turbines to Crimea for use in two power plants under construction there. Siemens has denied it supplied any turbines to Crimea. In a statement issued on Friday, it said that if one of its customers had, in violation of the sales contract, re-routed any turbines to Crimea, the company  will not provide any deliveries or services for installation, commissioning support, or warranty.  However, the three sources said that one of the firms involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea is Russian-registered ZAO Interautomatika. Siemens has a 45.7 percent stake in the firm, according to public records. According to its website, the systems that Interautomatika offers to clients  are based on the use of technology that is produced by Siemens, or under license from Siemens.   On Siemens' Russian language website, Interautomatika is described as a  Solution Partner  to the German firm. Asked about the involvement of Interautomatika in the Crimea power plants project, a Siemens spokesman said in a statement provided to Reuters:  Siemens stands by its earlier position that no gas-turbine warranty, installation and commissioning support services will be provided.   We are investigating the involvement of Interautomatika in the commissioning of gas turbines and any other services and if proven true, we will take all necessary and available steps to terminate any activities as soon as possible.  Technopromexport, the Russian state-owned firm which is building the two power plants, declined to answer questions about the issue. Interautomatika did not immediately respond to Reuters questions. Reuters has not been able to determine if Siemens knew of or approved of the delivery of the turbines, or the role of Interautomatika in the power plant projects. The turbines, and the role of Interautomatika, expose the Germany company to potential accusations of insufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, some legal experts say. In its statement on Friday, Siemens said it had no credible evidence about actual deliveries of its turbines to Crimea but had set up a task force to clarify the facts. It said it had taken all possible legal measures and would take operational steps to prevent the equipment from being used unlawfully. Prestige Project  The Kremlin wants to get the two Crimean power plants up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents after it was annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014. The Siemens-made turbines are a vital component because they are the only ones that fit into the foundations already laid for the power plants, and Russian firms are not able to manufacture comparable equipment on their own. Technopromexport, the main contractor on the project, said on Thursday that it bought the turbines on the secondary market. It did not disclose the seller or the manufacturer of the turbines. It said they had been modernized by specialized Russian factories and engineering companies which it did not name. Delivering the turbines to the site of the power stations is only the start of a complex process to get them running. They are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment packed with electronics and running off specialist software. They therefore require specialist engineers to install and commission them.  One of the three sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said a contract had been signed under which Interautomatika, together with other Russian firms, would provide commissioning services for the turbines in Crimea.  The source did not say when the contract with Interautomatika was signed, or who awarded the contract.  Reuters was not able to find documents on the award of such a contract.  EU sanctions bar European individuals and companies from providing energy technology to Crimea or from taking any actions designed to circumvent those rules due to the bloc's view that the peninsula was illegally stolen from Ukraine.  Legal experts say there are no court precedents to say whether Siemens could be held responsible if a third party supplied the technology to Crimea.  The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on the delivery of the turbines. An EU source with knowledge of the issue said the EU has little ability to ensure compliance, leaving much of that to national governments. When asked about the delivery of the turbines on Wednesday, a spokesman for German's Ministry for Economic Affairs said he had no immediate comment. The other Interautomatika shareholders apart from Siemens are Technopromexport, with 17 percent, and VTI, a Russian power sector research institute, with 37 percent, according to the company's website.

Germany's Angela Merkel treated the leaders to a concert at Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie on Friday night, where they listened to Beethoven while their aides began an all night slog aimed bridging differences with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Chancellor Merkel, for whom the summit is an opportunity to show off her diplomatic skills ahead of a federal election in September, welcomed the first face-to-face meeting of Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. Their encounter, which began with a handshake and lasted over two hours, was one of the most eagerly anticipated meetings between two leaders in years.

Slideshow (28 Images)The latest draft communique sticks with language about the Paris climate accord being  irreversible  but removes a reference from an earlier version to a  global approach  that some countries felt could suggest there was a parallel track to Paris. It also includes a new paragraph which says the United States will  work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently . Some experts were skeptical whether leaders would approve the reference to fossil fuels, which would be a clear nod to Washington. As the leaders met on Friday, police said they were sending reinforcements from other parts of Germany to cope with thousands of anti-capitalist protesters who set fire to cars, rubbish bins and wooden pallets in violence that Hamburg's interior minister called  frightening .

Dozens of Iraqi soldiers celebrated amid the rubble on the banks of the Tigris river without waiting for a formal victory declaration, some dancing to music blaring out from a truck and firing machineguns into the air, a Reuters correspondent said. The mood was less festive, however, among some of the nearly one million Mosul residents displaced by months of combat, many of whom are living in camps outside the city with little respite from the blazing summer heat.

A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the eight-month campaign to wrest back Mosul, by far the largest city seized by Islamic State (IS) in 2014.  Almost exactly three years ago, the ultra-hardline group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared from Mosul a  caliphate  over adjoining parts of Iraq and Syria. 'Fighting for Every Meter' Members of the Emergency Response Division celebrate in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 8, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniDozens of IS insurgents were killed on Saturday and others tried to escape by swimming across Tigris, state TV said. Most of those making a last stand were foreigners, it added. Iraqi commanders say the militants were fighting for every meter with snipers, grenades and suicide bombers, forcing security forces to fight house-to-house in the densely populated maze of narrow alleyways.  The battle has reached the phase of chasing the insurgents in remaining blocks,  the Iraqi military media office said in a statement.  Some members of Daesh have surrendered,  it added, using an Arab acronym of Islamic State. The road where the soldiers celebrated was scarred with gaping holes from explosions and rubble from a flattened multi-storey shopping mall.  Slideshow (9 Images)Rubbish and ammunition boxes were strewn around and the only civilians seen were a group of about 15 women, children and elderly, some of them wounded, sheltering in a damaged petrol station. Security forces medics were giving them first aid.   Months of urban warfare has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up. Stripped of Mosul, Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live. The militants are expected to keep up attacks on selected targets across Iraq. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst-affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said. The fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and the Shi’ite majority that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade..  During their impromptu victory celebrations, some of the Iraqi soldiers waved pictures of Hussein, the grand son of prophet Mohammed who is immensely revered by the Shi'ites. Mosul is a majority Sunni city who has long complained of being marginalized by the Shi'ite-led governments installed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq's regional Kurdish leader said this week that the government in Baghdad had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Measures are needed that will lead to a genuine ceasefire in Ukraine, and implementation of the Minsk agreements to end the conflict there has been too slow, the Kremlin said on Saturday. With Ukraine on the agenda, President Vladimir Putin earlier met with his counterparts from France and Germany, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, on the fringes of the G20 summit in Hamburg. Macron said he had no ready solution to the crisis, but that the three countries had had a  good discussion  about it.

We know how complicated the situation is on the ground, so we are negotiating.   Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was an understanding between the three countries that  effective measures should be taken, which would lead to real ceasefire on the frontline and to ensure military hardware withdrawal .  The Minsk accords are being implemented too slowly, serious disappointment is not concealed,  Peskov told reporters during a regular conference call. Macron said Normandy format talks involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine would probably take place in coming weeks.    Progress on implementing the Minsk peace accords in an eastern Ukrainian, negotiated by Berlin and Paris, has stalled. The agreement was designed to end a conflict that has killed thousands of people since April 2014.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese hospital treating Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo said on Saturday his cancer was in the final stages and while a German and a U.S. doctor who visited his bedside had approved of his treatment they had asked for him to be moved abroad. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in China's northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer and the hospital said it had invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment. In a short statement, the hospital said Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Markus W Büchler of Germany's University of Heidelberg had seen Liu on Saturday with the Chinese experts treating him. The team listened to his medical history, heard a report on his treatment, visited Liu and met his relatives and then discussed his illness, the hospital said.  The U.S. and German experts fully approved of the treatment by the national experts group and what they had done,  it said. The hospital said Liu had late-stage liver cancer which had  spread and was in its final stages, adding that it was looking at the medical options to improve his chances of survival. Calls have grown from rights groups, international bodies and western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife Liu Xia to be treated overseas. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoA source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters that Liu was compos mentis and spoke to the U.S. and German doctors in English.  He told them he still hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government has been very clear they won't allow this,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked how serious Liu's condition is at present and how long he might have to live, the source said:  It's very serious. I'm extremely worried .  The hospital's website posted four pictures of the consultation with the U.S. and German doctors, one of which showed both men bending over to talk to Liu as he lay in his sick bed. He gestured back to them with his left hand. A separate hospital statement cited both doctors as saying they hoped Liu could be treated abroad. A Chinese doctor, who it did not identify, responded that moving him would not be safe and asked what better treatment could be offered.  The U.S. and German experts answered: 'We also do not have a better way, you are already doing very well',  the statement said. In an emailed statement on behalf of Herman, the MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed he was in Shenyang to participate in the consultations on a visit facilitated by the U.S. State Department. It gave no details on Liu's condition. Büchler did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The hospital did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on Saturday evening.

{"content":"CAIRO, July 8 (Reuters) - Egypt aims to double production of its most famous export, the silky soft cotton once known as  white gold , after a period of slumping output, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said on Saturday. Hamed Abdel-Dayem told Reuters production should rise to 1.4 million qintar (160 kg) in the 2017-18 fiscal year that started in July from 700,000 qintar a year earlier. All the cotton will be exported. The government aims to increase the price of the long staple cotton to more than 3000 Egyptian pounds ($168.07) per qintar, which will all be exported, the spokesman said. Production of the cotton, used in luxury bedding, has fallen sharply since 2011, a year of political upheaval that coincided with looser regulations that degraded the quality of local cotton. Egypt's sunny skies and superior seed help it grow a cotton known for unusually long fibres that produce a light durable fabric with an attractive sheen and soft touch. Long-staple sells at 155 U.S. cents per lb, about twice the price of common short-staple cotton. Its return to world markets could provide a lucrative export opportunity at a time when Egypt has a huge trade deficit and is seeking to relaunch its stagnant economy. In 2016 Egypt banned all but the highest quality cotton seed, dramatically shrinking the area under cultivation but restoring quality, in a bid to save its historic crop. This year Egypt grew about 220,000 acres (89,000 hectares) of long-staple cotton compared with 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares) in 2016-2107, Abdel-Dayem said. Farmers, spinners, and exporters say the weakness of the Egyptian pound following its flotation in November and a scandal over the alleged sale of falsely labelled Egyptian cotton have increased demand for the real thing, injecting life into a historic industry on its deathbed.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria, July 8 (Reuters) - Ferrari will trial a new transparent frontal protection cockpit 'shield' in British Grand Prix practice at Silverstone next week, Formula One's governing body said on Saturday. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said the aim was to carry out a first full track test at Italy's Monza circuit in September. Silverstone will allow drivers to give initial feedback early in the development process, however. The shield is an open canopy in front of the driver and made from polycarbonate, a tough but see-through thermoplastic polymer. The aim is to protect the driver's head from flying debris without obstructing his vision. The FIA has been focusing on that concept rather than a previously tested 'halo' cockpit protection system that was extensively tested last season to a mixed response from teams and drivers. Cockpit protection is seen as a key area following fatalities in other series where drivers were hit by wheels and flying debris. While the FIA said in January that the safety benefit of the halo had been established, some leading F1 figures were wary about dramatic changes to the look of the cars.  A possible geometry has been developed and the FIA is currently working with teams in Formula One on further defining its geometry,  the FIA said, with an image of the shield published on its website.

{"content":"MOSUL/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State militants vowed to  fight to the death  in Mosul on Saturday as Iraqi military commanders said they would take full control of the city from the insurgents at any moment. Dozens of Iraqi soldiers celebrated amid the rubble on the banks of the Tigris river without waiting for a formal victory declaration, some dancing to music blaring out from a truck and firing machineguns into the air, a Reuters correspondent said. The mood was less festive, however, among some of the nearly one million Mosul residents displaced by months of combat, many of whom are living in camps outside the city with little respite from the blazing summer heat.  If there is no rebuilding and people don't return to their homes and regain their belongings, what is the meaning of liberation?  Mohammed Haji Ahmed, 43, a clothing trader, told Reuters in the Hassan Sham camp to the east of Mosul.  Earlier on Saturday, a military spokesman said the insurgents' defense lines were collapsing, state television reported.  We are seeing now the last meters (yards) and then final victory will be announced,  a presenter said, citing correspondents embedded with security forces fighting in Islamic State's redoubt in the Old City by the Tigris.  It's a matter of hours,  she added. But Islamic State's Amaq news agency reported  fierce fighting  around the riverside district of Maydan and said its fighters  were holding onto their fortified positions.   Related CoverageWith Mosul victory at hand, displaced residents ponder uncertain future The fighters of Islamic State are collectively pledging (to fight to the) death in Maydan,  Amaq said in another online post. Artillery explosions and gunfire could still be heard during Saturday afternoon and a column of smoke billowed over the Old City riverside, the Reuters correspondent said. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the eight-month campaign to wrest back Mosul, by far the largest city seized by Islamic State (IS) in 2014.  Almost exactly three years ago, the ultra-hardline group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared from Mosul a  caliphate  over adjoining parts of Iraq and Syria. 'Fighting for Every Meter' Members of the Emergency Response Division celebrate in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 8, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniDozens of IS insurgents were killed on Saturday and others tried to escape by swimming across Tigris, state TV said. Most of those making a last stand were foreigners, it added. Iraqi commanders say the militants were fighting for every meter with snipers, grenades and suicide bombers, forcing security forces to fight house-to-house in the densely populated maze of narrow alleyways.  The battle has reached the phase of chasing the insurgents in remaining blocks,  the Iraqi military media office said in a statement.  Some members of Daesh have surrendered,  it added, using an Arab acronym of Islamic State. The road where the soldiers celebrated was scarred with gaping holes from explosions and rubble from a flattened multi-storey shopping mall.  Slideshow (9 Images)Rubbish and ammunition boxes were strewn around and the only civilians seen were a group of about 15 women, children and elderly, some of them wounded, sheltering in a damaged petrol station. Security forces medics were giving them first aid.   Months of urban warfare has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up. Stripped of Mosul, Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live. The militants are expected to keep up attacks on selected targets across Iraq. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst-affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said. The fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and the Shi’ite majority that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade..  During their impromptu victory celebrations, some of the Iraqi soldiers waved pictures of Hussein, the grand son of prophet Mohammed who is immensely revered by the Shi'ites. Mosul is a majority Sunni city who has long complained of being marginalized by the Shi'ite-led governments installed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq's regional Kurdish leader said this week that the government in Baghdad had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.

{"content":"MUZAFFARABAD/SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Seven people were killed in Kashmir in cross-border shelling by both Pakistan and India on Saturday, officials on both sides of the frontier said, as the anniversary of a militant's killing raised tensions in the disputed region. The violence occurred as hundreds of militants and political activists took to the streets in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir to commemorate the death of Burhan Wani, a militant killed by the army after urging the region's mainly Muslim population to rise up against Indian forces. A Reuters witness saw protesters holding Pakistani flags and banners and shouting slogans lauding the sacrifice of Wani and others, while pledging to carry on the holy war in Indian-administered Kashmir.  Jihad is our path, freedom is our destination,  they shouted while holding up portraits of the slain militant. In Indian-controlled Kashmir, another Reuters witness saw demonstrators wearing face masks throwing stones at police in downtown Srinagar, the region's summer capital. Police retaliated with teargas and stones thrown using slingshots. Indian authorities blocked internet access in Kashmir on Friday and sealed off his home town after Wani's supporters said they would stage demonstrations to mark the anniversary. Five people died on Pakistan's side of the disputed border and 10 were wounded in cross-border shelling, local police officials told Reuters.

Although Hamilton has accepted the apology and said he still has  the utmost respect  for Vettel, he refused to play along when asked to shake hands with his rival in post-qualifying interviews. Television images showed, however, that he and Vettel had done so unprompted after they stepped out of their cars in the pit lane.  The car was really good.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to carry out a new test of its THAAD missile defense system against an intermediate-range ballistic missile in the coming days, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Friday, as tensions with North Korea climb. Despite being planned months ago, the U.S. missile defense test will gain significance in the wake of North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4 that has heightened concerns about the threat from Pyongyang. The test will be the first of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to defend against a simulated attack by an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), one of the officials said. The THAAD interceptors will be fired from Alaska. The United States has THAAD interceptors in Guam that are meant to help guard against a missile attack from a country such as North Korea. The officials who disclosed to Reuters the precise nature and timing of the upcoming test spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked by Reuters, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) confirmed that it aimed to carry out a THAAD flight test  in early July.  Chris Johnson, an MDA spokesman, said the THAAD weapon system at the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska in Kodiak, Alaska, would  detect, track and engage a target with a THAAD interceptor.   The test is designated as Flight Test THAAD (FTT)-18,  Johnson said. He did not elaborate.  Still, in recent testimony to Congress, Vice Admiral James Syring, then the director of the Missile Defense Agency, said  FTT-18 would aim to demonstrate THAAD's ability to intercept a separating IRBM target. MDA said THAAD had a 100 percent successful track record in its 13 flight tests since 2006. After previous tests, the U.S. military has publicly disclosed the results. South Korean Deployment THAAD is a ground-based missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is seen in Seongju, South Korea, June 13, 2017. Picture taken on June 13, 2017.Kim Hong-JiLockheed Martin Corp, the prime contractor for the THAAD system, said it has the ability to intercept incoming missiles both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere. This year's U.S. deployment of THAAD in South Korea to guard against North Korea's shorter-range missiles has also drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system's powerful radar can probe deep into its territory. Earlier this month Moscow and Beijing, in a joint statement, called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of THAAD in South Korea. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the region.   THAAD's success rate in testing is far higher than the one for America's Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), the system specifically designed to shoot down an ICBM headed for the U.S. mainland. That GMD system has only a 55 percent success rate over the life of the program. But advocates note that the technology has improved dramatically in recent years.  In a key development, the GMD system successfully shot down an incoming, simulated North Korean ICBM in a test in May.   That led the Pentagon to upgrade its assessment of America's ability to defend against a small number of ICBMs, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. MDA told Congress in June that it plans to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, for a total of 210 since May 2011. In a sign of U.S. congressional concern about missile defense, several lawmakers filed amendments to a sweeping defense policy bill on Friday that addressed North Korea. Republican Representative Don Young, whose home state Alaska is seen as especially vulnerable to the North Korea threat, asked for more ground-based interceptors for his state, and a study of potential additional sites on the East Coast or Midwest.

{"content":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian state firms are courting foreign pension funds by offering a share in future revenue from toll roads, power stations and other infrastructure projects, as part of a presidential drive to secure $10 billion in additional inflows. The state budget is not enough to fund President Joko Widodo's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, a sprawling archipelago where the costs of moving goods around are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return. Positive Initial Response An official drives a motorcycle during an inspection at a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Salatiga, Central Java province, Indonesia June 8, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.  Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSIndonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk (JSMR.JK), has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   State-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia June 15, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra  via REUTERSPLN [PLNEG.UL] decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Varian added, however, that liquidity may be boosted over time partly because domestic pension funds and insurance firms are required to have a certain portion of investments in government bonds or infrastructure-linked securities.

{"content":"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - A ceasefire deal agreed for southwestern Syria is a positive development that could help prop up the political process aimed at ending the country's six-year war, the U.N. Deputy Special Envoy for Syria said on Saturday.  This is a step in the right direction,  Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy told reporters in Damascus. The United States, Russia and Jordan reached a ceasefire and  de-escalation agreement  for southwestern Syria set to take effect on Sunday. The announcement came after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit of major economies. Previous ceasefires have failed to hold for long and it was not clear how much the actual combatants in the area - Syrian government forces and the main rebel groups in the southwest - are committed to this latest effort.  All of this leads to supporting the political process,  Ramzy said after meeting with government officials about U.N.-based peace talks that open in Geneva next week.   This development helps create the appropriate environment for the talks,  he added, expressing hope that agreements would be reached for other parts of Syria as well. Among other issues, the latest round of U.N. peace talks, due to start on Monday, will include  continuing technical negotiations about the constitutional and legal matters related to the political process,  Ramzy said.

{"content":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Two U.S. supersonic bombers conducted live-fire drills on Saturday in South Korea in a show of force following North Korea's test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the South's military said. The pair of B-1B Lancer strategic bombers flew from a U.S. base on Guam and were joined by U.S. and South Korean jet fighters to conduct the simulated destruction of an enemy ballistic missile launcher and underground facilities, the South's air force said. North Korea announced on Tuesday it successfully test-launched an ICBM, saying the missile was capable of carrying a large and heavy nuclear warhead. Some experts believe the missile has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and the test signaled a significant advance in the North's declared intent to build a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the test indicated a quicker than expected pace of the North's ICBM program. The B-1B bombers conducted the live-fire exercise at a range in South Korea's eastern Gangwon province, dropping weapons in a simulated attack on a missile launcher, the South Korean air force said in a statement. South Korean and U.S. fighter jets conducted precision strike drills aimed at attacking enemy targets hidden underground, it said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the bombers then flew west, hugging the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border between the two Koreas, before leaving South Korean airspace. The drill follows a joint artillery and missile exercise by South Korean and U.S. forces a day after the North's ICBM test.

South Korean Air Force/Yonhap via REUTERSTrump Warning Despite the sabre-rattling, the United States and South Korea have said they are committed to resolving the crisis over the North's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile peacefully. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday in Hamburg, where the leaders of G20 nations are meeting, there would not be many good options left on North Korea if the peaceful pressure campaign failed. Slideshow (2 Images)U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to confront the North  very strongly  and said  Washington was considering  severe things  for the isolated state following the ICBM test.     The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution to put new sanctions on North Korea.  On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Trump, Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to apply  maximum pressure  to counter the North nuclear threat. North Korea has hailed the ICBM test as marking the completion of is strategic weapons capability that it says includes atomic and hydrogen bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a mausoleum honouring state founder Kim Il Sun on Saturday, the anniversary of his grandfather's death, the North's official KCNA news agency reported. He was joined by military officials who contributed to the success of the ICBM test, the news agency said.

{"content":"SPIELBERG, Austria (Reuters) - Formula One's new owners Liberty Media should buy Silverstone to end lingering uncertainty over the future of the British Grand Prix circuit and grow the sport, McLaren executive director Zak Brown said on Saturday. The American, speaking at the Austrian Grand Prix, added that he had conveyed that opinion to the commercial rights holders. The British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), which owns the former World Two airbase, is expected next week to activate for financial reasons a break clause in its contract to host the race.  My view is Liberty should buy Silverstone,  said Brown, a sports marketing expert who joined McLaren last year after former boss and shareholder Ron Dennis was ousted.  I have voiced my views on that (to Formula One Management). They listen and they will be quick to tell you if they disagree and they didn’t disagree with the logic,  he added.  But I wouldn’t want to put words in their mouths that that means they are going out and buying it now because I have no idea.  The BRDC fears that the current contract, with an annual rise in hosting fees agreed with previous F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, exposes them to a  potentially ruinous risk . They have argued that the break clause would allow for a renegotiation under more favorable terms. But there is also a risk that the race could fall off the calendar in 2019 and go elsewhere.   Silverstone, which hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause from 2019 that must be exercised two years in advance. Practice for this year's race starts next Friday.  I think Silverstone’s a great track,  said Brown, whose team is one of a majority in Formula One to be based in Britain.  I sympathize if with the escalator they can’t make money. We need to figure out a way for them to make money to either create new revenue streams or re-cut the deal.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese hospital treating Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo said on Saturday his cancer was in the final stages and while a German and a U.S. doctor who visited his bedside had approved of his treatment they had asked for him to be moved abroad. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in China's northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer and the hospital said it had invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment. In a short statement, the hospital said Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Markus W Büchler of Germany's University of Heidelberg had seen Liu on Saturday with the Chinese experts treating him. The team listened to his medical history, heard a report on his treatment, visited Liu and met his relatives and then discussed his illness, the hospital said.  The U.S. and German experts fully approved of the treatment by the national experts group and what they had done,  it said. The hospital said Liu had late-stage liver cancer which had  spread and was in its final stages, adding that it was looking at the medical options to improve his chances of survival. Calls have grown from rights groups, international bodies and western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife Liu Xia to be treated overseas. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoA source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters that Liu was compos mentis and spoke to the U.S. and German doctors in English.  He told them he still hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government has been very clear they won't allow this,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked how serious Liu's condition is at present and how long he might have to live, the source said:  It's very serious. I'm extremely worried .  The hospital's website posted four pictures of the consultation with the U.S. and German doctors, one of which showed both men bending over to talk to Liu as he lay in his sick bed. He gestured back to them with his left hand. A separate hospital statement cited both doctors as saying they hoped Liu could be treated abroad. A Chinese doctor, who it did not identify, responded that moving him would not be safe and asked what better treatment could be offered.  The U.S. and German experts answered: 'We also do not have a better way, you are already doing very well',  the statement said. In an emailed statement on behalf of Herman, the MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed he was in Shenyang to participate in the consultations on a visit facilitated by the U.S. State Department. It gave no details on Liu's condition. Büchler did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The hospital did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on Saturday evening.

The firm's biggest domestic rival, Suez (SEVI.PA), announced the $3.4 billion purchase of GE Water from General Electric (GE.N) in March. Asked whether Veolia could spend as much on an acquisition, its boss Antoine Frerot told Reuters the size of the group's balance sheet  would allow it .  Frerot, who earlier this year said he would favor organic growth for the business, laid out two conditions for any future large acquisition.

{"content":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian state firms are courting foreign pension funds by offering a share in future revenue from toll roads, power stations and other infrastructure projects, as part of a presidential drive to secure $10 billion in additional inflows. The state budget is not enough to fund President Joko Widodo's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, a sprawling archipelago where the costs of moving goods around are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return. Positive Initial Response An official drives a motorcycle during an inspection at a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Salatiga, Central Java province, Indonesia June 8, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.  Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSIndonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk (JSMR.JK), has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   State-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia June 15, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra  via REUTERSPLN [PLNEG.UL] decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Varian added, however, that liquidity may be boosted over time partly because domestic pension funds and insurance firms are required to have a certain portion of investments in government bonds or infrastructure-linked securities.

{"content":"AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - Cheap credit is for now not fuelling a destabilizing real-estate bubble in Germany but the central bank is closely watching the market, Bundesbank vice president Claudia Buch said on Saturday. Housing prices in Germany - relatively cheap compared with other European countries in the past - have risen sharply in recent years, prompting the Bundesbank to warn in May about the risk of a dangerous bubble developing.  We very closely watch the real estate market in Germany because we know that in over-valued real estate prices there might be a risk to financial stability,  Buch told an economic conference in southern France.  We don't see an immediate risk because prices are increasing, but there is not a lot of borrowing going on, so it's not a credit-financed increase in prices.  But Buch, who is in charge of financial stability at the Bundesbank, said it had less information about loan contract terms than other countries like France and was therefore less aware of credit standards. Average real estate prices in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt have increased by more than 60 percent since 2010, the Bundesbank estimates, reflecting solid growth, low unemployment and low borrowing costs. Buch said that the Bundesbank was generally concerned about low interest rates spurring risk taking at a time when asset valuations are already high.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - There is only one way to treat petulant players, such as Australia's Bernard Tomic, who call for a medical time out to treat a fake injury -- expose them to public humiliation.  That is the theory of Bill Norris, the ATP's former Director of Medical Services who spent 35 years patching up the broken and sore bodies of top players from Ken Rosewall and Arthur Ashe to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Tomic was fined $15,000 by the International Tennis Federation on Thursday after admitting he was  bored  and had faked an injury during a listless first-round defeat at Wimbledon.  This young man (Tomic) not trying in his match at Wimbledon is not a good thing,  Norris, who turns 75 next month, told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Boca Raton, Florida.  If I got called out to court (and realized) some guy just wants to buy time, it is gamesmanship.   I would say it out really loud so that the umpire and spectators could hear and say (to the player): 'You called me out for this? That’s very unfair of you and it’s unfair to your opponent'.   So I would embarrass the player.   Legal Cheating  Tomic's behavior was condemned as  legal cheating  by his fellow Australian Pat Cash, and while it has created an uproar at Wimbledon, Norris felt that the rapport he had built up with the players allowed him to read them the riot act if they  misbehaved .   Over 35 years I had a unique relationship with the players. They were all like my children. And when they misbehaved, I would call them on it,  said Norris, who has been around professional athletes since the age of 12 after working with the medical team of the Pittsburg Pirates baseball team.   That guy who has faked an injury, after the match he will have to face his peers in the locker room. He will have to face me. And they didn’t like that,  Norris said  Hopefully the fine will set Tomic straight and he will not do that again. It’s certainly a lack of professionalism.  So how often did he get called out to treat fake injuries?  Very little. Very low percent of players have tried that.  The amount of prize money on offer these days appears to have its downside as during this year's championships, there were seven first-round retirements in the men's draw.  Some players such as Martin Klizan and Alexandr Dolgopolov were criticized for taking to court for their matches against Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer respectively as it was clear from the outset they were too injured to finish.  The back-to-back retirements on Centre Court angered many fans but Norris felt the players could not be blamed for trying to earn a living when an  average career is probably five to six years .   In the early days the game wasn’t as physical as it is now. When I first started they played with wooden rackets so you had to have more finesse. We had some injuries for our time but we never had the rotator tears of the muscle,  said Norris, who added that injuries increased by 10 to 15 percent during his time on the tour from 1973 to 2008.  Money Motivation  Money is a motivator so a lot of players play in events when they should be recovering. You can’t help that.  The worst injury seen this week, however, occurred mid match. American Bethanie Mattek-Sands howled in agony after she slipped and suffered a horrific knee injury during a second round match. Norris, however, has seen worse.  In 1975 New Zealander Jeff Simpson was playing doubles in an indoor tournament on carpet. He was playing at the net and he caught a smash into his neck,  recalled Norris, who has chronicled his life on the tour in the book 'Pain, Set and Match'.   The impact of that ball that hit Jeff's neck threw him to the ground. When he fell, he hit his head and had a concussion. It also triggered a convulsion.   Luckily I have a lot of emergency medical experience so I was able to resuscitate him and revive him. It was scary... and that was the worst one.  In those days there was no time limit on medical time outs and hence, astonishingly, Simpson had a day off and came back to win the doubles title in Washington. Norris, who now passes on his knowledge to juniors at the Evert Academy, feels rather than on-court injuries, the biggest threat to a player's health is  heat illness .   We have to educate the kids at the academies from an early age to properly hydrate. Heat exhaustion is a killer,  added the grandfather of four.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday to put aside  distractions  that have strained bilateral ties and warned that China was unwilling to compromise on Taiwan, state news agency Xinhua said. Relations have been complicated for decades by the legacy of Japan's wartime aggression. Self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China and was governed by Japan from 1895-1945, is another sensitive issue, and a maritime territorial dispute over small islands in the East China Sea has deepened mutual suspicion in recent years. Beijing complained to Tokyo in March after a Japanese minister visited Taiwan, and China has also told Japan not to get involved in the dispute over the South China Sea. Meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg, Xi told Abe the countries were important neighbors, and said the healthy development of relations was of importance to the rest of the world, Xinhua said. Xi urged Japan to learn from history so as to have a  better future  in its ties with China, the report added.  Noting that the China-Japan ties have been distracted by complicated factors despite some positive exchanges between the two sides, the Chinese leader said there is no room for compromise on the issues related to history and Taiwan, and Japan shall honor its words in these respects,  Xinhua said. Adding to long-standing tensions, China said last month a Japanese citizen was being investigated for harming national security, following a similar case in May in which China said six Japanese were being questioned on suspicion of illegal activity.

{"content":"The American League Central-leading Cleveland Indians look to continue their sudden offensive surge when they host the rival Detroit Tigers for the middle contest of a three-game set on Saturday night. The Indians posted 22 runs on 30 hits to win their last two contests, including an 11-2 victory over the Tigers in the series opener Friday as Michael Brantley knocked in four runs. Francisco Lindor had three RBIs in the victory and is 7-for-15 over the last three contests for Cleveland while Jose Ramirez remained red hot with a pair of hits to extend his hitting streak to nine games in which he is 15-for-37. Mike Clevinger hopes to get the same run support as he takes the mound for the Indians against former AL MVP Justin Verlander, who is 1-2 with an 11.30 ERA in three starts during the season series after getting pounded by Cleveland last weekend. The Tigers are on the verge of dropping into last place in the AL Central after losing four of their last six and have given up 26 runs while suffering three straight setbacks against the Indians.

The 34-year-old has permitted 24 hits, including five homers, in three starts against the Indians in 2017 and owns a 6.22 ERA on the road overall. Lonnie Chisenhall is 15-for-44 with three homers versus Verlander, who is 20-23 in 51 career games against the Indians. Clevinger is unbeaten (2-0) in his last four starts, yielding five runs on 12 hits over 21 innings with 24 strikeouts after a strong outing against Verlander and Detroit last week. The 26-year-old Floridian matched a season high with five walks despite holding the Tigers to one run on two hits over six innings in the 11-8 win on Sunday. Cabrera is 2-for-4 with a homer and five RBIs against Clevinger, who is 1-1 with a 5.40 ERA in three appearances (two starts) versus Detroit. Walk-Offs 1. Indians manager Terry Francona underwent a successful cardiac procedure Friday and is expected to be back in the dugout after the All-Star break. 2.

The Brewers followed up an 11-2 rout of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on Thursday with a 9-4 victory over the Yankees in the series opener. Milwaukee has won five in a row and eight of nine to open up a 4 1/2-game lead in the National League Central, and they are averaging seven runs a game during the 8-1 surge. Jesus Aguilar had a pair of homers - including the tiebreaking grand slam in the seventh inning - in Friday's win, and his franchise record-tying seven RBIs helped Milwaukee snap a 10-game losing streak in Yankee Stadium. New York had a 4-2 lead in the opener before its beleaguered bullpen gave up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings to contribute to the club's 17th loss in 23 games.

Minnesota took the first two in the series and four of its last five overall to pull within 1 1/2 games of the Indians in the Central. The Twins pounded out 15 runs on Thursday and Friday against the Orioles and totaled 22 hits in the two contests as Max Kepler has scored three runs and collected three RBIs, while Byron Buxton stayed hot while improving to 8-for-16 with five runs scored in the last four games. Baltimore got a rare offensive explosion on Friday from star third baseman Manny Machado, who went 4-for-5 with a pair of home runs while raising his batting average to .224.

Miley faced Minnesota once last season and was lit up for five runs on six hits - three home runs - and four walks in four innings. Mejia is on a roll with wins in three straight starts and has allowed a total of three runs in 17 2/3 innings in those three turns.

Shortstop Elvis Andrus (paternity leave) and corner infielder Joey Gallo (hamstring) did not start on Friday, but second baseman Rougned Odor played though a hand injury and joined Adrian Beltre, Nomar Mazara and Jonathan Lucroy to supply Texas with all of its run production in a 10-0 rout in the opener. In addition to winning consecutive games for the first time in nearly two weeks, the Rangers (42-44) pulled into a virtual tie with the Angels (44-46) for second place in the American League West. Los Angeles has dropped four of five and failed to score more than three runs for the seventh time in 10 games - a stretch which includes three shutouts.

Beltre is 2-for-14 while Odor is 5-for-11 with a pair of home runs against Chavez, who is 2-5 with a 6.00 ERA in 18 appearances (five starts) against the Rangers. Ross was unable to build on his best outing of the season but settled for a no-decision Sunday at the Chicago White Sox despite giving up four runs on four hits and five walks over five innings.

The Astros pounded out 14 hits en route to a 12-2 victory Friday night to even the series, improving to 3-1 on their current six-game swing and to 21-4 away from home since the middle of May. George Springer was the catalyst with four hits - including two home runs - to go along with five RBIs, and the 27-year-old is 14-for-24 with 11 runs scored during a five-game hitting streak. Jose Altuve added three hits for the Astros to raise his major league-leading average to .342, and Carlos Correa smacked his 18th home run to extend his hitting streak to 15 games - the longest active run in the majors.

Stroman let up two runs in five frames prior to his abrupt departure Monday at Yankee Stadium, the 13th time in 17 starts in which he has allowed three earned runs or fewer. The Duke product has a 2.87 ERA in nine home starts and defeated the Astros at the Rogers Centre last August with 6 1/3 solid innings.

{"content":"The Boston Red Sox uncharacteristically used the long ball to even the series and hope to build on the momentum when they visit the Tampa Bay Rays for the third of the four-game set on Saturday afternoon. The Red Sox, who are last in the American League with 90 homers, belted three Friday night to pull away for an 8-3 victory after losing the opener with their ace Chris Sale on the mound. Dustin Pedroia, who is 4-for-9 in the series, got things started with a two-run blast while Jackie Bradley Jr. and Hanley Ramirez added solo homers for Boston, which became the second AL team to reach 50 wins. The Red Sox send reigning AL Cy Young winner Rick Porcello to the hill to try and put a positive end to a rough first half and Tampa Bay counters with fellow right-hander Alex Cobb, who is 1-0 with a 5.56 ERA in two outings against Boston in 2017. The Rays could not follow up an inspiring victory over Sale on Thursday, but Steven Souza Jr. launched the team’s 132nd homer of the season - second in the AL. Tampa Bay’s Logan Morrison walked twice Friday to extend his on-base streak to 27 contests and the first baseman is 8-for-17 his last five games.

The 28-year-old New Jersey native allowed three runs on three hits (two homers) in a no-decision at Texas last time out and has given up nine blasts in his last seven contests. Morrison is 10-for-27 with a homer overall against Porcello, who is 0-2 with a 9.58 ERA versus the Rays in 2017. Cobb followed up his best outing of the season at Pittsburgh on June 27 with one of his worst five days later at Baltimore when he permitted seven runs (six earned) in 6 1/3 innings. The 29-year-old Boston native had gone 2-0 over his four previous outings, capped by a no-decision against Pittsburgh when he surrendered two hits over eight scoreless frames. Christian Vazquez is 4-for-6 versus Cobb, who is 4-3 with a 3.84 ERA lifetime against Boston. Walk-Offs 1. Tampa Bay 2B Brad Miller went 2-for-2 with an RBI Friday after being activated from the disabled list while INF Tim Beckham (ankle) was placed on the 10-day DL. 2.

The Cardinals were hoping to take advantage of some sub-.500 competition to get back into the National League Central race before the All-Star break but instead dropped three of their last four games to the Marlins and the Mets. St. Louis will try to even the series on Saturday behind veteran Adam Wainwright, while New York sends righty Zack Wheeler to the mound.

The 27-year-old has not won since May 20 and did not make it past the second inning in either of his final two starts prior to hitting the DL on June 20. Wheeler is 1-1 with a 4.60 ERA in six road starts. Wainwright was roughed up in his final frame against Miami on Monday and ended up charged with six runs on eight hits in five innings but still came away with a win. The Georgia native allowed a total of three earned runs and 10 hits across 13 1/3 innings over his two previous starts and owns 21 strikeouts in 18 1/3 frames over the last three.

{"content":"After missing the previous two games with a stiff neck, San Diego Padres catcher Austin Hedges wasn't about to let a long delay in Friday's series opener in Philadelphia keep him from putting a fitting end to a dominant performance. Coming off the first two-homer effort of his career, the 24-year-old backstop looks to power the Padres to a rare series victory against the Phillies on Saturday as the teams continue their three-game set. Hedges, who leads National League catchers with 13 home runs, went deep in each of his first two at-bats in his first career start at Citizens Bank Park before action was paused for 94 minutes in the top of the seventh inning due to rain. Philadelphia tied the game up moments after play was resumed, but Hedges came through yet again with a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the ninth to send San Diego to a 4-3 victory. While the Padres enjoyed their fourth win in five tries in the opener, the Phillies dropped their fourth straight contest and are in danger of losing only their second series to San Diego since 2009. Tommy Joseph snapped out of a 2-for-15 slide over his previous four games by reaching base in all four of his at-bats Friday, drawing two walks to go along with a pair of extra-base hits - including a solo homer. TV: 4:05 p.m. ET, FSN San Diego, CSN Philadelphia PITCHING MATCHUP: Padres RH Jhoulys Chacin (7-7, 4.52 ERA) vs. Phillies RH Aaron Nola (6-5, 3.73) Chacin continued his dominance at home Sunday against the Los Angeles Dodgers, picking up the victory after permitting four hits and three walks while striking out six in five scoreless frames. The 29-year-old Venezuelan improved to 5-2 with a 1.68 ERA in nine home turns, but he has been among the worst starting pitchers on the road in 2017 (9.08 ERA in eight outings). Chacin, who hasn't faced the Phillies since 2014, is 2-1 with a 2.25 ERA in seven appearances (five starts) versus Philadelphia. Nola won his third consecutive start Monday against Pittsburgh, firing seven scoreless innings while allowing four hits and striking out eight. The Louisiana native has posted a 1.27 ERA during his win streak - fanning at least eight each time - and is 4-2 with a 2.68 ERA over his last six turns dating back to the beginning of June. Nola is 1-1 with a 3.60 ERA in three starts against the Padres, including a loss against them in April of 2016 when he was tagged for four runs despite striking out nine across seven innings. Walk-Offs 1. Hedges' two homers on Friday were his first since June 3. 2. Despite Friday's loss, Philadelphia has still won 10 of the last 13 meetings at Citizens Bank Park and is 60-27 against the Padres since 2004 - the club's best mark against any opponent over that time. 3.

{"content":"If the Atlanta Braves are going to make a run at the Washington Nationals in the National League East, they might need to upgrade the back end of their bullpen. The Nationals rallied in the ninth inning Friday before recording their seventh walk-off win of the season, and they’ll try to keep the momentum going when they host the Braves for the third of a four-game series Saturday. Washington scored three runs in the ninth inning Friday against Atlanta closer Jim Johnson, then won 5-4 on Daniel Murphy’s game-winning single in the 10th, evening the series at a game apiece. Braves ace Julio Teheran takes the mound Saturday looking to snap a three-start winless streak dating to his victory at Washington on June 14. Teheran has had mixed results against the Nationals this season, allowing seven runs over four innings in a loss April 19 in Atlanta before limiting the Nationals to two runs and six hits over seven frames in the win last month. Teheran opposes Washington right-hander Stephen Strasburg, who has faced the Braves three times this season, recording at least 10 strikeouts in each.

The streaking Dodgers have won 24 of their past 28 games heading into Saturday’s contest against the visiting Kansas City Royals, who saw their four-game winning streak come to an abrupt end with a 4-1 loss in Friday’s series opener. Chase Utley recorded his 1,000th career RBI and Yasiel Puig belted a solo homer in Friday’s victory as the Dodgers won their fourth straight and moved a season-high 30 games over .500. Los Angeles’ starting pitching has been outstanding over the last four games, allowing a total of two runs on 11 hits over 26 innings. The Royals entered this weekend’s series having won 22 of their last 32 games but were held to five hits in Friday’s loss. The top three batters in the order – Whit Merrifield, Ramon Torres and Lorenzo Cain – were a combined 0-for-10 as the Royals struggled against Kenta Maeda and three Dodger relievers.

Puig is 4-for-24 against Kennedy, who is 5-9 with a 4.31 ERA in 20 career starts against the Dodgers, including 0-7 since his last win on Sept. 11, 2012 with Arizona. McCarthy will be activated from the disabled list to start for the first time since June 25, when he allowed five runs (four earned) in three innings against Colorado.

{"content":"Once dominant against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Jake Arrieta has struggled against the Bucs the past two seasons. The 2015 National League Cy Young Award winner hopes to revert to his previous form when the Chicago Cubs host the Pirates for the second of a three-game series Saturday. The Cubs won the series opener 6-1 to climb back to .500 for the 20th time this season, but they haven’t won consecutive games since taking three straight from June 18-20. To change that, Chicago needs a strong outing from Arrieta after starter Eddie Butler lasted only four innings Friday. Arrieta’s career numbers against the Pirates remain impressive, but after going 9-1 with a 1.46 ERA in the first 12 meetings, he is 0-3 with a 7.81 ERA in his past five starts against Pittsburgh. Friday’s loss snapped a three-game winning streak for the Pirates, who tied their season-high with three errors and had a streak of 13 1/3 scoreless innings from their bullpen come to an end.

Nova beat the Cubs on June 17 in Pittsburgh, limiting them to three runs and six hits in seven frames.

The Diamondbacks bounced back from Thursday's horrific 5-4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers when closer Fernando Rodney was unable to protect a three-run ninth-inning lead. Arizona manager Torey Lovullo professed complete support of Rodney prior to Friday's game and used him later to get the final out for save No. 22 when other bullpen members allowed three ninth-inning runs.

{"content":"Oakland Athletics right-hander Chris Smith is making one of the more unlikely starting debuts in major-league history when he takes the mound against the host Seattle Mariners on Saturday. Smith, who was a college pitching coach earlier this decade, becomes the oldest starter in Athletics' franchise history at 36 years, 90 days. Smith has made 63 career relief appearances and was out of the majors for five consecutive seasons before re-emerging last season to pitch in 13 games for Oakland. He is being summoned from Triple-A Nashville to make the start and will replace Joe Pate (33 years, 334 days in 1926) as the oldest pitcher to make his starting debut for the Athletics. Seattle halted an eight-game home losing streak by posting a 7-2 victory in Friday's second contest of the four-game series as designated hitter Nelson Cruz drove in five runs and smashed the 300th homer of his career. Mariners shortstop Jean Segura is also excelling and is a torrid 15-for-27 over the last six games. TV: 10:10 p.m. ET, NBCSN California (Oakland), ROOT Sports Northwest (Seattle) PITCHING MATCHUP: Athletics RH Chris Smith (NR) vs. Mariners RH Andrew Moore (1-1, 3.60) Smith has a 4.58 career ERA while seeing time with the Boston Red Sox (2008), Milwaukee Brewers (2009-10) and Athletics. He was released by the Seattle Mariners in 2011 and became a coach at UC Riverside - his alma mater - before later giving the sport another try and catching Oakland's attention during an independent league stint.  I kind of fought for that call-up last year with the A's,  Smith told reporters.  And I knew what it meant ... it wasn't easy, being that old and doing what you're doing, competing with younger kids and competing with those prospects that I once was one time.  Moore is making his third career start and hasn't issued a walk in 15 major-league innings.

{"content":"MOMBASA (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants beheaded nine men in an overnight attack on a village in the Kenyan coastal district of Lamu, police said, days after Somali militants killed three policemen in an attack on a nearby village.  Police said there were nine bodies. A witness, who asked not to be named, confirmed the death toll.   They raided Jima and Poromoko villages and killed nine men. They were slaughtered like chickens, using knives,  said the witness. Villagers said a group of heavily armed attackers, many of whom appeared to be ethnic Somalis, attacked the villagers at 11:00 pm.

{"content":"AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - Cheap credit is for now not fuelling a destabilizing real-estate bubble in Germany but the central bank is closely watching the market, Bundesbank vice president Claudia Buch said on Saturday. Housing prices in Germany - relatively cheap compared with other European countries in the past - have risen sharply in recent years, prompting the Bundesbank to warn in May about the risk of a dangerous bubble developing.  We very closely watch the real estate market in Germany because we know that in over-valued real estate prices there might be a risk to financial stability,  Buch told an economic conference in southern France.  We don't see an immediate risk because prices are increasing, but there is not a lot of borrowing going on, so it's not a credit-financed increase in prices.  But Buch, who is in charge of financial stability at the Bundesbank, said it had less information about loan contract terms than other countries like France and was therefore less aware of credit standards. Average real estate prices in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt have increased by more than 60 percent since 2010, the Bundesbank estimates, reflecting solid growth, low unemployment and low borrowing costs. Buch said that the Bundesbank was generally concerned about low interest rates spurring risk taking at a time when asset valuations are already high.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - In a meeting that ran longer than either side had planned, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin discussed alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election on Friday but agreed to focus on better ties rather than litigating the past. Trump, a Republican who called it an  honor  to meet with the Russian president, drew swift criticism from Democrats at home, who accused him of dismissing U.S. intelligence and giving Putin's denial, reiterated on Friday, of Russian interference too much weight. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg that Trump had  positive chemistry  with Putin during the meeting, which lasted some two hours and 15 minutes. He opened their discussion by pressing Putin about  the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election  and had a robust exchange, Tillerson said. The Russian president has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year and Moscow has asked for proof that it took place. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Trump accepted Putin's assertions that the allegations, backed by U.S. intelligence agencies, were false. Tillerson said they both sought to move on.  The presidents rightly focused on how do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point,  Tillerson said. That explanation did not sit well with Democrats. “Working to compromise the integrity of our election process cannot and should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion,  said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a statement. On Thursday in Poland Trump gave lukewarm support to the view that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. political process.

Trump says his team did not collude with Russia. Tillerson said they agreed to work on commitments of  non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those in other countries.  Andrew Weiss, a former National Security Council official responsible for Russia, said Trump had sent the wrong signal with upbeat body language and by not pushing Putin harder on alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.  The atmospherics were chummy,  said Weiss, who is now at Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington.  The clear push from Trump to normalize U.S.-Russian relations was on display in the meeting.

The face-to-face encounter was one of the most eagerly anticipated meetings between two leaders in years. Trump and Putin spoke through translators with their respective foreign ministers present for six minutes before reporters were allowed into the room for their statements. Afterwards the reporters were ushered out and the meeting continued.  President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well,  Trump told reporters, sitting alongside the Russian leader. Slideshow (14 Images) We've had some very, very good talks. ... We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you.  Putin, through a translator, said:  We spoke over the phone with you several times,  adding:  A phone conversation is never enough.   I am delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President,  he said, noting that he hoped the meeting would yield results. Both men sat with legs splayed. Trump listened intently as Putin spoke. The encounter went longer than expected, and first lady Melania Trump came in at one point to urge them to conclude, Tillerson said. The two men later joined other G20 leaders at a concert. Mrs. Trump sat next to Putin at dinner. Before the get-together, some feared the U.S. president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, would be less prepared for the talks than Putin, a former KGB agent who has dealt with previous U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders. Amid criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria and the investigations into its role in the U.S. campaign, Trump has come under growing pressure to take a hard line against the Kremlin. On Thursday, Trump delivered some of his sharpest remarks about Moscow since becoming president, urging Russia to stop its  destabilizing activities  and end its support for Syria and Iran. But Trump stopped short on Thursday of any personal criticism of Putin and declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials' assertion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump said on a visit to Poland.

{"content":"HASSAN SHAM CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - Victory over Islamic State may be close at hand in the battle for Mosul but many of the almost one million city residents displaced by months of fighting are in no mood to celebrate. At a camp sheltering a fraction of those who have fled eight months of combat between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants, the main concern is keeping cool without electricity as temperatures climb above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).    Some of the displaced people living at Hassan Sham camp east of Mosul are selling food rations in order to buy a more precious commodity: ice. A small block measuring roughly a foot long (30 cm) sells for 500 Iraqi dinars ($0.43). Standing in the ice queue, some camp residents said they would be happy to see the back of the militants, who subjected them to three years of violence and privation, but questioned how they would rebuild their lives in a ravaged city.  Most have lost their livelihoods, many have lost homes and relatives too.     There is nothing they (Islamic State) didn't take from us,  said Mohammed Haji Ahmed, who arrived at the camp just five days ago from the Souq al-Shaareen neighborhood in Mosul, where Iraqi forces are fighting to dislodge the last militants.     The clothes trader lost his house, his car, his business and 15 members of his extended family as a result of Islamic State's occupation of Mosul.      If there is no rebuilding and people don't return to their homes and regain their belongings what is the meaning of liberation?  he said. 'Safer Here Than There' After three weeks of fighting in the narrow streets of the Old City where Islamic State is making its last stand, state TV said on Saturday that Iraqi security forces expected to take full control of Mosul in the coming hours.

{"content":"BANJUL (Reuters) - Chinese and French companies are bidding to help Gambia build up its Atlantic port Banjul to be what industry sources say could be a rival to neighboring Senegal's Dakar. It would be one of the first major structural changes in Gambia following the end of President Yahya Jammeh's more than 20-year rule in January. State-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) (601800.SS) says one of its subsidiaries has made a bid for a  140 million euro ($159.91 million) contract Gambia has launched to redevelop the port. France's Bollore Group (BOLL.PA) has also submitted an offer to develop the port for hundreds of millions of dollars, sources told Reuters, and was part of a recent delegation of French investors to the country. The port was run by a state agency during Jammeh's rule. It is considered to have strategic potential thanks to its easy access to Atlantic shipping lanes.  Abdoulie Tambedou, managing director of the Gambia Ports Authority said there had already been several offers.  The Chinese are interested in investing in the infrastructure for an overall envelope of 140 million euros,  he told Reuters in an interview.  We hope to agree the financing in the next six months.  An official at CCCC confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was bidding for the contract, without specifying which. In a sign of their interest, a witness saw a Chinese delegation visiting the port last week. Tambedou confirmed Bollore's offer, without giving the price, and said this included both infrastructure costs and the rental concession. Chinese interest in the project follows China's resumption of diplomatic ties with former Taiwan ally Gambia last year under the  one China  policy, which states that self-ruled Taiwan is part of China. President Adama Barrow's new government reaffirmed that position in February.  Workers in Gambia's main port of Banjul cheer from the top of a vessel, June 29, 2017. Picture taken June 29, 2017.Emma FargeChina is also a major market for Gambia's exports, which globally are mainly peanuts, wood, cashews, fish and fruit.   Upgrading the port will take 30-36 months to complete, Tambedou said. Struggling Gambia is poor. It ranks 173 out of 189 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index, below Haiti. It is badly in need of key infrastructure development. There is not a single bridge across its eponymous 1,120 km (695 mile)-long river that wiggles up the length of the country, for example. People and goods have to be shipped across on ferries - or go around. Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals. Space constraints at the port, however, mean that arriving cargo ships often have to wait at anchorage before entering.  Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

Chinese interest in the project follows China's resumption of diplomatic ties with former Taiwan ally Gambia last year under the  one China  policy, which states that self-ruled Taiwan is part of China. President Adama Barrow's new government reaffirmed that position in February.  Workers in Gambia's main port of Banjul cheer from the top of a vessel, June 29, 2017. Picture taken June 29, 2017.Emma FargeChina is also a major market for Gambia's exports, which globally are mainly peanuts, wood, cashews, fish and fruit.   Upgrading the port will take 30-36 months to complete, Tambedou said. Struggling Gambia is poor. It ranks 173 out of 189 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index, below Haiti. It is badly in need of key infrastructure development. There is not a single bridge across its eponymous 1,120 km (695 mile)-long river that wiggles up the length of the country, for example. People and goods have to be shipped across on ferries - or go around. Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals. Space constraints at the port, however, mean that arriving cargo ships often have to wait at anchorage before entering.  Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The firefighters who battled an inferno at a London apartment block that killed at least 80 people last month were hindered by equipment failings including the lack of a high ladder, the BBC reported on Saturday. More than 200 firefighters and 40 engines were sent to the 24-storey Grenfell Tower on June 14, rescuing 65 people from the devastated building. But the BBC said there were radio problems and a shortage of  extended duration  breathing apparatus, which allow firefighters to work for longer. A high ladder, which might have given the fire crews a better chance of stopping the blaze from engulfing the building, did not arrive for more than 30 minutes. Crews also cited problems with water pressure, the BBC said, although water firm Thames Water told the broadcaster that  any suggestion there was low pressure or that Thames Water did not supply enough water to fire services during this appalling tragedy is categorically false . London Fire Brigade, which could not immediately be reached to comment, told the BBC it had changed its procedures since the fire and its response would be reviewed. Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry into the blaze, the worst in the British capital since World War Two, although survivors and locals have expressed unhappiness with the government's choice of chairman for the probe, saying they were skeptical he would uncover wider issues. British police have also launched a major investigation into the fire and are considering a range of possible criminal offences including manslaughter. Meanwhile, Law firm Leigh Day confirmed on Saturday that it had suspended two members of staff after the Times newspaper reported that they had been touting for business by putting up posters offering help to survivors.  As soon as the posters were brought to our attention, a full internal investigation was commenced under formal protocols,  Leigh Day said in a statement.  The two individuals concerned have been suspended whilst this investigation takes place.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Police gained the upper hand in Hamburg early on Saturday morning after a day of running clashes with anti-capitalist protesters seeking to disrupt the city's G20 summit of global leaders. Heavily armed police commandos moved in after activists had spent much of the day attempting to wrest control of the streets from more than 15,000 police, setting fires, looting and building barricades. With meetings between leaders of the club of 20 largest global economies finished for the day, police stormed the last holdouts, who had gathered in the Schanzenviertel district, an area known for its left-wing activism and culture of squatting. With two months to go before she seeks re-election, Chancellor Angela Merkel had hoped to cement Germany's growing global leadership role with a demonstration of its unwavering commitment to free speech, assembly and dissent by holding the summit in the center of a city with a proud radical tradition. Protesters torched cars and lorries, smashed windows in banks, looted retail stores and hurled paving slabs and other objects before police managed to restore order. Some 197 officers were injured after two days of clashes in the port city. Police made 19 arrests and detained dozens more. Standing in a nearby falafel restaurant, Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months before, surveyed the scene with disbelief.  They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,  he said.  They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.  But G20 participants said they had never seen protesters closer to such a summit than in Hamburg and praised the work of police in keeping the event safe, suggesting Merkel's gamble had paid off. A woman takes pictures of a store, damaged after demonstrations at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.Fabian BimmerBeethoven vs Hendrix  I have every understanding for peaceful demonstrations but violent demonstrations put human lives in danger,  Merkel had said earlier. Most of the 100,000 protesters were peaceful, hoisting signs saying the G20 leaders were not welcome, or engaging in mass bicycle processions through the city center wearing brightly coloured uniforms. Slideshow (33 Images)When world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping gathered for a Beethoven concert in the Elbphilharmonie concert hall on one side of the river, protesters blared the music of Jimi Hendrix from the other side. But in the night's most dramatic scenes, police pursued members of the radical Black Bloc movement, which wants to overthrow capitalism, across scaffolding as they sought refuge on rooftops. Below, burning barricades billowed thick smoke. Despite the chaos that threatened to overwhelm parts of the city during much of the day, the summit, with thousands of participants from dozens of countries, was largely unaffected. Police declined to clear U.S. first lady Melania Trump's motorcade to leave her hotel for a tour of the historic harbor, and protests delayed buses taking visitors away from the state dinner that concluded the meetings. The summit is due to conclude on Saturday.

{"content":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed fellow Group of 20 leaders to compromise at the start of talks on climate and trade that have pitted U.S. President Donald Trump against virtually every other country in the club of leading economies. The host of the G20 summit addressed her counterparts on Friday in a hall at the Hamburg convention center, after video footage showed Trump shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the first face-to-face encounter between the two men. Merkel was shown talking casually with Putin as the leaders entered the hall, then joining French President Emmanuel Macron in a three-way discussion with Trump, who was seated between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Britain's Theresa May.  We all know the big global challenges and we know that time is pressing,  Merkel told the group.  And so solutions can only be found if we are ready for compromise and move toward each other, but without - and I stress this - bending too much, because of course we can also state clearly when there are differences.  Trump later held bilateral talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Putin. The meeting with the Russian leader is drawing intense scrutiny because of Trump's election campaign pledge to seek a rapprochement with Moscow. So far he has been unable to deliver on that promise amid accusations from U.S. intelligence services that Russia meddled in last year's presidential election and investigations into the Trump campaign's links to the country. Merkel, who is gearing up for a parliamentary election in September, faces the daunting task of steering the G20 toward a consensus on trade, climate change and migration - all issues that have become more contentious since Trump entered the White House half a year ago promising an  America First  approach. Last month he pulled the United States out of a landmark international agreement aimed at combating climate change. And he is threatening to take punitive trade measures in the steel sector which would hit China, Germany, Canada and a host of other countries. Related CoverageOfficials thrashing out G20 communique face long night: MerkelAngry and agile - anarchists give police hard time at Hamburg G20Police gain upper hand after Hamburg's day of G20 clashesThe Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that President Xi had called on G20 nations to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and forestall risks in financial markets.  Xi also urged G20 members to develop financial inclusion and green finance to make the financial sector truly drive the development of the real economy,  Xinhua added. Envoys have been working for weeks to bridge differences, and European sources said they had come up with new language on the climate issue on Thursday which would be put to the leaders for approval. The latest draft communique sticks with language about the Paris climate accord being  irreversible  but removes a reference from an earlier version to a  global approach  that some countries felt could suggest there was a parallel track to Paris. It also includes a new paragraph which says the United States will  work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently . Some experts were skeptical whether leaders would approve the reference to fossil fuels, which would be a clear nod to Washington. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump confer at the start of the first working session of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, July 7, 2017.John MacDougall/PoolEarlier, leaders of the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China - called on the G20 to push for implementation of the Paris climate deal despite Trump's decision to pull out.  Frightening  As the leaders met, police said they were sending reinforcements from other parts of Germany to cope with thousands of anti-capitalist protesters who set fire to cars, rubbish bins and wooden pallets in violence that Hamburg's interior minister called  frightening . U.S. First Lady Melania Trump was prevented from leaving her hotel to join a harbor tour because of security concerns, her spokeswoman said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble canceled an appearance in downtown Hamburg. Slideshow (22 Images)Police said 160 officers had been injured, 45 protestors temporarily detained and another 15 taken into custody.  We have to expect everything, and we are expecting everything,  Hamburg Interior Minister Andy Grote said.  Merkel chose Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. The summit is being held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the  Rote Flora  which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Steel Threat On the policy front, sources said that Washington was backtracking on language condemning trade protectionism that Trump agreed to at a Group of Seven meeting in Sicily in May. The BRICS countries pushed back in a statement saying:  We firmly support a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, implementation and enforcement of existing WTO rules and commitments and oppose protectionism.  Hanging over the trade discussions is a threat by Washington to use a Cold War-era law to restrict steel imports based on national security concerns, a step that would hit the Chinese as well European producers. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday morning in Hamburg that the EU would respond  immediately and adequately  if the U.S. took action on steel. After sessions on terrorism, the global economy and climate on Friday, the leaders will be joined by their spouses for dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new glass concert hall perched atop an old warehouse building overlooking the Elbe River.

{"content":"MILAN (Reuters) - Pope Francis warned leaders of the world's top 20 economies meeting in Hamburg against forming dangerous and distorting alliances that could harm the poor and migrants, in an article in Italian daily la Repubblica on Saturday.  The G20 worries me, it hits migrants in countries in half of the world and it hits them even more as time goes by,  the Pope was quoted as saying in a conversation with the paper's founder Eugenio Scalfari.  Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,300 years, said he was afraid of  very dangerous alliances among (foreign) powers that have a distorted vision of the world: America and Russia, China and North Korea, (Vladimir) Putin and (Bashar al-)Assad in the war in Syria.

{"content":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is in talks with Canada's Teck Resources Ltd (TECKb.TO), the largest North American producer of coking coal used to make steel, for long-term purchase agreements after a cyclonic disruption in Australia cut supplies earlier this year. India has joined top buyers China and Japan to scour new markets after a powerful cyclone hit Australia that knocked out rail lines carrying coking coal to ports for export, causing a surge in prices. Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh will be in Canada on Sunday along with executives of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) (SAIL.NS) for talks with Vancouver-based Teck over long-term, formula-based price deals, a top official in the steel ministry said, declining to be identified as the talks have not been made public.  Coking coal prices went haywire because of the natural calamity in Australia. There is every reason for India to not depend on only one source for coking coal,  the official said, adding the Canadian government had called upon the Indian minister to visit the country's mines. SAIL and Teck may explore signing a preliminary agreement, the official said.  At present, SAIL meets a little over three-fourths of its needs from BHP Billiton (BLT.L), (BHP.AX), the world's biggest shipper of coking coal, according to a second government official. India needs about 56 million to 57 million tonnes of coking coal every year, of which about 85 percent is imported. According to the government's newly-drafted National Steel Policy, India's coking coal requirements will more than double by the fiscal year ending in 2031. Executives from Teck Resources had visited India last month for preliminary discussions, said the two government officials.  Diversification is essential otherwise we are dependent on Australia and their supply sometimes becomes very volatile because of cyclones,  said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at India's biggest steel producer, JSW Steel (JSTL.NS).     JSW sources 60 percent of its coking coal supplies from Australia and the rest from Mozambique, the United States and  Canada. The steel minister's office and SAIL did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. Steel plants use coking, or metallurgical, coal to fire blast furnaces and any shortfall can potentially close down production and risk damaging the furnaces.    In 2016, India imported 46.7 million tonnes of coking coal, higher than China's 35.7 million tonnes but lower than Japan's imports of 53.4 million tonnes, according to Clarksons Research. India's steel policy, which aims to nearly triple the country's production capacity by fiscal year 2031, has also recommended measures to reduce the dependence on imported coking coal and develop domestic washeries.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has no intention of devaluing its currency, the yuan, to boost its competitiveness, said the head of the country's foreign exchange regulator.  There is also no necessity for China to devalue its currency, Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, wrote in state magazine Qiu Shi. The yuan slumped about 6.5 percent against the dollar last year in its biggest annual drop since 1994. But since then, the yuan has regained its vigour, rising 2.4 percent against the dollar in the first half of 2017. Faced with an entrenched bearish view on the yuan, Beijing moved swiftly to flush out currency speculators, quash expectations of a further steep depreciation and safeguard its reserves. Data this week showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose to $3.057 trillion in June. It was the first time the reserves had climbed for five months in a row since June 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump has also backed away from a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator. Under U.S. law, labelling a country as currency manipulator can trigger an investigation and negotiations on tariffs and trade. Despite the yuan's strength, China's trade balance has stayed at a surplus since March, indicating foreign demand for Chinese goods remains positive.   Capital outflows have eased markedly since the start of the year and are now mostly offset by the trade surplus,  Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Friday.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tibetan rights groups have criticized a U.N. cultural organization's decision to extend world heritage status to an extensive plateau area in a heavily Tibetan area, saying it reinforces Chinese control in the region. The groups argue the UNESCO designation will allow Chinese authorities to remove residents from the area, known as Hoh Xil in Qinghai province, and threaten its environment and nomadic culture.  The (UNESCO) Committee ignored the reality that Tibetans, and nomads in particular, are stewards of the landscape whose role is essential to sustaining the wildlife,  said Kai Mueller, executive director of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). The area has an elevation of more than 4,500 metres (14,764 feet) and is home to several endemic species as well as the entire migratory route of the endangered Tibetan antelope.  The designation of protected areas does not give UNESCO any powers of enforcement, but has proved to be controversial in areas plagued by conflicting territorial claims.  On Friday, UNESCO also designated an ancient shrine in the occupied West Bank, revered by both Jews and Muslims, as a  Palestinian World Heritage Site in Danger , angering Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who called the decision  delusional . The Tibetan rights groups argue the UNESCO designation could accelerate Chinese efforts to move nomads into settled villages.  UNESCO is supposed to uphold and safeguard the world's culture, but this shameful decision will do exactly the opposite and will ultimately assist China in denying Tibetans their fundamental rights,  Pema Yoko, executive director of advocacy group Students for a Free Tibet, said in a statement. At a U.N. forum in March, China was pressed by members to ease its clamp-down on Tibet, in a rare show of direct criticism from member countries. There are also large Tibetan communities in neighboring provinces like Qinghai and Sichuan. China's foreign ministry and did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. China rejects criticism from rights groups and exiles who accuse it of trampling on the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people, saying its rule has brought prosperity to a once-backward region. Chinese representatives argue the new UNESCO status is designed to help protect the area and will not impact traditional culture.  According to the ICT, Chinese representatives on Friday circulated a statement saying they would fully respect the herders and their culture. A UNESCO spokeswoman said the Chinese government had made a commitment that no forced relocation would be undertaken.  They also commit to work with the communities and other stakeholders to ensure protection and management of this site,  the spokeswoman told Reuters. The latest decision brings the number of UNESCO world heritage sites in China to more than 50.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has no intention of devaluing its currency, the yuan, to boost its competitiveness, said the head of the country's foreign exchange regulator.  There is also no necessity for China to devalue its currency, Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, wrote in state magazine Qiu Shi. The yuan slumped about 6.5 percent against the dollar last year in its biggest annual drop since 1994. But since then, the yuan has regained its vigour, rising 2.4 percent against the dollar in the first half of 2017. Faced with an entrenched bearish view on the yuan, Beijing moved swiftly to flush out currency speculators, quash expectations of a further steep depreciation and safeguard its reserves. Data this week showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose to $3.057 trillion in June. It was the first time the reserves had climbed for five months in a row since June 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump has also backed away from a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator. Under U.S. law, labelling a country as currency manipulator can trigger an investigation and negotiations on tariffs and trade. Despite the yuan's strength, China's trade balance has stayed at a surplus since March, indicating foreign demand for Chinese goods remains positive.   Capital outflows have eased markedly since the start of the year and are now mostly offset by the trade surplus,  Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Friday.  This should prove supportive of the renminbi (yuan) which we think, contrary to the consensus, will strengthen against the U.S. dollar during the next couple of years.

Authorities warned of more downpours over the weekend, compounding the misery that the summer storms have brought to southwest Japan since Wednesday. Some neighborhoods have been devastated by flooding and landslides, and rescue workers and residents have been picking their way through expanses of broken, water-logged trees, branches and mud.

{"content":"Puig homers, Utley reaches milestone as Dodgers top Royals LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are winning so often that they don't spend much time admiring their work. Chase Utley drove in the 1,000th run of his 15-year career during the Dodgers' 4-1 win over the Kansas City Royals on Friday, but he didn't bother asking anyone to save the baseball -- it took one of the coaches to get the ball back from Royals catcher Salvador Perez. Yasiel Puig was less impressed with the home run he hit, a 429-foot blast off Jason Hammel (4-8) through the thick, humid air, than the fact he got finally saw a slider that wasn't in the dirt. It all added up to the Dodgers' 24th win their last 28 games, and their 15th win at home in 16 games that pushed their home record to an audacious 37-11. And it came against the hottest team in the American League. Puig's home run in the sixth pushed a Dodger lead to 3-1, which was enough for Kenta Maeda (7-4) and three relievers to snap Kansas City's four-game winning streak. Even with the loss, the Royals are 18-7 in their last 25 and in contention in the AL Central. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at DodgersLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch He pitched well,'' Puig said of Hammel.  But we were able to pick up on what he was throwing. He hung a slider. He threw so many in the dirt, one had to stay up.'' Puig was looking for the slider, moving up in the batter's box on the 2-2 pitch.  I'm going to hurt my shoulder if I keep going after sliders in the dirt,'' he said after his 16th home run of the season, three shy of his career-high 19 in 2013.  I just have to use my wrists more.''  Yasiel doesn't need the marine layer,'' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about the airless evening.  When he hits it good, it's not coming back.'' Utley didn't come out for an ovation after his 1,00th RBI, and ducked in and out of the clubhouse in a flash.  Sorry guys, fireworks,'' he said, referring to the postgame entertainment.  You don't see much emotion with Chase,'' Roberts said.  But 1,000 is a great milestone. We've been anticipating this for a while.'' Royals manager Ned Yost, whose bullpen has been overworked the last week, chose to leave Hammel in for the sixth after giving up seven hits and walking three in the first five innings.  He was coming off a good inning,'' the manager said.  He made a good pitch and he (Puig) went down and got it. We had a chance to get to Maeda early and didn't take it.'' Maeda went five innings, allowing four hits and striking out five in addition to delivering a single that scored a run in the fourth inning. He handed the game to the bullpen, Scott Fields working an inning, Brock Stewart two perfect innings and Kenley Jansen the ninth for his 21st save. Mike Moustakes doubled and scored on an Alcides Escobar single to give the Royals a 1-0 lead in the fourth, but the Dodgers got two back on singles by Utley, Maeda, Logan Forsythe and Corey Seager. Puig homered in the sixth and Utley drove in Joc Pederson with his double in the eighth. NOTES: Dodgers 1B Chase Utley, 38, drove in the 1,000th run of his career, making him one of nine active players with 1,000, joining Albert Pujols, Adrian Beltre, Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Beltran, Matt Holliday, Adrian Gonzalez, Robinson Cano and Victor Martinez. ... Dodgers LHP Alex Wood was named to his first All-Star game, being named as a substitute for teammate Clayton Kershaw on the NL team. Kershaw is scheduled to pitch Sunday and will not be available to play in the game. Wood is 10-0 with a 1.67 ERA and the third Dodger to begin a season 10-0, the others being reliever Ed Roebuck in 1962 and Don Newcombe in 1955. ... Dodgers 3B Justin Turner was given a day off and was not in the starting lineup, a day after winning the final five voting for an All-Star game spot on the NL team. Turner has the highest batting average in the NL at .380 but does not have enough plate appearances to officially qualify. He was on the DL for 19 games earlier this season. He walked as a pinch hitter in the eighth. ... The Dodgers will activate RHP Brandon McCarthy from the 10-day disabled list Saturday and he will start against the Royals. ...

{"content":"Straily, Stanton lead Marlins over Giants SAN FRANCISCO -- Having pitched eight shutout innings for the first time in his career, Miami Marlins right-hander Dan Straily had one more battle to win Friday night. He had to talk Marlins manager Don Mattingly into letting him pitch the ninth. Straily won that 30-second war of words but couldn't finish the Marlins' 6-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants in the opener of a three-game series.  I saw he had that handshake look in his eye,  Straily said of his encounter with Mattingly in the dugout after the eighth inning.  I just told him, 'Let me go for it.' I felt good once I convinced him.  Denard Span's one-out homer ended Straily's shutout bid and his night, but not before he set a career high for innings pitched (8 1/3) and run his career record against the Giants to 4-0. Giancarlo Stanton and J.T. Realmuto hit home runs, and Dee Gordon had four hits, as the Marlins evened their record at 4-4 on a 10-game trip. The loss snapped the Giants' three-game home winning streak and saw them lose one of their top hitters, left fielder Austin Slater, along the way. The rookie injured his right hip trying to run out a ground ball, and is expected to be placed on the disabled list Saturday. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at GiantsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch That's a bad break for the kid, and for us,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  I mean, he was doing a nice job out there. But he's going to be down for a little while. I can't tell you how long.  Straily (7-4) pitched into the ninth inning for the first time in 94 career starts before leaving having allowed one run and four hits. He struck out three and did not walk a batter en route to his third consecutive win.  We were joking (in the dugout) about maybe I wouldn't get any strikeouts,  Straily noted.  Being a fly-ball pitcher in the (San Francisco) Bay, I experienced it on the other side of the Bay (while with the Oakland Athletics). You get the marine air here at night. Just keep throwing strikes and hope they hit it in the air.  Straily is now 2-0 with a 1.13 ERA in two starts in San Francisco. Stanton gave Straily all the offensive support he needed with a two-run homer in a four-run first inning off Giants left-hander Matt Moore (3-9). The All-Star added a double in the fourth inning, coming within a couple of feet of scaling the 25-foot right field wall at AT&T; Park for the second time in one game.  That was impressive,  Straily said of his teammate's opposite-field power display.  He's a lot of fun to watch on a daily basis.  Only 40 balls hit by right-handers have cleared the wall in the 18-year history of the ballpark. Realmuto had three hits, and Stanton, Christian Yelich, Justin Bour and JT Riddle added two hits apiece for the Marlins, who will return home after the series to host the All-Star Game festivities beginning Monday. Span's homer landed in the San Francisco Bay beyond the right field wall, his third career  Splash Hit  and the 74th in Giants history. Joe Panik had two doubles for the Giants, who began a stretch of 21 of 29 at home. The Marlins out-hit the Giants 16-5. Moore was pulled after 3 1/3 innings, having allowed a career-high-tying 12 hits and five runs. He struck out one and did not walk a batter.  That's a lot of hits there in 3 1/3 (innings),  Bochy said.  It was just one of those nights where it wasn't going well for him, but he actually was pounding the strike zone well. He just didn't expand a few times when he needed to. The stuff was fine; he just made too many mistakes.  Stanton's homer, his 24th of the season, came on Moore's seventh pitch of the game. It followed a game-opening infield single by Gordon. Moore got the next two Marlins out but then served up four consecutive singles, including a bases-loaded, two-run hit to Riddle that made it 4-0. Bour's second hit, a two-out single in the second, plated Gordon for a 5-0 lead. Realmuto made it 6-0 in the fifth with his eighth homer of the year, a solo shot off Cory Gearrin. NOTES: Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton's home run was the first over the right field wall at AT&T; Park by a right-handed hitter since Giants INF/OF Kelby Tomlimson accomplished the feat in October 2015. There has never been a  Splash Hit  by a right-handed batter in the history of AT&T; Park. ... The homers by Stanton and J.T. Realmuto gave the Marlins 100 for the season. It's the fourth time they've reached the century mark before the All-Star break, the first time since 2008. ... The career-high-tying 12 hits allowed by Giants LHP Matt Moore equaled the number he allowed to the Baltimore Orioles while pitching for the Tampa Bay Rays on June 9, 2013. He has allowed 10 or more hits six times in his career, three of them this season. ... Marlins LHP Chris O'Grady is slated to make his major league debut in the second game of the series Saturday. He was promoted from Triple-A New Orleans on Friday, taking the place on the active roster of RHP Edinson Volquez (tendinitis in left knee), who was placed on the disabled list. ... The Giants made two transactions before the game, promoting INF Miguel Gomez from Double-A Richmond and reinstating 3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms) from the DL while demoting RHP Chris Stratton to Triple-A Sacramento and placing 3B Ryder Jones (bruised right wrist) on the DL.","keywords":"Austin Slater,Bruce Bochy,Chris O'Grady,Chris Stratton,Christian Yelich,Conor Gillaspie,Cory Gearrin,Dan Straily,Denard Span,Don Mattingly,Edinson Volquez,Giancarlo Stanton,J.T.

{"content":"Cruz hits HR No. 300, Mariners KO Athletics SEATTLE -- With the Seattle Mariners having lost eight home games in a row, they decided to try something completely different Friday. Like everyone using Jean Segura's walk-up music,  El Que Fue,  by Mexican pop star Samo. There was some method behind the madness, as the Seattle shortstop was coming off three consecutive multi-hit games, including a four-hit effort in the series opener Thursday against Oakland.  (Thursday night) he told us we should all hit to that song,  Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz said.  In the hitter's meeting (Friday), I told them to play it all night.  The move worked, especially for the All-Star cleanup hitter. Cruz hit his 300th career home run and drove in five runs as the Mariners defeated the Athletics 7-2. Cruz had run-scoring singles in his first two at-bats, then cranked a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning off A's reliever Liam Hendriks. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarinersOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch Some guys are already tired of it,  Cruz said of Segura's taste in music.  I'm going to dream that song.  Cruz received a standing ovation after his milestone homer and popped back up to the top step of the dugout to tip his helmet to the fans. He said it was the first time he's ever had a curtain call.  It's special,  said Cruz, who is tied for the major league lead with 68 RBIs this season.  It's a long way from the Dominican. Never in my dreams would I hit 300 home runs in the big leagues.  Cruz's big night overshadowed a strong performance by left-hander James Paxton (7-3), who allowed just two runs on two hits in seven innings and tied his season high with nine strikeouts. Paxton won his second straight decision after a three-game losing streak.  Paxton was really good. He turned up the dial,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  That's what ace-type pitchers do.  Oakland's Sean Manaea (7-5) nearly matched Paxton but left after seven innings with his team trailing 3-2. The left-hander, who was 6-1 with a 2.84 ERA in nine starts since suffering a loss May 15 at Seattle, allowed three runs on eight hits. He walked one and struck out three.  All things considered he gave us seven innings when it looked like he might give us four, and really should have given up one run,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  There are times when he doesn't have his good stuff, and he ends up pitching like that. For a young kid, he's come a long way and now he's able to battle and get through tough stretches. He pitched well enough to win that game, for sure.  The Mariners teed off on Hendriks, the Australian right-hander, in the eighth. Danny Valencia led off with a double down the right-field and Robinson Cano walked. Cruz hit the next pitch 433 feet into left-center field to make it 6-2.  I don't know what the exit velocity on that, but it was a rocket,  Servais said. Mitch Haniger followed with a one-hop double off the center-field fence. That was all for Hendriks, who didn't retire any of the four batters he faced. Haniger advanced to third on a wild pitch from Zach Neal and scored on Kyle Seager's sacrifice fly for the final margin. The Mariners took the lead in the first as Valencia and Cano singled with one out and Cruz hit a run-scoring single to left field. The A's responded with two runs in the third. With one out, Matt Joyce singled to right and moved to second on a throwing error following Ryan Lavarnway's flyout. After a walk to Rajai Davis, Marcus Semien hit a two-run double down the left-field line. The Mariners regained the lead in the bottom of the inning as Segura and Valencia led off with singles. Cano grounded into a fielder's choice to put runners at first and third, and Segura scored on another run-scoring single by Cruz, making it 2-2. A single by Haniger loaded the bases and Cano scored the go-ahead run on Seager's sacrifice fly to center field.  Pitching, defense and timely hitting is a good recipe for us,  Servais said. NOTES: Mariners 2B Robinson Cano was named an injury replacement for the American League in next Tuesday's All-Star Game in Miami. ... Seattle made a roster move, sending starting RHP Sam Gaviglio, who suffered the loss Thursday, to Triple-A Tacoma and calling up RHP Emilio Pagan. ... A's RHP Chris Smith, 36, is scheduled to be selected from Triple-A Nashville to make his first major league start Saturday against rookie Mariners RHP Andrew Moore (1-1, 3.60 ERA).

{"content":"D-backs remain tough at home, top Reds PHOENIX -- Zack Greinke stepped up when the Arizona needed him the most Friday. Greinke threw seven scoreless innings in the Diamondbacks' 6-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field, stopping a three-game losing streak marked by three one-run losses to the National League West-leading Dodgers. Arizona failed to hold a 4-1 lead in the ninth inning of a 5-4 loss Thursday.  I felt like it was a big win,  Greinke said.  It was a bad series in L.A. We played close but just didn't get any wins. It's nice to get a win and have some positive thoughts again.  Greinke (11-4) gave up four hits, struck out seven and walked one while extending his home dominance.

Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DiamondbacksCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch We had the right guy step up,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.  When a No. 1 guy is on board, you really appreciate these moments. He was the right guy for us at the right time. He did exactly what he is supposed to do.  I know nothing changes to his approach, but I think he had the weight of 24 guys on his shoulders and he carried all of it.  Paul Goldschmidt hit his 20th homer and Greinke singled in a run as the Diamondbacks (53-34) extended the best start in franchise history. Arizona is 33-13 at home, the second-best home record in the majors. Greinke had a busy night all the way around. He was hit by a pitch in the left forearm in a two-run second inning and drove in a run with a two-out single in the fourth for a 3-0 lead.  It didn't affect anything,  Greinke said of the spot where he was hit.  It was no big deal.  The Diamondbacks led 6-0 before the Reds scored three in the ninth inning. All-Star Joey Votto hit a two-run homer with no outs off T.J. McFarland and Schebler added a bases-empty homer off Jake Barrett with two outs. After Peraza beat out an infield single, Fernando Rodney entered and got the final out for his 22nd save. Rodney did not retire any of the six batters he faced while giving up four runs in the ninth inning Thursday.  We lost a few in a row, but it was not the first time,  Goldschmidt said.  That was really behind us. Zack pitched great. We got those two runs early and then we were able to add on and close it out.  The Reds (37-49) are 14-29 on the road. Only the Phillies have fewer road wins. Brandon Drury had two doubles, two walks and an RBI and Goldschmidt had his 67th RBI, tied with teammate Jake Lamb and Miami left fielder Marcell Ozuna for second in majors to Colorado's Nolan Arenado (68). Drury doubled in a run and scored in the second, and doubled and scored in the fourth. Goldschmidt homered to make it 4-0 in the fifth, and David Peralta doubled in a run in a two-run seventh and scored the other when he stole third and came around on an errant throw. Adam Duvall had two hits for the Reds.  We have the ability to score runs, as we saw there late in the game,  Cincinnati manager Bryan Price said.  We didn't do much with Greinke.  NOTES: Cincinnati signed No. 1 draft pick Hunter Greene, the second overall selection in the June draft, for a $7.23 million bonus on the final day draftees could sign.  I don't think it's exaggerating that it came down to seconds, not minutes,  Reds general manager Dick Williams said. ... The Diamondbacks drew 27,006 for Game of Thrones night, including about 2,500 who purchased a themed Game of Thrones package that included seating along the third base line.","keywords":"Adam Duvall,Brandon Drury,Bryan Price,Chris Owings,David Peralta,Dick Williams,Eugenio Suarez,Fernando Rodney,Greene,Jake Barrett,Jake Lamb,Jeff Mathis,Joey Votto,Jordan Zimmermann,Jose Fernandez,Jose Peraza,Marcell Ozuna,Nolan Arenado,Paul Goldschmidt,Scott Schebler,T.J.

{"content":"(Repeats with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2uxKwbb By John Kemp LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. independent oil and gas producers came close to breaking even during the first quarter of 2017 thanks to aggressive cost cutting and improvements in well productivity. Some shale producers claim they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. But Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources , a major producer in North Dakota and Oklahoma, has said oil prices need to be above $50 to be sustainable. Prices below $40 would force producers to idle rigs again, he said in a recent interview (“Harold Hamm warns oil prices below $40 will idle U.S. drilling”, CNBC, June 28). The renewed drop in oil prices, unless quickly reversed, looks set to put these conflicting claims to the test. Fifteen independent producers with operations focused on the United States reported a combined net loss of $3.7 billion in the first three months of 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2uxKwbb). But most of the losses were attributable to Marathon Oil, which reported a net loss of $4.9 billion, mostly as a result of an impairment charge linked to its Canadian oil sands businesses. The other fourteen companies in the sample reported total net income of almost $1.3 billion, up from a loss of $9.9 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Ten companies in the sample reported positive net income during the first quarter, up from just two in the previous quarter and none in the first quarter of 2016. Financial performance for the companies in the sample has been steadily improving since losses peaked at $23 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shale producers have benefited from a combination of cost reductions, improvements in drilling efficiency and well productivity, and a significant increase in oil and gas prices. The average price of WTI, the domestic benchmark, rose from $33 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 to $52 in the first quarter of 2017. The average price of gas delivered to Henry Hub rose from just $2 per million British thermal units to $3.07 over the same period. But benchmark oil prices fell by 7 percent in the second quarter, though gas prices were up 2 percent. Both oil and gas prices have slid so far in the third quarter. Given the precarious profitability of oil producers in the first quarter when oil prices were above $50, the slide in WTI during the second and third quarters will renew the pressure on drilling firms. Unless there are further exceptional write-downs, the sample group may be able to increase their net income in the second quarter despite the fall in prices. Many, though not all, shale producers have hedged the price of their output for the remainder of 2017 which gives them some protection in the short-term against the downturn. But very little production has been hedged so far for 2018. The current calendar strip means hedging is only possible for 2018 at a WTI price of around $47 - and many shale producers will actually receive less.

{"content":"Rockies break out, batter White Sox DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies collectively exhaled and wasted no time doing it when their sputtering offense instantly came alive Friday night. Colorado scored four runs in the first inning and added two more in the second while pounding the Chicago White Sox 12-4. The four-run first was the Rockies' biggest inning since they scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth on June 18 to beat San Francisco. The victory was just fourth in 16 games for the Rockies, who had averaged 3.2 runs per game during their 3-12 slide. They matched their season high in runs scored. It's the fourth time they have scored 12 runs. Colorado also reached a season-high with 17 hits, 11 coming with two strikes.  I think we are more of that team that we saw tonight than what we've seen in the last couple weeks,  Rockies manager Bud Black said. The win was Black's 700th as a major league manager. While grateful for the milestone, Black didn't want to call any personal attention to it. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RockiesChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch Hopefully, there's more of these from a team standpoint to come,  Black said. DJ LeMahieu, Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado, who had three hits and a season-high five RBIs, homered for the Rockies, who added to the recent misery of White Sox starter Derek Holland. Blackmon had three hits, as did Gerardo Parra, who was reinstated Friday from the 10-disabled list after missing 28 games.  It was good to get off to a start like that,  Arenado said.  I felt we hadn't done that in a long time. I feel like we've been behind or it's taken us five or six innings (to get rolling) ...It was nice to win like that after what we've been going through lately.  Pitcher German Marquez, who had two career hits in 25 at-bats, matched that total with a double, his first extra-base hit, and a single. He scored two runs, one more than he had scored in his career, trotting home on the two-run shots by LeMahieu and Arenado. Arenado has five games with five or more RBIs. More importantly for the Rockies, Marquez (6-4) pitched well. After pitching six innings in just one of his past seven starts, Marquez worked seven innings -- his longest outing since he pitched a career-high eight innings May 10 against the Chicago Cubs -- and threw 73 of 102 pitches for strikes. Marquez gave up nine hits and three runs in seven innings with no walks for the first time this season and five strikeouts. He gave up a run in the first when Todd Frazier doubled and moved up on a fly ball and a grounder and yielded a two-run homer to Tim Anderson in the seventh.  (No walks) was the key,  Marquez said.  My (fastball) location was amazing, and my curve was really good today.  Holland (5-9) is 1-6 with an 8.76 ERA in his past eight starts with 12 home runs allowed in 37 innings and is 0-4 with an 18.44 ERA in his past four road starts. Coming off a losing start against Texas when he yielded five hits and five runs in 5 1/3 innings, Holland surrendered eight hits and seven runs in four innings, The first six Rockies reached base against him. Arenado singled home a run after Blackmon walked and LeMahieu singled. With the bases loaded, Parra drove in a run with an infield single that ricocheted off Holland's glove toward second base. Trevor Story followed with a two-run single. After the White Sox manufactured a run in the second, Marquez doubled down the left-field line to open the second inning and scored on LeMahieu's fourth homer.  Today was just flat-out embarrassing,  Holland said.  I don't even know where to begin. I put my teammates in a hole, gave up four runs right out of the gate. Then they put up a run for me, and of course, I go back out there and give up another run. It's a frustrating thing on my part.  I'm not doing my job. I need to be a lot better than I was for this start and my last start. The only positive is I've gotten through half the year so far healthy. That's a big plus. But I'm upset with how I've pitched these last two starts.  NOTES: Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) will begin a rehab assignment July 13 at Double-A Hartford.

{"content":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Two U.S. supersonic bombers conducted live-fire drills on Saturday in South Korea in a show of force following North Korea's test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the South's military said. The pair of B-1B Lancer strategic bombers flew from a U.S. base on Guam and were joined by U.S. and South Korean jet fighters to conduct the simulated destruction of an enemy ballistic missile launcher and underground facilities, the South's air force said. North Korea announced on Tuesday it successfully test-launched an ICBM, saying the missile was capable of carrying a large and heavy nuclear warhead. Some experts believe the missile has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and the test signaled a significant advance in the North's declared intent to build a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the test indicated a quicker than expected pace of the North's ICBM program. The B-1B bombers conducted the live-fire exercise at a range in South Korea's eastern Gangwon province, dropping weapons in a simulated attack on a missile launcher, the South Korean air force said in a statement. South Korean and U.S. fighter jets conducted precision strike drills aimed at attacking enemy targets hidden underground, it said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the bombers then flew west, hugging the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border between the two Koreas, before leaving South Korean airspace. The drill follows a joint artillery and missile exercise by South Korean and U.S. forces a day after the North's ICBM test.

South Korean Air Force/Yonhap via REUTERSTrump Warning Despite the sabre-rattling, the United States and South Korea have said they are committed to resolving the crisis over the North's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile peacefully. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday in Hamburg, where the leaders of G20 nations are meeting, there would not be many good options left on North Korea if the peaceful pressure campaign failed. Slideshow (2 Images)U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to confront the North  very strongly  and said  Washington was considering  severe things  for the isolated state following the ICBM test.     The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution to put new sanctions on North Korea.  On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Trump, Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to apply  maximum pressure  to counter the North nuclear threat. North Korea has hailed the ICBM test as marking the completion of is strategic weapons capability that it says includes atomic and hydrogen bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a mausoleum honouring state founder Kim Il Sun on Saturday, the anniversary of his grandfather's death, the North's official KCNA news agency reported. He was joined by military officials who contributed to the success of the ICBM test, the news agency said.

{"content":"Aguilar's 7 RBIs fuel Brewers' comeback win over Yankees NEW YORK -- As Jesus Aguilar concluded his first postgame interview at Yankee Stadium, Ice Cube's 1992 hit  Today was a Good Day  blared on the sound system inside the Milwaukee Brewers' clubhouse. To say it was a good day for Aguilar might be a major understatement. Aguilar produced one of the greatest showings in Milwaukee's history when he tied a club record with seven RBIs and hit a tiebreaking grand slam with two outs in the top of the seventh inning as the Brewers overcame five errors in a 9-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Friday.  He's a rookie doing this,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said of Aguilar, who was claimed off waivers from the Cleveland Indians on Feb. 2 after appearing in 35 games in parts of the previous three seasons.  It feels like an experienced at-bat. He knows what he's doing. He's putting together professional at-bats. He has a plan. He knows what he can and can't do and he's a very mature hitter certainly when he steps in the box.  Hours after visiting Monument Park, Aguilar hit his first career grand slam onto the netting above the attraction beyond the left-center field wall to give Milwaukee an 8-4 lead. He hit the homer on 3-2 fastball against Tyler Clippard to cap a seven-pitch at-bat. Aguilar's grand slam marked the 11th seven-RBI game in team history and first since Ryan Braun on Aug. 6 at Arizona. It also was the most by any rookie in team history. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at YankeesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchAguilar became the first rookie to get seven RBIs since San Diego's Hunter Renfroe on Sept. 27 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also was the second rookie with at least seven RBIs against the Yankees, joining Walt Dropo, who did it for the Boston Red Sox on July 1, 1950. Before connecting off Clippard, Aguilar hit a two-run homer on a full count in the third inning off Jordan Montgomery and lifted a sacrifice fly to put the game in a 4-4 deadlock. Aguilar's second homer also occurred after Aaron Judge made some history of his own with a solo shot off Josh Hader (1-0) in the fifth. Judge's latest blast gave him 30 for the season and broke the mark he shared with Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who hit 29 as a rookie in 1936. Judge's home run became an afterthought for the Brewers thanks to Aguilar's big night. He entered the game second among rookies in batting average and increased it 13 points to .299.  I'm very very happy. I'm happy I tied Braun's record, but most important I'm happy that we got the win,  Aguilar said through a translator.  That's all that matters. As long as we keep winning. We just got to keep playing the way we've been playing and just try to keep winning. I'm happy to be able to help the team.  The Brewers continued playing well despite committing five errors for the first time on the road since July 21, 1984, at Oakland.  I'm pretty sure that doesn't happen,  Aguilar said.  The most important thing is We came back from it. We put our heads up. We kept having good at-bats, we kept having a good game and, we were able to win.  Coincidentally, Aguilar made the last of those errors as he dropped a throw from Junior Guerra right before a 51-minute rain delay. Before the delay, right fielder Domingo Santana and second baseman Jonathan Villar made two fielding errors apiece, but the Yankees only scored three runs on a sacrifice fly by Clint Frazier and a two-run homer by Ji-Man Choi. By not being able to stop Aguilar from producing the best game of his brief career, the Yankees lost for the 17th time in 23 games since June 12. New York lost a game when its opponent made five errors for the second time since 1962 (also July 9, 1995 at Texas).  It's really disappointing, but we didn't have many hits,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  They gave us some opportunities through their errors and we scored some runs, but we didn't have a lot of hits tonight.  Before allowing Aguilar's grand slam, Clippard (1-5) threw a wild pitch that scored Braun ahead of the game-tying sacrifice fly. He also walked Villar and Santana in the seventh and the Yankees opted to intentionally walk left-handed third baseman Travis Shaw.  I was trying to throw a good fastball down and away and didn't execute,  Clippard said.  I was trying to go down and away and it leaked middle-middle.  Guerra was lifted with a right shin contusion after allowing three runs (one earned) and two hits in 3 1/3 innings. Hader struck out seven in three innings after Judge homered off him. Before New York's bullpen faltered again, Montgomery allowed two runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. He came out after the rain delay but was lifted after allowing consecutive hits to Orlando Arcia and Villar. NOTES: DH Matt Holliday (viral infection) took early batting practice and will play two games at designated hitter in a minor league rehab assignment. He anticipates he will be ready by next weekend when the Yankees are in Boston. ... Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said RHP Wily Peralta (strained right calf) will need at least two more rehab starts. ...

{"content":"Twins rally for 9-6 win over Orioles MINNEAPOLIS -- Rookie Trevor Hildenberger entered Friday's game with the Minnesota Twins down 6-0 against the Baltimore Orioles and knew he just needed to halt the slide and give Minnesota some quality innings. Hildenberger did his job. Four others relievers matched him and the Twins' offense finally broke through against Kevin Gausman. Kennys Vargas had three hits and drove in two runs in his return from the minors, Eddie Rosario added three hits and the Twins' bullpen supplied 6 1/3 scoreless innings in Friday's 9-6 comeback win against the Orioles.  I think the best part of it was the big comeback,  Hildenberger said after his first major league win.  Being in the dugout for those two big rallies was really, really fun. It kind of makes me want to be in the dugout all the time. It wasn't just me. The whole bullpen put up zeroes all game. (Ryan) Pressly came in and picked me up after that. (Matt) Belisle with some big outs, and (Taylor) Rogers and (Brandon) Kintzler have been nails all year.  Vargas returned from Triple-A Rochester after Joe Mauer went on the disabled list with back issues and hammered two balls off the outfield wall, including a two-run double in the go-ahead fifth inning. Minnesota has now won all five games against Baltimore this season. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch We just have to battle every pitch, and try and get back in the game run by run,  Vargas said.  We're just still fighting, taking good at-bats. We got those hits at the right moment. That was the key.  Hildenberger (1-0) gave up two hits and struck out three batters in 2 1/3 innings in relief of starter Felix Jorge. On the day he was named an All-Star, Brandon Kintzler finished off his American League-leading 24th save in 27 chances. Miguel Castro (1-1) took the loss in relief of Gausman. Castro allowed one run on two hits in one inning of work. Manny Machado had four hits, including two homers. Seth Smith added a solo home run for the Orioles, who've lost five games in a row and seven of their past eight.  They're a good team over there and you got to give them credit for what they're doing,  Machado said.  It's baseball. We all struggle some way or another. We go 0 for 30, pitchers can get rocked all day, it's just part of the game. This is what we're going through right now, and it's just going to make us stronger down the line.  Jorge's second career start wouldn't go as well as his debut last week when he earned a win against the Kansas City Royals. Smith opened the game with his ninth homer of the season and the seventh of his career leading off a game. Machado followed with a home run for the Orioles' sixth set of back-to-back homers this season. It was the first time since May 20, 2016, against the Angels that Baltimore had done so leading off a game. Jorge walked No. 9 hitter Ruben Tejada leading off the third and the top of the Orioles' order again went to work. Smith singled and Machado followed with a three-run homer. It was the 11th multi-homer game of Machado's career and the second this season. Trey Mancini added an RBI single to end Jorge's night. Meanwhile, Gausman was controlling the Twins on the other side. The right-hander had thrown 12 1/3 scoreless innings in his previous two starts and didn't allow a run until unraveling in the fourth. Miguel Sano and Max Kepler had infield singles with one out. Vargas singled to right field to load the bases. Rosario plated one run with a single to center and the bases remained loaded. Chris Gimenez was hit by a pitch to bring another run but two strikeouts got Gausman out of the jam. Brian Dozier started the fifth with a triple, followed by Robbie Grossman's RBI double. Machado's throwing error allowed Sano to reach base. Kepler added an RBI single, Vargas knocked a two-run double and Gimenez laced an RBI single off Castro for a 7-6 lead.  I wanted to be the guy to kind of right the ship, turn us around tonight and then have two more games of this series,  Gausman said.  Hopefully we kind of gain some momentum and get some momentum going into the break. We got to off to a great start offensively, six runs in the first couple innings just what a starting pitcher wants.  I just tried to battle as much as I could. I left a couple key pitches in bad spots. Unfortunately, those infield hits kind of came around and scored. You just got to try to minimize.

{"content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone economy still needs a long period of easy monetary policy and a shift in message that induced a market selloff last week was merely a nuanced change to reflect better growth, European Central Bank chief economist Peter Praet said.  The ECB still needs to be patient and persistent with stimulus as inflation is a  long way  from getting back to the ECB's 2 percent target, Praet told Belgian newspaper De Standaard, likely hoping to temper expectations of an imminent policy shift.  ECB President Mario Draghi stirred markets last week when he argued that better growth in itself would provide increased support, allowing the ECB to curb its own stimulus to keep the overall level of accommodation broadly unchanged. That message was taken as a signal that the ECB could announce as soon as September a reduction in asset buys, already running for over two years with the aim of reviving spending, growth and eventually inflation.  I see it more as an evolution in our communications,  Praet, a key Draghi ally said, according to an interview published on Saturday.  The tone was rather optimistic regarding growth, and rightly so.   Now indeed inflation is picking up, but that is a process that is a long way from completion,  Praet added.  The process of reflation is a long one that remains highly dependent on accommodative monetary policy.  The ECB will decide in September or October whether to wind down its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme from next year or extend the buys, having to resolve an apparent contradiction between accelerating growth and subdued inflation.  We need to be patient because inflation convergence needs more time,  Praet said.  And we need to be persistent, because our baseline for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions.   As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive,  Praet said.  This will reinforce accommodation.

{"content":"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Populist former martial arts star and businessman Khaltmaa Battulga has won Mongolia's presidential run-off election, according to voter data from the General Election Commission released on Saturday. The poll was seen as a referendum on the government's economic recovery plans and the role of southern neighbor China in the landlocked but resource-rich country known as the birthplace of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan. Battulga, of the opposition Democratic Party, won with 50.6 percent of the vote on a 60.9 percent turnout, giving him the majority needed to overcome his opponent, parliament speaker Miyeegombo Enkhbold of the ruling Mongolian People's Party.

The election campaign was marred by political mudslinging from all sides and the public perception that none of the candidates were fit for the job, according to Luvsanvandan Sumati, the head of polling group the Sant Maral Foundation.

{"content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone economy still needs a long period of easy monetary policy and a shift in message that induced a market selloff last week was merely a nuanced change to reflect better growth, European Central Bank chief economist Peter Praet said.  The ECB still needs to be patient and persistent with stimulus as inflation is a  long way  from getting back to the ECB's 2 percent target, Praet told Belgian newspaper De Standaard, likely hoping to temper expectations of an imminent policy shift.  ECB President Mario Draghi stirred markets last week when he argued that better growth in itself would provide increased support, allowing the ECB to curb its own stimulus to keep the overall level of accommodation broadly unchanged. That message was taken as a signal that the ECB could announce as soon as September a reduction in asset buys, already running for over two years with the aim of reviving spending, growth and eventually inflation.  I see it more as an evolution in our communications,  Praet, a key Draghi ally said, according to an interview published on Saturday.  The tone was rather optimistic regarding growth, and rightly so.   Now indeed inflation is picking up, but that is a process that is a long way from completion,  Praet added.  The process of reflation is a long one that remains highly dependent on accommodative monetary policy.  The ECB will decide in September or October whether to wind down its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme from next year or extend the buys, having to resolve an apparent contradiction between accelerating growth and subdued inflation.  We need to be patient because inflation convergence needs more time,  Praet said.  And we need to be persistent, because our baseline for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions.   As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive,  Praet said.  This will reinforce accommodation.

{"content":"DeGrom, Mets survive slugfest with Cardinals ST. LOUIS -- Jacob deGrom said it wasn't fun to give up four homers in a game for the first time in his career. But because it occurred as part of a win, the ignominious feat went down a little bit easier for the New York Mets' ace. Overcoming the St. Louis Cardinals' barrage of long balls, deGrom picked up his fifth consecutive victory Friday night, working seven innings in the Mets' 6-5 decision. In upping his record to 9-3, deGrom allowed eight hits and four runs, walking none and fanning five. The four homers were St. Louis' first four hits of the game, so deGrom never worked from the stretch until Paul DeJong's leadoff single in the fifth.  It was not fun, but at least they were solo shots,  deGrom said.  Our guys kept putting up runs for me, so I had to figure it out. I had to start getting the ball down. You just try to forget about the bad ones.  After retiring the first six men he faced, deGrom coughed up a 419-foot blast to Randal Grichuk and a 418-foot shot to DeJong to start the third. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at CardinalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchTo begin the fourth, deGrom surrendered the Cardinals' second pair of back-to-back jacks in as many innings, as Dexter Fowler and Jedd Gyorko both drilled pitches over the right field wall. Jose Reyes and Jay Bruce unloaded solo shots for New York before the fifth inning was done on a night where normally pitcher-friendly Busch Stadium might as well have been Coors Field. The six combined homers were one off the record for a game at the 12-year old ballpark.  You could feel it tonight -- the ball was jumping,  St. Louis second baseman Matt Carpenter said.  You'd stand on second and the wind would blow in your face.  But deGrom, who got two extra days of rest because of a rainout in Washington on Wednesday night and an off-day Thursday, survived. He induced two 5-4-3 double plays to work out of trouble in the fifth and sixth innings, and handed a 6-4 lead to the bullpen.  It goes back to what we talk about all the time -- he's a competitive kid,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  He had great velocity with the extra rest, but his location was off.  Fortunately for New York (39-45), Cardinals ace Carlos Martinez (6-8) endured a second straight five-inning, five-run outing. Working without his top stuff or command, Martinez permitted seven hits and three walks, fanning four.  I didn't feel too great about it,  Martinez said through an interpreter.  I was trying my hardest, but for some reason, my pitches weren't (going) where I wanted them to.  Martinez walked the first two batters of the game and hit T.J. Rivera with the bases loaded later in the first, giving the Mets a cheap run. Reyes made it 2-0 to start the second with his ninth homer. After St. Louis' first set of consecutive homers, New York regained a two-run lead. Travis d'Arnaud singled home Reyes, and Curtis Granderson laced a 3-0 pitch down the right field line to score deGrom, on base after forcing out d'Arnaud. In the fifth, Bruce whacked his 22nd homer on a 1-2 breaking ball that drifted over the plate's middle. The 401-foot shot was his fourth career hit against Martinez, doubling his total before the game.  We were hitting mistakes,  Bruce said.  He left some balls out over the plate.  Rivera's RBI double in the seventh scored Yoenis Cespedes, who reached on Carpenter's third error in five games, with what proved to be the winning run. Gyorko's sacrifice fly in the eighth drew the Cardinals (41-45) within one, but closer Addison Reed sailed through a clean ninth on 11 pitches for his 15th save in 17 chances. NOTES: St. Louis activated CF Dexter Fowler (right heel spur) from the 10-day DL and optioned OF Jose Martinez to Triple-A Memphis. Fowler, who missed 12 games with the injury, batted third and went 1-for-4. ... New York OF Michael Conforto (bruised left hand) went 3-for-4 Thursday night in a rehab game for Class A St. Lucie against Charlotte. Conforto, the Mets' only representative for Tuesday night's All-Star Game, could be activated Saturday. ... The Cardinals sent LHP Kevin Siegrist (cervical spine strain) to Double-A Springfield to start a rehab assignment. Siegrist pitched a scoreless inning, allowing a hit and fanning one.","keywords":"Addison Reed,Asdrubal Cabrera,Carlos Martinez,Curtis Granderson,Dexter Fowler,Jacob deGrom,Jay Bruce,Jedd Gyorko,Jose Martinez,Jose Reyes,Kevin Siegrist,Matt Carpenter,Michael Conforto,Paul DeJong,Randal Grichuk,Terry Collins,Travis d'Arnaud,Yoenis Cespedes,BBO,METS,CARDINALS,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-08 00:34:00","news_title":"DeGrom, Mets survive slugfest with Cardinals","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED78R5D0TG"}
{"content":"Hamels, Rangers overpower Angels in rout ARLINGTON, Texas -- Cole Hamels' new look was a rousing success. The left-hander, who shaved his beard and showed off a new mustache, allowed just three singles in 7 2/3 innings as the Texas Rangers pounded the Los Angeles Angels 10-0 on Friday night. The victory gave the Rangers consecutive wins for the first time since June 24-25 and they reached double figures in runs for just the second time since June 23. The Angels have dropped four of their last five games and six of eight. Hamels (4-0) matched his season high with six strikeouts and has posted 13 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings, the longest streak by a Texas starter this season. He got all the run support he'd need in the first when Texas scored three times off Ricky Nolasco (4-10), which was more than enough for Hamels and two relievers as the Rangers notched their fourth shutout of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at RangersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch I was just being aggressive in the strike zone,  Hamels said.  That's something I was really trying to focus on in the last start. I'm still working on it but at the same time if I can still make hitters uncomfortable and try to get the count in my favor, throw a lot of pitches that might not be strikes but look like strikes and get some good swings to be my advantage, it definitely eases everything.  So does a bunch of offensive support, which Texas had in winning by double digits for the second time this year. Rougned Odor's RBI single gave Texas its first run and Jonathan Lucroy followed with a two-run double to left. Nolasco, who hadn't allowed a run in his last two starts, didn't make it out of the second inning as the Rangers tacked on five more runs to build an 8-0 lead. Nomar Mazara's RBI single increased the Texas lead to 4-0 before Adrian Beltre hit a three-run homer to left. Odor followed with a solo homer to right to give Texas its first back-to-back homers on the season. That ended the night for Nolasco. He was charged with eight runs on seven hits in 1 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.  It was a pretty terrible game,  Nolasco said.  I put us in a huge hole, just a bad game. All around I wasn't hitting any of my spots. I have to shake it off and be ready for the next one. It's just one start. You say it's just one of those days. Shake it off and keep going forward.  It didn't help that the Angels weren't able to avoid the big inning after getting two outs. Texas scored all eight of its runs off Nolasco with two outs in the inning. He retired the first two batters in the bottom of the first before Mazara got the Texas offense going with a walk. It was downhill for him and the Angels from there.  Two quick outs in the first inning, then those guys backed up hit after hit,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  Then in the just, just begging behind guys and then, when he (Nolasco) did get ahead, just didn't put guys away. His stuff wasn't as crisp today. Those guys had a good offensive day. We've got to turn the page on it.  Texas finished with 12 hits, including two from Beltre. His homer was part of a 2-for-4 night and the three RBIs moved him past Mike Schmidt and into a tie with George Brett for 32nd on the all-time list with 1,596.  I'm seeing the ball OK,  Beltre said.  It's a work in progress. Obviously, I could be better. I'm surprised I'm able to catch those guys. I'm glad it happened obviously. It means that I've been playing for a long time. That's it.  Odor also had three hits and two RBIs. Mazara blasted a two-run homer to right-center in the sixth inning and finished with two hits, three RBIs and three runs scored. Delino DeShields also had two hits. Los Angeles didn't have a runner reach second base in the game. Albert Pujols singled twice and accounted for two of his team's three hits as the Angels were shut out for the eighth time this season, with three of those coming in the last 10 games. NOTES: Texas recalled INFO Drew Robinson from Triple-A Round Rock. He took the roster spot of RHP Nick Martinez, who was optioned to Triple-A Wednesday. ... The Angels recalled 1B C.J.

{"content":"Padres, Hedges clip Phillies with 9th-inning sac fly PHILADELPHIA -- The final ball that San Diego catcher Austin Hedges hit on Friday night didn't leave Citizens Bank Park like the first two did. It was plenty good enough, though, as Hedges' sacrifice fly in the ninth inning lifted the Padres to a 4-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on a rainy Friday night at Citizens Bank Park. Despite coming through with the game-winning RBI, Hedges afterward was lamenting the fact he didn't do what he was originally supposed to -- lay down a suicide squeeze to try and drive the winning run home. Instead of getting the bunt in play, Hedges whiffed on the first two attempts, forcing him to get it done a different way.  I should have gotten the safety squeeze down. I would have been a lot more excited about it -- well, that's false, I was excited about the sac fly,  he said.  Obviously, I wish I got the sac (bunt) down but to still go out and win the at-bat, that's tough to do after you screw up what you're supposed to.  The sacrifice fly capped off a powerful offensive night for Hedges, who earlier hit two solo home runs for his first multi-homer game in the major leagues. It was the last at-bat that most impressed his manager, however. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at PhilliesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatch You've got a strikeout pitcher on the mound with a very good split and a very good high fastball and if you're evaluating where (Hedges') strengths and weaknesses reside, that's not the greatest matchup,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  Which is great credit to him that even with two strikes he managed to get the job done today. That was a great job after not getting the safety squeeze down.  A 94-minute rain delay midway through the seventh inning helped the Phillies get right back into a game they had trailed to that point. San Diego starter Clayton Richard had limited his opponents to five hits and one run in six innings before the storm forced the Padres to go to the bullpen.  He was outstanding,  Hedges said.  First couple of innings he was on point, he was as good as he's been, and he lost a little bit of command later but he's such a good competitor that we made an adjustment and he was able to give us six great innings.  The Phillies put runners on second and third against reliever Phil Maton, and pinch-hitting Daniel Nava made it a one-run game with a ground ball to the mound. Freddy Galvis then tied it up with a single through the gap at short off left-hander Brad Hand, scoring rookie outfielder Nick Williams, who had doubled in a pinch-hitting appearance. Hand (2-4), the Padres' only All-Star selection, ran into more trouble in the eighth, walking Tommy Joseph and giving up a single to Odubel Herrera to put men on first and second with one out. But he struck out Andres Blanco and Cameron Rupp to end the inning. San Diego got to Phillies reliever Hector Neris (2-3) immediately thereafter. Cory Spangenberg singled and advanced to third on a one-out base hit by Carlos Asuaje before Hedges brought him home with a fly ball to center. Brandon Mauer pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 18th save of the year.  Very resilient from our group of guys,  Green said.  I know we've had our fair share of getting blown out, but when it's close our guys have figured out a way to win the game.  Hedges, who had missed the two previous games with some neck tightness, had the Padres in good shape before the delay. A solo shot to left in the third inning put the Padres up 2-0 and his follow-up at-bat in the fifth inning ended the same way, with Hedges rounding the bases after the ball landed in the right-field seats to make it 3-1.  It was good to see him swing the bat well,  Green said.  He's been working hard in the cage. He's been kind of scuffling a bit lately. I'm sure the two days (off) helped him reboot the system, too.  Hedges wasn't the only Padres' hitter to go deep against Phillies starter Nick Pivetta. Jose Pirela got the scoring underway in the first inning with a homer to left, his fourth of the season. Philadelphia's first run also came on a solo shot, off the bat of Joseph in the fourth inning. That was the 15th of the season for the first baseman, who hit 21 in 107 games as a rookie last year.  Still some things I'm working on,  Joseph said,  but I've done a better job of putting the ball in the air, which helps with extra-base hits.  The home runs were the only problem for Pivetta, who went seven strong innings, giving up five hits while striking out nine Padres along the way.  I'll take three solo shots over walking anybody,  he said.  I'm finding my consistency and keep moving forward.  NOTES: It was 1980s retro night at Citizens Bank Park, with both teams wearing throwback uniforms from the era. ...

{"content":"Springer, Astros hammer Blue Jays TORONTO -- Starting pitchers Charlie Morton and Aaron Sanchez shared similar situations when they opposed each other Friday night. Both had been on the disabled list since May. The similarity ended there, however, because Morton was on and Sanchez was not. The Houston Astros gave Morton ample support, led by George Springer's two home runs and five RBIs, which matched his career best, in a 12-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Springer's four hits included a three-run homer and a solo blast. He became the first leadoff hitter to hit 27 home runs before the All-Star break in major league history.  He can wow you even when you're around him every day,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  What a great tone-setter. He's a difference maker. Getting him the most at-bats is pretty awesome. He's using the middle of the field and the opposite field. No park can hold him right now.  Springer said,  We've all hit the ball hard the last four or five games. You've got to have a plan. Develop a plan and approach, then adjust from there depending on what he's doing. He (Sanchez) has got good stuff over there, a lot of those guys do.  Morton, meanwhile, allowed one run in six innings Sanchez allowed eight runs (five earned) in 1 2/3 innings. Carlos Correa added a two-run homer and Evan Gattis had a solo shot for the Astros (59-28), who have split in the first two games of the four-game series. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTroy Tulowitzki and Ezequiel Carrera homered for Toronto (40-46). Morton (6-3), starting for the first time since May 24 because of a right lat strain, allowed four hits and two walks.  For the offense to come through like that early, it's great because it gives me a chance to just go out there and compete,  Morton said.  A little less stress, a little less worry. We were going in on righties, that was the most we've been doing that all year. It seems like it was working ... getting those ground balls.  Sanchez (0-2) allowed seven hits and four walks in his first start since May 19. He had been on the disabled list with a blister and split nail on his right middle finger.  If he could have thrown that curveball over a little bit more that would have helped, but that will come,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  But he looks strong and they're swinging. If you make a mistake, they're hitting it. I don't think the line was as bad as it looked because I thought he was close.  Gattis started the seventh with his seventh homer of the season. Springer homered with two outs in the seventh. James Hoyt replaced Morton and had a perfect bottom of the seventh and Tony Sipp had a perfect eighth. In the eighth, Toronto's Jeff Beliveau replaced Mike Bolsinger, who allowed six hits and four runs while striking out seven in 5 1/3 innings of relief. Beliveau allowed one hit in two innings. Francis Martes pitched the ninth for the Astros and gave up the sixth homer of the season by Carrera, who replaced Jose Bautista in right field in the seventh. Sanchez allowed two runs in the first inning when Correa hit his 18th home run of the season after Springer and Jose Altuve led off with singles and Josh Reddick grounded into a double play. The Astros added six runs in the second. Springer's 26th homer of the season followed walks to Gattis and Norichika Aoki to bump the lead to 5-0. An error by Tulowitzki at short on his flip to second base on Correa's potential double-play grounder loaded the bases for Houston. Marwin Gonzalez had an RBI groundout to second, Carlos Beltran chopped an RBI infield single to second and Gattis hit an RBI double. Bolsinger replaced Sanchez.  I felt great,  Sanchez said.  I think the best part about tonight is that I didn't think about my finger once. I went out there, I was aggressive, I felt like I was who I was before all this stuff happened. l think that's s a plus.  A double by Springer and an infield single by Altuve set up an RBI single by Reddick for a 9-0 Houston lead in the third. Alex Bregman led off the fifth with a double and scored from third on Springer's sacrifice fly.  I understand who's up behind me,  Springer said.  If I can get to first for guys like Altuve, Correa, Beltran, I understand that there's a good chance I'm going to score. If I can spark us, great. If not, I know who's up behind me.

Jay Bruce broke a 1-1 tie in the eighth with an RBI double for the Mets, who won a second straight in San Francisco after having opened a 10-game trip with four consecutive losses against the Los Angeles Dodgers.  I said this before: He had that outing when he struggled (June 6 at Texas) and he's come back after that, made the necessary adjustments and he's been lights out,  Bruce said of deGrom.  That's what an ace does.  The loss was the Giants' 50th of the year, making them the first team to reach the half-century mark this season.  It is hard to believe,  Bochy said of the 50 losses.  I don't know if anybody saw this coming. Hard to make sense of it. It can be embarrassing.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at GiantsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchThe teams were knotted at 1 after solo homers by Flores and Brandon Belt were the lone blemishes against deGrom and the Giants' Johnny Cueto. Right-hander Sam Dyson replaced Cueto to start the eighth, and Curtis Granderson greeted him with a triple to get the game-winning rally in motion. After Asdrubal Cabrera walked and Yoenis Cespedes struck out, Bruce smacked a Steven Okert pitch into right field to plate Granderson with the go-ahead run. One out later, Flores sliced a double to right off the Giants' third pitcher of the inning, right-hander George Kontos, to make it 3-1. Dyson (1-7) was charged with the loss, his first since joining the Giants. The Mets tacked on two insurance runs in the ninth, the first coming when Michael Conforto, pinch hitting for deGrom, singled in Jose Reyes, who had opened the inning with a triple off right-hander Kyle Crick. A two-out wild pitch by Crick allowed Conforto to score, increasing the New York lead to 5-1. It was more than deGrom (7-3) needed.  That's what I want to do every time out there,  he said of the eight-inning effort.  That's what I expect of myself.  In a pitching rematch of Game 2 of the 2015 World Series, a game Cueto won for the Kansas City Royals, deGrom limited the Giants to four hits in eight innings while running his record to 3-0 with a 0.72 ERA in his last three starts. He walked one and struck out seven.  You figured it would be a low-scoring game with those two guys going,  Bochy said of deGrom and Cueto.  The (Giants) bullpen struggled tonight.  Right-hander Addison Reed surrendered a two-out, run-scoring single to Brandon Crawford in the bottom of the ninth before wrapping up the win. Cueto did not get a decision after allowing one run and five hits in seven innings. He walked three and struck out three.  Thank God,  he blurted out afterward.  I think I'm in rhythm now.  Flores' homer, his seventh of the season, opened the scoring in the fourth inning. He finished with two hits and two RBIs for the Mets, who had five of their 10 hits go for extra bases. Cabrera contributed a double and a single for New York. Belt's home run, his 14th, led off the seventh and drew the Giants even at 1-1. Buster Posey had a pair of singles for San Francisco, which has lost 11 of its last 12 overall and nine of its last 10 at home. NOTES: The Mets have hit 23 home runs in their last 13 games and 42 in the month of June. Their franchise record for homers in a month is 45, set in August 2015 and tied in August 2016. ... The Mets lead the majors in homers on the road this season with 64. ... The Giants never previously in franchise history had lost a 50th game until July 8. ... The San Francisco bullpen has allowed at least one run in 47 of the team's 77 games. The Giants have gone 11-36 in those games. ... Giants 3B Ryder Jones went 0-for-4 in his major league debut.

Hong Kong was handed back to China under a  one country, two systems  formula, promising a high degree of autonomy on July 1, 1997. Xi's visit comes at a time when many Hong Kong residents see China as increasingly interfering in city affairs. Of particular concern were the abduction by mainland agents of some city booksellers who specialized in critical material and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature. An annual protest to press for full democracy in the city is expected to take place after Xi's departure on the afternoon of July 1. During Xi's first visit to Hong Kong as China's president, he will oversee the swearing in of new Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. Lam, chosen as chief executive by an electoral college stacked with Beijing loyalists, has promised to heal divisions in the city and improve the government's relationship with the opposition and the public.

{"content":"(The Sports Xchange) - So Yeon Ryu shot a tournament-record 10-under-par 61 on Saturday to seize a five-stroke lead heading into the final round of the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship in Rogers, Arkansas. Ryu, who is bidding for her second LPGA title this year and fourth of her career, finds herself at 16-under 126 to claim the 36-hole record at the tournament. The 26-year-old South Korean capped her impressive bogey-free round with back-to-back birdies, finishing with 10 on the day to claim comfortable lead over Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn and American Stacy Lewis at Pinnacle Country Club.  It was so much fun,  Ryu told reporters after her round.    “I made a really long putt at 8, 17, and then I boost up and the shot was getting better and better. At the back nine, I was able to make some more short birdies, and then pretty much made all of them. So happy with my round today.” Ryu resides third in the Rolex world rankings and is .489 average ranking points behind No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, who isn't playing this week. If Ryu wins, the battle for No. 1 likely will come down to fractions of a point in Monday's release of the new rankings. Ryu's performance on Saturday bested the previous course record of 62, set by Angela Park and Jane Park in 2008 and matched last year by Lydia Ko and Ayako Uehara. Both Jutanugarn and Lewis each followed their opening-round 66s with seven birdies against one bogey to finish with a 65 on Saturday. Lewis capped her round with back-to-back birdies at the par-3 17th and par-5 18th to send the crowd into a frenzy.  Kinda felt like I was struggling a little bit coming in, so that's why the last two birdies were extremely important to me,” Lewis said. “I felt like I got the momentum back and can hopefully post another good one tomorrow.” South Korean's Amy Yang shot a 65 to sit in fourth place at 10-under, one stroke ahead of the four-way contingent of countrywoman Inbee Park (65), Australian Minjee Lee (65), Indian Aditi Ashok (64) and Norwegian Suzann Pettersen (66).","keywords":"Thailand,Amy Yang,Angela Park,Ayako Uehara,Jane Park,Jutanugarn,Lydia Ko,Stacy Lewis,Suzann Pettersen,Yeon Ryu,US,GOLF,WOMEN,Norway,India,Western Europe,South Korea,Sport,Asia / Pacific,Europe,Emerging Market Countries,Canada,Industrial Machinery / Equipment (Legacy),United States","news_time":"2017-06-24 23:18:00","news_title":"Golf: Ryu seizes lead after sparkling 61 in Arkansas","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-idUSKBN19G02Z"}
{"content":"KINGSTON (Reuters) - Reigning Olympic 110 meters hurdles champion Omar McLeod ran a sizzling 12.90 seconds in Kingston on Saturday to lay down a marker ahead of the world championships. McLeod's run to secure a third successive national title at the Jamaica championships was the fifth fastest of all time, level with American Dominique Arnold's 2006 mark and only a tenth of a second behind Aries Merritt's world record. Apart from Merritt, only Cuban Dayron Robles (12.87), China's Liu Xiang (12.88) and American David Oliver (12.89) have run faster. From lane four, McLeod was quickest to the first hurdle and never eased off the throttle to better Hansle Parchment's previous Jamaican record of 12.94 seconds set in 2014. McLeod told Reuters the world record was now firmly in hissights.  Oh yes!  the excited hurdler said.  My new coach (Edrick Floreal) told me that every time somebody asked me about the world record I shied away from it last year and I don't know why.  But he made me fall in love with the hurdles again.  It was a humbling experience because he made me feel like I just started hurdling.  There were a lot of things I had to work on technically and it's now all coming together.  And he said when anyone asked if I'm going to break the world record, I should say 'yes'.

His coach had expected him to run 12.85.   I was not supposed to hit a hurdle, but I think I hit two.  I'm finally doing some speed work and finally learning how to control my speed, finally attacking the hurdles fearlessly and not worried about hitting a hurdle. Slideshow (2 Images) So, God is good.

Dacres will try to better his seventh place finish at the Beijing world championships two years ago in London.

{"content":"EditorsNote: resend Baez, Lester propel Cubs past Marlins MIAMI -- The Chicago Cubs are more popular than ever -- even on the road. That was certainly the case on Saturday afternoon as Javier Baez drove in three runs in the Cubs' 5-3 win over the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. There were thousands of Cubs fans in the stands, but the decibel level went up in the ninth inning as the crowd reacted to an otherwise routine pinch-hitting appearance by Anthony Rizzo, who grew up less than one hour from Marlins Park.  I didn't even realize we were doing that for him,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said of the noise given in support of Rizzo, who is normally a starter at first base.  I was looking around, 'Did somebody walk in the door? Is it A-Rod and J-Lo?'  Nope, Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez weren't causing a scene. It was just Rizzo, who lined out to shortstop. Even so, it was still a great day for the Cubs. Baez, who led all Cubs hitters with a .302 batting average in May, delivered a tiebreaking, two-run double in the sixth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MarlinsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchJon Lester (5-4) picked up the win and has now defeated 29 of the 30 teams in the majors. The only exception is the Boston Red Sox, a team he played for and has never faced. Facing Miami for the fifth time on Saturday, Lester pitched seven innings and allowed four hits, one walk and three runs as the Cubs (38-36) took a 2-1 lead in the weekend series that concludes Sunday. Lester retired 18 of the last 20 batters he faced. Carl Edwards then pitched a scoreless eighth and Wade Davis did the same in the ninth for his 15th save of the year. Miami (33-40) was led by J.T. Realmuto, who cranked a three-run homer, his seventh long ball of the season.  He should be under consideration for the All-Star Game,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Realmuto.  But, as a manager, you see that there is more to his game.  Mattingly also had a comment on the pro-Cubs crowd.  It's not a great situation,  he said.  I don't think it has anything to do with how we play. But it would be nice to have a packed crowd with Marlins fans so that Cubs fans or Mets fans can't get tickets. But that's not the case.  Marlins starter Justin Nicolino allowed seven hits and three runs (two earned) in four innings, escaping with a no-decision. Reliever Nick Wittgren (1-1) took the loss, allowing two runs in one inning. Chicago got to Nicolino right away. Leadoff batter Jon Jay, a former University of Miami standout, singled in the first and advanced to second when center fielder Christian Yelich bobbled the ball. Jay moved to third on Wilson Contreras' single and scored on a two-out, opposite-field hit by Ian Happ. Miami grabbed the lead back in the bottom of the first. After Giancarlo Stanton walked and Yelich singled, Realmuto lofted his three-run homer to left.  I hung a curveball,  Lester said.  We were careful with Stanton on a 3-2 curveball, walked him. Then we had the lefty (Yelich), and I didn't make my pitch.  After Realmuto's homer, Lester retired the next 13 batters consecutively. That gave Chicago's offense an opportunity to rally, and the Cubs tied the score 3-3 with two runs in the fourth. Addison Russell singled, advanced on a Happ sacrifice bunt and scored on Baez's single to left. Albert Almora, a Miami native, capped the inning with an RBI opposite-field double. The Cubs took a 5-3 lead in the sixth as the first three batters in the inning all got hits. Russell doubled, Happ singled and Baez had his two-run double off the wall in right. All five of Chicago's RBIs came on opposite-field hits, which pleased Maddon. Happ, who has eight hits in the series so far, seems particularly adept at going the other way.  I'm just trying to get these guys to realize that there is more than one side to a baseball field,  Maddon said of Happ and the other young Cubs hitters.  As we do that, we will hit better in situations. That's the key to being able to drive in runs.  NOTES: Former Florida State running back Dalvin Cook, the Minnesota Vikings' second-round pick, threw out the first pitch. ... Marlins SS Adeiny Hechavarria (oblique) may be ready to come off the disabled list on Tuesday against the New York Mets. ... Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (tendinitis) is hoping to return before next month's All-Star Game. ... Cubs 2B Ben Zobrist (left wrist inflammation) was eligible to come off the disabled list on Friday, but his return is not imminent. ... The Cubs have won 11 fewer games than last year at this same point, and most of that can be traced to the rotation. Last year, Cubs starters had a 2.36 ERA compared with 4.45 now. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union asked a U.S. judge on Saturday to expand an order that temporarily blocks the deportation of 114 Iraqis in Michigan, to cover Iraqis nationwide, according to a court filing. The advocacy group filed an amended complaint seeking to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States while a federal judge weighs the case of the Iraqis in Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith on Thursday ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis' deportation for at least two weeks while he decides whether he has jurisdiction. The ACLU, which had sued to block the Michigan deportations, asked Goldsmith to rule by Monday on expanding his order to cover the more than 1,400 Iraqis facing expulsion across the United States. The immigration agency has indicated it might start those deportations as soon as Tuesday, the ACLU said.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said the agency was reviewing the judge's order.  The agency intends to comply with the terms of the order, while determining the appropriate next steps,  she said in an email. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU said in its filing that those being deported could face persecution or torture because many were Chaldean Catholics or Iraqi Kurds and that both groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. The ACLU also filed a motion asking the judge to extend his order nationwide to ensure that people who could face persecution, torture or death in Iraq are not deported. The arrests of the Iraqis in Michigan were part of a sweep by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes.  The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's revised temporary travel ban.  The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case since only immigration courts can decide deportation issues.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to accelerate plans to amend Japan's pacifist constitution, saying he expects to submit a proposed revision to lawmakers before the end of the year,  media reported on Sunday. Abe said in a speech in Kobe city on Saturday he planned to submit a proposal for the first ever amendment of Japan's post-World War Two constitution during an extraordinary session of parliament that will be convened later this year, Japan's main daily newspapers reported. Abe has proposed amending the constitution's war-renouncing Article 9 by 2020 to officially recognize Japan's Self-Defense Forces as its military.  Such a change could draw fire from China and South Korea,  where bitter memories of Japan's past military aggression persist. They would likely see the change as a step toward the re-emergence of Japan as a military power. Abe had been expected to wait until next year before seeking legislators' approval of the change. He would need to win the support of two-thirds of members of both houses of parliament and a majority of votes in a referendum.      Supporters of Japan's post-war pacifism view Article 9 as the foundation of its democracy. Many conservatives see it as a humiliation imposed by the United States after Japan's defeat in 1945.

{"content":"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Eight people from a little-known urban guerrilla group have been arrested in connection with a bombing last week at an upscale mall in the Colombian capital Bogota, the police said on Saturday. Three people were killed and eight wounded when an explosive detonated in a women's restroom at the Andino shopping center on June 17. Four men and four women, members of The People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP) rebel group, were captured - half in Bogota and half in El Espinal in Tolima province, national police director Jorge Nieto told journalists. Those arrested will be arraigned on charges including homicide and terrorism, he said. The MRP, who have only been publicly known since late 2015, are being investigated for involvement in another 14 attacks, Nieto said.  The interdisciplinary team continues with the investigation to clarify the different terrorist actions and individualize and identify both the material and intellectual perpetrators of these acts,  Nieto said. The device, placed behind a toilet bowl, went off last Saturday afternoon amid busy Father's Day weekend shopping. Fatal victims of the bombing were 23-year-old French woman Julie Huynh, who had been volunteering in a poor area of the city, and Colombian citizens Ana Maria Gutierrez, 27, and Lady Paola Jaimes Ovalle, 31. Bogota, once the site of frequent car bombs and kidnappings, has grown safer over the past decade as the police and military increased surveillance and put more armed officials on the streets. Purses and bags were once checked at the entrance to shopping malls, but the practice has been scaled back in recent years. Bomb dogs still typically check cars at parking facilities in the capital. A peace accord signed last year with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's biggest guerrilla group, further raised hopes bomb attacks might be a thing of the past. But the country's second-largest insurgent group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), in February detonated a bomb outside a bull-fighting ring in Bogotá's center, injuring dozens of police. Both the ELN and the FARC have condemned the Andino attack.

Keni Harrison, the world record holder in the women's 100 metres hurdles, also joined the parade of Americans heading to August's world championships in London with her first national title, winning in 12.60 seconds. Kerley needed a little pressure from runner-up Gil Roberts to win the 400 in 44.03 seconds. The time, which trails only his season-leading 43.70, gave the 22-year-old the five fastest 400 metres for 2017 and sets up a mouthwatering showdown with South African world record holder Wayde van Niekerk at London. Kendricks, the Olympic bronze medallist, took much pleasure from topping the six-metre barrier for the first time.  It's a career point,  the American said.  Every great jumper in history had at least one six metres jump.  To be a part of that club, to be an elite top 20 in the history in the event is really cool to me.  Harrison, recovering from a broken hand, already had a wild card berth to London as the 2016 Diamond League champion. But she wanted the title and a chance to run.

{"content":"Dozier, Gimenez power Twins past Indians CLEVELAND -- The way Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona figures it, a poor defensive first inning cost his ace the ability to pitch the eighth, and that's when the game was decided. Brian Dozier's home run leading off the eighth inning broke a tie, and Chris Gimenez added a solo shot in the ninth as the Minnesota Twins beat Cleveland 4-2 on Saturday at Progressive Field. Dozier's homer, his 13th, came on a 3-2 pitch from Cleveland closer Cody Allen (0-3). Gimenez's homer, his fourth, came off Zach McAllister. Taylor Rogers (4-1) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to get the win. Brandon Kintzler pitched a scoreless ninth for his 20th save. Cleveland starter Corey Kluber was sensational, striking out 13 in seven innings, allowing two unearned runs, three hits and two walks. Kluber has not allowed an earned run in his last 21 innings. The two unearned runs Kluber allowed came in the first inning, thanks to two Indians errors. Dozier hit Kluber's first pitch of the game on the ground to second baseman Jason Kipnis, who threw wildly to first for an error. Joe Mauer walked, and Robbie Grossman doubled down the right-field line, scoring Dozier and sending Mauer to third. Mauer then scored on a wild pickoff throw to third by catcher Yan Gomes, giving Minnesota a 2-0 lead. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at IndiansMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch We took advantage of their mistakes right out of the chute,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  That was a shame,  said Francona of the first inning.  They not only got two runs, but it probably cost (Kluber) pitching the eighth inning. The runs were important, but that cost him an inning.  Kluber was removed from the game after seven innings and 106 pitches.  I was kind of disappointed in the way I handled the next two batters after the error,  Kluber said. The Twins were grateful for the two gift runs.  You know it's going to be a battle anytime Kluber is out there,  Twins starter Kyle Gibson said.  To get that 2-0 lead was huge because you never know when you are going to get runs off Kluber.  Gibson held Cleveland scoreless on one hit through the first three innings. But with one out in the fourth, Jose Ramirez drove a 3-2 pitch over the right field wall for his 12th home run, cutting the Twins' lead to 2-1. After the first inning Kluber started striking out hitters in bunches. In one stretch in the middle innings, he struck out nine of 12 batters.  Kluber was ridiculous. I think he struck out 38 guys,  Gimenez joked.  He has a wipeout breaking ball that he throws harder than I throw my fastball.  Dozier's tiebreaking homer in the eighth inning came after the Indians scored a run in the seventh inning to tie the game at 2. Gomes led off with a single against reliever Matt Belisle. Bradley Zimmer flied out for the first out, but Austin Jackson singled to left, moving Gomes to second. Francisco Lindor hit a ground ball to first baseman Kennys Vargas, who threw to shortstop Jorge Polanco at second for the force on Jackson. But Polanco's return throw to first was wild, allowing Gomes to score the tying run.  There wasn't much chance of completing that double play, so I would have rather we held the ball there, and kept the guy at third,  Molitor said. Rogers relieved Belisle and gave up an infield single to shortstop by Kipnis, with Lindor moving to second. But Rogers retired Ramirez on a groundout to end the inning.  Rogers got some big outs at a big time in the game against some good hitters,  Molitor said. Gibson pitched 4 2/3 innings, giving up one run on four hits, with one strikeout and four walks.

{"content":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Organization of American States President Luis Almagro offered on Saturday to resign if Venezuela holds free elections and enacts reforms to protect democracy in the troubled South American nation.  I will resign from the Organization of American States the day that free, fair and transparent national elections are held without impediments,  Almagro said in a video message posted on Twitter.  I offer my position in exchange for freedom in Venezuela.   President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday that if Almagro, an outspoken critic of his government, resigned he would consider reversing a decision to withdraw Venezuela from the 34-nation OAS bloc. At its annual general assembly in Mexico this week, the OAS failed to reach consensus on a resolution about Venezuela, where 75 people have died in three months of protests.  Demonstrators are demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the once-wealthy OPEC nation, racked by rising poverty and a deepening economic and political crisis. Countries in the region have lambasted Maduro over Venezuela's situation, but they have no evident means of forcing a political transition to happen. Despite low approval ratings and the increasingly dire humanitarian situation, Maduro faces few short-term threats to his hold on power.  The next presidential election is not scheduled until late next year, and military officers have until now ignored opposition calls that they urge Maduro to resign. Demonstrators Dispersed Demonstrators clash with riot security forces while rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's Government in front of an Air Force base in Caracas, Venezuela, June 24, 2017.Ivan AlvaradoAlmagro conditioned his resignation offer on a long list of demands, including the release of political prisoners such as high-profile politician Leopoldo Lopez, and a guarantee of Supreme Court independence. Maduro offered no immediate response to Almagro's offer on Saturday. But he has called the OAS chief  immoral  in the past and considers the regional group a puppet of Washington intent on toppling his government.  Security forces on Saturday used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators. Slideshow (13 Images)The National Guard said two of its members were wounded in confrontations with the demonstrators at an air base in the east of Caracas near where a 22-year-old protester was shot dead by a military police sergeant on Thursday..          Maduro, during a speech to commemorate independence day, again accused the opposition of sowing chaos to lay the groundwork for a coup against him.   Desperation, hatred, and fury thrive among the enemies of the fatherland,  said Maduro, flanked by ministers and military top brass, describing the OAS's inability to produce a statement on Venezuela as a victory for the country. The opposition wants Maduro to bring forward next year's presidential election.  Instead, the president has called for the election of a constitutional assembly on July 30 to draft a new constitution. The opposition has said it will boycott the vote, calling it a rigged process to help the unpopular government stay in power.

{"content":"TSOGTTSETSII, Mongolia (Reuters) - A few miles from Mongolia's giant Tavan Tolgoi mine, about 2,000 trucks a day set off across the Gobi desert, delivering coal to China on a road so narrow and ridden with pot holes it has become an accident black spot.  Nearby stand the foundations of a railway meant to connect Tavan Tolgoi to China to the south. The unfinished line would enable cash-strapped, landlocked Mongolia to sell more coal at higher prices to its biggest customer, which could also finance the project. But despite the obvious economic benefits, the project has become a casualty of the ambivalence Mongolians feel about China's growing influence. Those feelings loom large over a Mongolian presidential election on Monday.  It's been left here for two years without any work,  said the governor of Tsogttsetsii district, Orgodol Badarch, pointing to a gravel surface where the rails should have been laid, stretching into the distance for more than 200 km (124 miles).   I'm not sure, but it may have to be rebuilt completely.  Voters will choose between an investment-friendly candidate and a populist  resource nationalist  rival in an election that is a referendum on both economic policy and China's role. China's share of Mongolia's foreign trade was 68.5 percent from January to May this year, up from 1.5 percent in 1989. China took 90.5 percent of Mongolia's exports from January to May.  China wants Mongolia's coal and copper, and has the cash to build the infrastructure to get it - if Mongolia allows it. Julian Dierkes, specialist in Mongolian politics at the University of British Columbia, said there was a lot of nationalist language in the party manifestos.  Most of this must be thinking of Mongolia as united, but also, in part, united against China, even if that is not explicit,  he said. Miyeegombo Enkhbold, standing for the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), is  open to foreign investment from all countries, that of course includes investment from China , a party official told Reuters.  The reality for today is we have the supply, China has the demand,  he said, while adding that Mongolia had to diversify and  reduce inappropriate dependence  on one country. Enkhbold's main challenger, from the Democratic Party, is a former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga, who has voiced suspicion about China's aims in a country that was under Chinese domination for centuries, until it gained independence in 1921. Battulga said in an emailed statement on Thursday that China  is and must be a great partner of ours , but added that  rail and transportation for any country is both a national security and an economic issue .  FILE PHOTO: A truck transports coals to the Chinese border in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence Edwards The resources will finish in 40 to 50 years and there will definitely be conflict between the Mongolians and the Chinese,  Battulga said in a 2014 television interview. Polling is not permitted during election campaigning, but in a March survey, 24.3 percent said the MPP could best solve problems compared with 10.6 percent for the Democratic Party. Politics of Rail Mongolia's economy has more than doubled in size since 2010, but some regions have seen little benefit and lack running water and reliable electricity. While growing trade has brought jobs to Tsogttsetsii, poor transport means Mongolian coal is sold at a discount. Deliveries to China earned $66 a ton in April, half the price of shipments from Australia. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a part of half-paved road that spans 225 kilometers from the Ukhaa Khudag and Tavan Tolgoi coal mines to the China-Mongolia border, in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence EdwardsThe railway track from Tsogttsetsii was meant to have been laid in 2014, but financing dried up. A tentative 2015 pact with China's Shenhua Group and Japan's Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) to develop the mine and the railway was blocked by parliament. Progress was not helped by disputes over the gauge.  Battulga, transport minister from 2008 to 2012, had favored the wider Russian tracks, arguing that the international standard would leave Mongolia dependent on China. He recently said he'd go along with whatever parliament decided. A century ago, Chinese warlords used railways to help colonize Inner Mongolia, and some Mongolian nationalists argue a cross-border link could help facilitate a Chinese invasion. Though driven by Chinese demand, and by a billion-dollar deal to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold deposit now run by Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L), Mongolia's 2011-2013 mining boom encouraged politicians to think about ways to minimize dependence on China, and they drew up plans for rail links to the Russian Far East.       Parliamentarians also passed legislation blocking investment by foreign state-owned firms, aimed at blocking plans by the China Aluminium Corporation (2600.HK)(601600.SS) to acquire the Mongolia-based SouthGobi Resources (SGQ.TO).   But Mongolia can't be choosy. The government has been forced to implement austerity measures to secure a $5.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in May. Ultimately, economic growth may hold more allure for voters than nationalism, said Sumati Luvsanvandev, head of the Sant Maral Foundation polling group.  Anti-China sentiment cannot bring support to Battulga. They are interested in economic prosperity,  he said of voters.   They may be suspicious, but they're also quite pragmatic.

{"content":"Nationals bash Reds 18-3 WASHINGTON -- If Joe Ross is pitching at home on a weekend afternoon, there is a good chance his teammates are going to bash the baseball around Nationals Park. The Washington Nationals scored at least four runs in an inning on three occasions and lashed out 19 hits to crush the Cincinnati Reds 18-3 on Saturday. The Nationals were 12-for-18 with runners in scoring position, had five doubles and two homers and forced the Reds to throw 206 pitches in eight innings. Washington began the day leading the league with a team batting average of .276 and league-best 114 homers. The Nationals scored 23 runs on April 30 against the New York Mets in a game that Ross started at home on a Sunday afternoon.  I haven't noticed that,  Washington center fielder Michael A. Taylor said of the run support for Ross. But the Reds certainly noticed Taylor, who had four hits, including two homers.  He is hitting eighth,  noted an incredulous Reds manager Bryan Price.  There are not a lot of soft places to fall (in that lineup).  Washington scored a record 62 runs in the first four starts of the year for Ross (4-3), who gave up just one run on six hits in seven innings Saturday. The first-place Nationals (45-29) are 20-14 at home while the last-place Reds (30-43) lost for the 13th time in 14 games. The only other time Taylor hit two homers in a game was last year at San Diego. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at NationalsCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch That is a good feeling. It was a great team win right there,  Taylor said.  Joe came out and pitched a great game.  Taylor did not start the previous two games.  I was a little banged up. I am getting better. I am headed in the right direction,  said Taylor, who did not disclose his injury. Trea Turner, who had been in a slump, went a career-best 5-for-5 with a walk to raise his average to .275 and Daniel Murphy drove in four runs for the Nationals.  I feel better. I feel like it is starting to come around,  Turner said.  I am hitting the ball pretty good.  Reds starter Homer Bailey (0-1), in his first start this season, gave up eight runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings and lasted just 61 pitches after three minor league rehab starts.  In this game, at this level, you never really know. With a lineup like that and you're not sharp they're going to make you have a long day regardless of who you are or what kind of stuff you're featuring,  Bailey said.  I had no excuses. I just didn't pitch well today. That's all I can say.  Ryan Zimmerman began the festivities with a two-run double in the first to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Washington then scored six in the second to grab an 8-0 advantage and send Bailey to the showers. Turner had an RBI single, Murphy had a three-run double and Anthony Rendon and Matt Wieters had RBI singles in the inning. Wieters had an RBI single in the fourth and later scored on an error to make it 10-0. Taylor added a two-run homer later in the fourth to make it 12-0. Murphy had a sacrifice fly in the fifth for a 13-0 lead. The Reds broke the shutout with a solo homer in the sixth by Patrick Kivlehan against Ross. Taylor hit his second homer to lead off the bottom of the sixth, making it 14-1. He ended the day going 4-for-5 with three runs and three RBIs. Kivlehan had an RBI single off reliever Joe Blanton in the eighth and Eugenio Suarez added a sacrifice fly to make it 14-3. But Turner had an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth against Blake Wood, Brian Goodwin had an RBI double, and Adam Lind and Jose Lobaton had sacrifice flies to make it 18-3. Bailey was replaced in the second inning by Lisalverto Bonilla, who yielded five runs in 3 1/3 innings. Tucker Barnhart, Kivlehan, Scooter Gennett and Billy Hamilton had two hits for the Reds. Zimmerman, Rendon and Wieters did likewise for the Nationals.  They were not missing,  Price said of the Washington bats.  You have guys that hurt you in the bottom of the order. It is not like we were on top of our game. When you make a mistake they don't foul it back.  NOTES: Reds CF Billy Hamilton broke an 0-for-20 skid with a line single in the fifth inning. ... The Reds brought RHP Homer Bailey (bone spurs, right elbow) off the 60-day disabled list to start. To make room on the roster, OF Jesse Winker, who hit .273 in 14 at-bats, was sent to Triple-A Louisville. ... Washington manager Dusty Baker had the same job with the Reds from 2008 to 2013. ...

{"content":"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's fiery former President Cristina Fernandez formally launched her bid on Saturday for a Senate seat in October's mid-term elections in a race that will determine whether President Mauricio Macri can deepen his free-market reforms. Fernandez' run, confirmed by a spokesman, comes a little over a week after she formed a new center-left party independent of Peronism, the Argentina's dominant political movement that she has belonged to for decades. While Fernandez enjoys strong support from many who consider her a champion of the poor, her break with Peronism divides the opposition and could help Macri's coalition make a strong showing in October. Fernandez will be competing for a Senate seat representing the populous province of Buenos Aires, home to 40 percent of the country's voters and closely watched as a defining race.

{"content":"Phillips, Dickey help Braves top Brewers ATLANTA -- On a roster loaded with young talent, it was a couple of old guys who made the difference for the Atlanta Braves on Saturday. Brandon Phillips, 35, homered for the third straight game and 42-year-old R.A. Dickey pitched seven strong innings to help the Braves extend their winning streak to four with a 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at SunTrust Park. Phillips was 2-for-4 and scored two runs, but it was his two-run homer that landed in the back of the left-field bullpen, his seventh, in the third inning that was the decider. Phillips was wearing special cleats with the name of his son, Micah, who celebrated his fourth birthday on Sunday.  It feels good to come home and play in front of my family and friends and just be with my babies all the time,  said Phillips, an Atlanta native who was acquired from Cincinnati in February. Dickey (6-5) gave up his only run in the first but settled down to complete seven innings, allowing five hits and one walk with six strikeouts. He retired the minimum from the second through fifth innings. Of the 99 pitches he threw, 71 were for strikes. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at BravesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch He was getting ahead of guys, working it both ways, more left to right than up and down, then the shadows creep in the middle of the game,  Milwaukee third baseman Travis Shaw said.  Throwing consistent strikes like that makes it tough.  Dickey has won four straight decisions at SunTrust Park and is 3-0 with an 0.86 in his last three starts there, with 20 strikeouts. He has now thrown seven innings in back-to-back games to help the weary Atlanta bullpen.  It wasn't maybe as good movement as I've had the last three games,  Dickey said.  I had a good enough one to be able to change speeds with and it was in the strike zone a large percentage of the game. Those things add up to a pretty good outing.  Jim Johnson worked a scoreless ninth inning, striking out two, for his 15th save. Atlanta (36-38) has won seven of its last eight and pulled within two games of .500 for the first time since April 29. Milwaukee's Matt Garza (3-4) pitched six innings and allowed three runs and seven hits with four strikeouts. The Brewers scored a run in the first inning. Keon Broxton and Domingo Santana singled and advanced on a double steal. Shaw walked to load the bases. Broxton scored on a fielder's choice and Dickey struck out Jett Bandy to end the threat.  We had a nice rally in the first inning but we didn't really generate anything after that, no scoring opportunities after that,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. The Braves tied it in the bottom of the inning. Phillips and Matt Adams singled and Phillips scored on an RBI single by Tyler Flowers. Atlanta added two more when Phillips delivered a two-run homer in the third inning when Garza left a changeup too high in the zone.  He just left something middle in, trying to go down and away,  Counsell said.  Matt's stuff got better as the game went along. He put up three zeros after home run. He ended up giving us a quality start, but not enough offense today.  Milwaukee (40-37) threatened in the eighth when reliever Jose Ramirez walked pinch hitter Eric Sogard. After retiring Broxton on a fly to center, Atlanta went to left-hander Sam Freeman, who struck out Eric Thames and Santana. NOTES: Milwaukee OF Nick Franklin was ejected in the first inning. Franklin, who was not in the starting lineup, could be heard blasting the umpires for allowing Atlanta an excessive amount of time to determine whether it would challenge a call on a pickoff play at first base. Home-plate umpire Ben May yelled back at Franklin,  I heard you.  But Franklin got the thumb from crew chief Jerry Meals, who was working second base. Manager Craig Counsell said,  You can't get ejected there. ... It puts you behind the eight-ball. Somebody else should do the arguing there.  ...

{"content":"Orioles pull away late, sink Rays ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Baltimore manager Buck Showalter wanted to see his starting pitching step up and Dylan Bundy responded, pitching seven solid innings as the Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 on Saturday at Tropicana Field.  It's an example of why we think so much of him makeup-wise. He gives up that three spot and just goes on about his business, doesn't implode and gets us deep into the game,  Showalter said after Bundy gave up two home runs on back-to-back pitches to tie the score in the third inning. The Rays (40-37) had bounced back to tie the score, but the Orioles (36-38) rallied with two outs in the seventh for four runs to break it open. Tampa Bay reliever Jumbo Diaz was one strike from getting out of a two-on, no-out jam, but the strike didn't come. Instead, Mark Trumbo hit a two-run double for a 5-3 lead and the next pitch was a two-run homer by Trey Mancini, putting the Orioles up 7-3. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at RaysBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch I don't think anybody hits a prettier line drive over the infield than Mark does,  Showalter said.  It's fun to watch when he squares it up. That was a big knock and some add-on runs as well.  The loss went to reliever Jose Alvarado (0-3), who faced one batter to open the seventh and walked him, setting up what was the go-ahead run. Baltimore had allowed at least five runs in 20 straight games, the first time any major league team has done that since the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies. The streak ended thanks to seven solid innings from Bundy (8-6). The Orioles jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second inning against Rays rookie Jake Faria, who had allowed three earned runs in his first three major league starts. Faria hit Mancini and gave up a two-run homer to Welington Castillo. Baltimore added a solo home run in the third from Adam Jones. It bounced off the top of the wall in straightaway center, just above the reach of a leaping Mallex Smith.  They're a really good hitting team -- the two home runs they hit, those are mistakes that a good hitting team is not supposed to miss,  Faria said.  I've just got to work on execution, trying not to be too fine but not leaving pitches over the middle.  Tampa Bay needed just two pitches to tie it up in the bottom of the third. After a two-out walk to Smith, Corey Dickerson hit a two-run homer down the right-field line and Evan Longoria hit the next pitch for a solo shot, tying the score 3-3. The Rays have gone back-to-back 10 times this season, the most in the majors and already a team season record less than halfway through the year. Faria had his fourth straight quality start to open his career, giving up three runs and five hits in six innings, but he failed to win for the first time.  You go six, but the goal here is to go into the seventh, past the seventh,  Faria said.  Ultimately, if you don't come with the W, as a team, that's not really where we want to be.  Bundy was also sharp, pitching seven innings and holding the Rays to five hits and three runs. NOTES: The Rays made a long-awaited move at catcher, activating C Wilson Ramos from the 60-day disabled list and designating C Derek Norris for assignment. Ramos, recovering from ACL surgery last year, made his Rays debut batting sixth but went 0-for-3. ... Rays SS Matt Duffy, who hasn't played this season as he recovers from Achilles surgery, had a calcium deposit removed from his left heel Wednesday. He'll resume baseball activities as soon as the stitches heal. ... After needing extended bullpen work in Friday's loss, the Orioles recalled RHP Stefan Crichton from Triple-A Norfolk.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Jordan Spieth ended an up-and-down round on a high note, rolling in a 20-foot birdie putt at the last on Saturday to carry a one-stroke lead into the final round of the Travelers Championship at River Highlands in Connecticut. Spieth, who has led since the opening round in a campaign for his first win since the AT&T; Pebble Beach tournament in February, had three birdies over his last four holes for a four-under 66 to squeeze ahead of fellow American Boo Weekley. The closing charge by Spieth followed back-to-back bogeys from the 13th and put him at 12-under-par 198, while Weekley made five birdies in a bogey-free back nine including the last two holes to shoot 65 for an 11-under total. Three shots off the pace was American Daniel Berger (66), with C.T. Pan of Taiwan, who fired a 64 for the low round on a breezy day, Sweden's David Lingmerth (65) and Briton Paul Casey (66) another stroke back. World number six Spieth, who has struggled of late to regain his top form, confidently poured in his right-to-left breaker on the last green with his sights set on notching a 10th PGA Tour title one month from celebrating his 24th birthday. Jun 24, 2017; Cromwell, CT, USA;  Jordan Spieth reacts after putting for a birdie on the 18th green during the third round of the Travelers Championship golf tournament at TPC River Highlands. Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports With a few feet to go it was going to have a chance and it curled right in the middle,  Spieth told reporters.  That was a loud roar and those are really fun to experience.  Spieth heard some other roars, notably at the par-five sixth where he holed out a chip shot for birdie and at the short par-four 15th where his tee shot settled in a greenside bunker and his sand shot stopped a couple of inches from making two for an eagle. Slideshow (3 Images)No player has ever won the Travelers wire-to-wire, and Spieth will be trying for his second career win from start to finish following his 2015 maiden major triumph at the U.S. Masters. The 43-year-old Weekley, who has slipped to 390th in the world rankings, is gunning for his fourth tour title and first since winning at Colonial in 2013. World number three Rory McIlroy, frustrated by his recent putting form, auditioned five different putters before Saturday's third round before choosing a half mallet styled flat stick.

{"content":"Rookies make HR history, A's throttle White Sox CHICAGO -- Rookies on the Oakland Athletics enjoyed numerous career firsts on Saturday afternoon -- and then they celebrated with beer and baby powder showers. Franklin Barreto, Matt Olson and Jaycob Brugman hit their first career home runs -- marking the first time three teammates in the American or National League have accomplished the feat in a game -- to lead the A's in a 10-2 rout of the Chicago White Sox on Saturday afternoon.  That's pretty amazing, pretty amazing,  Brugman said.  Not only was that my first home run, but it was the first of two other guys that are really close to me. I couldn't be happier to share the day with those guys.  They're the second set of three teammates to hit their first major league home runs in a game since the Kansas City Packers' John Potts, Duke Kenworthy and Art Kruger did so in the Federal League on April 26, 1914, according to STATS and SABR HR Log.  I think everybody kind of looked around and said, 'Wow, I can't remember that ever happening before,'  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  We're not walking encyclopedias, but apparently it never has. Good feeling.  Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at White SoxOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchJames Shields allowed the three home runs in the first three innings. Olson hit a two-run shot in the first inning, Brugman connected for a solo shot in the second and Barreto drove a two-run shot in the third inning in his major league debut after he was called up from Triple-A Nashville earlier in the day.  These guys have fed off each other all the way through the system,  Melvin said.  They know each other really well and have won together. More the merrier at this point. For Barreto to come off a plane this morning and think he's not in the lineup and next thing he is in the lineup and do what he did is pretty amazing.  A's rookie Daniel Gossett (1-2) gave up two unearned runs in six innings, earning his first major league victory in his third career start.  As a pitcher, selfishly I reap the benefits of it because I can go out there and pitch a little more confident,  Gossett said.  To see Barreto get his first hit and other guys get their first home runs, it's really special for them and I'm glad I was part of it.  Shields (1-1) allowed six runs and seven hits before he exited with two on and no outs in the fourth inning. He was making his second start since coming off the disabled list for a strained right lat. His highlight was notching his 2,000th career strikeout to end the second inning.  I wasn't hitting my location with my fastball,  Shields said.  We're taxing the bullpen right now and the starters need to do a better job of going deeper in the game. I definitely didn't do my job today, going deep into the game, and that's something I've always prided myself on.  Olson added a two-run home run off Jake Petricka in the seventh for a 10-2 lead.  They said something about it was the first time it has happened in a while,  Olson said about the trio hitting their first home runs.  It's awesome to be able to share that moment with guys that I already built relationships with.  The A's have won two straight after ending a four-game losing streak while the White Sox have dropped five of their last six.  He didn't use that (breaking ball) as effectively as he did in Toronto,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said about Shields.  We were watching the game as it was developing and thought, man, if he starts to use his breaking ball a little bit more effectively it will help his fastball, the look of the fastball. He just never got to it. He got into a little trouble, left a couple pitches out over the plate that they got.  Melky Cabrera's single scored a run in the third and Tim Anderson's sacrifice fly in the fourth added another to cut the lead to 6-2. Both runs were unearned due to errors. Oakland committed three errors. The A's added two runs in the fifth on a single by Adam Rosales and a walk with the bases loaded. NOTES: The A's placed INF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) on the 10-day disabled list before Saturday's game against the White Sox. ... INF Franklin Barreto, the A's top prospect, was recalled from Triple-A Nashville to take Pinder's place. Barreto started at second base and batted seventh in the lineup after INF Jed Lowrie was scratched before the game. Lowrie twisted his right knee on Friday, manager Bob Melvin said. ... White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (left biceps bursitis) is nearing a return from the disabled list. Manager Rick Renteria said Rodon will possibly make his next start with the White Sox after throwing 93 pitches Friday in a rehab outing at Triple-A Charlotte. Rodon doesn't need another rehab start, Renteria said. Rodon has been on the DL all season. ... The White Sox retired LHP Mark Buehrle's number in a pregame ceremony. Buehrle threw a perfect game and another no-hitter during his 16-year career. ... White Sox 3B Todd Frazier was ejected for the first time in his career in the seventh inning after arguing when a review upheld an error call on his throw to first base. Renteria was also soon ejected. He has been ejected 10 times as a manager, including four times this season. ... RHP Nate Jones (right elbow neuritis) received clearance to throw. He felt good throwing Saturday, Renteria said. He has been on the DL since May 1. ... INF Tyler Saladino (back spasms) was cleared for activity and took ground balls. Renteria said the team plans to progress slowly with Saladino. He went on the DL May 27.","keywords":"Adam Rosales,Art Kruger,Bob Melvin,Carlos Rodon,Chad Pinder,Daniel Gossett,Duke Kenworthy,Franklin Barreto,Jake Petricka,James Shields,Jaycob Brugman,Jed Lowrie,John Potts,Mark Buehrle,Matt Olson,Melky Cabrera,Rick Renteria,Rookies Franklin Barreto,SABR HR,Tim Anderson,Todd Frazier,Tyler Saladino,BBO,ATHLETICS,WHITE_SOX,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 19:32:00","news_title":"Rookies make HR history, A's throttle White Sox","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED6O2OR9JT"}
{"content":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Portugal is investigating alleged appropriation of funds belonging to Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]  that were channeled through now-defunct Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo between 2009 and 2014, PDVSA said on Saturday.  PDVSA's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by high-profile corruption investigations including guilty pleas by two U.S.-based contractors who authorities said ran a $1 billion corruption scheme associated with PDVSA contracts.  Venezuela's opposition-led Congress last year said about $11 billion in funds went missing at PDVSA while Rafael Ramirez, currently Venezuela's U.N. envoy, was at the helm from 2004 to 2014. Ramirez slammed the report as  irresponsible lies.       Portuguese law enforcement agencies are investigating supposed appropriation of funds belonging to the corporation that were channeled through the above-mentioned institution,  the company said in a statement. The investigators are reviewing operations  in which there could have been money laundering and in which former employees of PDVSA and its subsidiaries could have been involved.  PDVSA until 2014 received payments for crude deliveries at its accounts at BES, as the bank was known, according to a 2014 Reuters report that cited an internal PDVSA document.

{"content":"TSOGTTSETSII, Mongolia (Reuters) - A few miles from Mongolia's giant Tavan Tolgoi mine, about 2,000 trucks a day set off across the Gobi desert, delivering coal to China on a road so narrow and ridden with pot holes it has become an accident black spot.  Nearby stand the foundations of a railway meant to connect Tavan Tolgoi to China to the south. The unfinished line would enable cash-strapped, landlocked Mongolia to sell more coal at higher prices to its biggest customer, which could also finance the project. But despite the obvious economic benefits, the project has become a casualty of the ambivalence Mongolians feel about China's growing influence. Those feelings loom large over a Mongolian presidential election on Monday.  It's been left here for two years without any work,  said the governor of Tsogttsetsii district, Orgodol Badarch, pointing to a gravel surface where the rails should have been laid, stretching into the distance for more than 200 km (124 miles).   I'm not sure, but it may have to be rebuilt completely.  Voters will choose between an investment-friendly candidate and a populist  resource nationalist  rival in an election that is a referendum on both economic policy and China's role. China's share of Mongolia's foreign trade was 68.5 percent from January to May this year, up from 1.5 percent in 1989. China took 90.5 percent of Mongolia's exports from January to May.  China wants Mongolia's coal and copper, and has the cash to build the infrastructure to get it - if Mongolia allows it. Julian Dierkes, specialist in Mongolian politics at the University of British Columbia, said there was a lot of nationalist language in the party manifestos.  Most of this must be thinking of Mongolia as united, but also, in part, united against China, even if that is not explicit,  he said. Miyeegombo Enkhbold, standing for the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), is  open to foreign investment from all countries, that of course includes investment from China , a party official told Reuters.  The reality for today is we have the supply, China has the demand,  he said, while adding that Mongolia had to diversify and  reduce inappropriate dependence  on one country. Enkhbold's main challenger, from the Democratic Party, is a former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga, who has voiced suspicion about China's aims in a country that was under Chinese domination for centuries, until it gained independence in 1921. Battulga said in an emailed statement on Thursday that China  is and must be a great partner of ours , but added that  rail and transportation for any country is both a national security and an economic issue .  FILE PHOTO: A truck transports coals to the Chinese border in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence Edwards The resources will finish in 40 to 50 years and there will definitely be conflict between the Mongolians and the Chinese,  Battulga said in a 2014 television interview. Polling is not permitted during election campaigning, but in a March survey, 24.3 percent said the MPP could best solve problems compared with 10.6 percent for the Democratic Party. Politics of Rail Mongolia's economy has more than doubled in size since 2010, but some regions have seen little benefit and lack running water and reliable electricity. While growing trade has brought jobs to Tsogttsetsii, poor transport means Mongolian coal is sold at a discount. Deliveries to China earned $66 a ton in April, half the price of shipments from Australia. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a part of half-paved road that spans 225 kilometers from the Ukhaa Khudag and Tavan Tolgoi coal mines to the China-Mongolia border, in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence EdwardsThe railway track from Tsogttsetsii was meant to have been laid in 2014, but financing dried up. A tentative 2015 pact with China's Shenhua Group and Japan's Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) to develop the mine and the railway was blocked by parliament. Progress was not helped by disputes over the gauge.  Battulga, transport minister from 2008 to 2012, had favored the wider Russian tracks, arguing that the international standard would leave Mongolia dependent on China. He recently said he'd go along with whatever parliament decided. A century ago, Chinese warlords used railways to help colonize Inner Mongolia, and some Mongolian nationalists argue a cross-border link could help facilitate a Chinese invasion. Though driven by Chinese demand, and by a billion-dollar deal to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold deposit now run by Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L), Mongolia's 2011-2013 mining boom encouraged politicians to think about ways to minimize dependence on China, and they drew up plans for rail links to the Russian Far East.       Parliamentarians also passed legislation blocking investment by foreign state-owned firms, aimed at blocking plans by the China Aluminium Corporation (2600.HK)(601600.SS) to acquire the Mongolia-based SouthGobi Resources (SGQ.TO).   But Mongolia can't be choosy. The government has been forced to implement austerity measures to secure a $5.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in May. Ultimately, economic growth may hold more allure for voters than nationalism, said Sumati Luvsanvandev, head of the Sant Maral Foundation polling group.  Anti-China sentiment cannot bring support to Battulga. They are interested in economic prosperity,  he said of voters.   They may be suspicious, but they're also quite pragmatic.

{"content":"HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Defending champions Oracle Team USA clawed their way back into the America's Cup on Saturday with a much-needed win over Emirates Team New Zealand to reduce their deficit to 4-1 in the first-to-seven final. The U.S. victory in the second race of the day gave the team backed by billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison hope of another comeback against New Zealand. Oracle Team USA won the cup in 2013 in San Francisco after staging one of the most astonishing sporting comebacks against New Zealand, winning 9-8 after having been 8-1 down. The U.S. team have spent the week working on making improvements to their 50-foot (15 meter) foiling catamaran in an effort to match the superior speed of their New Zealand rivals, who are using a revolutionary cycling system with which their sailors provide the power needed to control the boat.  That was exactly what the boys needed …. we’ve had a good improvement on our boat speed today and I think another step tomorrow would be great,  a pumped-up Jimmy Spithill, the U.S. skipper, said from onboard his boat after the race.  We worked very very hard those five days and we sailed probably five times as much as the other guys and did a lot of work on the shore and I'd just like to see the boat go quicker,  Spithill said, adding that they would be doing more overnight.

The U.S. win means the racing will now go into Monday or beyond.  It was great to see those boys actually sailing a little bit better … these guys just sailed well and we’re just excited about the battle ahead,  New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling said following the rare defeat. After five days with no racing, both crews have been working to improve the performance of their space-age catamarans, with the pressure on the U.S. crew and their extensive design and technical team to pull something out of the hat. Slideshow (5 Images)Things started badly on Saturday for the U.S. as they were fraction of a second over the line at the start of the first race, picking up a penalty which left them trailing. But although the New Zealanders got away, the U.S. champions recovered well and fought their way back into the race, finding the speed which had evaded them in previous encounters. At one stage comeback specialist Spithill managed to get a lead over Burling, but he was out-duelled and infringed the Kiwi  cat , incurring another penalty and allowing them to fly into the line on their space-age catamaran in front of a packed grandstand in Bermuda's purpose-built America's Cup Village. But in the second race there were no such errors and Spithill, who was wearing a bandage on his wrist after injuring it during a hard week's training, got away at the start. Burling and his crew fought hard to get back into the race and at one stage got a lead, only to be overtaken and ultimately left trailing in the wake of the U.S. boat as it screamed into the finish, to loud cheers from many Bermudan supporters.

{"content":"Vargas wins 11th as Royals stymie Blue Jays KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Jason Vargas continues to exceed expectations. Vargas worked seven strong innings and Alcides Escobar had three hits and scored two runs as the Kansas City Royals edged the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 on Saturday afternoon. Vargas (11-3), who leads the majors in wins, gave up two runs on eight hits. He walked none and struck out two.  He was very impressive,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He had everything working. He went out and pitched a great game.  Yost said the team  feels really good  when Vargas takes the mound.  The way he can command that changeup, it's a tough, tough pitch,  Yost said.  You see a lot of way-out front swings on it. Very seldom will he make a mistake on it.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RoyalsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchTroy Tulowitzki homered off former Long Beach State teammate Vargas to give the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead in the second inning. It was his third home run of the season and gave him seven RBIs in 24 games since coming off the disabled list. The Royals tied it in the third when Escobar tripled to lead off the inning. Right fielder Jose Bautista and center fielder Kevin Pillar ran into each other as the ball dropped behind them. Escobar scored on Whit Merrifield's sacrifice fly to shallow left, sliding in just ahead of Steve Pearce's throw. The Blue Jays challenged the call, but umpire Joe West's safe call was not overturned after a 2-minute, 16-second delay. Eric Hosmer homered, his ninth, to start the fourth inning and put Kansas City up a run. Vargas had a runner on base every inning before working a 1-2-3 sixth. Pillar and Darwin Barney singled leading off Toronto's fifth, but Luke Maile popped up a sacrifice bunt attempt that Salvador Perez caught. Bautista rolled into a double play to end the inning. The Blue Jays tied it in top of the seventh when Pillar homered with two out. The Royals regained the lead in the bottom of the inning when Alex Gordon's first triple of the year scored Escobar.  Scored two runs, two solo home runs,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  That's the frustrating part of this. We need to pick it up; you know right now we're going a little bit backwards. We climbed close. We don't want to go that other direction.  Marco Estrada (4-6) took the loss, giving up three runs on five hits and four walks before being pulled after 117 pitches and seven innings.  Vargas, he's been tough this year,  Estrada said.  These things are going to happen, so, yeah, I felt pretty good out there. I was relaxed and made a lot of good pitches, but we still lost.  Kelvin Herrera picked up his 18th save, working around a two-out single to Tulowitzki and striking out two. The Royals moved to 37-36, their first time above .500 this year after losing 20 of their first 30 games.  I didn't realize that,  Vargas said.  It's great. Hopefully we just keep stringing them together and keep pushing ourselves further and further over that mark.  The Blue Jays (35-39) dropped to four games below .500.  It was nice to see Marco pitch well,  Tulowitzki said.  I think he's definitely headed in the right direction. Bottom line, try to win a game tomorrow and go back home. I think we have only one road series before the All-Star break. Play good at home and get ourselves back into this thing.  NOTES: LF Steve Pearce returned to the Blue Jays lineup after being sidelined the previous two days with a bruised right knee. ... Closer Roberto Osuna is dealing with anxiety and was unavailable to pitch Friday when the Blue Jays' bullpen allowed four runs with two out in the ninth in a 5-4 loss. ...

{"content":"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan forces said they had gained control on Saturday over one of two remaining districts of Benghazi where they faced armed resistance. The advance in the central Souq al-Hout neighborhood was the latest step in the slow progress of the self-styled Libyan National Army commanded by Khalifa Haftar, which has been waging a campaign against Islamists and other opponents in Libya's second city for more than three years. In unusually heavy fighting in Benghazi over the past two days at least 13 men from the LNA were killed and 37 wounded, a medical official said. Many of those who died were killed by land mines, a military source said. Along with Sabri, Souq al-Hout was one of the final holdouts of the LNA's rivals. Since 2014, shifting alliances have been battling for power. The LNA and an eastern-based government have rejected a U.N.-backed government that has been in the capital, Tripoli, since last year.  Saturday's advance came after the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), an anti-Haftar armed group that includes fighters who retreated from Benghazi and have since tried and failed to advance again toward the city, said it was prepared to disband and be integrated into national security forces.

{"content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) sees no limit to the number of planes and crews it could lease from Air Berlin (AB1.DE), its chief executive told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, amid criticism that support for its ailing rival is a stealth takeover attempt.  We already support Air Berlin, in that we have leased 38 planes and set them on our routes. I can imagine, however, that we would expand this cooperation and lease further Air Berlin planes and crew,  Carsten Spohr said.  For me, there is no upper limit to this. On the other hand, I do not currently envisage a takeover of the company.  Spohr has previously expressed interest in loss-making Air Berlin on condition its debt pile and costs could be reduced. Travel agencies, the German monopoly regulator and rival carrier Ryanair (RYA.I) have raised competition concerns over any possible takeover of Air Berlin, Germany's second-biggest airline, by flagship Lufthansa. Air Berlin, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, is trying to protect roughly 8,000 jobs in Germany. Last year, the carrier made a record net loss of 782 million euros ($875 million).

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Some leading members of Britain's ruling Conservative Party want finance minister Philip Hammond to become prime minister, replacing Theresa May and steering the country through the Brexit process, the Sunday Times reported.  May, prime minister for less than a year, has been badly damaged by her failure to win a parliamentary majority in a June 8 election and is still working to persuade a small northern Irish party to support her Conservatives in government.   Hammond was sidelined for months by May during the election campaign and had been widely expected to be fired after the vote. But the party's poor showing has propelled him back into the spotlight. Citing some members of May's top team, or cabinet, the Sunday Times said Hammond should be appointed as a caretaker prime minister to see the country through until 2019 when it officially leaves the European Union.  Brexit minister David Davis should be named as his deputy, the newspaper quoted sources as saying.   I think Philip is the only plausible candidate for a couple of years, with DD (David Davis) running Brexit,  the paper quoted a serving minister as saying.   He is a more credible caretaker than the current prime minister. The PM's brand is so damaged it is painful. The calculation that people are beginning to make is that she is so inadequate we can't wait two years with her in place.  A former cabinet colleague was quoted by the paper as saying that Hammond believed he could do the job. Not all cabinet members were in agreement however, with some backing Davis and others favoring Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  A spokesman for May's Downing Street office declined to comment.

{"content":"Bibens-Dirkx, Rangers keep Yankees in tailspin NEW YORK -- Austin Bibens-Dirkx spent over a decade in the minor leagues and often needed an offseason job. After the 2010 season as a Chicago Cubs minor leaguer, Bibens-Dirkx figured he might as well get work playing baseball in the offseason. So, he headed to the winter league in Venezuela and began not only getting experience but also learning how to pitch effectively. It took nearly seven more years for the experience of his offseason employment in Latin America to pay off in a major league setting, but it did Saturday when Bibens-Dirkx allowed a run and five hits in seven effective innings for the Texas Rangers in an 8-1 victory over the New York Yankees.  More experience for one,  Bibens-Dirkx said.  It's better pay than in the minor leagues. You make literally nothing, half the time you pay to play. It was a little boost. I was going to have go get a job anyway, might as well go do baseball.  In the winter leagues in front of festive crowds, Bibens-Dirkx made 63 starts and won a pair of championship rings. He began going there five years into a professional career that started when he was a 16th-round pick by the Seattle Mariners in 2006. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at YankeesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchIt was those experiences that made pitching in Yankee Stadium for the first time easy to handle and it showed for someone who including winter leagues and independent baseball has pitched for 21 teams. Bibens-Dirkx (3-0) tied his career high for distance and did it on another big stage against a divisional leader. Nearly two weeks after allowing one run and three hits in seven innings against the National League East-leading Washington Nationals, Bibens-Dirkx was equally as effective.  It is remarkable,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  When you think about that, 12 years of experience and he's been all over the place. He's pitched in a number of different places where some guys wouldn't want to go to try to hone their craft. For him to be as calm as he is out on the mound, I really think he draws off of that experience.  In his estimation, Bibens-Dirkx only made two mistakes. The first was a four-pitch walk to Mason Williams to begin his fourth career start. It occurred after the Rangers scored a run in a 16-minute inning off Luis Cessa (0-2), and the 32-year-old right-hander said it was from not loosening up better while his teammates were batting. The second was a 1-1 pitch to slugger Aaron Judge with one out in the sixth. The pitch turned into a 439-foot homer over the left-center field fence.  I'll remember the home run. Aaron Judge is a very large human being and he's very strong,  Bibens-Dirkx said. After Judge's major league-leading 26th home run, Bibens-Dirkx quickly finished the sixth with two groundouts and was even quicker in the seventh. He gave up a single to Didi Gregorius but two pitches later was in the dugout accepting congratulations from his teammates after Tyler Austin bounced into a double play and Ronald Torreyes flied out.  It just seemed like he stayed off the barrel of the bat with some sliders changeups and cutters,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We weren't really able to square him up today.  By then the Rangers held a 4-1 lead on an RBI single in the first by Elvis Andrus, a two-run homer by Carlos Gomez in the fourth and a solo homer by Robinson Chirinos in the seventh. Texas then broke it open in the ninth against struggling reliever Tyler Clippard and did not need a save situation. Gomez scored on a wild pitch, Shin-Soo Choo ripped a two-run double and Andrus capped the scoring. Judge's 26th homer was the lone highlight for the Yankees, who lost for the ninth time in 11 games. Cessa yielded three runs and three hits in five innings but Clippard permitted four more runs, making it 11 earned runs allowed in his last seven appearances.  He's really in a funk and we've got to get him out of it,  Girardi said. NOTES: Texas RHP Yu Darvish played catch Saturday morning and reiterated he expects to make his next scheduled start after feeling tightness in his triceps on Friday. ... New York 3B Chase Headley missed his third straight game with back spasms. ...

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States agreed that efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula should be  complete, verifiable and irreversible , Chinese state media said on Saturday, reporting the results of high level talks in Washington this week.  Both sides reaffirm that they will strive for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,  a consensus document released by the official Xinhua news agency said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had said on Thursday that the United States pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea, during his meeting with top Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs. China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui met Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during the talks. Yang later met with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, where they also discussed North Korea, Xinhua reported. The consensus document also highlighted the need to fully and strictly hold to U.N. Security Council resolutions and push for dialogue and negotiation, which has long been China's position on the issue. Military-to-military exchanges should also be upgraded and mechanisms of notification established in order to cut the risks of  judgment errors  between the Chinese and U.S. militaries, the statement also said.

KCNA/via REUTERSChinese state media described the talks, the first of their kind with the Trump administration, as an upgrade in dialogue mechanisms between China and the United States, following on from President Xi Jiping's meeting with Trump in Florida in April. Xi and Trump are next expected to meet again in Hamburg during the G20 Summit next month. A day last week's talks, President Donald Trump said China's efforts to use its leverage with North Korea had failed, raising fresh doubts about his administration’s strategy for countering the threat from North Korea. The death of American university student Otto Warmbier earlier this week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, further complicated Trump’s approach to North Korea. China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has been accused of not fully enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on its neighbor, and has resisted some tougher measures.  Washington has considered further  secondary sanctions  against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea, which China opposes.

{"content":"HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Ben Ainslie is not about to give up steering the boat in his quest to bring the America's Cup back to Britain and is set to plan his next campaign as soon as he returns home next week. Ainslie would prefer the next America's Cup to be sailed in the high-speed 50-foot catamarans that have thrilled sailors and spectators over the last month in Bermuda, but he told Reuters on Saturday he would be open to other types of boat.  I still see myself as steering the boat ... This isn't all about Ben Ainslie having to steer the boat to win the America's Cup, it's about Britain winning the America's Cup,  the most successful ever Olympic sailor said at his team's base.  That's all I'm interested in and I happen to think that I'm the right person to do that job at the moment,  he added. The 40-year-old British skipper had mixed fortunes in Bermuda, but his development team won the Red Bull Youth America's Cup.   Ainslie's reputation, drive and connections in business and sailing have ensured that his Land Rover BAR team's next America's Cup campaign is already fully-funded, despite the new outfit going out of the competition at the semi-final stage. The campaign, which Ainslie said is likely to be similar in cost to the 90 million pounds ($114 million) spent on getting to Bermuda, will go ahead regardless of the outcome of the final between holders Team Oracle USA and Emirates Team New Zealand. Ainslie has signed up to a framework agreement with the U.S. and other teams which would mean the event is held every two years in catamarans similar to those being raced in Bermuda. But things could change if New Zealand triumph as the winners decide the format of the next cup and the Kiwis are the only team not to have signed up to the deal.  Sailing - America's Cup finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 24, 2017. Sailor Ben Ainslie speaks during an interview with Reuters during the America's Cup finals.Mike SegarNew Zealand lead the U.S. team 4-1 in the first-to-seven final and a win for them would mean that they have the right to change the type of boat used, as well as the venue and the timing of the next event, which has raised alarm bells for some teams that face losing sponsorship if there is uncertainty.   I don't have the fears that suddenly we'll go to New Zealand ...and it'll take the Cup back to the Dark Ages,  a tanned and bearded Ainslie said. Challenger in Waiting? Ainslie, often viewed as a voice of reason in a sport dominated by big personalities, did not rule himself out as the  challenger of record  for the 36th America's Cup, a key part of the process for the trophy, which dates back to 1851 when it was won off the south coast of England by the schooner  America . He does, however, feel that the competition would be better sticking with its current format, including the foiling 50-foot catamarans, which have provided exciting high-speed racing with plenty of lead changes and drama.   I think the foiling multihulls have proven to be great for the spectators and the sailors love them and that would be a shame to move away from that.  he said.  Regardless of who wins, Ainslie is calling for a quick decision on the format to keep the momentum from Bermuda and is a strong advocate of the World Series lead-up event, which has boosted support for fans and broadcasters.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said 34 high-rise apartment blocks had failed fire safety checks carried out after the deadly Grenfell Tower blaze, including several in north London where residents were forced to evacuate amid chaotic scenes. British officials have conducted tests on some 600 high-rise buildings across England after fire ravaged the Grenfell social tower block in west London on June 14, killing at least 79 people in the capital's most deadly blaze since World War Two. The Department for Communities said 34 apartment blocks had failed tests in 17 parts of the country, from London in the southeast to Manchester in the north and Plymouth on the southwest coast.  Prime Minister Theresa May, who was forced to apologize for the government's initial slow response to the tragedy, said the authorities were now racing to establish what needed to be done.   In some cases it's possible to take mitigating action,  she told Sky news.  In others it's been necessary for people to move out on a temporary basis and that is what happened in Camden last night.  Some 4,000 residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, were told to vacate their apartments on Friday after the Fire Brigade ruled that their blocks were unsafe.  Emerging into the streets on a hot night, residents clutched children, pets and small amounts of clothing and food to try to find a bed in a local hotel or with family or friends. Many were directed to inflatable beds laid out on the floor of the local sports hall.  Related CoverageUK firefighters battle blaze at low-rise building in east London I know it's difficult but Grenfell changes everything,  Georgia Gould, Leader of Camden Council, said in a statement.  I don't believe we can take any risks with our residents' safety.  May said the local authority would be given all the means necessary to make sure people had somewhere to stay.  Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door-to-door. Not all residents agreed to go, as they felt the evacuation was an over-reaction. A resident is evacuated from the Burnham Tower residential block as a precautionary measure following concerns over the type of cladding used on the outside of the building on the Chalcots Estate in north London, Britain, June 24, 2017.Hannah McKayPublic Anger  It was farcical communication,  21-year-old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds.  You don't get everyone to leave this quickly.  Several local councils said they were removing cladding from the facades of buildings that had failed the tests. In Camden, however, the London Fire Brigade found a number of faults, including concern about cladding, faulty fire doors and holes in compartment walls that could help a fire to spread.      Gould, the Camden council's leader, said it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated.  Slideshow (16 Images)Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was working with local authorities and fire services to address any problems that had been found.   We are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole; and we have issued interim safety guidance,  he said.  Police investigating the cause of the 24-story Grenfell Tower blaze have said the fire started in a fridge but spread rapidly due to external cladding on the building, trapping residents in their beds as they slept.  The cladding has since failed all safety checks and prompted a nationwide review of the materials used on everything from hospitals to hotels and apartment blocks. The fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at the record of May's Conservative Party in government following cuts to local authority budgets designed to lower the national deficit. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, one of the richest boroughs in Europe.  Battling to save her position after losing her majority in a June 8 election, May has promised to do everything she can to protect those residents who survived the fire and to improve the quality and safety of public housing in Britain. British police have said they are considering bringing manslaughter charges over the Grenfell fire.

{"content":"(Reuters) - If Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) hopes to revolutionize grocery delivery, then its bid to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) for $13.7 billion will be just the start of a long and costly process. The e-commerce giant would need to add a large network of specialized grocery distribution warehouses, former AmazonFresh employees and logistics experts said. This is something Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other competitors have already done. Whole Foods, with a relatively small distribution footprint of its own, does little to change the picture for Amazon, they said. Amazon has a little more than 3 million square feet of U.S. warehousing dedicated to its existing AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry grocery programs - a tenth of the warehouse space Wal-Mart has for specialized food distribution, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.  AmazonFresh really was for lack of a better word an after-thought,  said Brittain Ladd, who until March was a senior manager for the grocery delivery program, which launched in 2007. One key to Amazon's success in general retail sales has been its speed in delivering products to consumers, facilitated by warehouses located strategically throughout the United States. As of 2016, the company had about 100 million square feet of space in its fulfillment and data centers, some of it outfitted with state-of-the-art robotics to boost efficiency. Facilities for distributing fresh food are far more complicated than ordinary warehouses. A single facility can need a half dozen or more temperature settings to house products from Popsicles to berries. Some require certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and extra care must be taken to keep shelves clean and prevent pests from contaminating food. Whole Foods has over 1 million square feet of warehouse space for distribution to its markets, and a chunk of its inventory goes straight from suppliers to stores, MWPVL said.  The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol It's a peanut. It's nothing,  MWPVL President Marc Wulfraat said of Whole Foods' distribution.  If Amazon wants to become a dominant grocery company in a short period of time, then there would be an investment required, and it would be big.  Amazon, which did not return requests for comment, has not detailed its plans for Whole Foods. 12 or More Grocery Warehouses Needed Amazon's fulfillment expenses jumped 31 percent in 2016 - a bit faster than in prior years and faster than its retail sales growth - to $17.6 billion, according to its annual regulatory filing. Industry experts estimate the company would have to add a dozen or more grocery warehouses, particularly if it wanted to supply Whole Food stores in addition to homes. The cost to do that is unclear. They said Amazon would likely continue to rely on United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI.O) to supply Whole Foods with hard-to-source products, but would probably aim to cut costs and handle more of the distribution for conventional items. Even using Whole Foods stores to provide food for delivering  to nearby urban shoppers would have hard limits, since many outlets lack the floor space to handle thousands of online orders.  It’s a space issue for stuff coming through. It’s a labor issue for people tripping over each other,  said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. There would also be a risk that  the quality starts to go down because the e-commerce orders are getting better product.

{"content":"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday ratified an agreement that cedes sovereignty over two uninhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, brushing off widespread public criticism of the deal. The Red Sea islands accord has become politically sensitive for Sisi. He counts on Saudi Arabia as a key ally, but street protests broke out over the agreement last year among Egyptians angered over the concession. Egypt's parliament last week backed the deal handing control of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Saudi Arabia, but it has also become the subject of a legal tussle between different courts over jurisdiction.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ratified the maritime demarcation agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  the cabinet said in a statement. The announcement was made just as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends and on the eve of Eid al-Fitr festivities, a major public holiday when Egyptians are busy preparing to spend time with their families. The presidency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Government lawyer Rafiq Sharif told Reuters the decree was now law and the two uninhabited islands were under Saudi sovereignty.  All court decisions on the agreement were temporarily suspended this week by the head of the constitutional court, until it makes a ruling on which institution had the final say. Parliamentary leaders and government lawyers say the House of Representatives is the only entity allowed to rule on sovereignty. But in June last year the country's highest administrative court ruled Egypt's sovereignty must stand. Sisi's government announced the maritime agreement last year with Saudi Arabia, an ally which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt. The Egyptian and Saudi governments said the islands are Saudi but have been subject to Egyptian protection. FILE PHOTO: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi delivers a statement at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France November 26, 2014.Philippe Wojazer/File PhotoSaudi Arabia had helped Sisi since he toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and legal wrangling over the Red Sea deal was a source of tensions between the two countries. National Pride After last year's administrative court ruling, Saudi Arabia temporarily halted fuel shipments to Egypt, part of its aid deal. At the time, both sides denied any political fallout was involved and relations have since improved.  The transfer has been a long time coming; Riyadh has made it clear they expect the islands and Cairo agreed,  said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at American think tank Atlantic Council.  But considering the amount of opposition to the transfer, the speed at which it happened is instructive. It shows Sisi's administration doesn't feel there is much of a risk to be taken.  Still, Egyptians are increasingly critical over the state of the country's economy after years of political upheaval and a devaluation, tax rises and subsidy cuts introduced by Sisi's government. The islands issue touched a patriotic nerve, bringing thousands of protesters to the streets in April chanting  people want the fall of the regime , a slogan little heard since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Those rallies were one of the first signals the former general no longer enjoyed the broad public support that let him round up thousands of opponents after he seized power.  Now that the president has ratified it, the agreement is a law,  said Khaled Ali, chief lawyer defending the case for the islands being Egyptian and a former presidential candidate.  So we will continue the legal battle to show that it is unconstitutional and void.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish veteran Feliciano Lopez helped banish the memory of one of his most painful defeats when he beat Grigor Dimitrov to set up an Aegon Championships final against Marin Cilic on Saturday. Three years after failing to convert a match point in the Queen's Club title match against the Bulgarian, the 35-year-old left-hander avenged that loss with a 7-5 3-6 6-2 victory. If he is not to fall short for a second time, however, he will have to produce his best tennis again a fired-up Cilic who overcame Luxembourg's in-form Gilles Muller. Fourth seed Cilic, bidding for a repeat of the title he won in 2012, dropped serve for the first time all week but recovered quickly to win 6-3 5-7 6-4, ending veteran Muller's seven-match winning streak on grass. Lopez capitalized on a run of Dimitrov errors at 5-5 in the first set to break before holding serve with ease. A rain delay midway through the second set broke his rhythm though and sixth seed Dimitrov seized his chance to level. Lopez was comfortably the better player in the decider, though, as he moved through to the final.  It's a gift to be in this final again,  Lopez, who looked close to tears at the end, told reporters.  I think the first set was the best I've played all week.  You can imagine how important it is for me to be in the finals of Queen's at this stage of my career. It is one of the tournaments I love. I was dreaming to play.

Swinging Delivery Lopez, Cilic and Muller had all reached the semi-finals without dropping serve, so it was a surprise when Cilic began to read Muller's swinging delivery early on and broke in the fifth game of the day's first semi-final. Slideshow (13 Images)Cilic wrapped up the opening set quickly and had he converted break points in the third or seventh games of the second set he would have spared himself any undue stress. Instead, one lapse of concentration at 5-6 blotted his copybook to allow Muller to snatch the second set. It was nothing more than an inconvenience, though, as Croatian Cilic broke in the seventh game of the decider and powered to victory, sealing it with a second-serve ace. Cilic, set to move to a career-high ranking of six, will now have the chance to win the title in more orthodox fashion than in 2012 when his opponent, Argentina's David Nalbandian, was defaulted for injuring the leg of a line judge when kicking out at a hoarding in anger.  A title is a title,  he joked.  They still say 17 titles. They don't say 16 and a half. But it's great to be back in the final for a third time, playing great tennis.  The one worry for the Croatian is that his doubles semi-final in which he was partnering Marcin Matkowski against Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares was not finished because of rain, meaning he faces a busy schedule on Sunday.

Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev completely mis-read the situation after Hector Herrera sent a looping clearance 80 meters downfield from the edge of the Mexican area seven minutes into the second half. The ball bounced once about 25 meters from the Russian goal and, as Akinfeev and his defense dallied, Lozano bravely nipped in to head the ball over the goalkeeper from the edge of the area to send the CONCACAF champions into the semi-finals.

Russia's early exit from was another setback for next year's World Cup hosts who also went out of last year's European Championship at the group stage, when they failed to win a game and were regarded by many as the worst team in the tournament.

{"content":"GLASTONBURY, England (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn got a rock star reception at Glastonbury Festival on Saturday, telling a headliner-sized crowd that millions of young people who voted for him would not be silenced or sidelined. Dismissed as a left-wing no-hoper before elections on June 8, Corbyn attracted a surge of support from 18-24 year-olds that helped his Labour Party deny Prime Minister Theresa May a parliamentary majority. The 68-year old's popularity at Worthy Farm in south-west England could be measured by the number of pro-Corbyn banners on display and Corbyn T-shirts. They easily outnumbered those for the biggest names on the musical bill - Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran - and the chant  Oh, Jeremy Corbyn  rang round the world's biggest greenfield festival. Appearing between British singer-songwriter Craig David and U.S. rap act Run The Jewels, Corbyn - who promised during campaigning to abolish tuition fees -  said he was proud to have led Labour into an election that delivered the biggest increase in the party's support since 1945.  But what was even more inspiring was the number of young people who got involved for the very first time because they were fed up with being denigrated, fed up with being told they don't matter (and) fed up with being told they never participate,  he said to cheers from the crowd.  And that politics that got out of the box isn't going back into the box.  Corbyn, invited to speak on the famous stage by festival founder Michael Eavis, said Glastonbury was about people coming together in support of causes like environmentalism.  There is only one planet - not even Donald Trump believes there is another planet somewhere else,  he said. Eleri Angharad, a 25-year-old musician sporting a Corbyn T-shirt, said the veteran socialist was authentic.  He makes an effort to connect with people, and people connect back with him,  she said. Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses revellers from the Pyramid Stage at Worthy Farm in Somerset during the Glastonbury Festival in Britain, June 24, 2017.Dylan MartinezShe said she wasn't surprised by his support among young people, having seen his popularity rise on social media.  I don't read newspapers, I don't know anybody who does,  she said. But not every young person was won over.  It's very smart to target our age with tuition fees,  said 18-year old Hannah, who voted for the first time on June 8.  He's targeting the naive of our generation.  Engagement Slideshow (4 Images)Corbyn pulled out of a Glastonbury visit last year after the country voted to leave the European Union just as the festival started. Billy Bragg, the singer, songwriter and activist who runs the Leftfield politics and music stage, said Brexit had shocked young people into becoming interested in politics, and their influence had been seen a year later.   Even if it wasn't the youth 'what won it', the engagement among young people has shot up,  he said.  If it can be sustained, it's a sea change in British politics because it means that all parties will have to take their views into account.   An undercurrent of politics also swirled around the Other Stage, where former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher ended his set by asking the crowd to join in a rendition of  Don't Look Back in Anger  in memory of the victims of recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, and the Grenfell Tower fire. Pollster Ipsos Mori said week that age had been a bigger dividing factor on June 8 than in any election since it began keeping records in 1979, with the biggest rise in turnout coming from the young, although they were still far less likely to vote than the old. Both main parties increased their share of the national vote compared with 2015, at the expense of smaller parties. But Labour's share increased by 9.5 points to 40 percent, while the Conservatives' rose 5.5 points to 42.4 percent.

{"content":"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - European champions Portugal comfortably dispatched New Zealand 4-0 to reach the Confederations Cup semi-finals on Saturday after Cristiano Ronaldo set them on their way with a penalty. Portugal's all-time leading scorer swept the ball home in the 33rd minute, his 75th goal for his country, and Bernardo Silva added the second four minutes later.  A solo effort from Andre Silva, his eighth goal in 11 appearances, in the 80th minute and a stoppage-time goal from substitute Nani completed the scoring.      It was a typically efficient performance from Portugal who never looked in real danger despite a sluggish start. However, it was not all good news as Bernardo Silva went off injured at halftime, while a needless and reckless challenge from Pepe, with his side 2-0 up, earned the controversial central defender his second yellow card of the tournament, ruling him out of Wednesday's semi-final.  It was an odd game - we were in control, but they started creating problems, and if it had got back to 2-1, it could have got complicated,  said Portugal coach Fernando Santos. New Zealand goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic, who helped Unterhaching win promotion from the German fourth division last season, kept the score down with a superb second-half display. The Oceania champions were far from disgraced but have now competed in the tournament four times without winning a game and have an overall record of 11 defeats and a draw in 12 matches.

We know we've played some really good football at times. We never stopped. We created chances, we put them under pressure, so we could have got a little more out of this tournament,  he told reporters. Slideshow (13 Images) This team are on the right path, they have got great character, great belief and it's a young team moving in the right direction.  Portugal topped Group A with seven points from three games, ahead of Mexico on goal difference after the CONCACAF champions beat hosts Russia 2-1. New Zealand finished bottom of the group after losing all three games. Ronaldo had already headed against the crossbar before firing Portugal ahead after Danilo went tumbling under a challenge from two defenders and the referee pointed to the spot without asking for a video replay. Bernardo Silva turned Eliseu's low cross into the net four minutes later, although he suffered a knock on the ankle in the process.     Marinovic made impressive saves to deny Ronaldo, Andre Silva and Nani but was powerless stop Andre Silva when he collected the ball on the halfway line, ran at two defenders who backed off, and fired his shot into the far corner. Nani completed the scoring with his 25th international goal.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Merck KGaA has won a key recommendation to become a late entrant to the market for oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs in Europe, six years after its first attempt to launch the cladribine pill failed.   The European Medicines Agency, the EU's drugs regulator, said on Friday its experts had come out in favour of approving cladribine, branded as Mavenclad, for the treatment of the relapsing forms of MS. The European Commission, which has the final word, typically adopts the experts' view. In 2011, U.S. drug regulators' concerns about whether cladribine could cause cancer put an end to Merck's development and marketing plans for the drug. Since then, other drugmakers have pulled ahead with oral MS treatments, gradually replacing standard injection therapies and reaching a share of the overall MS market of more than 40 percent. The main contenders are Biogen's Tecfidera, with about $4 billion in global sales, as well as Gilenya from Novartis and Sanofi's Aubagio. But Merck, a diversified chemicals and healthcare group, further analysed the trials it conducted at the time and the insight encouraged it last year to seek approval in Europe without conducting further studies. Merck has said it might file for regulatory approval in the United States, depending on ongoing discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Oral drugs are taking market share from established injectable MS drugs such as Merck KGaA's Rebif, Teva's Copaxone and Bayer's Betaferon/Betaseron.

{"content":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) - A Tennessee jury on Friday found a former Vanderbilt University football player guilty of raping an unconscious female student in a teammate's dormitory room in 2013. The Nashville jury found Brandon Banks, 23, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery after deliberating for about 15 hours over two days. The case stoked simmering concern about sexual assault on college campuses by athletes. Banks faces at least 15 years in prison, Assistant District Attorney Roger Moore told media. Sentencing will be Aug. 18.  We are very satisfied with their verdict,  Moore said. Defense attorney Mark Scruggs did not respond to a request to comment. He was quoted by The Tennessean newspaper as saying that Banks was  shocked but understands that this is only the first part of this process. There's a lot more to do from here on.  Teammates Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey, two of the four former Vanderbilt football players charged in the case along with Banks, were found guilty when tried together in January 2015 but a mistrial was declared.  Batey was later retried, convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Vandenburg was found guilty in June 2016 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. A fourth player, Jaborian “Tip” McKenzie, who testified against his three teammates, has yet to stand trial in the case. The players used cell phones to record their crimes, and those videos - shown to the jurors in all the trials – played crucial roles in the prosecution’s case. Vandenburg and the victim, who had been dating, met for drinks at a bar popular with Vanderbilt students. Both had been drinking prior to meeting, according to testimony. Vandenburg tried to take the victim, who was unconscious, to her apartment, but could not get in. He then took her back to his dormitory, where the other three men charged in the case helped cart her to his room, which was the site of the attacks, prosecutors said.  The victim, who has not been named, testified against all three men for their roles in the rapes. Banks testified in his own defense and said he was intimidated by the other players and participated because he was scared of retribution that night and later on the football field.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) -  Mr Nice Guy  Marin Cilic believes a more aggressive attitude on court can propel him toward a title push at Wimbledon. On the surface the 28-year-old has the A-game for the All England Club's lawns -- a mighty serve, bludgeoning groundstrokes and, for a such a tall man, nimble court coverage. Yet he has never got past the quarter-finals and last year faltered from two sets up against Roger Federer, squandering three match points in an epic last-eight clash. With the grasscourt season in full swing, though, there are signs that Croatian Cilic, who will rise to a career-high ranking of six on Monday, has rediscovered the killer instinct that saw him sweep to the 2014 U.S. Open title when he beat Federer in the semis before overpowering Japan's Kei Nishikori. At Queen's Club on Saturday, where he won the title in 2012, Cilic reached the final of the Aegon Championships with an impressive 6-3 5-7 6-4 defeat of Gilles Muller, who had been on a seven-match winning streak on grass. With coach Jonas Bjorkman sitting courtside, Cilic clearly meant business, with observers remarking how  fired up  he was throughout the contest -- not something that has always been associated with the Monte Carlo-based giant.  I'm being a little bit more motivated, and that is driving me a little bit more to be aggressive on the court, which is extremely important in my own sense,  Cilic said. Some of his statistics this week have been remarkable. He won 50 of his 51 first-serve points during his first two rounds at Queen's -- either with unreturnable deliveries or, when the ball did come back, punishing forehands. Against Muller he served 20 aces and dropped only four points on first serve, making that 10 for the week. His conversion of break points (two of 13) was disappointing but proof that Cilic's return game, against one of the game's best servers, is also in fine fettle. Swede Bjorkman, a fine exponent of grasscourt tennis, has even encouraged Cilic to play more doubles to make him more confident at the net, and that paid dividends at Queen's where Cilic and Marcin Matkowski reached the doubles final. Confidence Under Pressure  That was a goal,  Bjorkman says.  To get a bit more comfortable up there. It's one thing doing it in practice but playing competitive doubles helps you have that confidence to do it when the pressure is on.  With his run to the Queen's final after losing in the semis on the grass of Den Bosch last week, Cilic will have only the  big five  ahead of him in the ATP rankings. But he wants more.  The target is top five,  he said.  All those top-five guys are definitely amazing players so to even be close is a great challenge and big motivation.  I know I can match them, but during the course of the year, it was difficult for me to keep it up. But I think I'm getting closer to that consistency level. That's the biggest step.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a highly unusual intervention, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to remove Iraq and Myanmar from a U.S. list of the world's worst offenders in the use of child soldiers, disregarding the recommendations of State Department experts and senior U.S. diplomats, U.S. officials said. The decision, confirmed by three U.S. officials, would break with longstanding protocol at the State Department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the Trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights.  Tillerson overruled his own staff’s assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in Asia and the Middle East who wanted to keep Iraq and Myanmar on the list, said the officials, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations. Tillerson also rejected an internal State Department proposal to add Afghanistan to the list, the three U.S. officials said. One official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the Pentagon to avoid complicating  assistance to the Iraqi and Afghan militaries, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamist militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving U.S. military aid, training and U.S.-made weapons unless the White House issues a waiver. Human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting, which was expected to be announced on Tuesday, the officials said, as part of the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. A State Department official said the TIP report's contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department  does not discuss details of internal deliberations.  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that  no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  in order for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume. In the lead-up to Tuesday's report, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which researches the issue and helps shape U.S. policy on it, along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in Asia and the Middle East concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list, the officials said. Officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last-minute changes. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference after talks with Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs at the State Department in Washington, U.S. June 21, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBetraying Children Human Rights Watch said removing Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list would be a  completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses.  The decision also would put the Trump administration at odds with the United Nations, which continues to list the Myanmar military, along with seven ethnic armed groups, on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers.  What's particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the U.N. in Burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited  by the Myanmar military, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Rights groups have long accused Myanmar of using child soldiers. Bordering both China and India, Myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the United States at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by China, which has sought closer relations with its neighbor. Iraq, which has received more than $2 billion in U.S. arms and training over the last three years, was added to the State Department’s  Child Soldier Prevention Act List  in 2016. However, the flow of U.S. assistance has continued. Former President Barack Obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly, including last year to Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and others out of 10 countries on the list. Last year's State Department report said some militias of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Shi'ite Muslim factions with ties to the Iraqi government and backed by Iran,  recruited and used child soldiers.  The report said that despite the PMF being funded by the government, Baghdad struggled to control all of its factions.  The government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the PMF and PMF-affiliated militias.      Human Rights Watch said in January that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one Iraqi refugee camp since last spring.     The broader TIP report, the first of Trump's presidency, is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his  America First  approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments, especially strategically important ones, for human rights violations at home. The Obama administration, while more vocal about political repression around the world, also faced criticism from human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers that decisions on annual human trafficking rankings had become increasingly politicized.

{"content":"CARACAS (Reuters) - A man describing himself as a former boss and friend of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday urged an investigation into the killing of his son in anti-government unrest convulsing the OPEC nation for nearly three months. David Vallenilla, 22, was shot at close range by a military police sergeant on Thursday, apparently with rubber bullets, as youths tried to pull down the fence around an air force base in Caracas and threw rocks at officials who had fired tear gas from inside. Maduro's critics said the killing was further evidence of abuse by security forces after protests since April by demonstrators demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the South American country amid a deepening economic and political crisis. At least 75 people have been killed in the protests so far, according to an official count on Friday. The victims include Vallenilla and another youth killed on Monday near the same base. In both incidents, soldiers were caught on camera with guns pointing at the protesters.   I want to speak to my former colleague of the Caracas Metro, Nicolas Maduro, you know that we worked together, I'm Supervisor Vallenilla ... I was your boss,  said the slain protester's father, also named David Vallenilla, referring to the years when Maduro worked as a bus driver.  I want to make sure this is resolved Nicolas, please, he wasn't a criminal, he was a graduating student ... please friend,  the elder Vallenilla told reporters outside a morgue as tears streamed down his face.  You met him when he was little.  Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the link between Vallenilla and Maduro. Maduro, who makes frequent reference to his former job as a bus driver to highlight his working-class roots, calls the protests an effort to violently remove him from office with the backing of ideological adversaries in Washington. However, the president condemned the latest  painful  deaths and ordered a newly promoted general to make sure that  nobody else falls.  Speaking at a Friday event where he gave new positions to several military officials, Maduro said,  The use of firearms is prohibited and I ratify the prohibition.

Barricades Opposition leaders have vowed to remain in the streets to demonstrate against what many are now calling a dictatorship and to demand a solution to economic crisis that has created chronic shortages of staple goods and left millions struggling to eat. Slideshow (13 Images)The crisis has brought strong words from world leaders and diplomatic efforts to build dialogue between Maduro and his critics. At Maduro's insistence, Venezuela is due to elect a new popular assembly next month to rewrite the constitution. Critics say Maduro will use it to consolidate power and keep adversaries in jail. Around Caracas on Friday, demonstrators burned tires and blocked roads while chanting slogans that included  No To Dictatorship  and  Murderer, Maduro  to protest Vallenilla's death.  We don't have weapons, the only option we have is to shut down the country,  said Joselyn Almeida who walked out of her office with colleagues to join around 100 people in blocking a main avenue in the upscale district of Las Mercedes. Officials say the recent wave of street protests across Venezuela, often resulting in vandalism, have arbitrarily restricted free transit and commerce and even prevented ambulances from reaching hospitals. A group of demonstrators on Friday returned to the spot where Vallenilla was killed. They set three trucks on fire and pushed one of them against the fence of the air base, which they later partially tore down. Opposition leaders said the demonstrators were not part of the broader protest and insisted the incident was staged by the government to tarnish the protest movement.

{"content":"BAKU (Reuters) - Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton admitted on Saturday that greed almost cost him dearly before he clinched a landmark pole during qualifying for Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The three-times Formula One champion pipped team mate Valtteri Bottas to first place on the grid to secure his 66th career pole – one more than his childhood hero Ayrton Senna and two off record-holder Michael Schumacher. It was touch and go at one stage as Hamilton trailed his team mate after running wide on turn 16, with Bottas appearing destined for pole.  The lap before was very good until the last corner,  Hamilton told journalists in the post-qualifying press conference.  (It was) so weird that, just before going into it, I thought, 'don't be greedy'.   Of course, I was greedy and locked up.  A red flag prompted by Daniel Ricciardo's collision late on in his Red Bull left Hamilton with enough time to attempt to overhaul Bottas, and in a gutsy shootout, he eventually pipped the Finn to top spot by 0.434 of a second.  It was do or die,  Hamilton added.  If ever there was a time to be perfect, that was the time.  In qualifying, sometimes you don't extract it, but it was a perfect lap.  All weekend we've not been able to (get our tires up to temperature) in one lap, but others have, so I had to give it everything,  he continued.  I could see (Bottas) was on a great lap, as well.  The British driver dominated the practice sessions on Baku's street circuit last year before clipping the barriers during qualifying and starting the race 10th on the grid, ultimately finishing fifth.

He has a hit in 11 of his last 13 games overall, hitting .382 since June 12. RHP James Shields (1-0, 2.42 ERA) will make his second start since coming off the disabled list on Sunday. He allowed three earned runs in 5 2/3 innings to the Toronto Blue Jays in his first start since injuring his shoulder in April. He is 6-5 in 16 career starts against the Oakland Athletics with a 4.15 ERA. In 132 career day games, Shields has a 3.65 ERA. RHP Mike Pelfrey threw 106 pitches in 4 2/3 innings in Friday's loss, dropping to 3-6 on the season. He had been 3-1 in his previous six starts. Pelfrey allowed two home runs after having not allowed a homer since May 26.","keywords":"Bruce Maxwell,James Shields,Jose Abreu,Mike Pelfrey,Rick Renteria,Tim Anderson,BBO,WHITE_SOX,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"Chicago White Sox - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XQB5"}
{"content":"2B Whit Merrifield delivered his first career game walk-off hit Friday. His two-run double with two-out in the ninth gave the Royals a 5-4 victory over the Blue Jays. The Royals had been 0-29 when trailing after eight innings this season before Merrifield's double. RHP Jake Junis allowed two runs on six hits, two walks, a wild pitch and a balk over 6 1/3 innings in a no-decision.  I thought Jake threw the ball well,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  The fourth inning there, kind of got himself into a little bit of trouble. A walk, and a wild pitch, didn't help his cause.  But, six-and-a-third strong innings kept us in the ball game and gave us a chance to win the ballgame.  RHP Neftali Feliz, who was released Monday by the Brewers, was signed by the Royals and added to their bullpen. Feliz was 1-5 with a 6.00 ERA in 23 relief appearances with Milwaukee. He went 8-for-9 in save situations, but lost the closer's job. Manager Ned Yost said initially he would use Feliz in low pressure situations since he has not pitched in nine days. He gave up a run on a homer in one inning on June 13, his final Brewers' appearance. Before that on June 11, he faced four Arizona batters and retired none, giving up two hits, including a home run, and walking two. The Royals are confident pitching coach Dave Eiland can fix Feliz mechanically.  It's not a risk, a low risk, high reward type of thing,  Yost said on picking up Feliz. He said Feliz is healthy and still possesses a 97 mile per hour fastball. LHP Danny Duffy will start Saturday for Triple-A Omaha to begin a minor league release assignment. He is on the disabled list with an oblique strain. Manager Ned Yost said they need to build up Duffy's pitch count to around 90 before bringing him back. C Salvador Perez doubled in the ninth and singled in the seventh. He has a hit in 12 of the past 13 games he has played when he has had an at-bat. He is hitting .451 in that stretch since June 5 with six doubles, four home runs and a dozen RBIs. RHP Chris Young, who has been struggling since being an essential part of the Royals' 2015 World Series pitching staff, was designated for assignment. Young went 11-6 with a 3.06 in 2015 and was 1-0 with a 2.87 ERA in four postseason appearances, including two starts. He was the winning pitcher against the Mets in the World Series opener. Since then Young is 3-9 with a 6.52 ERA, allowing 86 earned runs in 118 2/3 innings.  It was hard, but it was the right thing to do,  Royals general manager Dayton Moore said of releasing Young. He said the signing of RHP Neftali Feliz  potentially  should upgrade the bullpen.","keywords":"Chris Young,Danny Duffy,Dave Eiland,Dayton Moore,Jake Junis,Ned Yost,Neftali Feliz,Salvador Perez,BBO,ROYALS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"Kansas City Royals - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XQB4"}
{"content":"C Derek Norris went 3-for-3 with a two-run homer on Friday, though his time with the Rays will be short-lived. Wilson Ramos will be activated from the disabled list Sunday, and it will be at Norris' expense. Norris will be designated for assignment Saturday. Norris went into the game hitting just .188 but had been somewhat productive with 22 RBIs in 52 games. RHP Chris Archer wasn't sparkling by any means but picked up the win for the second straight start Friday. Archer lasted six innings but did give up five runs and eight hits -- the runs are his most in seven starts, but he also had a 9-2 lead after three innings. His ERA went up from 3.75 to 3.97. OF Shane Peterson was called up from Triple-A Durham before Friday's game and came through with a career-best four RBIs, including a two-run homer. Peterson was leading Durham with 10 home runs before the call-up, and he's making the most of another shot in the majors while Colby Rasmus is sidelined with a hip injury. 3B Evan Longoria, coming off back-to-back off days, came through with four RBIs in the Rays' win on Friday night. He had a two-run single for the game's first hit, a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly. Longoria now has 42 RBIs this season. OF Colby Rasmus was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 19, with left hip tendinitis. Rasmus had been held out for several days, but the hope is the extended rest will keep the injury from impacting the rest of the season.

Ynoa had a 4.26 ERA in four appearances before being sent down. He had 12 strikeouts against only two walks. 1B Trey Mancini had two hits in Friday's loss -- an RBI single in the second inning and an RBI double in the sixth. His 40 RBIs rank second on the Orioles behind only Jonathan Schoop. 3B Manny Machado had a quiet Friday, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout on a day in which the Orioles managed 11 hits in a losing effort. Machado's season average dropped to .225, but he remains in the No. 2 slot in the Orioles' batting order. RHP Ubaldo Jimenez's pitching struggles continued in a big way. He lasted only 2 1/3 innings while giving up nine earned runs and seven hits. Jimenez dropped to 2-3 and saw his ERA increase by a full run from 6.25 to 7.26. He gave up two two-run homers in the third inning alone. He had two walks and a passed ball before the Rays put the ball in play once. RHP Darren O'Day was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and pitched a scoreless eighth inning in his first game back. O'Day is a key part of Baltimore's bullpen, so his healthy return is a major plus as the Orioles work to get back on track.","keywords":"Darren O'Day,Gabriel Ynoa,Jonathan Schoop,Manny Machado,BBO,ORIOLES,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"Baltimore Orioles - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XQB2"}

He made his major league debut, starting in right, going 0-for-3 with a strikeout and sacrifice bunt. Parmley gives credit to Blue Jays minor league outfield and base running coordinator Tim Raines for improving his defense and base stealing skills.  The Rock's good,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said of Raines.  They all love him. The thing about Rock is that Rock's got time for everybody, whether he's a prospect or just a guy filling out the team. No one's better.  LF Steve Pearce missed his second straight game with a right knee bone contusion. Pearce was hurt Wednesday while crashing into the wall at Texas when he attempted to make a catch. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said Pearce should avoid going on the disabled list.  It's a big outfield out there (Kauffman Stadium), especially if you're hobbling, too,  Gibbons said of not playing Pearce. LHP Jason Happ is 2-0 with a 1.86 ERA in his past three starts. He gave up one run on four hits with five strikeouts and no walks in 6 2/3 innings in a no-decision Friday against the Royals.  Just trying to stay out of the middle as much as I can and just trying to stick that ball to each side and just use everything,  Happ said.  I feel like it is getting better.  RHP Cesar Valdez was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo. He made two relief appearances with Toronto, allowing four runs on four hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings. With Valdez's demotion, the Blue Jays have a seven-man bullpen.

{"content":"RHP Hector Velazquez was optioned to Pawtucket after Friday night's game. He is 1-1 in three games, two starts, in his two stints with the Red Sox this season. RHP Doug Fister, who opted out of his minor league deal with the Angels this week, was claimed off waivers by the Red Sox from Los Angeles and will start against the Angels in the series finale Sunday. The veteran, reunited with Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski, pitched 15 2/3 innings and had a 4.02 ERA with Salt Lake. He is 77-76 with a 3.60 ERA pitching for four major league teams. Fister will become the 10th starter used by the Red Sox this season.  What I saw made me think he's going to be a tough guy to beat on Sunday,  Angels RHP Huston Street, who had been rehabbing while Fister was at Salt Lake, told the Providence Journal. Said Dombrowski:  It gives us an established, winning pitcher who's been through postseason play, been through a pennant race.  RHP Carson Smith, coming back from Tommy John surgery, has been told to rest for the weekend. He will be re-evaluated Monday. -C Sandy Leon hit a two-run homer and two-run double in Friday night's win. It was his second four-RBI game of the season and the fourth of his career. He also had a single, tying his season high of three hits.  We got a good team,  said Leon.  I think we were going to just get a win for David (Ortiz) today. He deserved that.  INF Josh Rutledge was a late scratch Friday night with a sore hip that has been a recurring problem. LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, on the disabled list with right knee subluxation, will face hitters Saturday and the team hopes he can return before the All-Star break. 3B Jhonny Peralta, released by the St. Louis Cardinals, signed with the Red Sox and will report to Triple-A Pawtucket. He could become an answer to the team's ongoing problem at the position. DH Hanley Ramirez hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning, the 250th home run of his career. It was his 19th career full-count homer, his first of the season. Ramirez has reached safely in his last 24 home games, the longest active streak in the American League and second-longest in the AL this season. 2B Dustin Pedroia, who missed the three games in Kansas City after getting hit in the back with a pitch in Houston last Sunday, was a late addition to the starting lineup with Josh Rutledge nursing a sore hip. He walked and eventually scored on a wild pitch in the first inning, but then grounded out three straight times. He also spoke in the pregame David Ortiz ceremony.  It was a special night,  said Pedroia, who represented the 2017 team.  Obviously he means a lot to us and the city ... he played with a lot of guys and he affected them in a major way.  Pedroia was the final speaker before Ortiz, noting Ortiz was  family.   Ortiz, dabbing tears, then said,  The little guy made me cry.  RHP Rick Porcello avoided becoming the first 10-game loser in the major leagues, improving to 4-9 with 6 1/3 innings of solid work in Friday night's win over the Angels. It was his first win in six starts since May 23. He had allowed just one run on five hits before giving up three straight extra-base hits with one out in the seventh, ending his night, but he notched his ninth straight start of at least six innings.    It was, to me, vintage Rick Porcello,  manager John Farrell said.  The sink had returned to his two-seamer and it's a tribute to the work that he continues to do.  LHP David Price makes his sixth start of the season against the Angels on Saturday night. Price is 2-1 with a 5.14 ERA but has allowed 12 earned runs on 20 hits in going 1-1 over his last three.

{"content":"LHP Felipe Rivero picked up the final five outs for his third win of the year, continuing a stellar season that should earn him All-Star consideration. Rivero has allowed just 19 hits and nine walks in 40 innings, pitching to an ERA of 0.68 in 38 games. Rivero, who sports a 99 mph fastball, has fanned 43 batters and rarely finds barrels. RHP Jameson Taillon pitched a good game Friday night but came away with no decision. Taillon allowed four hits and two runs over six innings, walking two and fanning seven. His only mistake was a white-on-white fastball that Jose Martinez ripped over the wall in left for a two-run homer in the second. If Taillon can be a bit more efficient with his pitches, he could be a front-of-the-rotation guy. 1B Josh Bell clouted his 14th homer in the second inning, the second most prior to the All-Star break for a Pirates rookie since Ralph Kiner hit 15 in 1946. Bell has knocked in a run in each of the last three games, the third time he's done that this year. He nearly had a bigger hit in the eighth, but just missed a meaty 3-0 pitch and flew out harmlessly to center to strand three runners. 3B David Freese produced a game-tying two-out RBI single in the top of the eighth inning, breaking a trend that's hampered his production this year. Prior to that hit, Freese was 3-for-22 with runners in scoring position and two outs. The former St. Louis World Series hero of 2011 has reached base safely in all 14 games he's started against the Cardinals RHP Gerrit Cole gets the ball Saturday night when Pittsburgh continues its weekend series in St. Louis. Cole is coming off an 8-1 win Monday night in Milwaukee in which he sailed through seven innings, giving up only three hits and a run with two walks and five strikeouts.

Asuaje raised his average from .233 to .250 in June with the Chihuahuas and had more walks (40) than strikeouts (33) at Triple-A this season. He was 0-for-2 in a two-day cameo with the Padres earlier in the season. C-1B Hector Sanchez was reinstated from the disabled list Friday. The switch-hitter had been out since May 7 with a left foot contusion. Sanchez was hitting .269 (7-for-26) on a rehab assignment with El Paso, but was 4-for-6 with a double, two home runs and four RBIs in a game earlier this week. Sanchez gives the Padres a power bat off the bench from both sides of the plate. The Padres have little power on the bench. RHP Miguel Diaz was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday with a right forearm strain. The Rule 5 draftee departed Wednesday's start after 2 1/3 innings after allowing no runs on a hit and a walk with a strikeout. Diaz was making his third start.

Hedges is 7-for-21 over his last six games with three doubles and four RBIs. 2B-3B Yangervis Solarte was placed on the 10-day disabled list as expected Friday with a left oblique strain. Solarte suffered the injury Tuesday before the Padres' second game against the Cubs.  You never know with obliques,  said Padres manager Andy Green.  It could be two to three weeks, and I've see some take six to seven weeks.  Solarte had been the Padres' hottest hitter.

Cessa faced the Rangers as a relief pitcher and was the winning pitcher in a 9-7 win on June 29. 1B Tyler Austin will be called up from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes/Barre Saturday. Austin fractured his foot early in spring training and is hitting .300 with four homers and 22 RBIs in the minors this season. Last year he batted .241 with five homers and 12 RBIs in 31 games. RHP Masahiro Tanaka did not get a win but lowered his ERA from 6.34 to 5.74 when he allowed three hits in eight scoreless innings Friday. Tanaka recorded 23 swinging strikes, the second most in his career. He also threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters. It was the third time he pitched at least eight scoreless innings this season and he is one of four pitchers with multiple starts of at least eight scoreless innings. The others are Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana, St. Louis RHP Carlos Martinez and Cleveland RHP Corey Kluber. 3B Chase Headley (back spasms) missed a second straight game and likely will miss Saturday's game.

The surgery has an estimated recovery time of 12 to 14 months. The Dodgers have been cautious with Urias, who turns 21 in August, since he became a top prospect in limiting his innings. After a few struggles this season, he was sent to Triple-A Oklahoma City and soon after went on the disabled list.  We feel pretty confident that he will pitch for us next year,  club president Andrew Friedman said before Friday's game.  We know how hard Julio worked this offseason. He had high expectations of helping us win, as did we.  Friedman is optimistic that Urias will recover even though shoulder surgeries can be more complicated than elbow injuries. RHP Chris Hatcher was placed on the 10-day disabled list with thoracic inflammation. He pitched in Thursday's win over the Mets, allowing a run, hit and walk. He has a 4.66 ERA in 2017. SS Corey Seager had two hits, scored a run and had a RBI in Friday's 6-1 win over Colorado but left the game after two innings when he tweaked his right hamstring. It was a precautionary move. He will have an MRI and manager Dave Roberts said it's unlikely he will play Saturday.  It doesn't feel bad,  Seager said.  It tightened up like a cramp. I've had a bunch of these before and played through them, but you can also make it worse by playing.  LHP Alex Wood improved his record to a sterling 8-0 with a stout six inning effort Friday in a 6-1 win over the Rockies. He allowed three hits, two of them soft, and struck out seven. He lowered his ERA to 1.86 and hasn't lost a game since May 30, 2016. In 22 career games at Dodger Stadium, he has a 11-2 record and 1.77 ERA. RHP Ross Stripling was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City to replace Chris Hatcher (0-1, 4.66) in the bullpen. Stripling pitched 100 innings for the Dodgers last season, going 5-9 with a 3.96 ERA in 22 appearances, including 14 starts. He's 0-3 with a 4.00 in 2017.

{"content":"C Oscar Hernandez was designated for assignment on Friday, a move that removes him from the organizational roster and could effectively end the former Rule 5 draft pick's time with the team. He played in 22 games with Arizona the last two seasons and hit one home run. A former international signee by Tampa Bay, he was the first player selected in the Rule 5 draft five years later. He was hitting .197 with five homers and 13 RBIs at Double-A Jackson. OF A.J. Pollock, out since May 14 with a left groin injury, is ramping up his rehabilitation again and could be ready to play again Sunday on a rehab assignment at Triple-A Reno. He hasn't played since feeling tightness in his right quadriceps on Monday, during his second game at Reno.  He had a very aggressive day (Thursday) and another really aggressive day (Friday), then he'll back off it Saturday and play in a game on Sunday,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  But day-by-day things can change. That's the initial plan, but it can be changed based on what A.J. tells us.  Initially, neither Pollock nor the Diamondbacks felt the groin injury was as severe as one that kept him out for three weeks last season. When he was hurt, Pollock was hitting .299 with two homers and 11 RBIs. RHP Rubby de la Rosa was back in the Arizona dugout Friday night. His tenure with the team appeared to be over after Arizona didn't offer him a contract following last season. The team made that move after he was limited to 13 games, including 10 starts in 2016, going 4-5 with a 4.26 ERA and 54 strikeouts. But he received a stem cell injection in his elbow at the end of last season and subsequently was offered a minor league contract by the Diamondbacks. He responded by going 0-1 with a 2.35 ERA with 23 strikeouts and only four walks in 15 1-3 innings at Triple-A Reno, where his final eight appearances were scoreless. De La Rosa was called up Friday and came on in the seventh inning to strike out Aaron Altherr, the only hitter he faced.  It was great to see Rubby come in there -- after everything he's been through -- to come in and get a strikeout there and keep it at 1-0,  starting pitcher Patrick Corbin said.  It was nice to see.  1B Paul Goldschmidt continues to help his all-star candidacy. He leads the NL with 64 RBIs -- a category he last led in 2013, with 125 RBIs -- and also leads in on-base percentage. Over his last 16 games, he is hitting .433 (26-for-60) with six doubles, five homers and 21 RBIs. He's also reached base safely in a club-record 39 consecutive games at Chase Field. RHP J.J. Hoover allowed only one run in his last seven appearances, the latest of which was one-third of an inning Thursday at Colorado, but still was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday with right shoulder inflammation. He is 1-0 with a 4.18 ERA in 23 2-3 innings this season.  It's something that's been nagging and bothering him. He's been trying to grind through it, but we figured it was the best thing for him at this moment, to let him get ahead of things,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  It's going to be a little time down to rest the shoulder and get some strength back.  There is no immediate timetable for the former Reds pitcher's return. OF Jeremy Hazelbaker was optioned to Triple-A Reno after the Friday night's loss, despite his .318 batting average. The Diamondbacks said a corresponding move would be made Saturday.

RHP Johnny Cueto will be seeking just his second win in his last 10 starts when he pitches Saturday night against the New York Mets. He will be facing the Mets for the first time this season and 13th time in his career, having compiled a 4-4 record and 3.75 ERA against them. Cueto is 4-2 at home this season. 3B Eduardo Nunez (strained left hamstring) was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday, retroactive to Tuesday. He had missed six of the club's previous seven games with hamstring discomfort. An MRI revealed a mild strain. Nunez has at least one hit in 28 of his last 30 games. 2B/3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list before Friday's game against the New York Mets. He was deemed healthy after an eight-game, injury-rehab stint at Triple-A Sacramento in which he went 8-for-27 (.296). Gillaspie missed 39 games while on the DL. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts in his return to action Friday night.","keywords":"Conor Gillaspie,Eduardo Nunez,Johnny Cueto,Steven Okert,BBO,GIANTS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"San Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XQAT"}

RHP Amir Garrett was sent to Triple-A Louisville to make room for RHP Luis Castillo, who made his major league debut Friday. Garrett is 3-6 with a 7.41 ERA in 12 starts for the Reds this year.  The injury and line drive off his hand certainly didn't help his effectiveness,  manager Bryan Price said.  He has gotten out of sorts a bit. He will go down and work more on the side and gets things right.  RHP Tim Adleman visited nearby Georgetown, his alma mater, before Friday's game. He started Wednesday at Tampa Bay and is not slated to pitch this weekend in Washington. RHP Brandon Finnegan (left shoulder issues) could make a start for the Reds next week, manager Bryan Price said Friday. Finnegan pitched Wednesday for Triple-A Louisville and allowed four earned runs in five innings.  He came out of it feeling good. He is progressing as we hoped,  Price said. RHP Luis Castillo was called up from Double-A to start in his first MLB game Friday. He allowed five hits and two runs in five innings and was in line for the win before the Nationals tied the game in the seventh.  Expectations are tough. Throw it over (the plate) is a great start. He has a great fastball changeup mix. It is easy to see velocity,  said Bryan Price, the Reds manager. I'm happy with the way he threw the ball. He was a little defensive in some of those situations. Against this lineup he was a little too fine going over the plate with his fastball.  1B Joey Votto is no stranger to former Reds manager Dusty Baker. What makes him so good?  Number one he believes he can hit,  said Baker, the Washington skipper.  He is fearless.  Votto was 1-for-4 Friday and is hitting .305.

{"content":"RF Ian Happ, who made his major-league debut on May 13, had two of Chicago's six hits against the Marlins on Friday. He also has six hits in the first two games of the series. On Thursday, he had the first four-hit game of his career, going 4-for-5. The Cubs' first-round pick in 2015 -- taken ninth overall out of the University of Cincinnati -- Happ was moved up to third in the batting order on Friday. Last month, Happ became the first Cubs player in 34 years to homer in both his first road game and first home game. He was also the first Cubs player since at least 1913 to score at least one run in seven of his first eight career games. SS Addison Russell had a tough day against Miami on Friday, going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts. He had the last out in the inning twice with runners in scoring position. Still, Russell, 23, is a rising star in his third year in the majors. The Cubs have moved him to the cleanup spot in the batting order for a reason. Last year, he slugged 25 doubles, three triples and 21 homers, driving in 95 runs -- outstanding production from a young shortstop. RHP John Lackey (5-8) took a hard-luck loss against the Marlins on Friday. He allowed three hits, two walks and two runs (one earned) in six innings. Lackey has lost his past three decisions against the Marlins. LHP Jon Lester on Saturday will start against the Marlins, a team he has never beaten in four career starts, sporting a 4.91 ERA. He has beaten the 28 other major-league teams he has faced (he has never played against the Boston Red Sox). This will be Lester's 16th start of the season, and he has been much better at home (3-1, 2.68 ERA) than on the road (1-3, 5.85). In his most recent start, against the San Diego Padres, he allowed just two runs in six innings, getting a no-decision in an eventual Cubs win. It was his eighth quality start of the season.","keywords":"Addison Russell,Ian Happ,John Lackey,Jon Lester,BBO,CUBS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"Chicago Cubs - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XPAQ"}
{"content":"LF Jose Martinez continues to earn more playing time because he consistently gives the team quality at-bats. Martinez was 2-for-4 with a two-run homer in the second, facing a whopping 26 pitches in his plate appearances. He had an 11-pitch at-bat in the sixth, then a nine-pitch at-bat in the eighth that ended with a hit-and-run single to right. He's making it harder to keep him out of the lineup. RHP Lance Lynn will make the start Saturday night when St. Louis continues its weekend series with Pittsburgh in Busch Stadium. Lynn was roughed up in an 8-5 loss Sunday at Baltimore, surrendering seven runs off nine hits and two walks in 4 2/3 innings. Lynn is 6-5 with a 4.41 ERA in 20 career outings against the Pirates, including seven shutout innings in a win on April 17. C Yadier Molina (knee) sat out Friday night after reporting tightness from getting hit by a foul tip in Thursday's 5-1 defeat to the Phillies. Molina has caught 60 of the team's first 72 games, missing five this month because of minor injuries and a day-night doubleheader in which he sat the back end. Molina has a 10-game hitting streak in progress in which he's batted .293 with three homers. RHP Adam Wainwright tapped into homefield advantage Friday night for the good outing he had to have after a nine-run disaster in his previous start. Wainwright gave up only two hits and one earned run in seven innings, walking two and fanning five. He was in line for the win before the bullpen blew it, but Wainwright can take solace in the fact that he hit spots all night and induced a lot of weak contact. CF Dexter Fowler (quad strain) missed his second straight start Friday night, although he was available for late-game duty if needed. Fowler injured himself in the 10th inning of Wednesday night's 7-6 win in Philadelphia and didn't play on Thursday. Fowler, who's hitting .249 with 13 homers and 35 RBI, is optimistic that he'll be able to return to the lineup on Saturday night.","keywords":"Adam Wainwright,Dexter Fowler,Jose Martinez,Lance Lynn,Yadier Molina,BBO,CARDINALS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"St. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XPAP"}

He has some things to work on,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  But we'll continue to shuffle guys in and out (to Fresno) as we need to.  LHP Reymin Guduan was recalled from Triple-A Fresno and pitched two scoreless innings Friday, allowing one hit, one walk and striking out one. Guduan was up with the Astros from May 31-June 6, during which time he made his major league debut. In three games, he had an ERA of 9.00, allowing three runs in as many innings.  When we sent him out it was because he had thrown back-to-back days,  Houston manager A.J. Hinch said.  We wanted to get him back up here for this series and the Oakland series because he'll be a good matchup for some of their lefties.  2B Jose Altuve, who homered in the first inning Friday, has hit safely in seven of hits past eight games. He's batting .414 during that period, with three homers. CF George Springer was in the lineup Friday after being hit on the left hand by a pitch in the first inning a day earlier in Oakland.  George is good. I think it scared him a little,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  We breathed sigh of relief when it wasn't fractured. With George, if it's not broken or torn, then he'll be out there. He's as tough as they come.  Springer went 1-for-5 Friday and struck out twice. DH Carlos Beltran went 2-for-3 with two doubles Friday. It was the second time this season he's accomplished the feat, also doing it May 5 at the Los Angeles Angels. Beltran has 40 multi-double games in his career. RHP Charlie Morton, on the 10-day disabled list since May 28 with a lat strain, pitched two innings for Triple-A Fresno on Thursday.  It went very well,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  His velocity was in the low- to mid-90s and he felt really good coming out of it.  Hinch said Morton is scheduled to pitch again Tuesday for the Grizzlies, going three or four innings. RF Josh Reddick went 2-for-5 Friday with a double and has hit safely in 10 of his past 11 games.

LF Yoenis Cespedes belted a two-run homer in the Mets' 11-4 win over the San Francisco Giants on Friday night. The home run was his fifth in his last seven games against the Giants. He also had a double and a single as part of the Mets' season-high-tying, 20-hit attack. RHP Jacob deGrom will be seeking to complete eight innings or more for the third consecutive time when he pitches Saturday night against the San Francisco Giants. He became the first Met since RHP Bartolo Colon in 2015 to post back-to-back, eight-inning efforts when he limited the Washington Nationals to one run and three hits in his last start. DeGrom is 3-1 with a 3.62 ERA in five career starts against the Giants. 2B Gavin Cecchini was demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas before Friday's game against the San Francisco Giants. The move was made to create a roster spot for 2B Asdrubal Cabrera, who was returning from the disabled list. The demotion came four days after Cecchini hit his first career home run off Los Angeles Dodgers ace LHP Clayton Kershaw on Monday night. 2B Asdrubal Cabrera (sprained left thumb) told reporters before Friday's game in San Francisco that he planned to request a trade from the Mets. He was upset after seeing that he would be playing second base in his return from the disabled list, having lost the shortstop spot to SS Jose Reyes.

Difo came up through the minor league system as a middle infielder.  If you can play shortstop you can probably play center field,  said Dusty Baker, the Washington manager. Difo had trouble with a flyball early on and was replaced late in the game as the Nationals came back to win. RHP Joe Ross is slated to start Saturday against the Reds. In his third big league season he has struggled, going 3-3 with a 5.98 ERA in nine starts. Ross began the year at Triple-A Syracuse and his best game with the Nationals was when he fanned 12 Baltimore Orioles in early June at home. RHP Stephen Strasburg failed to go six innings for the third time in a row Friday. He gave up eight hits and five runs in five innings and did not figure in the decision. He was on track for the loss before the Nationals tied the game in the seventh. Strasburg said he had trouble dealing with the humidity - the game time temperature was 87. RF Bryce Harper came through again in the clutch Friday, with a walkoff single in the 10th for a 6-5 win over the Reds. It was the fifth walkoff win of the year for the Nationals and the 19th come from behind victory.  It was as lot of fun to watch and a lot of fun to be part of,  he said.  I had had some good pitches I had just missed in earlier at bats.  I was just trying to grind it out and get a pitch I could handle and get a hit. We battled from the first inning on.  It was tough facing a rookie we had not seen before. Our bullpen really did a great job tonight.  Anytime they come in and close the door for us like tonight that's huge.  LHP Sammy Solis (left elbow inflammation) has been on the DL since April 19 and has missed 58 games. But he may with Washington soon, giving the Nationals another lefty in the pen.  He is getting close, very closer,  said Dusty Baker, the Washington manager. OF Brian Goodwin hit two homers Friday - the first time he has hit more than one in a game. He hit a solo homer in the first and then another solo homer in the seventh to tie the game at 5. Perhaps the biggest hit was his third one, a single with two outs in the 10th that sent Trea Turner to third. Then Bryce Harper came through with the game-winner.  He is learning to hit. He wants to stay here,  said manager Dusty Baker. RHP A.J. Cole was sent to Triple-A Syracuse on Friday to make room for INF/OF Wilmer Difo, who made his first start in CF on Friday. Cole did not pitch in his second stint this year for the Nationals. He started one game in May for Washington. CF Michael A. Taylor did not start his second straight game Friday.

Today was really a great performance.  Mark Leiter and his son are only the 15th combination in major league history to both start for the same team; Mark Leiter pitched for the Phillies in 1997-98. They're also only the second father-son duo in team history, joining Ruben Amaro and Ruben Amaro Jr. 3B Maikel Franco enjoys playing at in Chase Field.

Of his 301 major league hits, 108 have gone for extra bases. RHP Pat Neshek is one of the major leagues' best relievers this season, even if he plays for the worst-record team -- and the seventh he's pitched for in the majors. Neshek struck out three of the four batters he faced in the seventh inning Friday at Arizona, lowering his ERA to 0.61-- the lowest in the big leagues. He has pitched 16 consecutive scoreless innings, the longest streak for a Phillies reliever since 2014. He also had a 12 2/3 innings scoreless streak to start the season. He's building on his success during the World Baseball Classic in March, when he pitched five scoreless innings in five games for the gold medal-winning United States. 2B-OF Howie Kendrick was scratched from the lineup about an hour before Friday night's game with left hamstring tightness.

{"content":"RHP Andrew Moore, who won his major league debut Thursday against Detroit, was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma on Friday when the Mariners activated RHP Felix Hernandez from the disabled list. Moore went seven innings against the Tigers, allowing three runs on six hits, with no walks and four strikeouts.  Obviously, Andrew Moore did a great job, but we want him to keep pitching,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said, noting that the club won't need a fifth starter with two days off next week. Will Moore return when that fifth spot comes up?  We'll see,  Servais said.  He's certainly earned the right.  1B Danny Valencia went 4-for-5 Friday against Houston, matching his career high for hits in game. It's the fourth time this season he's accomplished the feat, also doing it May 4 vs. the Los Angeles Angels, May 10 vs. Philadelphia and June 3 vs. Tampa Bay. SS Jean Segura, who returned from the disabled list earlier in the week after suffering a right high ankle sprain, was replaced with a pinch-runner after hitting a double in the seventh inning of a 13-3 victory Friday.  He's not 100 percent and we had a big lead,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Let's just get him out of there and get iced.  C Mike Zunino went 2-for-4 with a double and a three-run home run Friday. All 10 of his home runs this season have come in the past 27 games, since returning from a stint in Triple-A Tacoma. His 29 RBIs in June lead the majors.  When your 9-hole guy is hitting three-run home runs ... that's what it takes in the American League,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said. RHP Felix Hernandez, who had been out since April 26 with right shoulder inflammation, was activated from the 10-day disabled list to start Friday against Houston. Hernandez got the victory, pitching six innings against the Astros, allowing three runs on eight hits.  I was going crazy on the DL, but I knew I'd be back,  Hernandez said.  I was just trying to have a good game. We scored a lot of runs, which was good for me.   Hernandez earned his 157th career victory, passing Freddy Garcia for the most by a Venezuelan-born pitcher.  It's an honor to pass him,  Hernandez said.  He's a real good friend.  RHP Yovani Gallardo made his first relief appearance since his rookie season of 2007 with Milwaukee. Gallardo started 278 straight games between bullpen assignments. He got his first career save with three scoreless innings of two-hit ball Friday in a 13-3 victory against Houston.  It definitely felt different, but it was good to get back out there,  said Gallardo, who hadn't pitched since last Saturday at Texas.  We had a big lead so I just tried to go out there and throw strikes.   Gallardo was 3-7 with a 6.30 ERA before getting sent to the bullpen this week.  I know things haven't gone as expected this year,  he said.  I've just got to go out and throw well when called on.  LF Ben Gamel extended his hitting streak to 15 games, going 2-for-5 with a home run. Gamel has hit safely in 25 of his past 26 games, batting .419 in that stretch.","keywords":"Andrew Moore,Ben Gamel,Danny Valencia,Felix Hernandez,Freddy Garcia,Jean Segura,Mike Zunino,Scott Servais,Yovani Gallardo,BBO,MARINERS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-24 13:01:00","news_title":"Seattle Mariners - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XPAF"}

In his five innings, Mejia allowed two hits, both singles, and struck out four. But he walked a career-high five.  There were some stressful innings, but he got through them somehow,  Brewers manager Paul Molitor said.  He had a lot of 3-2 counts, but he got big outs and five zeroes.  RHP Trevor Hildenberger, called up from Triple-A Rochester before the game, made his major league debut in the ninth inning on Friday. Hildenberger pitched a scoreless inning and gave up one hit. He retired three of the four batters he faced.  I was extremely nervous,  Hildenberger said.  More in the bullpen than on the mound.

The 18-times grand-slam champion, who captured the Australian Open, Indian Wells and Miami titles this year, skipped the entire claycourt season to improve his chances of winning a record eighth title at the All England Club. He will now face 20-year-old Zverev in a rematch of last year's semi-final, which the German won. Zverev booked his second successive final spot when he beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 4-6 6-4 6-3. Gasquet, a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist, grabbed the first set against Zverev with a break at 5-4.  But he quickly fell behind in the second as Zverev, a finalist last year, who has already won three titles in 2017, charged to a 4-2 lead and held on to take the set. The world number 12 booked his final spot after breaking at 3-3 and finishing the Frenchman off with another break to set up the showdown with Federer. Despite a shock exit from Stuttgart on his comeback last week, Federer has improved in Halle and has not lost a set.   I thought it was extremely close, especially that second set,  Federer, who has never won a tournament nine times, told reporters.  I'm still just very happy how I was able to close it out in the (tie-)breaker,  said the 35-year-old.

{"content":"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - The union representing workers at Volkswagen's Slovak factories said on Saturday it was close to agreeing a wage deal with management to end a five-day strike that has hit production at the country's biggest private employer. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees in Slovakia joined the protest, the union said. It began on Tuesday and is the first ever strike at the carmaker's plants in the country. After two rounds of failed talks earlier this week, union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said a compromise between his demand of 13.9 percent wage hike over two years and the company's offer of 9 percent could be reached at the next meeting. The union is also asking for longer lunch breaks.     We are close to a deal... We hope to return to the table as soon as possible,  Smolinsky said. In the event of a deal, production lines that normally make about 1,000 cars a day - almost all of which are exported - could resume on Monday, he added. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016, including the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques. The company pays its Slovak workers an average of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average but less than half of the 4,200 euros earned by equivalent employees in Germany, according to the union. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has supported the strike, saying Volkswagen should pay its Slovak workers the same pay as its western European ones.

{"content":"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - The union representing workers at Volkswagen's Slovak factories said on Saturday it was close to agreeing a wage deal with management to end a five-day strike that has hit production at the country's biggest private employer. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees in Slovakia joined the protest, the union said. It began on Tuesday and is the first ever strike at the carmaker's plants in the country. After two rounds of failed talks earlier this week, union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said a compromise between his demand of 13.9 percent wage hike over two years and the company's offer of 9 percent could be reached at the next meeting. The union is also asking for longer lunch breaks.     We are close to a deal... We hope to return to the table as soon as possible,  Smolinsky said. In the event of a deal, production lines that normally make about 1,000 cars a day - almost all of which are exported - could resume on Monday, he added. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016, including the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques. The company pays its Slovak workers an average of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average but less than half of the 4,200 euros earned by equivalent employees in Germany, according to the union. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has supported the strike, saying Volkswagen should pay its Slovak workers the same pay as its western European ones. The Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of strike would cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, produces more than 1 million vehicles a year, making it the biggest per-capita auto producer in the world. Kia Motors Corp and Peugeot also have plants in Slovakia and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] is due to open one next year.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made calls to fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Friday to mobilize support for their party's healthcare overhaul while acknowledging the legislation is on a  very, very narrow path  to passage. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill.  We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.   This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,  Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. Related CoverageFactbox: Where Republican U.S. senators stand on healthcare billThat could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks as he hosts a Congressional picnic event, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2017.Carlos BarriaRepublicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Four Conservatives Oppose Bill On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Slideshow (3 Images)Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.   It's not that they're opposed,  he said.  They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that.  Trump said getting approval would require traveling a  very, very narrow path  but that  I think we're going to get there.   It's going to be a good bill,  Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday.   For the House of Representatives' version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders.  Trump later criticized the House bill privately as  mean  and this week called for a health plan  with heart.  He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.

{"content":"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul's governor has banned a gay and transgender pride march which was due to take place in the city on Sunday, citing security concerns after threats from an ultra-nationalist group. It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. March organizers said the ban was effectively legitimizing what they called the hate crimes of groups like Alperen Hearths, and urged the governor to reverse the decision. The governor's emphasis on public order and safety was an effort to distort the image of a planned peaceful march, they said in an online statement headlined:  We are Marching, Get Used to It. We are Here, Not Going Away . The gay pride parade in Istanbul -- a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq -- has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organizers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan.   While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.

{"content":"* Audit followed scandal over $2 bln in secret loans * Findings shows gaps on how money was spent * IMF says to visit Mozambique in July (Adds more details, comments) By Manuel Mucari MAPUTO, June 24 (Reuters) - Mozambique's government has not done enough to explain how $2 billion in loans was spent and roughly a quarter of the money remains unaccounted for, an independent audit of the debt showed on Saturday. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded an external forensic audit of the debt last year following revelations about the previously hidden loans granted to three state-owned companies in 2013 and 2014. Discovery of the unapproved credits to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM) led the IMF and Western donors to halt budget support to Mozambique, triggering the collapse of the local currency and debt defaults as well as hitting economic growth. In a 57-page summary of the audit, risk management firm Kroll Inc said officials in the southern African country had given inconsistent answers about how $500 million earmarked for the tuna fishing company had been spent.  Gaps remain in understanding how exactly the USD 2 billion was spent, despite considerable efforts to close this gap,  the audit summary said.  Until the inconsistencies are resolved, and satisfactory documentation is provided, at least USD 500 million of expenditure of a potentially sensitive nature remains unaudited and unexplained.  Explanations on how the $500 million was spent included that the money was integrated into the national budget and that it was used to purchase military equipment, Kroll said. The Mozambique attorney general's office acknowledged the findings of the audit and said it would work with the international community to resolve the issues raised. The audit showed Credit Suisse and Russia's VTB Capital -- lead arrangers for the loans -- were paid a total of $199.7 million in fees. Kroll also found there was no evidence provided that any assessment took place before the signing of three government guarantees with a combined value of $1 billion and potential conflict of interest issues were identified. The state-owned companies also lack some basic infrastructure necessary for their operations, the audit showed.  Proindicus does not have an operational satellite package, EMATUM does not currently have permits for the fishing vessels, and MAM has only recently obtained access to a shipyard in Maputo that is undergoing an upgrade to enable the maintenance of vessels,  the audit said. The IMF said it would visit Mozambique from July 10-19 to discuss concerns raised by the debt audit.  The publication of these documents constitutes an important step towards greater transparency regarding the loans,  the Fund said in a statement.  However, information gaps remain, in particular on the use of the loan proceeds. An IMF staff mission will visit Mozambique ... to discuss the results of the audit with the authorities and possible follow-up actions.

{"content":"DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior United Arab Emirates official said on Saturday that if Qatar did not accept an ultimatum issued by fellow Arab states which imposed a boycott this month on the tiny Gulf Arab nation, there would be a  parting of ways . The 13-point list of demands from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE include closing the Al Jazeera satellite television network, curbing relations with Iran, shutting a Turkish base in Doha and paying reparations. The demands are apparently aimed at dismantling Qatar's two-decade-old interventionist foreign policy, which has reflected the clout generated by its vast natural gas and oil wealth but incensed conservative Arab peers over its alleged support for Islamists they regard as mortal threats to their dynastic rule. Doha said it is reviewing the list of demands and that a formal response will be made by the foreign ministry and delivered to Kuwait, but added that the demands are not reasonable or actionable.   The alternative is not escalation, the alternative is parting of ways, because it is very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told reporters.  He said diplomacy with Qatar remained a priority, but added that mediation efforts to resolve the dispute had been undermined by the public disclosure of the demands.  The mediators' ability to shuttle between the parties and try and reach a common ground has been compromised by this leak,  he said.  Their success is very dependent on their ability to move but not in the public space.  Gargash said that if Qatar fails to comply within the 10-day timeline set out in the ultimatum, it will be isolated. But he did not make clear what more could be done since the four Arab nations have already cut diplomatic relations with Doha and severed most commercial ties. The most powerful Middle Eastern country to stand with Qatar in the dispute has been Turkey, which has rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Doha as a sign of support. Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived in Doha since the worst crisis among Gulf Arab states for years erupted on June 5.  Gargash said the Turkish deployment was a  meaningless escalation  and he hoped Ankara would act in a  reasonable way .  We hope that Turkey prioritizes the interest of the Turkish state and not partisan ideology,  Gargash said.  Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party, and Qatar have been the main backers of the Muslim Brotherhood movement that challenges Arab rulers.  Kuwait is helping mediate the dispute as is the United States, for which it has posed a challenging test since Qatar hosts a base housing the headquarters of U.S. air power in the Middle East as well as 11,000 troops. The Sunni Muslim Arab group that imposed the sanctions on Qatar accuse it of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their Shi'ite Muslim enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian rulers. The uncompromising positions adopted by both sides leave little prospect for a quick end to the crisis. The sanctions have disrupted Qatar's main import routes by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But Qatar so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative channels and says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges.

I am happy that I am able to show good tennis here. I played four matches already, so it's a good record and good preparation for the final.  Tennis - WTA Premier - Aegon Classic - Edgbaston Priory Club, Birmingham, Britain - June 24, 2017      Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova after Czech Republic's Lucie Safarova (L) withdraws from the semi final due to injury   Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra The hand is good, which... I am not feeling any pain, and that's the best news.  Safarova was the latest player to withdraw in the latter stages of the WTA event. On Friday, American Coco Vandeweghe retired with an ankle injury in her quarter-final against Muguruza. Slideshow (3 Images)In another last-eight game Barty also had a walkover, with Italian Camila Giorgi retiring with a leg injury in the first set.  The Australian, ranked 77th in the world, then made the most of the opportunity as she beat the 2016 French Open champion and 2015 Wimbledon finalist Muguruza to earn a chance to win a second WTA title. The match turned when Barty broke at 2-2 in the second set after the Spaniard had looked comfortable.  I didn't really get a look in on her serve in the first set and once I knew I was in with a shot it was a little bit of a different story,  said Barty. Muguruza saved two match points in the final set as she battled hard but after recovering from her first set reverse, the Australian, who has also played national level cricket in her homeland, looked in command by making great use of the slice.  For me it is important to use my slice on the grass and I love coming out here, slicing away and getting a bit of purchase on the ball and I was able to do that and it was really pleasing  she said.

{"content":"AIN ISSA, Syria (Reuters) - A civil council expected to rule Raqqa once Islamic State is dislodged from the Syrian city pardoned 83 of the jihadist group's low-ranking militants on Saturday, a goodwill gesture designed to promote stability. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have gained significant ground in the battle for Raqqa, the operational base for Islamic State over the past three years and a symbol of its self-proclaimed caliphate. Senior SDF figures predict Raqqa could fall within months. That would be a severe blow to Islamic State, which has plotted shooting and bomb attacks around the world from Raqqa, a city of about 300,000 before the militants seized it.  The 83 Islamic State prisoners were transported to the headquarters of the Raqqa City Council in the village of Ain Issa, north of Raqqa, in an amnesty coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  One by one, they stepped down from buses, the youngest 14 years old.   Related CoverageSyrian government says frees 672 prisonersLeila Mustafa, co-leader of the council, read out a speech as the militants, released because they had no blood on their hands and held no senior posts, stood silently in neat lines.  Sweets were handed out on trays in the sweltering heat, in what officials hoped would be the start of a new chapter in the men's lives. Speakers forecast a brighter future for Syria, which has been locked in a multi-sided civil war for six years involving regional powers and a U.S.-led coalition whose air strikes put Islamic State on the defensive. An Islamic State prisoner, who was pardoned by a council that is expected to govern Raqqa once the group is dislodged from the Syrian city, gestures in Ain Issa village, north of Raqqa, Syria June 24, 2017.Goran Tomasevic We would never release senior Daesh officials or anyone who has blood on their hands,  senior council member Omar Aloush told Reuters, using a derogatory term for Islamic State.  We are giving these men a second chance.  On the street outside the council, he told the Islamic State members, some of whom had surrendered, that they would be integrated into society and given a chance to attend schools. Speeches were followed by applause from all sides. The men walked past council members and shook their hands, before tasting freedom and reuniting with their families. Slideshow (9 Images)Several young Islamic State members, like 17-year-old Kays al-Hadi, provided a simple explanation on why they joined IS.  There were no opportunities before they arrived,  he said. The amnesty may be one small step towards easing tensions that run deep in Raqqa after three years of ruthless Islamic State occupation, followed by war.  Council officials acknowledge they face huge challenges in rebuilding a city with a traumatized population and devastated infrastructure. Abdel Rahman Kalas, 43, worked in the Islamic State department that imposed taxes on Raqqa citizens.  I have seven children,  he said, as former militants walked away after the ceremony to face the uncertainty that hangs over Raqqa.  I had no choice but to cooperate. They paid me $115 a month.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria's government said on Saturday it released 672 prisoners who had promised to accept the state's authority, a move it said was aimed at bolstering a  reconciliation  process.  Reconciliation is the term the government uses for local deals with rebels for them to either disarm and accept its rule or to leave with small arms for other insurgent areas.   They have been released after promising not to do anything against the nation's security or stability,  Justice Minister Hisham al-Shaar was quoted as saying by the official SANA news agency.   He said most of the prisoners were from Damascus but there were others from across Syria, indicating the release was not linked to a particular deal regarding one rebel-held area.  SANA did not report what the freed detainees had been put in prison for, but some of those released told Reuters they were arrested for actions they took against the government.  Syria's opposition says reconciliation deals are forced on areas after prolonged sieges and intense bombardment. The United Nations has warned they may be used to force people from their homes.  President Bashar al-Assad has said he sees them as a way to reduce fighting in Syria and bring to an end the six-year conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made millions homeless.  The opposition, Western countries and rights groups say the government has detained tens of thousands of Syrians without trial for political reasons, torturing and killing thousands of them. Assad and his government deny that.

{"content":"BAKU (Reuters) - McLaren drivers Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne's grid penalties at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday have been extended to 40 and 30 respectively, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said. The FIA stewards said in a statement that twice Formula One world champion Alonso had another 25-place grid penalty added to his previous sanction of 15 grid places after changing his car's Honda engine for a seventh time this season. Drivers are permitted to use a maximum of four engines per season. In a separate statement, the FIA said Alonso's team mate Vandoorne has had his grid penalty extended to 30 places after the same offense. Vandoorne's use of a seventh Turbo Charger (TC) and seventh Motor Generator Unit Heat during the third practice session means he drops 15 grid positions, added to the 15-place penalty he incurred earlier in the week. The sanctions ensure that McLaren will occupy the back row in Sunday's race, regardless of their performance in qualification on Saturday. The punishments are yet another embarrassing episode for the team as they seek to improve their efficiency, reliability and track performance. Neither Alonso nor Vandoorne have taken any points during the opening seven races of the 2017 season.  We'll have to start at the back of the grid anyway, so we'll take things smoothly in qualifying,  Alonso told McLaren's official website (www.mclaren.com) after Friday's session.

{"content":"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul's governor has banned a gay and transgender pride march which was due to take place in the city on Sunday, citing security concerns after threats from an ultra-nationalist group. It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. March organizers said the ban was effectively legitimizing what they called the hate crimes of groups like Alperen Hearths, and urged the governor to reverse the decision. The governor's emphasis on public order and safety was an effort to distort the image of a planned peaceful march, they said in an online statement headlined:  We are Marching, Get Used to It. We are Here, Not Going Away . The gay pride parade in Istanbul -- a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq -- has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organizers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan.   While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.

{"content":"(Adds Setubal comments on Brazil political situation) By Guillermo Parra-Bernal SAO PAULO, June 24 (Reuters) - Brazilian lawmakers need to urgently pass a revamping of the country's outdated labor code in order to mitigate extra costs for companies and consumers, the co-chairman of Brazil's largest bank said on Saturday. The excessive rigidity of Brazil's labor legislation is creating an enormous burden for citizens, who end up paying more for the goods and services they buy, said Roberto Setubal, the co-chairman of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA. Speaking at an event sponsored by XP Investimentos SA, Setubal said political turmoil is unlikely to ease in coming months, posing challenges to President Michel Temer's ambitious economic reform agenda. Successful policymaking has so far help mitigate those risks, he said.  People need to understand that reforming an outdated labor code is good for business but, ultimately, for consumers, who are overburdened by market inefficiencies,  Setubal said at the event. His remarks underscore how political problems are delaying efforts by Brazilian business leaders to regain competitiveness in the face of a bloated state structure and rigid industry rules. Temer wants to pass a pension and tax code reforms, aside from the labor plan. Xp Investimentos Setubal said the price that Itaú Unibanco paid for a minority stake in Brazilian independent securities firm XP Investimentos SA embeds  very high growth rates  ahead. Itaú paid 5.7 billion reais ($1.76 billion) for the 49.9 percent stake in May to grow in the retail brokerage and money management segments. Setubal said that keeping XP as an independent financial firm is good to help deepen capital markets activity in the long run.

{"content":"MUMBAI, June 24 (Reuters) - India's Maharashtra state, home to the country's financial capital Mumbai, will waive $5.27 billion of farm loans, the latest state to offer relief to farmers reeling from losses caused by bad weather. The state, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has decided to write off debts up to 150,000 rupees ($2,326) for 8.9 million farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Saturday. The state will settle farmers' loans with banks, making 90 percent of farmers eligible for fresh borrowing, Fadnavis said. Earlier this month, the state had announced that it would write off loans of all farmers after striking farmers cut milk and vegetable supplies to cities like Mumbai. Modi, who had promised to double farmers' incomes over five years, remains a popular leader three years into his term. But unrest has flared in states ruled by his party, catching regional leaders flat-footed. In the central state of Madhya Pradesh five farmers were shot dead during protests earlier this month. India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh in April decided to waive $5.6 billion of farm loans, while northern state of Punjab earlier this week decided to write off $1.5 billion of loans to farmers. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. Economists at Merrill Lynch estimate that states will end up writing off debts equivalent to 2 percent of GDP - the bulk of all outstanding loans to farmers.

{"content":"(Reuters) - British driver Jolyon Palmer will miss Saturday's Formula One qualifying for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after his car caught fire in practice, Renault Chief Technical Officer Bob Bell said. Palmer completed just four laps and finished at the bottom of the standings in Saturday's final practice session.   Unfortunately the fire in his car pretty much rules him out in qualifying,  Bell told Sky Sports.  We'd never get it out in time, so yes, he'll miss qualifying.  It looks at this stage as though it was a high-pressure fuel leak probably from the pump on the engine and when that catches fire it's quite a big thing.   It could have been (a lot worse) but fortunately it wasn't.  Saturday's setback continued a bad run for Palmer, who crashed during Friday's practice session.  There's no time frame on (Palmer's future with Renault),  added Bell.  We want Jolyon to succeed.  If you look back at last year, he was under pressure at the start of the season with (former Renault driver) Kevin (Magnussen) and by the end of the season he was regularly in front.  We just need to see a level of progression by the end of the season.  Palmer, who finished 18th with one point during the 2016 season, has yet to score this campaign.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Six emails sent by and to an Arconic Inc (ARNC.N) sales manager raise questions about why the company supplied combustible cladding to a distributor for use at Grenfell Tower, despite publicly warning such panels were a fire risk for tall buildings.    The emails, dating from 2014 and seen by Reuters, were between Deborah French, Arconic's UK sales manager, and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for the refurbishment contract at Grenfell Tower in London, where 79 people died in a blaze last week.     When asked about the emails, Arconic said in a statement that it had known the panels would be used at Grenfell Tower but that it was not its role to decide what was or was not compliant with local building regulations.      The company manufactures three main types of Reynobond panel-- one with a polyethylene (PE) core, one with a fire retardant core and another with a non-combustible core, according to its website.     Diagrams in a 2016 Arconic brochure for its Reynobond panels describe how PE core panels are suitable up to 10 meters in height. Panels with a fire resistant core -- the FR model -- can be used up to 30 meters, while above that height, panels with the non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used, the brochure says.     Grenfell Tower is more than 60 meters tall.     The brochure also issued a blunt warning that cladding can be a fire risk.       When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly,  the brochure said.        As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material.    Nonetheless, between May and July 2014, French, who was based at Arconic's factory in Merxheim, France, responded to requests from the companies involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower on the availability of samples of five different types of Reynobond aluminum-covered panels, all of which were only available in the combustible PE and FR versions, according to Arconic brochures.     In the end, Arconic said on Friday, the company provided PE panels.    While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts,  the company said in an emailed statement in response to the Reuters enquiry.  The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire are devastating, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragedy ... We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,  the statement said.       French did not respond to requests for comment.     Arconic, which was known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, declined to say if it knew how tall the tower was and the emails seen by Reuters do not specifically refer to its height. They do, however, refer to  Grenfell Tower  and mention other high rise projects where paneling has been used when discussing the appearance that was being sought for Grenfell Tower.      Arconic also knew the quantity of panels being supplied and thus the total exterior coverage. A source at one of the companies involved in the process said Arconic had  full involvement  throughout the contract bidding process. Omnis Exteriors, which cut the Arconic tiles to shape and supplied them to the cladding contractor, said it was not responsible for the choice of panel.  CEP played no part in the selection of Reynobond PE and simply fulfilled the order as directed by the design and build team,  the company said in a statement on Saturday, referring to CEP Architectural Facades Ltd, the Omnis unit which fulfilled the contract. Harley Facades Ltd., the company which installed the panels, Rydon Group, the overall contractor on the 2014-2016 Grenfell refurbishment, and the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns the tower block all declined to comment.     Rydon previously said in a statement that its work on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was intended to give the building better heat and sound insulation, complied with all building regulations. Harley said last week it was  not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower .     In the emails, French and representatives of Harley and Rydon also discuss the choice of panel models and colors and how they were inching towards securing the contract with the local authority.      Harris did not respond to requests for comment.     On Sunday, British finance minister Philip Hammond said the type of panels used, which are cheaper than non-combustible panels, were banned for use in high rise buildings in Britain, as they are in Europe and the United States. Omnis said combustible Reynobond PE material was safe to use on high rise buildings if the insulation material usually put behind the panels was made of incombustible material such as mineral fiber. Some safety experts say the regulations are not black and white. The UK uses a 'principles-based' approach to regulation which puts an onus on companies to operate safely, based on common understanding of risks and the technology available. This differs to the highly specific 'rules-based' approach to regulation taken in the United States.  Supporters of the principles-based approach say it avoids the emergence of loopholes and means companies have to take account of new information on risks immediately, rather than wait for a new regulation to be drafted. The fatal fire was started by a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer in one of the apartments, London police said on Friday. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said insulation on the building, and the cladding panels, had failed safety tests carried out after the disaster.     The police investigation was considering the possibility of manslaughter and criminal offences in respect of the fire.

{"content":"(Repeats with no changes) By Jeffrey Dastin June 23 (Reuters) - If Amazon.com Inc hopes to revolutionize grocery delivery, then its bid to buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion will be just the start of a long and costly process. The e-commerce giant would need to add a large network of specialized grocery distribution warehouses, former AmazonFresh employees and logistics experts said. This is something Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other competitors have already done. Whole Foods, with a relatively small distribution footprint of its own, does little to change the picture for Amazon, they said. Amazon has a little more than 3 million square feet of U.S. warehousing dedicated to its existing AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry grocery programs - a tenth of the warehouse space Wal-Mart has for specialized food distribution, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.  AmazonFresh really was for lack of a better word an after-thought,  said Brittain Ladd, who until March was a senior manager for the grocery delivery program, which launched in 2007. One key to Amazon's success in general retail sales has been its speed in delivering products to consumers, facilitated by warehouses located strategically throughout the United States. As of 2016, the company had about 100 million square feet of space in its fulfillment and data centers, some of it outfitted with state-of-the-art robotics to boost efficiency. Facilities for distributing fresh food are far more complicated than ordinary warehouses. A single facility can need a half dozen or more temperature settings to house products from Popsicles to berries. Some require certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and extra care must be taken to keep shelves clean and prevent pests from contaminating food. Whole Foods has over 1 million square feet of warehouse space for distribution to its markets, and a chunk of its inventory goes straight from suppliers to stores, MWPVL said.  It's a peanut. It's nothing,  MWPVL President Marc Wulfraat said of Whole Foods' distribution.  If Amazon wants to become a dominant grocery company in a short period of time, then there would be an investment required, and it would be big.  Amazon, which did not return requests for comment, has not detailed its plans for Whole Foods. 12 or More Grocery Warehouses Needed Amazon's fulfillment expenses jumped 31 percent in 2016 - a bit faster than in prior years and faster than its retail sales growth - to $17.6 billion, according to its annual regulatory filing. Industry experts estimate the company would have to add a dozen or more grocery warehouses, particularly if it wanted to supply Whole Food stores in addition to homes. The cost to do that is unclear. They said Amazon would likely continue to rely on United Natural Foods Inc to supply Whole Foods with hard-to-source products, but would probably aim to cut costs and handle more of the distribution for conventional items. Even using Whole Foods stores to provide food for delivering to nearby urban shoppers would have hard limits, since many outlets lack the floor space to handle thousands of online orders.  It’s a space issue for stuff coming through. It’s a labor issue for people tripping over each other,  said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. There would also be a risk that  the quality starts to go down because the e-commerce orders are getting better product.

{"content":"(Refiles to amend editing credit; no changes to story text) By Tom Bergin LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Six emails sent by and to an Arconic Inc sales manager raise questions about why the company supplied combustible cladding to a distributor for use at Grenfell Tower, despite publicly warning such panels were a fire risk for tall buildings. The emails, dating from 2014 and seen by Reuters, were between Deborah French, Arconic's UK sales manager, and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for the refurbishment contract at Grenfell Tower in London, where 79 people died in a blaze last week. When asked about the emails, Arconic said in a statement that it had known the panels would be used at Grenfell Tower but that it was not its role to decide what was or was not compliant with local building regulations. The company manufactures three main types of Reynobond panel -- one with a polyethylene (PE) core, one with a fire retardant core and another with a non-combustible core, according to its website. Diagrams in a 2016 Arconic brochure for its Reynobond panels describe how PE core panels are suitable up to 10 metres in height. Panels with a fire resistant core -- the FR model -- can be used up to 30 metres, while above that height, panels with the non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used, the brochure says. Grenfell Tower is more than 60 metres tall. The brochure also issued a blunt warning that cladding can be a fire risk.  When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly,  the brochure said.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material.  Nonetheless, between May and July 2014, French, who was based at Arconic's factory in Merxheim, France, responded to requests from the companies involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower on the availability of samples of five different types of Reynobond aluminium-covered panels, all of which were only available in the combustible PE and FR versions, according to Arconic brochures. In the end, Arconic said on Friday, the company provided PE panels.  While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts,  the company said in an emailed statement in response to the Reuters enquiry.  The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire are devastating, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragedy ... We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,  the statement said. French did not respond to requests for comment. Arconic, which was known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, declined to say if it knew how tall the tower was and the emails seen by Reuters do not specifically refer to its height. They do, however, refer to  Grenfell Tower  and mention other high rise projects where panelling has been used when discussing the appearance that was being sought for Grenfell Tower. Arconic also knew the quantity of panels being supplied and thus the total exterior coverage. A source at one of the companies involved in the process said Arconic had  full involvement  throughout the contract bidding process. Omnis Exteriors, Arconic's UK distributor, Harley Facades Ltd., the company which installed the panels, Rydon Group, the overall contractor on the 2014-2016 Grenfell refurbishment, and the local authority which owns the tower block all declined to comment. Rydon and Omnis have previously said in statements that their work on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was intended to give the building better heat and sound insulation, complied with all building regulations. Harley said last week it was  not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower . In the emails, French and representatives of Harley, Omnis and Rydon also discuss the choice of panel models and colours and how they were inching towards securing the contract with the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC). Harris did not respond to requests for comment. RBKC declined to comment. At the weekend, British finance minister Philip Hammond said the type of panels used, which are cheaper than non-combustible panels, were banned for use in high rise buildings in Britain, as they are in Europe and the United States. Safety experts say the regulations are not black and white as they consider the overall safety of a project, taking account of how the safety measures taken interact. This 'principles-based' approach is different to the highly specific 'rules-based' approach to regulation taken in the United States. The fatal fire was started by a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer in one of the apartments, London police said on Friday. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said insulation on the building, and the cladding panels, had failed safety tests carried out after the disaster. The police investigation was considering the possibility of manslaughter and criminal offences in respect of the fire.

{"content":"ISTANBUL, June 24 (Reuters) - Istanbul's governor has banned a gay and transgender pride march which was due to take place in the city on Sunday, citing security concerns after threats from an ultra-nationalist group. It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. The organisers of the march said they would discuss their response later on Saturday. The gay pride parade in Istanbul - a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq - has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organisers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan. While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread. Critics say President Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party have shown little interest in expanding rights for minorities, gays and women, and are intolerant of dissent.

We have a strong obligation to succeed. The French people no longer want intentions, they want results,  Ferrand said in a statement. Some 306 deputies voted for Ferrand and two abstained. Macron's year-old Republic on the Move party (LREM) won a huge parliamentary majority on June 18 that boasts scores of lawmakers never before elected - unprecedented in France and central to his promise to clean up the country's politics.

Ferrand, who headed the campaign that swept Emmanuel Macron to power in a vote last May 7, left the government in a Cabinet  reshuffle this week.

{"content":"Xander Bogaerts has taken on a starring role in the middle of the lineup following the retirement of David Ortiz, and he finds himself in the midst of a stretch that would make even  Big Papi  proud. After driving in his 34th run of the season on the same night the Boston retired Ortiz's No. 34 jersey, the 2016 All-Star eyes his fifth multi-hit game in six outings Saturday when the Red Sox continue a three-game home series versus the Los Angeles Angels. Bogaerts went 2-for-4 with an early run-scoring double in Friday's 9-4 victory over Los Angeles and is batting .500 with three home runs and eight RBIs during a five-game hitting streak. Sandy Leon and Hanley Ramirez, a good friend of Ortiz's and a fellow Dominican, each clubbed two-run homers as Boston won for the fifth time in its last six contests at Fenway Park. The Angels (38-39), who have been around or at .500 for all of June, fell to 2-2 on their eight-game road trip despite posting 10 hits for the 10th time in their last 15 contests. Even with Friday's setback, Los Angeles is 22-12 against the Red Sox overall since 2012 and 10-7 in its last 17 games in Boston, although the Angels have dropped five of their last six in Fenway Park.

The 28-year-old Nicaraguan has failed to pitch more than five frames in three outings during that stretch after logging at least six innings in each of his five May turns (2-1, 2.67). Ramirez will make his first start against the Red Sox, who have managed only three hits against him in four scoreless relief outings. Price was unable to correct his recent control issues despite picking up the win in Houston on Sunday when he yielded three runs on eight hits (two homers) and three walks while also throwing two wild pitches and hitting a batter in five frames. The five-time All-Star is averaging a career-high 4.5 walks per nine innings, nearly twice as high as his career average (2.3). Albert Pujols is 4-for-22 with two solo homers against Price, who is 5-5 with a 3.26 ERA in 13 starts versus the Angels. Walk-Offs 1. The Red Sox have amassed at least 10 hits in each of their last six home contests. 2. Pujols went 1-for-4 on Friday and is batting .315 in 19 career games at Fenway Park. 3.

{"content":"The Chicago Cubs were remarkably consistent during their dominant run to the World Series title a year ago considering their youth, but this season’s roller-coaster ride has been more typical of a team reliant on young talent. After offensive performances on both ends of the spectrum in the first two games of the series, the Cubs visit the Miami Marlins for the third of a four-game set Saturday afternoon. The Cubs’ 2-0 loss Friday night marked the sixth time they’ve been shut out this season, matching their total all of last season - one night after racking up 16 hits in an 11-1 rout. Chicago’s lineup is far from full-strength at the moment with starters Ben Zobrist and Jason Heyward on the disabled list and slumping slugger Kyle Schwarber at Triple-A Iowa. The Marlins have won five straight home series and are 3-2 on their current homestand, but they’ve totaled just eight runs in the past four contests. Miami’s three hits in Friday’s win marked its second-lowest hit total in a win this season and the lowest was a two-hit performance in a 2-1 win over Washington on Wednesday.

The 33-year-old has struggled to a 1-3 record and a 5.85 ERA in six road starts, but he struck out 10 and allowed just one run over seven frames in his last outing away from home. Lester is 0-2 with a 4.91 ERA in four starts against the Marlins. Nicolino came off the disabled list Monday to make his first start in nearly three weeks. The 25-year-old was not sharp against Washington, allowing six runs (three earned) in three innings, including a pair of home runs. Nicolino is just 2-6 with a 4.41 ERA in 17 games (15 starts) at Marlins Park. Walk-Offs 1.

Logan Morrison belted his team-leading 22nd homer and knocked in three runs while Evan Longoria along with newly-recalled Shane Peterson had four RBIs apiece in Tampa Bay’s 15-5 rout Friday. The Rays have posted 44 runs in their last six games and are expected to add slugging catcher Wilson Ramos to the lineup as early as Saturday after he recovered from knee surgery, and reliever Brad Boxberger (back) could also be activated this weekend. Jacob Faria will go for his fourth straight victory to open his major-league career for Tampa Bay and he will oppose fellow right-hander Dylan Bundy, who has been Baltimore’s best starter despite pitching in some bad luck. Adam Jones returned after being rested Thursday to register three hits Friday for the Orioles and is 10-for-23 during a six-game hitting streak while teammate Manny Machado went 0-for-5 in the series opener after recording nine RBIs in his previous seven contests.

The 24-year-old Tulsa native has given up at least one homer in nine straight starts and 11 in that stretch after surrendering two in his first six outings. Tim Beckham is 2-for-3 with two homers versus Bundy, who allowed two runs over 6 1/3 innings of a no-decision against the Rays on April 26. Faria is the fifth player in recorded major-league history to win his first three starts while permitting one run or fewer and completing at least six innings in each outing. The 23-year-old Californian yielded one first-inning run on six hits total over a career-high seven innings at Detroit on Sunday. Faria, who was 6-1 in 11 starts before being recalled, has increased his pitch total from 95 to 102 to 110 in his starts with the Rays and is holding opponents to a .208 batting average. Walk-Offs 1.

Minnesota posted a 5-0 victory in the opener of the three-game set after losing four straight home games to the Indians last week and eight of the first 10 meetings. Second baseman Brian Dozier went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and shortstop Jorge Polanco hit a two-run homer on Friday as the Twins survived without slugging third baseman Miguel Sano (sinus infection).

Between the headaches, it just makes sense to try to back him off and get him on some medication. Hopefully he feels better (Saturday).  The defeat was just the second in the past 10 games for Cleveland, which saw its American League Central lead dip to 1 1/2 games over the Twins.

{"content":"The Kansas City Royals and the Toronto Blue Jays both came into the season with playoff aspirations before rough starts pushed them back in the standings, and both are trying to make their way forward again. The Royals have the benefit of owning the hottest pitcher in the league, and Jason Vargas will take the mound when they host the Blue Jays in the second of a three-game set on Saturday. Kansas City (36-36) reached .500 for the first time since it was 7-7 on April 19 and pushed Toronto (35-38) one game further away with a 5-4 win in the series opener on Friday. The Royals are winners of 10 of their last 12 games and won in dramatic fashion on Friday, when Whit Merrifield delivered a walk-off, two-run double to cap a four-run ninth inning. The Blue Jays began their seven-game road trip strong with wins in two of the first three at Texas but dropped an 11-4 decision on Thursday with a chance to move to .500 and fell in excruciating fashion on Friday. Toronto will try to bounce back against Vargas, while the Royals counter with right-hander Marco Estrada. TV: 2:15 p.m. ET, SportsNet (Toronto), FSN Kansas City PITCHING MATCHUP: Blue Jays RH Marco Estrada (4-5, 4.98 ERA) vs. Royals LH Jason Vargas (10-3, 2.27) Estrada is enduring a four-start winless streak and wasn’t particularly sharp in any of those outings, during which he piled up a 0-3 record with a 12.68 ERA. The California native managed to escape without a decision at Texas on Monday despite allowing six runs on seven hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings. Estrada is seeing for the Royals for the first time since the 2015 American League Championship Series, when he went 1-1 in a pair of starts, including a win in Game 5 that kept the series alive for Toronto. Vargas is enjoying a streak of five wins in as many starts and is tied with Los Angeles Dodgers’ ace Clayton Kershaw for the major-league lead in wins. The Californian, who attended Long Beach State with Estrada, has allowed a total of six runs in his last four outings and is coming off a win over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday. Vargas missed the 2015 ALCS following elbow surgery and has not faced Toronto since a win on May 30, 2014. Walk-Offs 1. Blue Jays OF Steve Pearce (knee) is both day-to-day. 2. The Royals reportedly agreed to a deal with veteran RHP Nefatli Feliz and designated RHP Chris Young for assignment. 3. Toronto DH Kendrys Morales went 0-for-3 on Friday, snapping a string of five straight games with multiple hits.

{"content":"Things haven’t been going well for the Cincinnati Reds in the pitching department this season, but there is some reason for optimism. The Reds will welcome back veteran right-hander Homer Bailey on Saturday when they visit the Washington Nationals for the second of a three-game series. Cincinnati boasts one of the most fearsome lineups in the league with Scott Schebler joining Joey Votto in the 20-homer club and Adam Duvall, Eugenio Suarez and Zack Cozart all hitting well, but the team entered the weekend with the worst rotation ERA in baseball at 6.12. Top prospect Luis Castillo pitched well in his major-league debut on Friday - two runs allowed in five innings - but the bullpen let the team down before closer Raisel Iglesias allowed Bryce Harper’s game-winning hit in the 10th. The Nationals are usually the team with the suspect bullpen, but four relievers combined to allow one hit in five scoreless innings in Friday’s triumph. Washington will try to get more out of starter Joe Ross on Saturday while Bailey tries to give the Cincinnati bullpen a break. TV: 4:05 p.m. ET, FSN Ohio (Cincinnati), MASN 2 (Washington) PITCHING MATCHUP: Reds RH Homer Bailey (2016: 2-3, 6.65 ERA) vs. Nationals RH Joe Ross (3-3, 5.98) Bailey is coming off his third elbow surgery since Aug. 2014, the latest being a procedure to clean out bone chips in February. The 31-year-old Texan, who signed a six-year, $105 million contract just before the series of injuries began in 2014, breezed through three rehab starts with a 3-0 record, 1.08 ERA and 17 strikeouts in 16 2/3 total innings. Bailey struggled in six major-league outings last season, yielding a total of 35 hits in 23 innings. Ross is struggling to find consistency this season and showed off the good and the bad over his last three outings. The 24-year-old struck out 12 and allowed one run across 7 2/3 innings against Baltimore on June 8 but yielded nine runs - seven earned - and 18 hits in a combined 11 2/3 innings over his last two starts. Ross is making his second career start against the Reds and escaped without a decision on July 2, 2016, despite allowing four runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 frames. Walk-Offs 1. Reds INF/OF Scooter Gennett hit his 10th homer on Friday, giving Cincinnati five players with double-digit homers. 2. Washington CF Michael Taylor (undisclosed injury) is day-to-day. 3. Cincinnati CF Billy Hamilton is 0-for-18 over the last four games.

{"content":"The Philadelphia Phillies got off to a nice start on their nine-game road trip and look to keep it going when they visit the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday for the second contest of their four-game series. Philadelphia used some late power to post a 6-1 triumph in the opener, ending its seven-game slide on the road. Maikel Franco belted a solo homer in the eighth inning and Tommy Joseph added a two-run shot in a four-run ninth, giving him at least one hit in 17 of his last 18 contests. Arizona managed only six hits Friday as it was held in check after scoring a total of 26 runs in its previous two contests. David Peralta recorded one of the Diamondbacks' hits, a double that extended his hitting streak to six games. The 29-year-old Venezuelan has collected 11 hits during his run, with only three going for extra bases. TV: 10:10 p.m. ET, TCN (Philadelphia), FSN Arizona PITCHING MATCHUP: Phillies RH Ben Lively (1-1, 3.33 ERA) vs. Diamondbacks LH Robbie Ray (7-3, 2.87) After winning his major-league debut on June 3 against San Francisco, Lively has gone 0-1 in three starts - including a no-decision against Arizona on Sunday in which he allowed three runs and eight hits over six innings. The 25-year-old Floridian registered six strikeouts - one more than the total from his first three turns - and issued just one walk after handing out seven free passes over his initial 21 frames. Lively has yielded three runs and at least eight hits in each outing during his winless streak but had worked seven innings in each of his three career starts prior to Sunday. Ray also did not factor in the decision on Sunday after yielding four runs on eight hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. The outing ended a five-start winning streak for the 25-year-old native of Tennessee but extended his unbeaten string to seven outings that includes four scoreless efforts, a complete game and three double-digit strikeout performances. Ray, who hasn't lost since May 9 versus Detroit, owns a 1-1 record and 5.19 ERA in three career starts against Philadelphia. Walk-Offs 1. Phillies LF/2B Howie Kendrick was scratched from Friday's lineup due to tightness in his left hamstring but came on and delivered a pinch-hit double. 2. Arizona placed J.J.

{"content":"The New York Mets are hoping to reverse their fortunes after beginning their 10-game road trip in forgettable fashion. They started the process in the series opener against the San Francisco Giants and look to continue it Saturday in the middle contest of the three-game set. The Mets were outscored 36-11 by the Los Angeles Dodgers during a four-game sweep but bounced back Friday, pounding out 20 hits - nine for extra bases - in an 11-4 triumph. Five players registered three hits apiece - including Yoenis Cespedes and Lucas Duda, who combined for two home runs and four RBIs. San Francisco trailed 7-1 after two innings in the opener and went on to lose for the 10th time in 11 contests. Brandon Belt has been one of the few bright spots for the Giants of late, as he brings a six-game hitting streak and four-game RBI string into Saturday's meeting. TV: 7:15 p.m. ET, FOX PITCHING MATCHUP: Mets RH Jacob deGrom (6-3, 3.94 ERA) vs. Giants RH Johnny Cueto (5-7, 4.42) DeGrom seeks his third consecutive victory after allowing a total of one earned run over 17 innings in home triumphs over the Chicago Cubs and Washington. The 29-year-old Floridian is hoping a recent trend does not continue, as he surrendered 15 runs over eight frames in his previous two turns - both losses - after recording a pair of wins in which he gave up one run over 15 1/3 innings. DeGrom did not figure in the decision against San Francisco on May 8, remaining at 3-1 with a 3.62 ERA in five career starts versus the Giants after yielding three runs in six frames. Cueto's winless streak reached four starts on Monday, when he dropped to 0-3 during the drought despite giving up only two runs and five hits in seven innings at Atlanta. The 31-year-old Dominican has won just one of his last nine outings but has worked at least six frames seven times in that span and allowed three or fewer earned runs on six occasions. Cueto has made 12 career starts against the Mets, going 4-4 with a 3.75 ERA. Walk-Offs 1. Giants OF Hunter Pence is 5-for-14 with five RBIs against deGrom in his career. 2.

{"content":"The Oakland Athletics have struggled away from home all season long and hope to begin turning things around on this road trip after putting together a strong performance in the opener. The Athletics look to follow up a shutout victory when they visit the struggling Chicago White Sox on Saturday for the middle contest of a three-game series. Oakland, who sit in last place in the American League West, is 10-25 overall on the road and had dropped 23 of 29 away from home before five pitchers scattered seven hits en route to posting a victory for the first time in five contests. Rookie Daniel Gossett will try to give the Athletics a series victory Saturday and earn his first major-league victory, while the White Sox counter with veteran James Shields, who has pitched well in all four of his starts this season. Chicago has dropped four of five and is seven games out of first place in the AL Central after getting shut out for the fifth time this season on the heels of a 9-0 victory over Minnesota on Thursday. White Sox designated hitter Matt Davidson, who has seven homers in his last 11 games, registered multiple hits Friday for the sixth time in his last nine contests. TV: 2:10 p.m. ET, NBCSN California (Oakland), CSN Chicago PITCHING MATCHUP: Athletics RH Daniel Gossett (0-2, 7.20 ERA) vs. White Sox RH James Shields (1-0, 2.42) After a rough big-league debut, Gossett improved in his second major-league start, allowing two runs on six hits and no walks with six strikeouts over 6 2/3 innings in a 4-1 setback Monday against Houston. The 24-year-old Clemson product gave up seven runs (six earned) and six hits - two homers - over 3 1/3 innings in a loss to Miami on June 14. Gossett, a former second-round pick, was 3-3 with a 3.41 ERA in 11 starts at Triple-A Nashville before his promotion. Shields kept his team in the game in his first start since returning from a two-month stint on the disabled list, permitting three runs on seven hits across 5 2/3 innings in a no-decision at Toronto. The 35-year-old Californian is four strikeouts shy of 2,000 for his career and had 16 in three starts while surrendering three runs combined before suffering a back injury.

{"content":"The New York Yankees rallied to avoid another stinging defeat and will try for their first winning streak in nearly two weeks when they continue a three-game series against the visiting Texas Rangers on Saturday. Losers of eight of their last nine entering Friday's series opener, the Yankees were down to their last two outs before Brett Gardner clubbed a game-tying solo homer to force extra innings. Ronald Torreyes won it in the 10th with an RBI single as New York improved to 24-11 at home and remained in a virtual tie with Boston atop the American League East. Rangers closer Matt Bush allowed both runs and a total of five hits in 1 2/3 innings and he has given up eight earned runs in eight innings over his last eight appearances. His latest clunker prevented Texas from getting over .500 and spoiled an outstanding start by Yu Darvish, who matched New York righty Masahiro Tanaka in a game that was scoreless into the ninth. The matchup is not nearly as intriguing in Saturday's tilt, as rotation fill-ins Austin Bibens-Dirkx for the Rangers and Luis Cessa of the Yankees are on the mound. TV: 1:05 p.m. ET, MLB Network, FSN Southwest (Texas), YES (New York) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rangers RH Austin Bibens-Dirkx (2-0, 4.25 ERA) vs. Yankees RH Luis Cessa (0-1, 7.36) Bibens-Dirkx followed up a gem in a win at Washington by allowing five runs in five innings of a no-decision against Toronto on Monday. The 32-year-old rookie has a 4.86 ERA and has held opponents to a .210 average in three starts. His win over the Nationals on June 11 left him 1-0 with a 2.60 mark in four appearances (one start) away from home. Cessa was recently called up to replace the injured CC Sabathia in the rotation and he gave up four runs in four frames at Oakland in his first start of the year for the Yankees. The 25-year-old from Mexico is 2-5 with a 4.37 ERA in 10 career starts. He allowed one run in three innings of relief to get the win in his lone encounter with the Rangers last season. Walk-Offs 1. Gardner's homer was his 14th, which leaves him three shy of matching his career high set in 148 games in 2014. 2. Rangers 1B Joey Gallo has gone 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in each of his last two games. 3.

Atlanta hosts Milwaukee in the middle game Saturday and its second baseman figures to make an impact again after Phillips hit a double and a homer in Friday’s 5-4 victory, raising his average since May 16 to .328 with 18 extra-base hits. The Braves have won eight of their past 11 games to move within three games of .500 as Atlanta got two more hits from shortstop Dansby Swanson, who is batting .338 with 14 RBIs in 22 games this month. The Brewers have lost four of their past seven but still lead the National League Central. Shortstop Orlando Arcia went 2-for-4 with a double and two RBIs in the opener, raising his average to .331 in his past 33 games.

He gave up four runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings Monday against Pittsburgh in an 8-1 loss, five days after surrendering four runs in five innings in a victory at St. Louis. Garza earned his first victory of the season against the Braves on April 30, striking out seven with no walks, three runs and six hits allowed in 6 2/3 innings. Dickey recovered from his worst start of the season June 13 at Washington, in which he allowed eight runs in five innings, to fire seven shutout innings of three-hit pitching to get the win Monday over San Francisco. The 42-year-old has walked just one hitter with 20 strikeouts in his past 19 innings, starting that stretch with a victory over Philadelphia (one run, three hits, seven innings). Dickey has settled in at SunTrust Park, going 4-1 at the Braves’ new home with a 3.58 ERA in eight starts. Walk-Offs 1. Milwaukee has hit at least one homer in its past 11 games. 2.

{"content":"After winding up on the wrong end of three consecutive one-run games in their first visit to St. Louis, the Pittsburgh Pirates turned to an ex-Cardinal in order to end their recent struggles at Busch Stadium. David Freese hopes to haunt his former team yet again Saturday as his Pirates continue their three-game series in St. Louis. Pittsburgh dropped three straight 2-1 decisions in St. Louis from April 17-19 after entering the series with a .500 record, and it hasn't been able to get back to the break-even mark since. Freese, who has reached base safely in each of his 14 career starts against the Cardinals, gave Pittsburgh the jolt it needed in Friday's 4-3 win with a game-tying RBI single in the eighth before John Jaso delivered a solo home run one inning later to seal it. St. Louis continued its recent homer-happy ways with two more in the opener, but Jose Martinez's two-run shot and Paul DeJong's solo blast weren't enough in the team's first home setback against the Pirates in eight meetings. The Cardinals have homered in a season-high 12 consecutive games and scored 33 of their last 42 runs via the long ball. TV: 7:15 p.m. ET, FOX PITCHING MATCHUP: Pirates RH Gerrit Cole (5-6, 4.28 ERA) vs. Cardinals RH Lance Lynn (5-4, 3.33) Cole was masterful in Monday's win at Milwaukee, giving up one run and three hits across seven innings after posting a similar line six days earlier against Colorado. The 26-year-old UCLA product seems to have recovered from a four-start stretch during which he surrendered 23 runs and 39 hits in 19 1/3 frames and found the form that allowed him to post a 2.84 ERA after his first nine turns. Cole lost at St. Louis on April 19 despite permitting two runs in six innings, falling to 5-4 with a 2.84 ERA in 11 career starts against the Cardinals. Lynn's strong start this month came to a crashing halt Sunday in Baltimore as he surrendered a career-high four homers among the seven runs and nine hits he allowed over 4 2/3 innings. The one-time All-Star, who hasn't lasted more than 5 1/3 frames in any of his last five outings, had opened June by allowing a total of three runs and eight hits while striking out 18 across 15 1/3 innings. Lynn worked seven scoreless frames on April 17 to earn his first victory of the season against the Pirates. Walk-Offs 1. Pirates 1B Josh Bell's 14 home runs are the second-most by a Pittsburgh rookie before the All-Star break since Hall-of-Famer Ralph Kiner hit 15 in 1946. 2.

{"content":"The streaking Los Angeles Dodgers have won eight straight games and 14 of their last 15, but they received a scare Friday as star shortstop Corey Seager exited the contest in the second inning with a right hamstring cramp. Seager figures to be out of the lineup Saturday as the Dodgers continue their three-game series against the visiting Colorado Rockies, who have dropped three in a row. Seager is listed as day-to-day after going 2-for-2 with two runs scored in Friday’s 6-1 victory, which gave the Dodgers a major league-best record of 22-6 since May 25. Justin Turner contributed three hits in the win and has recorded at least one in 16 of his last 17 games, batting .469 with four home runs and 13 RBIs over that stretch.

The 27-year-old settled for a no-decision Sunday despite holding San Francisco to two runs over six frames. Turner is 2-for-13 against Chatwood, who allowed five runs in 4 1/3 innings against Los Angeles on May 12 and has gone 4-7 with a 3.95 ERA in 12 career turns versus the Dodgers. Kershaw recorded the win Monday against the New York Mets despite surrendering six runs - and a career-high four homers - over 6 1/3 innings. The three-time Cy Young Award winner has allowed a career-high 17 homers but has registered a stellar 115 strikeouts against 17 walks over 103 1/3 frames.

Detroit managed just three hits in its latest hapless effort while dropping nine games under .500 on the season and to 14-25 on the road. San Diego has recorded just seven runs over its last five games and notched only two hits on Friday, with Austin Hedges delivering an RBI double for the game's lone run. Cory Spangenberg registered the Padres' other hit as he reached base three times and scored ahead of Hedges' double. The Tigers were hitless in six at-bats with runners in scoring position in the opener, and cleanup hitter J.D. Martinez struck out in three of his four at-bats.

Sanchez is 0-2 with a 3.09 ERA in four career starts against the Padres, including a no-decision in his lone career outing at Petco Park. Lamet is coming off a 12-strikeout performance against Milwaukee, the second-best total by a Padres rookie behind Oliver Perez (13 in 2002). The 24-year-old wasn't involved in the decision as he gave up three runs and four hits - two homers - in six innings.

{"content":"The Seattle Mariners are one of the hottest teams in baseball and look for their seventh consecutive victory when they host the Houston Astros on Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game series. Seattle experienced few issues in the opener against the team with the best record in the majors by drubbing Houston 13-3 on Friday. The hot-hitting Mike Zunino belted a three-run homer to break open the game, and Ben Gamel (15-game hitting streak) and Kyle Seager also went deep to fuel the Mariners' 16-hit attack. Zunino, a poor offensive performer entering the month, has recorded nine homers and 29 RBIs in June - with the latter total just four shy of the franchise mark for any month.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State said on Friday it had no concrete evidence on whether the militant group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead or alive but played down any significance he might have on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria.

{"content":"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - If Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is confirmed dead, he is likely to be succeeded by one of his top two lieutenants, both of whom were Iraqi army officers under late dictator Saddam Hussein. Experts on Islamist groups see no clear successor but regard Iyad al-Obaidi and Ayad al-Jumaili as the leading contenders, though neither would be likely to assume Baghdadi's title of  caliph , or overall commander of Muslims. Russia's defense ministry said last week Baghdadi may have been killed in an air strike in Syria and Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian parliamentarian on Friday as saying the likelihood that he had been killed was close to 100 percent. But armed groups fighting in the region and many regional officials are skeptical about the reports.   We don't have any concrete evidence on whether or not he's dead either,  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the international coalition battling Islamic State, told a Pentagon briefing.  Obaidi, who is in his 50s, has been serving as war minister. Jumaili, in his late 40s, is head of the group's Amniya security agency. In April Iraqi state TV said Jumaili had been killed, but that was not confirmed.  Related CoverageU.S.-led coalition unsure if Islamic State's Baghdadi dead or aliveBoth joined the Sunni Salafist insurgency in Iraq in 2003, following the U.S.-led invasion which Saddam and empowered Iraq's Shi'ite majority. They have been Baghdadi's top aides since air strikes in 2016 killed his then deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, his Chechen war minister Abu Omar al-Shishani and his Syrian chief propagandist, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.  Jumaili recognizes Obaidi as his senior but there is no clear successor and, depending on conditions, it can be either of the two (who succeeds Baghdadi),  said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises several Middle East governments on IS affairs. Baghdadi awarded himself the title of caliph - the chief Muslim civil and religious ruler, regarded as the successor of the Prophet Mohammad - in 2014. Obaidi or Jumaili would be unlikely to become caliph because they lack religious standing and Islamic State has lost much of its territory.  No  Land to Rule   They don't belong to the Prophet Mohammad's lineage. The group has no longer 'a land to rule' or 'Ardh al-Tamkeen'. And none is well versed in Islamic theology,  said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, another Iraqi expert on the extremist group.   A caliph has to have an Ardh al-Tamkeen, which he rules in  accordance with Islamic law. Failing that, the successor will just be recognized as the emir,  said Hashimi.  Emir is Arabic for prince, and is a title that jihadists often use to describe their leaders.  By contrast, Baghdadi, born as Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai' in 1971, comes from a family of preachers and studied Islamic law in Baghdad.  The appointment of the new leader would require the approval of an eight-member shoura council, an advisory body to the caliph. But its members would be unlikely to meet for security reasons so would make their opinion known through couriers.  Six members of the council are Iraqis, one Jordanian and one  Saudi, and all are veterans of the Sunni salafist insurgency. A ninth member, the group's Bahraini chief cleric, Turki al-Bin’ali, was killed in an air strike in Syria on May 31. In Washington, two U.S. intelligence officials said they believed Islamic State had moved most of its leaders to al-Mayadin in Syria'a Euphrates Valley, southeast of the group's besieged capital there, Raqqa. Among the operations moved to al-Mayadin, about 80 km (50 miles) west of the Iraqi border, were its online propaganda operation and its limited command and control of attacks in Europe and elsewhere, they said.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - The West's monopoly on rights has been dealt a blow by the United Nations' decision to adopt a China-led resolution saying development promotes human rights, an editorial in the official paper of China's ruling Communist Party said on Saturday. The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday adopted a China-led resolution on  The Contribution of Development to the Enjoyment of All Human Rights, the first time it had adopted a resolution on development issues, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The resolution was co-sponsored by more than 70 countries, Xinhua reported.  For a long time, the international rights process and conversation has been monopolized by Western governments,  the People's Daily said in a Saturday editorial.  Some people from the West often use the pretense of human rights to export their own values and even to use them to meddle in other countries' internal affairs,  it added. Overview of the United Nations Human Rights Council is seen in Geneva, Switzerland June 6, 2017.Denis Balibouse The inclusion of the concept of 'development promoting human rights' into the international human rights system signifies a major shift in the global human rights conversation,  the paper said. China has long faced criticism over its poor human rights record from international bodies and Western governments, which speak out against stifling of civil society, as well as censorship and detention of rights lawyers and activists. Beijing regularly rejects foreign criticism, saying that the definition of rights used by the West is too narrow and ignores the effort China has made on poverty alleviation and securing the rights to education and freedom from hunger. In the face of regular pressure from the U.N. rights council, China has sought to gain the support of other U.N. members, often developing nations, on rights issues to redress what it sees as shortfalls in the current system. Last week, Greece blocked a European Union statement to the council criticizing China's human rights record, a decision EU diplomats said undermined efforts to confront Beijing's latest crackdown on dissent. China has previously refused to allow in some U.N.-appointed envoys and others who were allowed to visit have complained of government interference with their work, though the government pledged to cooperate with the body in September last year.

{"content":"DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - A faction of Pakistan-based sectarian militants Lashkar-e-Jhangvi on Saturday claimed responsibility for twin bombs that hit a market in the northwestern town of Parachinar, killing at least 50 people ahead of the holiday marking the end of Ramadan. LeJ's Al Alami faction said in a statement it was targeting minority Shi'ite Muslims and threatened more attacks over Pakistanis fighting against Sunni militants in Syria's civil war. Video footage after the attack showed civilians dragging bleeding victims outside to waiting ambulances in the chaos that came when the bombs exploded before the sundown meal breaking the daily Ramadan fast.  We have received 50 bodies so far, and 250 were wounded,  said Sabir Hussain, medical superintendent of Parachinar Hospital. Sixty of the seriously wounded had been transferred to the larger city of Peshawar, he added. LeJ Al Alami, which has previously partnered with Middle East-based Islamic State to carry out attacks in Pakistan, said it has previously  warned the Shia community of Parachinar ... to stop staining your hands with the blood of Sunnis in Syria . It repeated the demand in the statement, saying that  otherwise in the coming days you will face such hate-fueled and deadly attacks that you will not be able to stand them . Hundreds of Pakistanis - many of them Shi'ites believed recruited by Iran - have gone to fight in Syria to defend the government of Tehran's ally, President Bashar al-Assad.  Assad's government is also supported by Russian air strikes and fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, against an array of Sunni rebels backed by Turkey and Arab states. The United States, Turkey, Arab and European powers are also participating in a coalition bombing Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim militant group. The market bombings in Parachinar late on Friday afternoon came on a particularly deadly day for Pakistan as both Sunni and Shia Muslims prepared to mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Another bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta killed 13 people and a drive-by shooting killed four police officers in the southern megacity of Karachi on Friday. Both of those attacks were claimed by another militant group, the Jamaat ur Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban. Islamic State also claimed the Quetta attack through a messaging network. It had not commented on the Parachinar attack by Saturday afternoon. Sunni-majority Pakistan also has a sizeable Shi'ite minority and has sought to avoid being dragged into sectarian strife that is rife in Syria and also the recent rift between Qatar and Saudia Arabia-led Sunni states that have cut off ties with Doha in part over its relations with Iran. Pakistan's military said late Friday it had tightened security across the country, including at the Afghan border, following the attacks.

Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane's recommendation to alter the South African Reserve Bank's principal constitutional mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus on economic growth has highlighted worsening divisions between the country's state institutions.

{"content":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The head of South Africa's anti-graft watchdog is open to talks on her recommendation to change the central bank's mandate, a proposal that has drawn sharp criticism from parliament, the ruling party and investors, a local news agency said on Saturday. Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane's recommendation to alter the South African Reserve Bank's principal constitutional mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus on economic growth has highlighted worsening divisions between the country's state institutions.  Both the central bank and parliament plan to mount legal challenges to the proposal. Mkhwebane defended her recommendation but said she was willing to hold discussions with those opposing it, news agency Eyewitness News (EWN) reported.  I haven't overstepped and I think those will be the deliberations which we'll be having further and again. I'll see how the notice of motion, the content and why are they disputing that. We'll take it from there,  Mkhwebane was quoted as saying. Mkhwebane made her proposal on Monday as she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa Group. The lender has denied any wrongdoing. Her call threatens to further stain South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after mines minister Mosebenzi spooked investors by raising the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent. The row over the central bank's role has also highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling African National Congress party (ANC), the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to altering the role of the central bank while Cosatu has backed calls for changes.

{"content":"DUBAI(Reuters) - President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government said on Saturday it was investigating reports that forces backed by the United Arab Emirates were running secret prisons in southern Yemen where detainees are subjected to torture and abuse. The UAE is part of a Saudi-led Arab alliance that intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to roll back Iran-allied Houthi forces that drove Hadi into exile. His government has since regained a presence in the south based in Aden but the Houthis still hold most of the north including the capital Sanaa. Reports of secret prisons where detainees are abused relate to areas of the south where UAE forces and its allies have also swooped against al Qaeda militants, who have exploited the war to try to carve out areas of control and influence. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch reported that it had documented the cases of 49 people, including four children, whom it said were arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared in Aden and Hadramout over the last year. Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr said he had set up a six-member committee headed by the justice minister to investigate  human rights allegations in liberated areas .  The committee starts work from today and sends its report to the prime minister within 15 days,  the order, dated June 22, said. The committee's duties were to investigate the abuse allegations, ways to respond to them and to put forth mechanisms to deal with any such issues in the future. The HRW report said that at least 38 of those held appear to have been arrested by security forces backed by the UAE.  You don't effectively fight extremist groups like al Qaeda or ISIS (Islamic State) by disappearing dozens of young men and constantly adding to the number of families with 'missing' loved ones in Yemen,  Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. It also said that at least two of 11 informal prisons identified by researchers are run by the UAE, while the others are run by UAE-backed Yemeni security forces. On Friday, the UAE Foreign Ministry denied running any secret prisons in Yemen and called the accusations  an attempt to sully the reputation of the alliance that had intervened to save the Yemeni people .  This issue is in the hands of the legitimate Yemeni authorities, while the coalition forces provide the necessary training for Yemeni cadres in line with the best legal practices,  the ministry said in a statement.

{"content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea (PNG) began voting for a new parliament on Saturday in a two-week-long election to decide who will lead the resource-rich nation through a period of significant economic uncertainty. PNG has been hit hard by a slump in oil and gas prices and a 2016 drought that crippled farming and brought production at its largest copper mine to a halt. The country’s credit rating was downgraded to B2 by Moody’s in April last year, reflecting ongoing balance of payments pressures that have been compounded by the slump in global commodity prices. Despite that, Prime Minister Peter O’Neill is in a strong position to retain power, although experts say elections in the South Pacific nation are hugely unpredictable. “You have to treat this as 111 separate elections because what matters to the voters in most areas is incredibly local issues - what services are getting sent to them from their local member,” said Jonathan Pryke, a research fellow in the Lowy Institute's Melanesia program. (There are 111 seats in the PNG parliament.) Despite its mineral wealth, which includes Exxon Mobil's $20 billion LNG plant, most of Papua New Guinea's nearly eight million people live at subsistence level on islands, atolls and in remote mountain villages. A total of 3332 candidates - including 165 women - from 44 political parties will contest the election.  O'Neill, who came to power in 2012 promising to rein in corruption, has faced allegations he authorized millions of dollars in fraudulent payments to a leading law firm. In 2014, an anti-corruption watchdog issued an order for his arrest over the incident, which O'Neill denies. He refused to comply and stripped the watchdog of funding. Opposition politicians have harshly criticized the prime minister over his economic management, which has been marked by deficit spending. O’Neill finished up campaigning on Friday by visiting remote villages in his home district of Ialibu-Pangia in Southern Highlands Province. “We still have some weeks of voting and formation of Government, and I call on all candidates and members of the public to continue to maintain the same calm and peaceful approach to voting,” he said in a statement. Violence and corruption, most notably vote-buying, have been a feature of elections in Papua New Guinea since it gained independence from Australia in 1975. Australia is working closely with PNG to support the election, seconding experts from the Australian Electoral Commission and deploying 200 defense force personnel in Port Moresby, the capital.  It has also deployed military aircraft to deliver election materials to remote communities.  Electoral observers from Commonwealth nations are in the country to observe the election.   The official result is due by July 24.

{"content":"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese police detained a French dissident of Vietnamese descent for deportation on Friday after the Communist state revoked his Vietnamese citizenship last month, his wife said. Pham Minh Hoang, a 61-year-old activist and mathematics lecturer, had dual French and Vietnamese citizenship before Vietnam canceled his citizenship without giving a reason, a move that drew criticism from human rights groups.  Despite sweeping reforms to the economy and growing openness to social change, the Communist Party retains tight media censorship and tolerates no criticism. Dozens of bloggers and activists are serving sentences for crimes against the state. Hoang's wife, Le Thi Kieu Oanh, said police came to their house in Ho Chi Minh city on Friday asking to carry out a regular check on their household registration but later forced Hoang to leave with them and said they would deport him the next day.  My husband refused to go but three to four police officers used violence to drag him out and locked me inside the house... They also parked a signal-jammer car right in front of our house,  Oanh said. The French embassy in Vietnam said France regretted the Vietnamese authorities decision to revoke Hoang's Vietnamese nationality and to deport him.  Freedom of expression and of opinion, notably on the Internet, are both guaranteed by the international covenant on civil and political rights to which Vietnam is a party. France calls on Vietnamese authorities to ensure compliance with these commitments , the embassy said in a statement sent to Reuters. Ho Chi Minh police said they could not provide any information on the case. Hoang was sentenced to three years in jail for attempted subversion in 2011 but was released after 17 months and served three years under house arrest. He frequently posts blogs criticizing the Vietnamese government. Oanh said the couple were informed on June 1 by the French consul-general that Hoang's Vietnamese citizenship was being annulled with a month for him to leave the country, but they refused to comply.  It's Hoang's ideal to stay in Vietnam to raise a voice and contribute to building freedom and democracy,  Oanh said.  After the signal-jammer car left I called the consul general and he just said he acknowledged the situation. What they would do after that, I don't know,  she added. She said the French embassy and consulate in Vietnam were  waiting for guidance from the French foreign ministry because  Hoang's Vietnamese and French passports have expired. Vietnam's foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang last week defended the decision to revoke Hoang's citizenship, saying it was  conducted in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law.  Hoang is a member of California-based Viet Tan, a group Vietnam considers a terrorist organization.  The French government should not take part in the Hanoi regime's brazen exile of a well-known human rights activist,  Viet Tan said in a statement.

{"content":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Chinese court meted out a nearly 700 million yuan ($102.4 million) punishment to a Russian-controlled high-frequency trading firm for futures market manipulation on Friday, drawing a line under one of the most high-profile cases of misconduct Beijing blames for contributing to the 2015 stock market crash. The verdict by the Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, posted on its official microblog, also involves a penalty to two executives of Yishidun International Trading Co. The ruling comes at the end of a week in which index publisher MSCI agreed to include China's domestic shares in its emerging market benchmark.  Malicious  short selling by domestic and foreign  speculators  have been largely blamed by the Chinese government for causing the market crisis that started in the summer of 2015.

{"content":"Yankees top Rangers in battle of Japanese pitchers NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees were delighted to see Masahiro Tanaka go toe to toe with Yu Darvish. An even better sight was watching Ronald Torreyes deliver the game-winning hit. Tanaka pitched eight scoreless innings during his first major league appearance against Darvish and Torreyes singled with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning, lifting the Yankees to a 2-1 win over the Texas Rangers. Although Tanaka took a no-decision and is winless in his last eight starts since May 9, he looked more like the pitcher who tossed a three-hitter at Fenway Park while opposing Chris Sale on April 27 than the pitcher who began the game with a 6.34 ERA.  Everything,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of what was working for Tanaka. Tanaka allowed three hits, threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters and retired 16 straight at one point from the third to the eighth.

Darvish said he began feeling it in the fourth inning but said he should be able to make his next start. Before exiting, Darvish tied a season high with 10 strikeouts and allowed two hits. Two of his strikeouts were to slugger Aaron Judge, who struck out on a 72 mph curveball in the first and a 95 mph fastball in the seventh.  They were two brilliant Japanese pitchers that had faced off before, been stars in the Japanese league and they're stars here,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said. It was the 15th game in major league history involving two pitchers from Japan. Seven of those games have involved the Yankees and three occurred against Darvish, who opposed Hiroki Kuroda in 2012 and 2013.  We both pitched great,  Darvish said through an interpreter.  So there may be something, but I was trying to focus on my pitching.  While it was the first time Darvish and Tanaka faced each other in the majors, it was the fifth overall matchup. They opposed each other four times in Japan, and in the last meeting on July 20, 2011, both pitchers went the distance.  It was amazing,  Yankees reliever Chasen Shreve said.  We were waiting for it and we know he has it, so it was great to see.  After Tanaka and Darvish were finished, the Yankees won for only the second time in 10 games when Torreyes lined a 98 mph fastball from Matt Bush (3-2) up the middle. It was the first career game-ending hit for the infielder, who raised his arms, dropped his helmet and was lifted by a teammate after reaching first base.  Super happy to able to get a hit in that inning,  Torreyes said through an interpreter.  It's great.  Before Torreyes won it, the Rangers were two outs from getting a 1-0 victory when Elvis Andrus scored on a passed ball by Gary Sanchez while Adrian Beltre struck out against Aroldis Chapman. Instead, Brett Gardner tied it by hitting a 2-1 fastball from Bush into the right-field seats. After Gardner's 14th home run, Aaron Judge chopped a single up the middle just out of shortstop Andrus' range. The Yankees were unable to get the winning run as Bush struck out Matt Holliday but won the game after Shreve (2-1) worked out of a bases-loaded jam by getting Andrus on a popup after striking out Joey Gallo with two on. The game was delayed one hour and 42 minutes, but it was worth the wait for the 39,602 fans at Yankee Stadium and fans watching in Japan 13 hours ahead of New York's time zone.

{"content":"HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Mystery surrounds what next for the America's Cup if New Zealand win sailing's most prestigious prize in Bermuda next week. Emirates Team New Zealand are seeking to wrest the cup from holders Oracle Team USA and with it the rights to decide when the event is next held, its timing and the type of boats used. This is all dictated by the ancient  Deed of Gift  which stipulates the trophy first won in 1851 by the U.S. schooner  America  was to be  a perpetual challenge cup for friendly competition between nations  and allows the winner to take all. However, the history of the cup has been anything but friendly at times, riddled with costly legal feuds, bitter personal battles and a stop-start reputation which has made it  hard to attract tens of millions of dollars needed in sponsorship and broadcasters willing to pay for rights.  From a sponsor's perspective, you don't have any certainty at all ... the defender decides virtually everything,  Jaguar Land Rover's [TAMOJL.UL] Experiential Marketing Director Mark Cameron said on Friday of the firm's support for Britain's Land Rover BAR team, led by British sailor Ben Ainslie. That could all change if the U.S. holders are able to turn around a 3-0 Kiwi lead in the first-to-seven competition on Bermuda's Great Sound when racing resumes this weekend. The team led by Oracle boss Larry Ellison signed up to a  framework agreement  with four of the other challengers this year which would mean the cup being held every two years in foiling catamarans as in Bermuda and a series of match races along the lines of Formula One around the world. This would please many sponsors, but not everyone liked the idea with some saying it was not true to the spirit of the cup and New Zealand boycotted the agreement. The New Zealand camp have not said so far what they will do if they win the cup back. Whose Cup Is It Anyway? Bermuda offered big financial incentives to have the America's Cup held on the small mid-Atlantic island and is keen to make sure that it gets repeat business. Painted on bus shelters along the island's narrow, winding roads is the official slogan  America's Cup, Bermuda's Legacy, Our Moment , with posters depicting a smiling boy from the island saying  America's Cup is Zico's Cup . But not everyone agrees, with  America's Cup is Larry's (Ellison's) Cup  in graffiti on one bus stop. If the U.S. team manage to keep the cup, there is speculation among other teams that the 36th edition could end up in Chicago rather than Bermuda, with races in places including Britain, France, Japan and Sweden.  But if the Kiwis win, the expectation is that it will move to Auckland, although there are also some suggestions that it could also be held in Dubai, where the main New Zealand sponsor Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] is based. While an Auckland cup would be more expensive for some sponsors and create challenges for televising the event in some countries, sponsors such as Land Rover which supports Britain's BAR team do not see it as a deal breaker.  We are clear that we want to compete in the next America's Cup,  Land Rover's Cameron said, adding that his preference was for it to be governed by the framework agreement, with an established class of boats and a  World Series  racing circuit.  We would have to see the details ... but on the basis of location its not a game changer. We would be competing in Auckland,  Cameron told Reuters by telephone.

{"content":"Padres' Perdomo, three relievers blank Tigers SAN DIEGO -- The Detroit Tigers were shut out for the sixth time this season Friday night by the San Diego Padres. And for the third time, Tigers right-handed starter Michael Fulmer was on the wrong end of the zeroes.  All I know is I've had just one scoreless outing this year and obviously that needs to change,  Fulmer said after the Padres scored the game's only run on one of the two hits he allowed -- a second-inning RBI double by catcher Austin Hedges -- as San Diego won 1-0 in the opener of a three-game interleague series at Petco Park.  The way things are going, that's just not good enough,  Fulmer said of his outing after Padres starter Luis Perdomo (2-4) and two relievers combined on a three-hit shutout to hand Detroit its seventh consecutive loss. That was one more hit than the Padres had. But timing is everything.  A walk and a hanging slider,  continued Fulmer.  One inning. There is not much you can do.  Actually, Fulmer (6-6, 3.29 ERA) thought he could have done better. Cory Spangenberg drew a leadoff walk to open the second and reached second on Erick Aybar's groundout to second on a run-and-hit play. Hedges, who hadn't played since being run over by Anthony Rizzo at Wrigley Field on Monday night, doubled to right-center on a two-out, 1-2 slider, driving Spangenberg home. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at PadresDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch I was looking for a mistake and he gave it to me,  said Hedges.  I knew the pitcher was up next,  said Fulmer.  That's why I threw him a slider. I meant to bounce it and I just left it up. I wasn't trying to throw it for a strike. You've got to have a better pitch than that. Unfortunately, one of the few bad ones cost me.  Meanwhile, Perdomo made more mistakes early than Fulmer, but settled down and didn't allow a run for the first time this season in his 13th start. Perdomo allowed two hits and five walks with six strikeouts in six innings as his ERA fell from 4.97 to 4.56. Perdomo didn't allow a hit until Andrew Romine's single leading off the fifth. But he did issue four walks in the first four innings with a pair of inning-ending double plays easing the workload. Padres manager Andy Green and Perdomo credited Hedges for helping the young pitcher settle down and make several midgame adjustments.  I don't think Perdomo gets through the first two innings if not for Austin,  said Green.  It was good to see Austin back in there. He does a great job for the entire ball club. The hit was huge. But Perdomo did a great job of adjusting as the game went on and a lot of that was Austin.   I trust in Austin a lot,  said Perdomo.  Early, I was out of control ... my mechanics. I made some adjustments that kept me in the game.  What adjustments?  I let him be nasty,  said Hedges.  I stopped worrying about setting up on the corners. His stuff was great, but his command wasn't there. So we just set up in the middle to let his pitches move.  Detroit's best opportunity against Perdomo came in the top of the sixth. Alex Avila opened the inning with a single and stole second after Miguel Cabrera lined out to center. But Perdomo struck out J.D. Martinez for the second time and retired former Padre Justin Upton on a grounder to first. Perdomo was followed by left-handers Ryan Buchter and Brad Hand and right-handed closer Brandon Maurer, who picked up his 14th save. The three Padres relievers had five strikeouts against one hit in three innings. Buchter struck out two Tigers in a perfect inning. Hand had two strikeouts after giving up a leadoff double in the eighth. Maurer had one in a perfect ninth. Tigers pinch-hitter John Hicks doubled to lead off the eighth but was stranded when Hand struck out Ian Kinsler -- on a disputed check-swing call by first base umpire Jordan Baker -- and pinch-hitter Nicholas Castellanos before retiring Cabrera on a grounder to short. Detroit manager Brad Ausmus was ejected by Baker for arguing the call.  It was probably because of my emotion concerning the call he made,  said Ausmus.  I wasn't real happy with the call on the check swing. I didn't think Ian went and still don't think he went after watching the replay.  I felt real good about having the leadoff hitter on second. Then Kinsler is out on a supposed swing and now it's a different story.  Baker was involved in another call in the Tigers' ninth. The umpire called Upton safe at first on a one-out grounder to short. But Green appealed the call and Upton was ruled out. Maurer then retired Dixon Machado on a fly to center to complete San Diego's fourth shutout of the season. The Padres' only other hit was a single by Spangenberg in the fourth. Spangenberg reached base in all three plate appearances on two walks and the single and also stole a base. NOTES: The Padres placed 2B-3B Yangervis Solarte (left oblique strain) and RHP Miguel Diaz (forearm strain) on the 10-day disabled list Friday and recalled C-1B Hector Sanchez and 2B Carlos Asuaje from Triple-A El Paso. Sanchez had been at El Paso on a rehab assignment while on the disabled list. He had been out since May 7 with a foot contusion . . . Detroit released RHP Francisco Rodriguez and placed OF Alex Presley on the seven-day concussion disabled list.

{"content":"Mariners' Hernandez beats Astros in return SEATTLE --  King's Court  is back in session. Felix Hernandez pitched six strong innings in his first start since April 25 and the Seattle Mariners hit three home runs to defeat the Houston Astros 13-3 Friday night at Safeco Field. Hernandez (3-2), who had been on the disabled list with inflammation in his pitching shoulder, allowed eight hits and three runs. He walked one and struck out six.  I was going crazy on the DL, but I knew I'd be back,  Hernandez said.  I was just trying to have a good game. We scored a lot of runs, which was good for me.  Mike Zunino hit a three-run homer for Seattle, which won its season-high sixth straight game. Ben Gamel and Kyle Seager added solo shots.  King's Court  in the left-field corner, a group of fans who wear yellow  King Felix  T-shirts and hold up  K  signs and chant whenever Hernandez reaches a two-strike count, was overflowing Friday for the right-hander's first appearance at home since April 19. The court, which normally fills two sections, consumed four. Related CoverageHouston Astros - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch  It's a blast playing behind that guy,  Gamel said.  Everything he brings to the table and the atmosphere ... it's huge having Felix back.  Hernandez was staked to a six-run lead in the third inning and cruised from there. Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman hit solo home runs for Houston, which had its four-game winning streak snapped.  It's a big series,  said Hernandez, referring to the matchup between the top two teams in the American League West -- even though the Astros have an 11 1/2-game lead.  It's a good start to win this game.  Altuve hit a two-out homer, his 11th of the season, in the first. Bregman led off the fifth with his homer to straightaway center field, his eighth.  Both home runs were pretty good pitches,  Hernandez said.  Just got to tip my hat to them.  The Mariners tied it in the second as Seager led off with a single, moved to second on a single by Danny Valencia and scored on Jarrod Dyson's double down the right-field line. Seattle loaded the bases in the third as Seager was hit by a pitch after singles by Gamel and Nelson Cruz. Mitch Haniger hit a run-scoring single up the middle, then Valencia grounded a two-run single to left just past diving Astros third baseman Bregman. An out later, Zunino hit the first pitch from Houston starter Joe Musgrove 402 feet over the bullpens in left field for a three-run homer, his 10th of the season, making it 7-1. The Astros got one run back in the fourth as Carlos Correa led off with a single and later scored on a run-scoring single by Marwin Gonzalez. But the Mariners continued to batter Musgrove in the fourth, knocking him out. Gamel led off with a homer to left field, his fourth of the season. Two outs later, Seager homered to right, his eighth, giving the Mariners a 9-2 lead. After a walk to Haniger and a single by Valencia, Musgrove's night was done. Musgrove (4-7) had his worst start of the season. He allowed nine runs on 12 hits in 3 2/3 innings, with one walk and four strikeouts, and was tagged for three home runs.  He really made a lot of mistakes in the strike zone and they made him pay for it,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  They did a good job of putting some good at-bats together and we couldn't stop them.  NOTES: RHP Felix Hernandez recorded his 157th career victory, passing Freddy Garcia for the most by a Venezuelan-born pitcher. ... All three of Seattle's runs in the seventh inning scored on wild pitches, even though RHP James Hoyt threw just two. Both 1B Danny Valencia and CF Jarrod Dyson scored on the first one, with Dyson racing home from second. Pinch-hitter Taylor Motter scored on Hoyt's second wild pitch. ... Valencia went 4-for-5, matching his career high for hits in game.

{"content":"Cabrera's trade demand not a distraction for Mets in 11-4 win SAN FRANCISCO -- When Asdrubal Cabrera dropped a bombshell on the ballclub a couple of hours before game time, the New York Mets appeared on the verge of an implosion Friday night. Instead, they exploded, with their bats making the loudest statement of the night. Yoenis Cespedes highlighted a six-run second inning with a two-run homer, helping the Mets brush aside a Cabrera trade demand and a four-game losing streak with an 11-4 victory over the staggering San Francisco Giants.  Very impressed,  Mets manager Terry Collins said after his team's 20-hit attack.  I'm not worried about the attitude of my club. Today was an unfortunate situation. We'll get through it.  Cespedes, Cabrera, Wilmer Flores, Michael Conforto and Lucas Duda had three hits apiece for the Mets, whose hit total equaled the club's season high, set twice previously. Cabrera's big offensive game, which included two runs scored, came shortly after he made his intentions known to reporters that he was planning to request a trade. The second-year Met was unhappy to find out he'd be starting the game at second base in his return from the disabled list, having lost his shortstop spot to Jose Reyes.  I just want to talk about the game,  Cabrera said afterward. He had plenty to talk about, including two flares to right field that dropped for hits in his first two at-bats off the DL. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at GiantsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch I got a couple to fall in right field. Then I hit one hard to shortstop and he made the play. This game is crazy,  he said.  We have a good hitting team. We can do this.  Cabrera fielded four grounders flawlessly and teamed with Reyes on a double play, none of which surprised Collins.  I know he can play second base,  the manager said.  I understand he's not happy playing there. But he's a professional. There were no lingering effects (of the pregame demands).  Duda also homered for the Mets, who were coming off a four-game sweep against the Los Angeles Dodgers and began the night a season-worst 10 games below .500. The two homers gave the Mets 22 in their last 12 games. The Mets teed off on Giants left-hander Ty Blach (4-5), who was facing New York for the first time.  Tonight he was off,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  He couldn't get out of that inning.  Winning pitcher Seth Lugo helped get the big second inning rolling with an RBI double that plated Duda with the run that broke a 1-1 tie. Cespedes' homer, his ninth of the season, made it 5-1 four batters later. It was his fifth home run in seven games against the Giants since the start of last season. Flores, Conforto and Travis d'Arnaud followed with successive doubles, completing the six-run uprising. Duda's homer, his 13th, came against the Giants fourth pitcher, left-hander Josh Osich, in the seventh inning and completed New York's scoring. Cespedes, who also doubled in a three-run sixth inning, finished with three RBIs, and Flores and Conforto had two apiece for the Mets, who had lost eight of their previous 10 games.  That three-spot kind of knocked us out of it,  Bochy said of the Mets' tack-on that increased their lead to 10-1.  When you get down that much in this part, it's tough sledding.  Lugo (2-1) won for the second time in three starts, allowing four runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out two. Gorkys Hernandez had a two-run single in a three-run sixth inning for the Giants, who lost for the 10th time in their last 11 games. Denard Span, Joe Panik and Austin Slater had two hits apiece for the Giants, who were coming off a 1-7 trip on which their pitchers posted a 7.94 ERA. Blach left for a pinch hitter after having surrendered seven runs and 11 hits in three laborious innings during which he threw 80 pitches. He walked one and did not record a strikeout. The career-high 11 hits allowed increased Blach's total in June to a major league-leading 44. Teammate Matt Cain had been tied for the lead at the start of the day with 36. NOTES: The Mets' 20 hits were their most ever at AT&T; Park. The 11 runs tied their previous high in the stadium's 18-year history. ...

{"content":"(The Sports Xchange) - Rookie Sung Hyun Park fired an eight-under-par 63 to take the first-round lead at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship on Friday in Rogers, Arkansas. Park went out in 31, including a stretch of six consecutive birdies interrupted by her only bogey of the day, and added three more birdies on the back despite hitting just eight of 13 fairways.  My play was best with putter today, very good,  Park said. Three players are two shots back of Park, including So Yeon Ryu, Mel Reid and Ally McDonald.  I went to see Ian Baker-Finch and he told me -- he actually make me really comfortable to do putting, like he gave me a lot of confidence like just trust yourself,  Ryu said.   Also, I played with Nick Price, which it was really a pleasure to play with him. He also told me like your putting stroke is so smooth and you're really great, so after that I got extra confidence.  Reid, also a rookie, birdied five of her first seven holes. A hole-in-one at the par-three 11th moved her to eight under, but she made bogey on two of the final seven holes.  As soon as I hit it I thought, oh, it's got a chance,  Reid said of her hole-in-one.  It just pitched a little longer than we thought. But yeah, I mean, a hole-in-one, I hit a good shot into there. I just hit a little 9-iron, so I think it was 135. I just tried to play a 130 shot and it pitched about seven behind it and came back.  Reid's 65 is her low round of the year and comes after she missed the cut in her last three starts. Ryu played bogey-free golf while notching six birdies. McDonald finished with seven birdies and a bogey while playing in front of her parents, grandparents and several family friends.  There are few places that my family can get to with the schedule and with my grandparents wanting to watch me,  McDonald said.  I'm happy they could all be here, and hopefully I can play well for them.

{"content":"Surging Dodgers rip Rockies for 8th in row LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are on such a roll that players don't want to come out of the lineup. Alex Wood suffocated the Colorado Rockies to improve his record to a sterling 8-0 but was bummed when manager Dave Roberts called it a night for him after six innings. Wood allowed three hits, two of them soft, and struck out seven as the Dodgers won their eighth straight, 6-1, Friday night.  I had an at-bat in the sixth so I thought I was going back out,  said Wood, who lowered his ERA to 1.86.  I didn't even know I was up to 98 pitches.  Being 8-0 is nice, for sure. But you always go out there wanting to give your team a chance to win. I tried to attack the strike zone all night. My changeup was working well.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DodgersColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchRoberts said,  He had a great three-pitch mix. They didn't get many good swings. When your starters have had some recent injuries, you look at the long view more than the short one.  Justin Turner had three hits to improve his average to .392 and Yasiel Puig crushed a 445-foot solo home run in the fourth inning to extend the Dodgers' streak of consecutive games with a home run to 15. Shortstop Corey Seager had two hits, scored a run and had an RBI but left the game after two innings after tweaking his right hamstring. It was a precautionary move. He will have an MRI exam on Saturday. Roberts said he probably wouldn't play Saturday.  It doesn't feel bad,  Seager said.  It tightened up like a cramp. I've had a bunch of these before and played through them, but you can also make it worse by playing. I'll get it checked out but I feel pretty confident.  The Dodgers are exuding confidence. They have won 14 of their last 15, the eight-game win streak is their longest since 2013, they've won nine straight at home and have the best home record in the majors at 30-10. They also tied a franchise record by scoring six runs or more in their seventh straight game. The win moved Los Angeles' lead in the NL West to a season-high 2 1/2 games over the Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Rockies started Kyle Freeland (8-5) was touched for 10 hits and three walks in six innings as the Rockies dropped their third straight. Colorado has used a rotation loaded with rookies to post one of the best records in the NL, but its starters have allowed 24 runs in the last three games. Manager Bud Black is aware that Freeland and other starters don't have a foundation of a lot of innings, but he isn't concerned.  You'd like to be eight or nine deep in starters, and that's where I think we are,  Black said.  Reinforcements are coming.  Jon Gray, out since April with a broken foot, is scheduled to return shortly. Tyler Anderson returned this week after being on the DL with a knee injury and may start Sunday. Chad Bettis is also throwing simulated games after being sidelined all season with testicular cancer. NOTES: Dodgers OF Yasiel Puig's home run on Friday was his 14th of the season and first against a left-handed pitcher. ... Cody Bellinger extended his hitting streak to nine games. ... LHP Alex Wood retired the last 10 Rockies he faced, and three relievers retired the next nine. ...

{"content":"Phillies' Leiter beats Diamondbacks in first start PHOENIX -- Mark Leiter Jr. was lights out in his first major league start, one that took the former 22nd-round draft pick plenty of years and plenty of setbacks to make despite his major league heritage. Leiter kept Arizona off-balance by effectively mixing his pitches over six shutout innings in his starting debut, and Maikel Franco and Tommy Joseph homered in the late innings to help the last-place Philadelphia Phillies cool off the Diamondbacks in a 6-1 win on Friday night. Arizona, coming off a 7-1 road trip, had won nine of 10 overall and 11 of 12 at Chase Field only to generate almost no offense against Leiter (1-0), whose first 12 career appearances came in relief.  He's always been under the radar, one of those guys that people have always doubted, but his mentality and the way he prepares and gets ready for this, he's second to none,  said Joseph, a Leiter teammate in both the majors and minors.  They're one of (the) best offenses in baseball, (but) he kept them off-balance and was in command of the strike zone.  The son of Mark Leiter and the nephew of Al Leiter -- both former major league pitchers -- the 26-year-old Leiter wasn't overpowering, with a fastball that topped out in the low 90s, but he constantly forced the Diamondbacks to chase cut fastballs, change-ups and a dominating split-finger fastball down in the strike zone. It probably made fans wonder why he labored with six minor league teams before finally reaching the majors at age 26. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at DiamondbacksPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch He made it look easy, used all of his pitches and pitched ahead all but one inning,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He had a good changeup he threw behind in the count, the splitter was his go-to pitch and he made a lot of hitters look bad on a good-hitting team.  Leiter couldn't have pitched much better for a team that had won only two of its previous 15 games, striking out five and walking one before giving way to his bullpen after throwing 81 pitches, 51 for strikes.  It says a lot about what kind of pitcher he is, first major league start and he comes up and does that. It (Chase Field) is known as a hitters' ballpark, and it means he's pretty strong between the ears,  Joseph said. The Phillies, winning successive games for the first time since June 5-6, didn't generate much offense themselves until the final two innings, but they turned Freddy Galvis' one-out triple in the first off starter Patrick Corbin into a run, then added a key insurance run when Franco hit his ninth homer of the season -- a line drive to right field off Jorge De La Rosa on a 3-0 pitch in the eighth. Galvis' second homer in four games against Arizona this season proved important in the bottom off the inning when Daniel Descalso's first triple of the season scored Rey Fuentes, who began the inning with a single. But reliever Joaquin Benoit recovered to strand Descalso at third, getting David Peralta on a line drive to short and striking out Jake Lamb around a walk to Paul Goldschmidt.  You're going to have those days,  catcher Chris Iannetta said of only the second Diamondbacks loss at home since May 14.  (We'll) brush this one off and come back tomorrow. It's not the end of the world.  Philadelphia, winning its fifth in a row at Chase Field since 2015, broke it open with a four-run ninth against T.J. McFarland that included Joseph's two-run homer into the swimming pool in right field, his 12th of the season.  There was a lot of good stuff out there,  Mackanin said, including Leiter's first major league hit, a single in the second inning. The Diamondbacks had scored 26 runs in their previous two games, but didn't give Corbin (6-7) any support as he allowed only one run over 6 1/3 innings despite giving up eight hits.  The first two innings I threw a lot of pitches but then I settled down,  Corbin said.  (There were) a lot of ground balls, some that got through, but some that didn't.  Pat Neshek followed Leiter -- whose father was in the stands to see his son's starting debut -- with a scoreless seventh inning, and Hector Neris pitched the ninth in a non-save situation. The Leiters are the 15th father-son combination in major league history to pitch for the same team. The Diamondbacks, coming off a franchise-best 7-1 road trip to Detroit, Philadelphia and Colorado, had a couple of chances early to get to Leiter, only to have the rookie pitch out of trouble. The Phillies played without their hottest hitter of late, second baseman Howie Kendrick, who was scratched with left hamstring tightness less than an hour before game time. Kendrick, out more than a month earlier this season with an oblique injury, doubled as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. NOTES: Phoenix Suns first-round draft pick Josh Jackson and Arizona Cardinals first-round pick Haason Reddick threw out ceremonial first pitches. ... RHP Randall Delgado (1-1) will make a spot start for Arizona on Sunday, in part to give RHP Taijuan Walker some extra rest. ... The D-backs placed RHP J.J. Hoover on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation and brought up RHP Rubby De La Rosa from Triple-A Reno, where he was 0-1 with a 2.35 ERA with 23 strikeouts in 15 1/3 innings. He was 4-5 for Arizona last season while being limited to 13 appearances by right elbow inflammation. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - New York Mets infielder Asdrubal Cabrera said on Friday that he has asked the Mets to trade him after the team recently moved him from shortstop to second base. Cabrera was the team’s starting shortstop when he was put on the disabled list with a sprained left thumb less than two weeks ago, but was unhappy to learn on Friday that he had been moved to second prior to New York’s game against San Francisco.  Personally, I'm not really happy with that move,  Cabrera told reporters prior to the contest.     If they have that plan, they should have told me before I came over here. I just told my agent about it. If they have that plan for me, I think it's time to make a move. So we're going to see what happens in the next couple weeks.  The Mets (32-41) are currently playing Jose Reyes at shortstop while regular second baseman Neil Walker is expected to miss considerable time with a hamstring tear.    The Mets held a closed-door meeting between Cabrera, manager Terry Collins and general manager Sandy Alderson on Friday before deciding to keep the veteran in the lineup.    Cabrera, 31, vowed to give  100 percent  effort despite his grievances. He finished 3-for-6 as New York crushed the Giants 11-4 to snap a four-game losing streak.  We'll get through it,  Collins said.  Right now, everybody needs to look in the mirror and do their jobs, period. He's playing second base tonight. I know he's not happy about it, which I just found out. So we're going to move on.

{"content":"EditorsNote: adding NOTES Royals wipe out four-run deficit in ninth to top Blue Jays KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Whit Merrifield was not thinking he never had a walk-off hit when he dug in at the plate in the ninth. Merrifield delivered his first career walk-off hit with a two-run double as the Kansas City Royals rallied from a four-run deficit to top the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 on Friday night. All four runs in the ninth inning were scored with two outs.  The tying run is on third, just hit the ball hard and if it happens to get in the gap or over the fence, that's a bonus,  Merrifield said of what he was thinking.  In that situation, you're just trying to get that run in from third.  Merrifield doubled with one out in the eighth, but did not score.  I felt like I had good at-bats all night, so it was nice to come through when it mattered,  he said. He was the seventh man to bat in the ninth.  I counted out in my head if it worked out, I was going to get to hit and I had confidence in our guys to get the job done and they did,  Merrifield said.  I had a chance and took advantage of it.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RoyalsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchAlcides Escobar singled home Salvador Perez with the first run of the inning and Alex Gordon singled home Brandon Moss, who had walked, with the second run.  I had him (Moss) 1-2,  Toronto reliever Ryan Tepera said.  Just kept battling and battling. Mixed it up with a fastball and a slider, and he just kept battling and we ended up walking him. That was the key point of the inning really.  Merrifield greeted Jason Grilli with a double to left to score Escobar and Gordon.  I was just hoping Salvy was not going to run out on the field too soon,  Moss said.  Esky scored and Salvy was already on his way out and I said, 'wait, wait, wait. We gotta make sure Gordy gets around, too.' That was a great at-bat by him. He got a pitch and didn't miss it.  The victory moved the Royals (36-36) to .500 for the first time since they were 6-6 on April 16. Joakim Soria (4-2) got the victory and Aaron Loup (2-1) took the loss. Blue Jays left-hander J.A. Happ limited the Royals to four hits and one run in 6 2/3 innings while striking out five and walking none. He left with a 2-1 lead.  The bullpen's been great for us,  Happ said.  This shouldn't be an issue. This was just one of those nights and it didn't go our way, but we're going to have to bounce back.  Troy Tulowitzki doubled home Kendrys Morales with the first Toronto run in the fourth inning and scored on a Jake Junis wild pitch. Toronto added two runs in the ninth with run-producing singles by Josh Donaldson and Justin Smoak. The Royals chased Happ in the seventh, which Lorenzo Cain led off with a double. Eric Hosmer reached on Ryan Goins' fielding error. Perez laced a single to left, scoring Cain with still nobody out. Happ rebounded to retire Mike Moustakas on an infield pop-up and struck out Moss. Danny Barnes was brought in to face Escobar, who flied out to center.  Just getting ahead, getting strike one,  Happ said.  I feel like I've been getting better at that. That helps me control the count a lot better and be able to throw the other pitches off of that. So, that was a plus tonight.   Just trying to stay out of the middle as much as I can and just trying to stick that ball to each side and just use everything. I feel like Russ did a good job back there tonight, kind of being on point with what we wanted to do. And, I feel like it is getting better.  Royals rookie Junis was pulled after 6 1/3 innings, allowing two runs, six hits and two walks while striking out four. The Blue Jays scored two runs on one hit, a hit batter and a wild pitch in the fourth inning. Junis hit Morales with a pitch to start the inning. Tulowitzki doubled to the right-center gap, scoring Morales. Dwight Smith Jr. flied out to deep center to get Tulowitzki to third. After walking Kevin Pillar, Junis uncorked a wild pitch with Goins batting, allowing Tulowitzki to score. Happ retired the first 10 batters he faced before Jorge Bonifacio doubled to left with one out in the fourth, but he was stranded at third base. The only other Kansas City baserunner the first five innings was Moss' opposite-field single with two out in the fifth. Jose Bautista and Russell Martin singled with two outs in the third, but Junis struck out Donaldson to end the inning. NOTES: The Royals designated for assignment RHP Chris Young, who had a 7.50 ERA and was allowing opponents to hit .353. They added RHP Neftali Feliz, who was released by the Brewers after going 1-5 with eight saves and a 6.00 ERA. ...

{"content":"SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) - Who says the old man still can't run? Olympic silver medalist Justin Gatlin stormed to the lead in the final 20 meters and defeated favored youngster Christian Coleman in the 100 meters final at the U.S. nationals/world championships trials on Friday. Gatlin, 35, claimed the victory in 9.95 seconds in his best performance of an injury-plagued season. Coleman, 21, clocked 9.98 for second with another newcomer Chris Belcher, 23, running 10.06 to complete the U.S. team for August's world championships in London.  It was a fighting moment,  Gatlin said.  It wasn't the spectacular times that you have seen me run in the last couple of years but it was a time where I needed to fight.  The victory earned Gatlin a chance to compete against rival and world record holder Usain Bolt one more time. The Jamaican is retiring after the 100 meters at the world championships. Coleman, who has the year's fastest time of 9.82 seconds, said his reaching for the finish line caused him to lose momentum in the side-by-side race with Gatlin, his mentor.  Up until the lean it could have gone either way,  said Coleman, whose reported million dollar sponsorship deal was announced on Friday. He confirmed the contract was for three years but would specify the figure.

Another of America's young sprinters, U.S. indoor champion Ronnie Baker, was eliminated in the semi-finals. Double Olympic medalist Tori Bowie won the women's 100 in 10.94 seconds. She was joined on the team for London by two Oregon collegians, Deajah Stevens and Ariana Washington. World 400 meters champion Allyson Felix, who was running the 100 for speed work, finished last in 11.28. She has a wild card to the 400 for London. World record holder Keni Harrison showed she was fully recovered from a broken hand, running the fastest 100 meters hurdles in the world this season, 12.54 seconds, despite a head wind in a qualifying race.  Twice Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor, who needed only to appear at the championships to collect a wild card spot for the worlds, intentionally fouled on his only attempt. Taylor, who trains in Europe, said he had sought to be excused from competing after delivering the best jump of the year, 18.11 meters, last month in Oregon, but was denied.  It is unfortunate,  said Taylor of not giving a full performance.  Every time I come out to the track I want to put on a show. but this time I have to be smart.

{"content":"Jaso blast lifts Pirates over Cardinals ST. LOUIS -- The majority of a sellout crowd of 47,112 believed that Seung Hwan Oh got John Jaso to swing at a 2-2 breaking ball for the third out of the top of the ninth inning Friday night. Only he didn't. Jaso held up and the pitch was ruled a ball. On the next pitch, Jaso made Oh pay for not putting him away, ripping a tie-breaking homer that gave the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the fifth homer this year for Jaso, who entered the game as part of a double-switch in the eighth inning.  I definitely held up on that swing,  Jaso said.  You don't let the anxiety of two strikes get to your head. He threw everything -- cutters, fastballs, splits.  Oh (1-4) left a changeup over the plate's middle and Jaso drilled it 406 feet to right-center, completing Pittsburgh's comeback from a 3-2 deficit with five outs remaining. The Pirates (34-40) passed St. Louis (33-39) by a percentage point for third place in the National League Central, five games back of first place Milwaukee. Pittsburgh snapped a seven-game losing streak in Busch Stadium, dating back to last July. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CardinalsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch We felt like we were going to win sometime this weekend,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  Might as well get it done tonight.  It appeared that Pittsburgh would taste defeat again under the Gateway Arch when rookie second baseman Paul DeJong rifled a solo homer with one out in the seventh to right-center, giving the Cardinals a one-run lead. But the Pirates spoiled Adam Wainwright's hopes for his eighth win by touching Trevor Rosenthal for the tying run in the eighth. David Freese grounded a two-out RBI single to right, scoring Adam Frazier. Pittsburgh then preserved the tie behind ace reliever Felipe Rivero and right fielder Gregory Polanco's third terrific catch in as many innings. Inserted with runners at the corners and one out in the St. Louis half of the eighth, Rivero (3-1) got Aledmys Diaz to line out to third. Then DeJong lofted the first pitch he saw from Rivero into right-center for a potential go-ahead hit. However, Polanco got a good jump on the ball and made a sliding grab to keep the score equalized.  He's a plus defender,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of Polanco.  He made a couple of nice plays.  Rivero then worked around a leadoff walk to Eric Fryer in the ninth to polish off the victory. While the Pirates played an errorless game, St. Louis' seventh error in three games cost it a run in the fourth. DeJong turned an ordinary chopper from Josh Bell into a two-base throwing error with one out, moving Freese to third. Andrew McCutchen's infield out evened the score at 2. It was the seventh unearned run the Cardinals have allowed as a result of the miscues.  He was trying to make more out of that play than was there,  Matheny said of DeJong.  He had to rush his throw and it caught (first baseman Matt) Carpenter off-guard.  Homers kicked off the scoring in the second inning. Pittsburgh's Josh Bell laced a solo shot down the right-field line, but Jose Martinez countered with a liner that cleared the left-field wall two pitches after Jedd Gyorko drew a leadoff walk. Most of the game was dominated by good starting pitching. Wainwright, who allowed 20 runs in his previous three starts, checked the Pirates on two hits in seven innings. He allowed just one earned run, walking two and whiffing five. Pittsburgh righty Jameson Taillon worked six innings in his third start since returning from the disabled list after undergoing surgery for testicular cancer last month. Taillon allowed four hits and two runs, walking two and fanning seven. He and his teammates got to savor a win, thanks to Jaso's patience and his stroke.  I'm not sure he knew how big the situation was,  Taillon said of Jaso.  He's so mellow. I don't know if he ever feels the pressure.

Fowler is optimistic that he'll be able to return to the lineup Saturday night. ...

{"content":"A's beat White Sox, end 4-game skid behind Davis' HR CHICAGO -- Oakland Athletics pitcher Jharel Cotton told his teammates in the bullpen that he wanted to give them a break and go nine innings. He didn't live up to his end of the bargain, but the A's will certainly live with his performance. Cotton (5-7) threw five shutout innings, scattering three hits in Oakland's 3-0 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night before leaving the game at the start of the sixth inning because of a blister on his right (throwing) thumb.  I was cruising until the fifth and the sixth and then this happened,  Cotton said, pointing to the blister.  It was kind of a bummer that I couldn't at least finish the sixth inning.  Cotton has been dealing with a blister for some time, and A's manager Bob Melvin said  it doesn't seem to be a big issue  and he's hopeful the right-hander makes his next start. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at White SoxOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchThe win snapped a four-game losing streak for the A's (33-42) as Khris Davis listened to Melvin's pregame message of jumping out to an early lead. On the first pitch he saw from Mike Pelfrey in the top of the first, Davis launched his 19th home run of the season, a 429-foot, two-run blast to center field.  (Melvin) told me he wanted to give me a kiss for some reason because we jumped out to an early lead,  Davis said with a laugh.  I think I agree with that, that it was important to jump out and score first. Just keeping an aggressive mindset early on.  Davis went 2-for-3 and also had a walk and stolen base. The early lead gave Cotton some confidence as he notched his first win in a night game this season.  Yeah, I told KD he took coaching very well today,  Melvin said.  Any time he makes the manager look good he gets to play again tomorrow. We needed to get on the board first, the way things had been going on the road for us. And Jharel kind of took that and ran with it, and obviously when he had to come out we had some rested guys in the bullpen today and they did a good job after it.  Matt Joyce also hit a home run for the A's, blasting a solo shot to right-center field in the fourth inning against Pelfrey (3-6), who dropped to 0-5 in his career against Oakland. He threw 106 pitches in only 4 2/3 innings.  For six or seven lefties, I did a terrible job of commanding the inside of the plate with the fastball,  said Pelfrey, who was 3-1 in his previous six starts coming in.  (I was) probably fortunate to get out of it with three runs like I did.  Melvin said that Oakland's bullpen was  terrific  in throwing four shutout innings. Closer Santiago Casilla made it interesting in the ninth, though, allowing the tying run to come to the plate, but Matt Davidson flied out to deep center field to end the game.  They did a great job from Liam (Hendriks) coming in and finishing my inning for me to (Sean) Doolittle coming in and throwing up zeros and especially (Ryan) Madson, a guy I talk to a lot, and of course Casilla, just closing the game out for us and giving us the first 'W' of the road series, which is pretty good,  Cotton said. Davidson had two hits for the White Sox (32-40), who have lost four of five. White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson and manager Rick Renteria were ejected by home plate umpire Jim Wolf in the bottom of the fifth inning. Anderson was tagged out by A's catcher Bruce Maxwell on a tapper that he thought was foul. Renteria came out to argue Anderson's ejection and he was tossed for the third time this season and second time in a week.  It happened kind of quick,  Renteria said.  I started walking out and I was too late obviously. But I mean things like that happen. In the heat of the battle, your emotions are flying high so it happens.  NOTES: Oakland SS Chad Pinder left the game after the fifth inning with a strained left hamstring. Manager Bob Melvin said it  could be a little bit. ... Usually those things aren't one day. . ... White Sox starter Mike Pelfrey had not given up a home run since May 26 -- he had gone five appearances and 21 innings without allowing a long ball. ... Khris Davis' home run for Oakland was only his third in June after hitting 10 in April and six in May, but he is hitting .294 in the month compared with a .186 average in May. ...

{"content":"Phillips homers early, Braves hold on to defeat Brewers ATLANTA -- It was a veteran who provided much of the offense, but it was a pair of rookies that came up with the decisive defensive plays for the Atlanta Braves on Friday. Brandon Phillips had a home run and a double, while fielding gems by third baseman Johan Camargo and shortstop Dansby Swanson were instrumental in helping the Braves survive a near-bullpen meltdown to hang on for a 5-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night at SunTrust Park. Atlanta has won six of its last seven games.  The game came down to they made some defensive plays, some excellent defensive plays at the end of the game,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. Phillips was 2-for-5, scored twice and drove in a pair of runs to pace the Atlanta attack. The second baseman showed no signs of the groin issue that caused him to leave Thursday night's game early. But it was Atlanta's defense in the late innings that saved the day. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at BravesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta appeared to be in control with a 5-1 lead after six innings when the Brewers' bats took advantage of some shaky relief work. Milwaukee scored a run against Sam Freeman in the seventh on Domingo Santana's RBI single. The Brewers scored twice in the eighth on a sharp two-run double by Orlando Arcia. After Lewis Brinson was hit by a pitch to put runners at first and second, the Braves escaped disaster when pinch hitter Jesus Aguilar ripped a grounder to third base that Camargo was able to backhand and turn into a double play. Arodys Vizcaino pitched the ninth inning for the Braves and earned his first save, but it didn't come without drama. Eric Thames led off with a double, but was retired at third when he tried to advance on Santana's ground ball. The hard-hit grounder was fielded by Swanson, who turned and threw accurately to get the sliding Thames.  That play Dansby made - I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like that,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  That ball's up the middle and you go to third base. To have the guts to make that play is the biggest thing to me. The conviction -- there wasn't any hesitation.  Swanson said:  It kind of went through my head before happened, really. It's just kind of crazy how you can process something before it happens and when it does happen, it just kind of becomes a reaction.  Vizcaino retired Travis Shaw on a fly ball to the warning track, which allowed Santana to move to second base. The game ended when Swanson dove to catch Manny Pina's line drive.  The ball Aguilar hit was a great double play and the ball that Domingo hit, that's a really nice play,  Counsell said.  Most shortstops are throwing that ball to first base.  Winning pitcher Mike Foltynewicz (5-5) suffered from a high pitch count and lasted only five innings. The right-hander allowed one run on four hits and three walks, with nine strikeouts. It is the fourth time in his last five starts that Foltynewicz has allowed two or fewer runs. Losing pitcher Jimmy Nelson (5-4) worked five innings and allowed four runs on six hits and three walks. He struck out eight. It was Nelson's first loss since May 23. The Braves scored twice in the first inning. Phillips hit the first pitch he saw from Nelson into the first row of seats in the left-field stands for his sixth home run. Nick Markakis walked, went to third on Matt Adams' single and scored on a ground ball. Tyler Flowers hit a double-play ball to second, which Eric Sogard flipped to second, only to have shortstop Orlando Arcia drop the exchange, which allowed the run to score. The Brewers made it 2-1 in the fourth when Keon Broxton hit a solo home run, his 12th, to straightaway center field. Rain began to fall, heavy at times, during the fifth inning, but the Braves were able to score two more times. Phillips doubled home a run and scored when Flowers drove an opposite-field single to right. NOTES: Atlanta 1B Freddie Freeman, on the disabled list since May 18 with a fractured left wrist, said Friday his goal is to return to the team for the four-game series against Washington the weekend prior to the All-Star Game. ... Atlanta RHP Bartolo Colon will pitch a bullpen session on Saturday and be re-assessed. The veteran was placed on the disabled list on June 6 with an oblique strain and had his stay extended when he complained of a sore back. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - Brazil's top federal prosecutor will level corruption charges against President Michel Temer one at a time instead of making all the accusations at once, a strategy aimed at weakening his defense, a source with direct knowledge of the process told Reuters on Friday. Under Brazilian law, any criminal charges against a sitting president must be approved by two-thirds of the lower house of Congress in order for the Supreme Court to put a leader on trial. Top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot is expected to charge Temer with receiving bribes early next week. The president is also facing accusations of racketeering and obstruction of justice.  Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of all accusations. The investigation is hampering the president's ability to push his economic reforms through Congress.  Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters this week, on condition of anonymity so they could speak freely, that they will set aside work on those proposed labor law reforms if forced to vote on criminal charges against Temer.  They also said they will not even consider advancing work on pension reforms until changes to the labor law are passed. Temer is being investigated in connection with a political graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker. Company executives said in plea-bargain testimony that the president took nearly $5 million in bribes in return for help resolving tax matters, for freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters.  Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, also made a recording of a conversation he had with Temer earlier this year. In it the president appears to condone paying off a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Lawyers defending Temer were trying to dismiss the use of the recording in the investigation, saying it was manipulated. But police said on Friday after finishing an analysis of the audio files and the equipment used by Joesley Batista to record the president that they were valid. Lawmakers in Temer's alliance say they have the one-third of lower-house votes required to block any charges against Temer. Out of 513 deputies, leaders in the alliance said this week they have between 250 and 300 votes.   But they also told Reuters they widely expected Janot to use the strategy of dragging out the charges against Temer in an effort to wear down lawmakers with multiple votes.  Those ballots will be deeply unpopular with Brazilian voters who overwhelmingly believe Temer is corrupt, according to opinion polls. It also gives more time for possible new corruption revelations to surface against Temer, said another key lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity, potentially eroding his support in the house.

{"content":"Mejia shaky but claims win for Twins over Indians CLEVELAND -- It wasn't the prettiest five innings of work, but Minnesota Twins manager Paul Molitor will take it. Ten of the first 19 batters that Twins starter Adalberto Mejia faced reached base, but none of them scored.  There were some stressful innings, but he got through them somehow,  Molitor said. Jorge Polanco homered and Brian Dozier had three hits and two RBIs in support of Mejia as the Twins topped the Cleveland Indians 5-0 on Friday night at Progressive Field. Mejia (2-3) threw 104 pitches in five scoreless innings, allowing two hits with four strikeouts and five walks. Four of the five walks came in the first two innings, but Mejia managed to navigate his way through without giving up any runs. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at IndiansMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch His stuff was good, but sometimes he tries to get cute with his stuff,  Molitor said.  He had a lot of 3-2 counts, but he got big outs and five zeroes.  Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer (6-6) pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up five runs (four earned) and eight hits with four strikeouts and one walk. Mejia and relievers Tyler Duffey, Taylor Rogers and Trevor Hildenberger combined on a four-hitter. It was Mejia's second consecutive start against Cleveland. In his last start against the Indians on June 17 in Minnesota, Mejia was the losing pitcher in a 6-2 Cleveland win. In that game, Mejia pitched 4 2/3 innings, giving up two runs.  This time I tried to prepare and had a better game plan,  Mejia said. Leading 4-0, the Twins added an insurance run in the seventh inning. With two outs and nobody on, Byron Buxton reached on a bunt single and went to second when Bauer threw wildly to first on the play. Dozier followed with a single to right field, giving Minnesota a 5-0 lead and knocking Bauer out of the game. It was Bauer's fourth start against Minnesota this year. In his first three, he was 3-0 with a 3.26 ERA. Bauer retired the side in order in the first inning, two on strikeouts. But the Twins sent eight men to the plate in the second inning, and half of them scored. Max Kepler led off the inning by bouncing a double off the right field wall. Kepler went to third on a flyout to deep right by Eduardo Escobar. Eddie Rosario followed with a single to right field, scoring Kepler with the first run of the game. Polanco worked the count to 3-2, then pounded a pitch over the right field wall for his third home run, pushing the lead to 3-0.  Jorge fouled off some tough fastballs, then took advantage of a fastball Bauer left over the plate,  Molitor said of the home run. Jason Castro drew a walk and Buxton blasted a line drive that was caught in left field by Daniel Robertson for the second out. But Dozier doubled over the head of center fielder Austin Jackson, scoring Castro to make it 4-0.  He threw too many pitches that were catching too much of the plate. Most of them were fastballs,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Bauer. In the fourth inning, the Indians loaded the bases with one out. Erik Gonzalez struck out with the bases loaded for the second time in three innings, and Francisco Lindor lined out to end the inning without a run being scored.  It seemed like we had baserunners in every inning the first five innings and good chances.

{"content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Open has traditionally had a reputation as the toughest test in golf, but benign conditions have turned this week’s championship into a birdie-fest, much to the lament of former champion Johnny Miller. Justin Thomas on Saturday became the fifth player to post a 63 in a U.S. Open, joining Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Weiskopf and Vijay Singh but Thomas is the only one to do it on a par-72 course. Miller, though impressed by Thomas, was not exactly in awe.  Taking nothing away from nine under par, nine under is incredible with U.S. Open pressure,  Miller told GolfChannel.com.  But it isn't a U.S. Open course that I’m familiar with the way it was set up.  It looks like a PGA Tour event course setup. I’m not sure where the days of the 24-to-29-yard-wide fairways that we played every time went. It’s interesting to see where the USGA has gone with the U.S. Open, being a little more friendly than in years’ past.  The course wasn’t designed to be soft, and if it was going to be soft, it should have been 26-or-27-yard-wide fairways. That’s what made it easy. The guys weren’t afraid to bomb it. It was never that way in the U.S. Open. It was always about really tight fairways and having to be a great driver. This went totally against the tradition of the U.S. Open.” In defence of the U.S. Golf Association, the wide-open course was designed and set up to be played in strong winds and with firm and fast fairways and greens. But the weather this week has not co-operated with ample rain and only light breezes leaving the layout at the mercy of the world’s best players. Miller shot his eight-under 63 in the final round en route to victory in the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, and he will be more impressed if Thomas, or anyone else in contention, can put together a 63 on Sunday.  For one, the greatness of my round is the 63 in the last round of the U.S. Open to win by one,  said Miller, now an analyst for the American TV network NBC. “Everything else is way secondary. If somebody does it tomorrow to win the U.S. Open by one, that’s the specialness of my round. And secondly, Erin Hills isn’t exactly Oakmont.” Another 63 is perhaps unlikely, because the breeze is finally predicted to pick up on Sunday, perhaps offering a stern test, though the course will probably remain fairly soft. Brian Harman, at 12-under 204, takes a one-shot over fellow Americans Thomas and Brooks Koepka and Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, with Rickie Fowler two back. Harman and Thomas will tee off in the final pairing at 2:54 p.m. Central (1954 GMT).  There will be an 18-hole playoff on Monday if the leaders are tied after 72 holes.

News, citing multiple unidentified sources, reported the birth and that Jay Z and Blue Ivy were seen at a Los Angeles area hospital on Thursday. Us Weekly, also citing multiple unidentified sources, reported that the couple welcomed twins earlier this week.  Bey and Jay are thrilled and have started sharing the news with their family and closest friends,  one unidentified source told PEOPLE. Reuters could not verify the reports. A representative for Beyonce did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The celebrity news websites did not provide additional details, such as the date and time the twins were born or the sex of the infants. The  Lemonade  singer, one of the most powerful women in the music business, announced the pregnancy on her Instagram account in February along with an image of her posed in lingerie and caressing a noticeable baby bump. The announcement got more than 8 million  likes  in the first 24 hours to become the  most-liked  Instagram ever. The R&B; singer performed live at the Grammy awards in Los Angeles two weeks later, proudly displaying her swelling belly in a motherhood-themed show. She has since posted numerous pictures of her bare baby bump on her social media accounts. (Reporting by Jill Serjeant in LOS ANGELES; Writing by Eric M.

{"content":"ERIN, Wisconsin (Reuters) - England's Tommy Fleetwood has been putting beautifully at the U.S. Open and needs to extend his surprising roll at the championship one more day to change his life forever. Bolstered by a delicate, bogey-saving chip shot at the 18th green, Fleetwood posted a four-under-par 68 on Saturday to stand 11 under par, just one stroke back of American lefthander Brian Harman heading into Sunday's final round at Erin Hills. Winning the U.S. Open is something he has thought about many times, the 26-year-old from Southport said.  Well, it would change my life, I know that,  Fleetwood told reporters.  I've pictured winning the U.S. Open a lot of times before.  Doing it all night is not going to help and not make any difference. It's just concentrate on each day.  Fleetwood said he must stay in the zone he has enjoyed all week in the rolling Wisconsin countryside.  I don't think I could play any different or score any better than I have done,  said Fleetwood, who won his second European Tour title earlier this season at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship.

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports This is my first time in contention in a major, so whatever happens I'll be doing my best and seeing how well I can finish. It will be a pleasure to go out on a Sunday trying to win a major.  Fleetwood, who tied for 27th in his only previous U.S. Open in 2015, has moved the ball smoothly through the long, links-style layout, illustrated by his average of just 1.54 putts per hole, tied for fifth-best in the tournament. For all his good work, the Englishman needed a perfect pitch shot to save his round. Slideshow (4 Images)Fleetwood's second shot on the par-five 18th finished just 47 yards from the pin. But his chip landed short of the green on a ridge, leaving him a nearly impossible putt to hold the green. The putt ran past the hole and settled at the bottom of a collection area 70 feet away. He floated a wedge shot to three feet to escape with his only bogey of the round. “It was a good save,” Fleetwood said. “It was a good bogey.  That was the best shot I hit all day.

{"content":"Nationals get key out on Cespedes in 7-4 win NEW YORK -- If the Washington Nationals end up cruising to the National League East title while leaving the New York Mets flailing for a lifeline in the wild-card derby, both teams may look back on Friday and Saturday's victories by the Nationals as symbols of a division race that never fully developed. But Nationals manager Dusty Baker would still prefer to find a less dramatic way to win. A Nationals pitcher got the best of Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes in a key spot for the second straight game Saturday, when left-hander Enny Romero induced Cespedes to hit into the double play that produced the final two outs of Washington's 7-4 win at Citi Field. On Friday night, Cespedes stepped to the plate with two outs in the eighth and the Mets down 4-1 against Nationals ace right-hander Max Scherzer, who whiffed Cespedes to cap an 11-pitch battle. Washington went on to win, 7-2. As far as Baker is concerned, he'd rather not try to go 3-for-3 in Sunday's series finale.  You're flirting with a rattlesnake,  Baker said of Cespedes.  You're going to get bitten. So I'd rather not flirt with him.  Cespedes, who is 11-for-24 since coming off the disabled list June 10, bit the Nationals all day Saturday. He singled in his first three at-bats before launching a solo homer off Joe Blanton into the second deck in left field in the eighth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MetsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchRomero had already wriggled out of a jam in the eighth when he recorded the final two outs and whiffed potential go-ahead run Rene Rivera to strand two runners and thrown 30 pitches when Cespedes stepped to the plate following Michael Conforto's bloop single. But Baker said taking his chances with the southpaw against the right-handed hitting slugger was the best option available to him. The Mets alternate lefties with righties beginning with Conforto -- Jay Bruce was on deck when Cespedes batted -- and Baker said the last lefty in his pen, Oliver Perez, was unavailable Saturday.  We were hoping that Enny kept the ball down,  Baker said.  When you've got great hitters like Cespedes, boy, you hope that he hits it at somebody. Because you know he rises to the occasion.  Romero, throwing sinkers, fell behind Cespedes 2-0 before Cespedes pulled the next pitch to third base, where Anthony Rendon began the 5-4-3 double play to close out Romero's second save.  There's always a time of decision,  Baker said.  And fortunately for us, Enny did his job today.  Romero's escape acts capped an afternoon in which the beleaguered Nationals bullpen -- it entered the day with a 5.17 ERA -- walked the tightrope against the Mets who had the tying or go-ahead run step to the plate in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings. But despite allowing six hits, Romero and four other relievers combined to limit the Mets to two runs in relief of Stephen Strasburg (8-2). The right-hander allowed two runs, six hits and two walks while striking out five in 5 1/3 innings.  Our bullpen did a great job,  Baker said.  They got 11 outs - that's a lot of outs.  Trea Turner homered on the second pitch of the game for the Nationals (42-26), who have not trailed in winning the first three games of the four-game series. Washington is now 11 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Mets (30-37).  This isn't football, so we don't do pep talks every night,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  The one thing I try to tell these guys every day -- I had a talk with two of the veteran guys yesterday -- is they can't get down about the situation.  Lobaton homered in the second inning and scored on an error in the fourth. Daniel Murphy finished 2-for-4 with an RBI double and scored on Adam Lind's two-run homer into the upper deck in the eighth. Turner singled in the ninth and scored on a double by Rendon (2-for-4).  Having back-end (bullpen) guys do well, having our starters do phenomenal, I think it's just a whole team effort,  Lind said. Wilmer Flores hit into a run-scoring double play in the fourth and lofted a sacrifice fly in the sixth for the Mets, who received an RBI single from Jose Reyes in the eighth. Cespedes scored three runs while Bruce (three singles) and Reyes (two singles) each had multiple hits. Right-hander Seth Lugo (1-1) took the loss after giving up four runs (three earned), seven hits and two walks while striking out five in 6 2/3 innings.  You've got to focus every pitch and a couple pitches got me today,  Lugo said.  That happens.

{"content":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday said Twitter was an  expression of fascism  after accounts linked to his government were suspended, accusing the U.S. company of persecuting his followers. One of the Twitter accounts suspended belonged to Radio Miraflores, a station set up by Maduro that broadcasts from the presidential palace, including a salsa music program the president hosts.   Twitter in Venezuela today deactivated thousands of people's accounts,  Maduro said at televised rally.  Simply for being 'Chavistas,'  he said, using the term for followers of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Chavez was a pioneer among politicians in the use of Twitter, gathering millions of followers and frequently announcing news on the platform. Even today, Chavez's 4 million followers beat Maduro's 3 million.  Maduro encouraged a pro-government journalist to publish photos of the head of Twitter in Venezuela, to show people  who was responsible for the manipulation.  It was not immediately clear if Twitter has employees in Venezuela. Media contacts listed on Twitter's corporate website did not return email requests for comment. The company does not list Caracas among the cities where it has international offices.  It was not clear why the accounts were suspended, or how many had been affected. Earlier, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said 180 accounts were hit.  Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (C) attends a meeting with supporters in Caracas, Venezuela June 17, 2017.

Twitter's guidelines say accounts can be suspended for abusive behavior, security or spam, among other reasons. Despite the strong words, Maduro encouraged his supporters to keep using the service as a way of countering online the opposition, which has taken to the streets over the past two months to demand elections, protest restrictions and complain about crippling food and medicine shortages.

The battle on social media is very important.     On Saturday, hundreds of opposition activists held prayer services in Caracas and other cities to oppose Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution, while the government held rallies in several regions to support the initiative.  The protesters have kept the pressure on the government, with clashes with security forces killing at least 72 people since April.  Maduro threatened opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles on Saturday, saying he would sooner or later  face justice  for deaths in an earlier round of protests.  In April, authorities banned Capriles, who narrowly lost the presidential election in 2013, from holding political office for 15 years, a key factor fuelling the protests.

{"content":"Late surge sends Diamondbacks past reeling Phillies PHILADELPHIA -- Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo didn't bite when given the chance to get into a war of words with fellow National League West rival manager Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Roberts called the Dodgers the best team in the division.  If he believes that, he needs to say what he feels,  Lovullo said.  More power to him.  Lovullo seems fine with letting his team's play do the talking. The Diamondbacks scored four times in the seventh inning and received a strong outing from Zack Godley to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 on Saturday evening. Arizona (43-26) has won six straight while the Phillies (22-45) sustained their 10th loss in 11 games. The Diamondbacks have the same record as the Dodgers, but both are a game behind Colorado for first place in the NL West.  It's a good feeling,  Lovullo said.  They deserve it and should enjoy it.  With the score tied at 1, the Diamondbacks took advantage of Philadelphia's lack of middle relief strength to tilt the contest in the seventh. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at PhilliesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchPitcher Jorge De La Rosa, who relieved Godley in the bottom of the sixth, attempted a sacrifice bunt with none out and a runner on first. Catcher Andrew Knapp made a poor choice trying to cut down the runner at second base and the Phillies came away without an out on the play. That opened the door for Daniel Descalso, who knocked an RBI single through the hole on the right side after battling in a seven-pitch at-bat. The crushing blow came two batters later, when Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt got a first-pitch hanging curveball from Casey Fien -- the second pitcher the Phillies used in the inning -- and split the gap in left-center field for a two-run double. The Diamondbacks made it 5-1 on a Brandon Drury single.  We've won some games where we haven't played our absolute best and won some close games,  Goldschmidt said.  If you're going to win some games, you have to win them like that sometimes.  De La Rosa (3-1) was credited with the win after facing just one batter. Edubray Ramos (0-4) took the loss after allowing three runs on two hits without retiring a batter. Godley posted a career-high eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings. He allowed one run on five hits and walked three.  What more could you ask? I know he gave up one run,  Lovullo said.  We kind of clipped him a little bit short and didn't let him finish that final inning, but it was time to hand it off to the bullpen, and make sure we did things to win the game. But once again, Zack was outstanding.  Phillies starter Jerad Eickhoff also surrendered one run. He labored early and settled down in his later innings, pitching six total. He allowed five hits, walked three and struck out a pair.  He had better command of his fastball and he threw really good curveballs,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He just located. That's a pretty good hitting team and to hold them to one run is pretty good.  It wasn't quite good enough. Arizona, which opened the scoring on a Jake Lamb RBI single in the third inning, had a chance to add on to its lead in the sixth. With runners on second and third and one out, catcher Chris Iannetta drove an Eickhoff slider to left field. Aaron Altherr camped under it in left and delivered a strike to cut down Lamb at home and keep the Arizona lead at 1-0. The Phillies tied it in the bottom of the inning on Knapp's sacrifice fly. Philadelphia had two runners in scoring position with two outs in the third, fourth and seventh innings, but failed to come away with runs. Michael Saunders, with the bases loaded, had a line drive snared by Goldschmidt to end the seventh.  It could have changed the whole game,  Mackanin said. After starting the season 11-9, the Phillies have lost 36 of 47. The game started 50 minutes late because of rain.

{"content":"Braves cap rally with walk-off win over Marlins ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves rallied from four down against the Miami Marlins to force extra innings with a tying run in the ninth, then celebrated their fourth walk-off victory of the season in the 10th as Brandon Phillips played hero. Phillips singled to center field off Marlins closer A.J. Ramos to score Johan Camargo, who had led off with a single and moved up on a sacrifice bunt, to give the Braves an 8-7 victory on Saturday.  Any time you win, it feels good,  said Phillips, who grew up in Atlanta but had spent his long career in Cincinnati until this season.  For myself, my first walk-off as a Brave, it really means a lot, playing in front of my family and friends.  It was Phillips' third hit of the game and the seventh game-ending hit of his career.  I have a feeling he knew (the pitch) was coming and I don't care, because if I execute he doesn't do anything with it,  Ramos said. The two-seamer, though, was down the middle, just like Ramos (1-3) had missed location on a slider to Phillips an inning earlier. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BravesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta sent the game to extra innings as Nick Markakis followed a leadoff double by Phillips in the ninth with an RBI double off the first base bag.  This is going to happen from time to time,  Ramos said.  You don't want it to, but sometimes you have a bad game. The bullpen has been solid until today.  Phillips, Markakis and Matt Adams all had three hits. Adams drove in four runs on a homer and two doubles.  It just shows our grind as a team,  Phillips said.  We're never out of any game.  Adams has 17 extra-base hits among his 32 hits since joining Atlanta on May 21 in a trade from St. Louis after first baseman Freddie Freeman broke his wrist. Nine of Adams' 10 homers have come as a Brave.  It's fun to be a part of, just seeing how guys grind out at-bats,  Adams said.  We're just a group of guys going out there, having fun and playing the game.  Tyler Flowers homered as well for the Braves, who had scored just three runs while losing their previous four home games. Arodys Vizcaino (3-2) pitched the top of the 10th for the Braves. He worked around a two-out single to JT Riddle and a wild pitch. Adams staked the Braves to a 3-0 lead with an RBI double in the first inning and a two-run homer in the third, but the Marlins scored five runs in the fifth against Jaime Garcia after the Atlanta starter had faced one batter over the minimum the first four innings. Tyler Moore plated the first two runs with his sixth homer. A balk and wild pitch preceded a tying RBI pinch single by Ichiro Suzuki, batting for Marlins starter Jeff Locke. Christian Yelich followed an intentional walk to Giancarlo Stanton with a two-out, two-run double. Reliever Ian Krol allowed RBI singles to Justin Bour and Dee Gordon in the sixth after replacing Garcia, who was charged with six runs in 5 2/3 innings after recording a 1.49 ERA in his previous five starts. The Braves cut into the Marlins' lead in the sixth against reliever Brad Ziegler. Flowers hit his fifth homer leading off the inning and Camargo delivered a RBI single. Flowers' drive was misjudged by Yelich in center field with two outs in the seventh and the Braves made it a one-run game as Adams followed with his second RBI double. Ramos also had a chance to trap Camargo off second base in the 10th on a comebacker, but made a bad throw.  We got to turn the page and not let this snowball,  Gordon said.  We've been playing good baseball. We have to have a (short) memory. This was just a little punch in the chest.

{"content":"Padres go deep twice in 11th to sink Brewers 7-5 MILWAUKEE -- For the second straight game, the San Diego Padres and Milwaukee Brewers took turns rocketing baseballs out of Miller Park. And for the second straight day, they needed extra innings to decide on a winner. This time, though, it was the Padres who prevailed as Corey Spangenberg and Chase d'Arnaud hit solo home runs in the 11th inning to lead San Diego to a 7-5 victory. The Padres hit five home runs, accounting for six of their seven runs. Yangervis Solarte hit a pair, giving him three in his last two games and four in his last five. He tagged Chase Anderson for a solo shot in the second inning that gave San Diego a 1-0 lead and struck again in the 10th with a two-run blast off Carlos Torres that put the Padres up 5-3. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at BrewersSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch Our guys fought all day,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  You look up, you get down three to one. You battle back late. You tie the game against a very a good bullpen. You take some good swings in extra innings too.  The Brewers hit three of their own, including an inside-the-park homer by Orlando Arcia that put Milwaukee on the board in the third. Eric Thames followed with a two-run homer later in the inning, giving him a blast in four straight games as well as putting Milwaukee up 3-1. But Dinelson Lamet clamped down after that, facing just one over the minimum over his final three innings after Thames' home run and finished with a career-high 12 strikeouts.  For (Lamet) that is the best stuff I've seen,  Green said. Brewers starter Chase Anderson was locked in, too, but gave up an RBI double to Hunter Renfroe in the fourth then served up a solo home run to Myers in the sixth that tied it 3-3.  It was a good outing,  Counsell said.  The first homer that Solarte hit I thought was a pretty good pitch. It was a changeup down and away from him. The second one, Myers got 3-0 and Chase got the middle of the plate. He pitched well. He pitched very, very well again. He's on quite a run right now.  That left things up to the bullpens. San Diego held Milwaukee scoreless over the seventh, eighth and ninth innings, allowing one base runner while the Brewers' relief corps stranded the go-ahead run in scoring position in the eighth and ninth. Carlos Torres retired his first two batters in the 10th before walking Myers. Solarte followed with his second home run of the game, putting the Padres ahead.  It didn't sound like it hit anywhere close to his barrel,  Torres said.  Today, all you had to do, apparently, was hit it in the air. The last two days, maybe every run scored was on the home run. Except one? That's unbelievable. We have to keep the ball down, that's what it is. I'm assuming that the ball was probably elevated. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe if I throw it down it's a ground ball like the one before. I don't know.  The Brewers responded when Jose Torres plunked Nick Franklin to open the bottom of the 10th and Keon Broxton tied it with a blast to center field, homering for the third straight game. Jose Torres got out of the inning without further damage and Spangenberg broke the tie on Oliver Drake's first offering of the 11th, with d'Arnaud following two batters later. Torres came back out for the 11th but was replaced after retiring lefty Travis Shaw, and Phil Maton retired the final two batters of this first career save.  It feels awesome,  Maton said.  Such an up and down game it is awesome to finally walk away with a 'W' there.

{"content":"Healy, Joyce power Athletics past Yankees OAKLAND, Calif. -- You couldn't blame Ryon Healy if he wishes June would never end. Healy recorded his third career multi-homer game -- all coming this month -- and powered the Oakland Athletics to a 5-2 victory against the New York Yankees on Saturday afternoon at the Oakland Coliseum. Healy hit solo homers in the second and fourth innings into the left-center field seats off Yankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka. Healy hit two homers against the Washington Nationals on June 3 and two against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 5 in Oakland.  Trusting the process,  Healy said.  It's a day-to-day grind. There's been a lot of days this season where I feel terrible in the cage and I just have to go out and clear my mind and just battle, compete in the box. Really emphasize getting a good pitch to hit and putting my best swing on it.  And yes, Healy had one of those terrible days in the cage Saturday before going 3-for-4. Healy has eight home runs in 16 games this month. He has 17 home runs for the season and is tied for the team lead with Yonder Alonso and Khris Davis. After hitting three home runs in his first 27 games, he has 14 in his past 40. Healy had 13 home runs in 72 contests last year as a rookie and has 130 career blasts in 139 professional games. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AthleticsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch He went through a considerable struggle at one point in time this year, too, and made the adjustment,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  That's what the really good hitters do, especially when they're young. He's a premier guy.  Matt Joyce led off the first inning with a home run and went 3-for-3 with a double, two walks and two runs scored for the A's. Rookie Matt Chapman went 2-for-4 with a double and a run scored in his third career major league game. He had his first two-hit game and first extra-base hit in the big leagues. The Yankees extended their season-long losing streak to five games.  It's not what you want,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  It's frustrating. But it's a long year. We'll get it turned around and we'll get hot again.  A's right-hander Jesse Hahn (3-4) struggled with his command but improved to 2-0 in three starts since returning from the disabled list with a strained right triceps. Hahn gave up two runs on three hits over five innings with six strikeouts and three walks. Tanaka (5-7) struck out 10 and walked one, but gave up five runs on eight hits, including three home runs, over four innings. He has allowed 21 homers in 76 2/3 innings this season.  The three home runs, that's unacceptable,  Tanaka said through an interpreter.  The two to Healy, I just wasn't able to execute my pitches. It just went into that spot where he likes it the most.  Joyce hit his fifth career leadoff home run, sending Tanaka's first-pitch fastball into the right field seats to give Oakland a 1-0 lead. Joyce's leadoff homer was his first since Sept. 24, 2013, against New York at Yankee Stadium off Hiroki Kuroda. The Yankees scored twice in the second to take a 2-1 lead, bunching singles by Ronald Torreyes, Mason Williams and Austin Romine. But with one out in the second, Healy launched Tanaka's 2-2 splitter into the seats as the A's pulled even. Then in the fourth, Healy led off with a 428-blast, giving Oakland a 3-2 lead. This time, he crushed Tanaka's 3-2 slider.  I still think it's getting there,  Healy said of his swing.  I'm not satisfied with the consistency of it. There's things that I'm still not doing well enough on a day-to-day basis.  The A's scored two more runs in the fourth. Chapman lined a single to left, moved to third on Joyce's single and scored on Adam Rosales' single to right. Jed Lowrie brought Joyce home with an infield single, making it 5-2. Liam Hendriks, Josh Smith, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle combined to blank the Yankees on two hits over the final four innings. Doolittle pitched the ninth for his second save, striking out three. Didi Gregorius went 0-for-4, ending his career-long, 17-game hitting streak, which was the longest active streak in the majors. NOTES: A's RHP Santiago Casilla was hit in the left shoulder by a foul ball during the game and had X-rays, which were negative.  He's OK,' A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He's a tough guy, but that was pretty scary for a minute because it came in there pretty good.  ... Yankees DH Matt Holliday was a late scratch because of an allergic reaction to something he ate, Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ... Yankees C Gary Sanchez (strained groin) was out of the starting lineup for the second straight game but pinch hit in the ninth inning. ... Yankees CF Aaron Hicks missed his second straight game and remained day-to-day. ... The A's selected RHP Michael Brady from Triple-A Nashville and optioned RHP Zach Neal to the Sounds.

{"content":"Napoli belts two homers as Rangers rout Mariners ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Texas Rangers finally have the offensive lineup they thought they'd have when the season started -- and it's paying dividends. Texas hit four homers Saturday and moved over the .500 mark for the first time since May 24 by pounding Seattle 10-4. It marked the second consecutive game for Texas to reach double figures, a first for the season. The Rangers have scored double figures in runs in consecutive games just twice since the start of the 2016 season. The Rangers have now won seven of their last eight games while Seattle fell to 2-4 on their road trip. Texas set the tone in the first by scoring five times with two outs off Yovani Gallardo (3-7), thanks to five straight hits. After Seattle cut the lead to 5-4, the Rangers blew the game open with three homers in the bottom of the sixth.  For the first time in the whole season, for two games straight, we have the nine guys that are supposed to be there,  said outfielder Carlos Gomez, who had a two-run single in the first inning.  We believe this is one of the best lineups in the league. We're going to come up with runs.  Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at RangersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchDesignated hitter Mike Napoli had two of the homers, both two-run shots. His first completed the five-run first inning. His second capped the sixth inning, which also included a solo homer from Rougned Odor and a two-run homer from Shin-Soo Choo. Texas recorded the back-to-back big games since Napoli and Gomez came off the disabled list Friday. On Saturday, the Rangers combined for three hits, six RBIs and four runs scored.  To be able to insert Gomez and Nap and have them come back and have them do what they did is crucial for us going forward,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  We need that lineup to be lengthened out.  Odor started the scoring in the first with an RBI double and Gomez followed with a two-run single. Napoli then hit his first homer of the game. Seattle got back in the game with a run in the third off Martin Perez (3-6) and then three runs in the sixth. Mike Zunino's three-run homer cut the Texas lead to 5-4. Texas blew the game open the bottom of the frame, scoring five times off Dan Altavilla. Odor homered to open the inning, Napoli hit his second blast two batters later and Choo added another two-run homer to extend the lead to 10-4. That big bottom of the sixth ended any Seattle momentum from the top of the frame.  Zunino gets the big hit to get us back into the game,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  At that point, felt good about going to Danny Altavilla. Been out four or five days. Got some balls up, and you can't do that with this club. It's disappointing when you battle your way back into that game.  Martin Perez picked up his first win since May 18 as he allowed four runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out five and walked two. Gallardo lasted just five innings, giving up five runs on six hits. He allowed just one hit after the first inning.  It's always the one inning,  Gallardo said.  I've got to find a way to put guys away after two strikes. It's frustrating. I made some pretty good pitches. The one to (Nomar) Mazara, a fastball up and in, he puts it down the third-base line for a base hit. Then the same to (Adrian) Beltre. He just kind of flicks his bat out there. I made a couple of mistakes throwing to Odor. I tried to throw a cutter up and in, and it stayed out over the middle of the plate. Then the one to Napoli was up in the zone.  Texas had 10 hits, with Napoli, Odor, Choo and Mazara each collecting two. Gomez, Odor and Choo each had two RBIs. Guillermo Heredia went 2-for-4 with a run scored for Seattle and Mitch Haniger also had two hits. Taylor Motter brought in Seattle's first run with an RBI double in the third inning. NOTES: The Rangers put RHP Andrew Cashner on the 10-day disabled list with a strained left oblique. The club purchased the contract of RHP Ernesto Frieri to take Cashner's roster spot. ... Texas INF Hanser Alberto will have arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Monday. He's been on the disabled list all season because of the shoulder. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - A retrial of Bill Cosby on sexual assault charges will likely offer major advantages to the defense, former prosecutors and defense lawyers say, but the enormous publicity surrounding the case may also produce a second jury that is more eager to convict. Judge Steven O'Neill of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberations. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele immediately announced he would seek a retrial. New York lawyer Paul Callan, a former prosecutor, said he thought it would  exceptionally difficult  for the state to win a second trial against Cosby.  Callan noted the defense would soon be able to access a full transcript of all the prosecution witness testimony to try to highlight inconsistencies. Linda Fairstein, former head of the sex crimes unit with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, agreed that retrials are usually better for the defense.   From my perspective, a retrial is never an advantage because, as a prosecutor, you put your best case on,  she said.  New York defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein noted Cosby's lawyers had shown fewer of their cards, resting without calling any witnesses. The comedian also did not testify in his own defense. FILE PHOTO - Actor and comedian Bill Cosby departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles Mostoller/File Photo They might decide to re-evaluate that position,  said Fishbein. The prosecution is also under more pressure than the defense in terms of expending public resources, he added. One hung jury raises the possibility of another one, and the government needs to weigh how far it wants to go to win a conviction. But that calculus can also change in very high-profile cases, noted Fishbein, who recently had that experience while representing Pedro Hernandez, who was charged with murdering six-year-old Etan Patz in New York in 1979. After a lone holdout deadlocked the jury in Hernandez's first trial, the public and media outcry made it extremely hard to find an impartial panel for the retrial, said Fishbein.   We had to go through 1,000 people to get a jury,  he said. Hernandez was convicted and sentenced to 25-years-to-life in April. Fishbein said he was appealing the verdict. Fishbein said he sees similarities with the Cosby case in terms of public opinion.   There's a lot at stake here with the fact that so many women have filed complaints against him,  said Fishbein.  It's going to be very hard to find a fair and impartial jury anywhere in the Northeast.

{"content":"Rays overtake Tigers with two-run seventh for 3-2 win DETROIT -- Baseball is a sport where you play the percentages because in a 162-game season it pays off.  How about those shifts?  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said Saturday after his maneuver worked when Detroit's Alex Avila grounded out against an overshift to cinch the Rays' 3-2 victory over the Tigers.  Those seem to work every once a while, don't they?  Avila came up with Mikie Mahtook at third with the tying run with two outs after a leadoff single. Mahtook had alertly moved to third when Tampa Bay shifted for Avila -- third baseman Even Longoria moving over the the normal shortstop spot and shortstop Tim Beckham moving from short to the other side of second. The second baseman slid into short right field.  He's getting to third regardless because of the positioning,  Cash said of Mahtook being given a stolen base for his advancement.  We felt it was more important at the time to cover more ground toward the pull side.  But I think that probably shows how much confidence we have in Alex Colome. We'll give up 90 feet to get to third trusting that if we put the guys in the right spot we'll can make a play and he'll make a pitch. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at TigersTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch Alex Avila's having a tremendous year. Whatever to get him out worked. We haven't gotten him out many times this year.  Colome posted his 19th save. He got Avila down 1-2 and then went up and in with a fastball. The Detroit catcher hit it sharply but right at the overshifted Beckham, who threw to first to end the game.  It was a little in, a little up,  Avila said of the pitch.  If it was down a little bit, maybe I'd stayed through a little bit better and hit a line drive into the gap there. Still hit it hard, just right at 'em.  I would say the guy's been playing there for a hundred years, but he hasn't.  Mallex Smith and Daniel Robertson grounded two-out RBI singles to right in the seventh inning to rally the Rays from a one-run deficit and snap a three-game losing streak. Robertson's single just trickled off diving Ian Kinsler's glove in short right to get Steven Souza Jr. in from third and tie the score 2-2. Souza Jr. drew a walk from Tigers starter Michael Fulmer (6-5) to lead off the seventh and got to third on two groundouts. Smith welcomed reliever Alex Wilson by grounding a 3-1 pitch to right for a single that scored Robertson, who had gotten to second when Derek Norris chased Fulmer with a line single to left. Smith had two singles and now has hit safely in all nine games he has played since being recalled from the minors to take over for injured center fielder Kevin Kiermaier. Jumbo Diaz pitched the seventh for Tampa Bay but gave up a one-out double in the eighth and was relieved by Colome, who got the last five outs.  We haven't done that in a while, asked him for a five-out save,  Cash said.  He hadn't pitched in three days. He wanted to pitch today (Saturday) regardless, I don't know if he wanted to pitch that much, but he wanted to pitch.  Miguel Cabrera slammed a first-pitch fastball from Rays starter Chris Archer (5-4) over the right field wall leading off the sixth inning to put the Tigers ahead 2-1. Archer allowed six hit in six innings, walking one and striking out eight. Fulmer lasted 6 2/3 innings, allowing six hits with four walks and three strikeouts. Kinsler ripped a flat 3-2 slider to the left field wall to drive in Andrew Romine, who had singled leading off the fifth for Detroit and gone to second on a groundout to tie the score 1-1. Robertson's RBI single to center with one out in the fifth gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead. Colby Rasmus doubled to right with one out and Beckham walked to precede Robertson's first-pitch line single. NOTES: CF Mallex Smith has four bunt singles in his 18 games with Tampa Bay this season, equaling the rest of the team combined. ... Detroit DH Victor Martinez was released from the hospital but will rest and be monitored for an irregular heartbeat for 7-10 days. ...

{"content":"Schoop leads HR binge, Orioles batter Cardinals BALTIMORE -- Rather than dampening Jonathan Schoop's confidence, a costly error early in the game seemed to energize the Baltimore Orioles second baseman. Schoop recovered from the gaffe and led an offensive explosion that the Orioles hope will be the catalyst to get their season on track. Schoop tied a career high with four hits, including two of Baltimore's five home runs, and the Orioles beat the St. Louis Cardinals 15-7 on Saturday.  You've got to forget about the past,  Schoop said.  I know I made a tough error, and then we come back and score runs. We forget about it and get better.  Adam Jones and Mark Trumbo hit back-to-back homers in the first inning and Manny Machado added a solo shot off starter Adam Wainwright (7-5). Baltimore scored nine runs against Wainwright, who lasted just 1 2/3 innings -- the shortest start of his 12-year career.  You face a good lineup, especially in a hitters ballpark, and you throw it down the middle, they're going to hit it hard,  Wainwright said.  They're going to hit it out. That's what happened.  Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at OriolesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchDexter Fowler hit a three-run homer off reliever Alec Asher in the sixth inning that pulled St. Louis within 12-7. The Orioles extended a franchise record by allowing at least five runs for the 14th straight game. Orioles reliever Mychal Givens then contained the Cardinals with 2 1/3 scoreless innings and a career-high 41 pitches. Baltimore got some breathing room in the seventh on a solo shot by Schoop and a double by J.J. Hardy that provided a 14-7 lead.  I'm prepared for any situation,  Givens said.  Like today, I was prepared. I was stretching and always prepared for any situation like that.  A passed ball gave Baltimore its 15th run in the eighth inning -- the team's highest output since 2015. The Orioles won for just the second time in the past 10 games. Paul DeJong and Yadier Molina also went deep for the Cardinals, who were 2-for-9 with runners in scoring position. Orioles left-hander Wade Miley (3-4) scuffled early, walking two of the first three batters he faced. That proved costly as Schoop could not handle a hard grounder by Molina, allowing St. Louis to take a 1-0 lead. Miley allowed six runs (five earned) and six hits with eight strikeouts and four walks in 5 2/3 innings.  It's been a grind, no doubt,  Miley said.  Baseball's going to throw that at you at some point every year. It's just kind of how we come through it, and hopefully we're moving in the right direction.  Baltimore pulled ahead on the homers by Jones and Trumbo and then took control with seven runs in the second. Hardy set the tone with a two-run double and Machado hit a solo homer two batters later. Trey Mancini had another two-run double that ended Wainwright's day. Left-hander Tyler Lyons entered and allowed an RBI single to Schoop. After DeJong pulled St. Louis within 9-3 in the fourth, a wild pitch by Lyons gave Baltimore its 10th run in the bottom half. Schoop provided a 12-3 lead with a two-run shot later that inning. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny lauded Lyons for going 31/3 innings, helping preserve the bullpen.  We had to have someone do something special out of the pen so we didn't beat up everybody and that was Tyler,  Matheny said.  Overall, the bullpen did a nice job and guys kept swinging the bats.  NOTES: Baltimore 1B Chris Davis (strained right oblique) would not speculate on how long he might be out of the lineup. He went on the 10-day DL on Wednesday retroactive to the previous day. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - Kim Si-woo kept up his steady pace at the U.S. Open on Saturday, posting his third successive sub-par round to remain in the hunt for his first major. The 21-year-old, who became the youngest winner of the prestigious Players Championship last month, added a four-under par 68 to his opening 69 and second-round 70 for a nine-under 207 total to stand three behind leader Brian Harman. Overnight rain once again softened the long, links-style layout and enabled some players to go very low again, which South Korean Kim seemed to feel hurt his chances.  U.S. Ryder Cup standout Patrick Reed fired a seven-under 65 to reach eight-under, and this season's three-time PGA Tour winner Justin Thomas shot a U.S. Open record nine-under-par 63 to trail Harman by just one stroke.  Overnight raining and then course was soft, and no wind today,  said Kim.  I think every pin (you) needed to go to the pin. I think it's much easier today, the last two days.  I don't think it's good for me. Today is too easy, other players may go lower. I'm playing good today, but (I'm) like three behind now.

Hideki Matsuyama, the other serious contender this week to become the first Asian man to win the U.S. Open, failed to take full advantage of the favorable conditions as he registered a 71 to stand six under par, six strokes behind Harman.

{"content":"Puig keys power surge as Dodgers rout Reds CINCINNATI -- It didn't take long after Saturday's game for Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to find the word that best described his team's offense: Relentless. Yasiel Puig homered twice, Cody Bellinger hit a two-run blast and Joc Pederson added a solo shot, lifting the Dodgers to a 10-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on a steamy afternoon at Great American Ball Park.  The offense today was the story,  Roberts said.  From the first (batter) to the eighth, we put together some good at-bats and had some big hits. Everyone on the field today gave us a chance to win.  Bellinger's homer was his National-League leading 19th, tying a major-league record for most homers in a player's first 49 career games. The Yankees' Gary Sanchez is the only other player to reach 19 homers in that span.  I'm sort of expecting it now,  Roberts said.  The homers, doubles, singles, walks ... it's the at-bat quality. He's a very talented young player with good mechanics. Cody's way ahead of schedule.  Puig homered in consecutive at-bats. He went deep in the sixth inning against Austin Brice and added his 12th homer of the season in the eighth against Jake Buchanan. It was his third career multi-home run game. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at RedsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch Just trying to find the right pitch (to hit),  said Puig, via a translator.  The offense has been doing its job. Bellinger keeps hitting balls to the street. Pederson is more patient.  The Dodgers (43-26) have won seven straight games against the Reds dating to last season and are 16-3 against them since 2015. Los Angeles has won eight of nine.  We're playing well, but we need to continue to get better if we're going to be ready for the playoffs and World Series,  Puig said. Joey Votto went 3-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 11 games for Cincinnati (29-38), which has lost a season-high eight in a row. The Reds haven't lost more than eight straight since an 11-game skid in May 2016. Los Angeles starter Hyun-Jin Ryu (3-6) needed 105 pitches to get through five innings but allowed only two runs and eight hits with two walks and seven strikeouts.  He was close to being done in the third inning,  Roberts said.  But to find a way to get through five innings is a credit to him. He dug deep today.  Consecutive doubles by Corey Seager and Bellinger produced a run for the Dodgers in the first inning. Billy Hamilton showcased his speed in the bottom half of the first when he singled and raced to third on Zack Cozart's double. When Chris Taylor's throw into second got away for an error, Hamilton slid home to tie the score. For the second straight day, the temperature at the start of the game was 90 degrees. Things got more heated in the second inning when Reds manager Bryan Price was ejected for arguing a called third strike by home plate umpire Stu Scheurwater on Hamilton for the third out. Hamilton tossed his bat and helmet before Price got ejected for offering choice words from the dugout. It was Price's first ejection of the season. Taylor atoned for his throwing error with a two-run double in the third.  There was some hesitation (by the umpire), and I didn't care for it,  Price said.  You want the call immediately. The hesitation got under my skin. I just didn't think it was a good enough pitch.  Bellinger's two-run shot in the third was immediately followed by Pederson's solo shot to put Los Angeles ahead 6-1. It was Pederson's fourth homer and second in as many days. Reds starter Asher Wojciechowski (1-1) allowed six runs (five earned) in 2 1/3 innings.

{"content":"Freeland helps Rockies maintain dominance vs. Giants DENVER -- A barrage of singles and some very timely hitting Saturday helped the Colorado Rockies continue their dominance over the San Francisco Giants with a 5-1 victory. Colorado scored all its runs with two outs in support of rookie Kyle Freeland (8-4), who pitched six innings before three relievers finished up. Freeland took a Joe Panik line drive off his left forearm in the third, but by then had settled in a groove after throwing 48 of his 94 pitches in the first two innings. The Rockies have won nine of 10 games against the Giants this season, including eight in a row. That is Colorado's longest winning streak in franchise history against any National League West opponent. The win was the fourth straight for the Rockies (45-26), their 11th in 14 contests and moved them a season-high 19 games above .500. The victory assured the Rockies of winning this four-game series, giving them a 16-4-3 record in series this season. The Giants (26-44) have lost five straight and 14 of their past 18 contests to fall a season-high 18 games below .500. They trail the first-place Rockies by 18 1/2 games, the first time the Giants have been that far from first place prior to the All-Star break since 1985. Giants manager Bruce Bochy was direct when asked if there was a common thread in this series against the Rockies. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at RockiesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch Yeah we're losing every game, that's the common thread. We're not doing enough to win the ballgames,  Bochy said.  We score 17 runs in the first two games, and we can't get a win. And we get a pretty good pitching job, and we get one run today. That's kind of how it's gone for us.  Giants starter Matt Cain (3-6) gave up nine singles and two runs (one earned) in five innings. He stranded nine runners. Freeland got 11 outs on ground balls while recording his team-leading 10th quality start. He managed just three strikeouts, but they were crucial. Freeland walked Kelby Tomlinson to open the game but picked him off. Panik and Hunter Pence followed with singles, but Freeland struck out Buster Posey and Austin Slater. With runners on first and second in the sixth, Freeland struck out pinch hitter Brandon Belt to end the inning and his outing. Freeland fell behind Belt 2-0 but deferred to catcher Tony Wolters and struck Belt out on a high 3-2 fastball clocked at 92.3 mph.  I shook Tony to go to a slider,  Freeland said.  Then he kind of looked at me and shook his head. I stepped off and said, 'Let's do it,' and we attacked him with the heater.  The left-handed hitting Belt represented a power threat but one with severe limitations as of late. He is 0-for-18 with just two hits in his past 29 at-bats and does not have a hit in his past 23 at-bats against left-handed pitchers. No. 8 hitter Wolters, who went 2-for-4 with two RBIs, singled home the Rockies' first run in the second inning and another in the seventh and is batting .301 with a .400 on-base percentage. Pinch hitter Pat Valaika followed Wolters in the seventh with a run-scoring double -- Colorado's only extra-base hit after 13 singles. Every player in the starting lineup, including Freeland, had at least one hit. Trevor Story put the Rockies ahead 2-1 when he grounded a single up the middle with two outs in the fifth, scoring Ian Desmond. Carlos Gonzalez walked, and Desmond took third on a passed ball before Story drove in his fifth run in six games. Nolan Arenado's two-out single in the sixth boosted the Rockies' lead to 3-1. The hit scored Raimel Tapia, who singled with one out and moved to second on a groundout. Tapia has recorded four straight multi-hit games and five consecutive multi-hit starts. Three straight two-out singles in the second, the last by Wolters, gave the Rockies a 1-0 lead. Gorkys Hernandez tied the game at 1 with a two-out single in the fourth. The hit scored Nick Hundley, who doubled into the right-field corner with one out. The Giants went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10 runners. Cain made his 39th career start against the Rockies, the most by any pitcher in major league history. For the ninth time in 14 starts, Cain received one or fewer runs of support, all part of the Giants' pervasive gloom.  It's not really one thing you can put your finger on,  Cain said.  It's something we've got to find a way to keep grinding though. It's definitely been hard for all the guys, the staff. It's not been easy.  NOTES: Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado was charged with his first error of the season when he was unable to come up with C Nick Hundley's grounder in the second. ... Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (cancer) is scheduled to throw 15 fastballs Sunday in a bullpen session, his first at 60 feet, 6 inches with the catcher positioned behind home plate. ... Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (bruised ribs, left shoulder sprain) threw about 40 pitches in a simulated game at the team's complex in Scottsdale, Ariz. ... Giants 1B Buster Posey (left ankle) was cleared to catch and will do so Sunday but started at first base. ... Giants SS Brandon Crawford and CF Denard Span, who pinch hit in the ninth, were given a day of rest, and 2B Joe Panik might rest Sunday. ... Giants INF Eduardo Nunez (left hamstring) is available in an emergency but likely won't return to the lineup before Monday at Atlanta. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - Long-hitting Lexi Thompson moved into a one-stroke after the third round at the Meijer LPGA Classic in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Saturday. After the par-five fifth hole was reduced to a par three due to flooding, Thompson notched four birdies on the back nine for a five-under-par 64 on the Blythfield Country Club course.  The American posted a 15-under 196 total, while South African Lee-Anne Pace had two eagles in a 61 to vault into a tie for second at 14-under with Canadian Brooke Henderson (67) and South Koreans Jenny Shin (63) and Park Sung-hyun (62). Thompson also had a one-shot lead starting the final round at last week’s Manulife LPGA Classic in Ontario, and enjoyed a two-shot cushion with two holes to play before three-putting both to fall into a three-way playoff eventually won by Thai world number one Ariya Jutanugarn. “I’ve been focusing on staying positive and making sure I do my routine on every shot and making sure I’m fully relaxed over my shots and in-between shots,” Thompson told Golf Channel. “I sometimes over-think things. I’ve been focusing on staying positive.” Thompson, an eight-time LPGA Tour winner, did not try to force the issue in her third round. “It was just a matter of staying patient,” she said. “I hit it well all day so it was just a matter of hitting the ball closer and making a few putts for birdie.” Shin, whose lone LPGA victory came at the Texas Shootout last year, reeled off five straight birdies from the 10th hole, all from eight feet or longer as her putter caught fire. “I started hitting it better and I just kept making the putts,” she said. “I wasn’t looking at the scorecard, wasn’t looking at the scores or anything.” Pace also has one career LPGA win, back in 2014, and she is closer to doubling her tally after changing equipment recently.  The last few weeks I struck my irons really, really well,  Pace said.  I just actually changed the irons and it’s made all the difference.   While Canadian Henderson is in the hunt for her fourth Tour win, South Korean rookie Park is still searching for her breakthrough triumph.

{"content":"HAVANA (Reuters) - American travelers who long to swill a cocktail at Havana's legendary Sloppy Joe's bar or dive into the rooftop pool of its newest luxury hotel had their dreams dashed when U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new Cuba policy this week. In a setback to the U.S.-Cuban detente negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump on Friday ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to the Caribbean island and a clampdown on dealings with its military, which owns many of the capital city's top establishments.  You could say, 'You could buy a drink anywhere,' but we want to come to a famous, very nice place,  said Russell Francis, 35, a special education teach from Houston, after visiting Sloppy Joe's, which won renown during the 1920s U.S. Prohibition era when American tourists flocked to Havana to drink and gamble to their heart's content. The watering hole, with its 60-foot (18-meter) bar immortalized in the 1959 movie  Our Man in Havana,  was frequented by film stars such as John Wayne, Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable. Many Americans have headed there again since detente to soak up its historic atmosphere. While there is a growing number of private sector joints in Old Havana, considered one of the jewels of colonial architecture in the Caribbean, virtually all the state hotels and eateries are owned by the military.  Part of the beauty of being in the city is the historic aspect,  Matt Flynn, 30, an accountant from New Orleans, said as he wandered along popular Calle Obispo where live salsa music floats out from restaurants and bars. He said he was disappointed by Trump's move, although he understood the principle. Lauren Sivan, 39, of Los Angeles said she was glad she slipped into Cuba before the policy shift and was still able to stay at the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski, owned by the tourism wing of the military, Gaviota. The stunning property, in a renovated Belle Epoque mall, opened this month billing itself as Cuba's first luxury hotel, with a vast spa, rooftop terrace and cigar lounge.  We're just so glad we came now,  said Sivan, who was visiting Cuba for a long weekend with a group of friends. U.S. visitors tripled in number in the wake of 2014 detente, emboldened by Obama's easing of the travel ban. Many came in under the self-directed  people to people  category, which Trump is eliminating.   Tourists from the U.S. take a guided bicycle tour in Havana, Cuba June 17, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniAmericans like Flynn and Sivan said they would not have undertaken the trip under the new rules, which make Communist-run Cuba more like the  forbidden island,  just 90 miles (145 km) from Florida. Confusion remains about what will be allowed and whether individual visitors could simply come in under the  support for the Cuban people  category now. Experts say the devil will be in the details of the regulations to be drafted over coming months. Similarly, it is not yet clear how the ban on dealings with companies affiliated to the military will work. GAESA, the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, is involved in all sectors of the economy. That means when you enter a shop in Cuba to purchase a bottle of water, soda or beer, you probably are patronizing a military establishment. Slideshow (5 Images) They are not marked so you would have to do your research,  Flynn said.  It's very hard to police because if you come without tour guide, it's cash and there aren't receipts.  Forcing would-be visitors into organized trips, issuing lists of which establishments they could not visit and auditing those tours would go some way to solving that issue. But it also would give the Cuban government, which sanctions tours, more control over what visitors see and likely reduce Americans' contact with ordinary Cubans.  You would probably have to go through a tour group which has its advantages but it would be considerably more expensive and very structured,  said Christian Walther, 26, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Some travelers said they understood why Trump did not want U.S. dollars going to the Cuban military but others said it would hurt Cubans who benefited from the recent tourism boom, using generous American tips to support their families.  It is ridiculous,  said Bronwyn Hennessy, 44, who runs a fishing lodge in Montana and was wrapping up a fly fishing tour on the island with a night in Havana. She said she would not let the new restrictions dampen her desire to explore the island further. For the adventurous, there were always other ways to slip into the island. She had entered previously via Cancun, Mexico, asking the Cuban officials not to stamp her passport.  If we come again, we will probably sneak in,  she said.

{"content":"NORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania prosecutors vowed to retry comedian Bill Cosby on sexual assault charges after a jury on Saturday failed to render a unanimous verdict despite 52 hours of deliberations in a case that echoed accusations made by dozens of women against him. Judge Steven O'Neill, of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, declared a mistrial on Saturday morning following a note from jurors saying that they were hopelessly deadlocked on three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The result was a victory for Cosby, 79, who had faced years in prison for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting college administrator Andrea Constand at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. But prosecutors immediately said they would seek a second trial, which O'Neill suggested could start within four months.  She's entitled to a verdict in this case,  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said at a news conference. Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told reporters that the trial's outcome had  restored  his client's legacy. But Cosby's reputation remains in tatters, following a slew of sexual assault allegations from about 60 women that have destroyed the  America's dad  image he built as star of the long-running 1980s TV comedy  The Cosby Show.  Constand's claim was the only one to lead to criminal charges, with many of the others dating too far back to allow for prosecution. The entertainer had no visible reaction in court. As news reporters streamed out of the room, several other Cosby accusers, some in tears, waited in line to hug Constand, who smiled broadly and maintained her composure. 'You're Not Off the Hook' Outside the courthouse, as Cosby stood silently behind them, members of his team criticized the case against him.  This is what happens - juries are stuck when a prosecutor seeks to put someone in prison for things that are simply not presented in the courtroom,  said Angela Agrusa, one of Cosby's lawyers. In a statement read aloud by one of Cosby's aides, his wife, Camille, who attended only a couple of hours of the trial, took aim at the prosecutors and the judge.  How do I describe the district attorney? Heinously and exploitatively ambitious,  Camille Cosby said in the statement.  How do I describe the judge? Overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney.  The mistrial was a blow to the dozens of women who have said they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, including several who attended the trial wearing buttons that read  We Stand in Truth.  Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy model who has accused Cosby of drugging and raping her decades ago, had a message for him.  You're not off the hook, buddy,  she said outside the courtroom. Constand did not speak to reporters, but her attorney, Dolores Troiani, said Constand was a  very spiritual person who believes everything happens for a reason.  Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (C) waves as he departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles MostollerCosby has denied all of the women's claims, saying that any sexual encounters were consensual. He still faces several civil lawsuits from at least 10 accusers. Cosby's starring role as beloved dad Heathcliff Huxtable in  The Cosby Show,  along with years of family-friendly standup comedy routines, made him a household name. He became an in-demand product endorser, appearing in commercials for Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford. He co-starred in the 1960s espionage show  I Spy,  the first black performer to star in a weekly American TV dramatic series.  But his live performing career stalled in 2015, as multiple accusers began going public with their stories. Jurors Revisited Testimony In Norristown, Pennsylvania, the jury struggled for days to agree on which version of the night in question to believe: Constand's or Cosby's. Slideshow (20 Images)Constand, then 31, met the married Cosby 15 years ago through her job as an administrator with the women's basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia, where Cosby was a trustee and the school's most renowned alumnus. She testified that Cosby acted as a mentor before offering her unidentified pills one night that left her unable to stop his advances. Cosby's defense lawyers, however, argued that Constand's account could not be trusted after they pointed to numerous discrepancies in her statements to police in 2005, when she first reported the encounter, which occurred nearly a year earlier.  In more than a dozen notes to the judge, the jurors asked to revisit huge chunks of trial testimony, including Constand's account from the witness stand, her statements to police from 2005 and Cosby's sworn depositions taken in 2005 and 2006, when Constand filed a civil lawsuit against him. Cosby chose not to testify at the trial. By Thursday morning, after nearly 30 hours of discussions spanning three days, the jurors told O'Neill they were at a stalemate. The judge instructed them to keep working, but despite marathon 12-hour sessions, the jury said on Saturday it was at an impasse. The trial drew intense media attention, with more than 100 credentials issued for print, online, television and radio reporters. The case itself has followed a long path to prosecution. In 2005, prosecutors declined to charge Cosby based on Constand's account, and she filed a lawsuit that Cosby settled for an undisclosed sum. His depositions in that case, however, were unsealed by a federal judge in 2015, revealing his admissions that he had given sedatives to young women in the 1970s and prompting prosecutors to reopen the case. He was eventually charged in December 2015, just days before the statute of limitations was set to expire. Although the district attorney has vowed to try the case again, Steele may have difficulty in winning an eventual conviction, according to former prosecutors and defense lawyers. Cosby's legal team has now seen the prosecution's whole case and can home in on inconsistencies the second time around, they say.

{"content":"(Reuters) - A protest on a Minnesota freeway over the acquittal of a police officer in the slaying of black motorist Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 18 demonstrators early on Saturday, state police said. The arrests came hours after St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez was found not guilty on Friday of second-degree manslaughter in 32-year-old Castile's July 2016 shooting death in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. The shooting drew national attention after the victim's girlfriend live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media, and it led to protests that have fueled debate across the country over police use of force in encounters with minorities. Protesters held a peaceful demonstration on Friday at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul and then about 1,500 converged on Interstate 94 in the city, blocking the freeway, a Minnesota State Patrol spokeswoman said in an email statement. Authorities repeatedly asked protesters to leave before making 18 arrests shortly after midnight on Saturday, the statement said. Unlawful assembly and other charges are pending against them, it said. Among those listed as arrested for alleged unlawful assembly were at least two journalists.

Yanez shot Castile five times. U.S. Senator Al Franken of Minnesota on Saturday said Castile did not deserve to die. Slideshow (11 Images) Whatever one's opinion of the outcome of this case, we must come together and take concrete action to reckon with and dismantle the systemic racial inequalities that lead to far too many of these deaths,  Franken wrote on Facebook. The video footage of the aftermath of the shooting taken by Castile's girlfriend had shaped many public perceptions of the fatal shooting before the trial. The video begins with the girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, in the passenger seat as Castile, covered in blood, sits in the driver's seat and a patrolman points his gun into the vehicle.   He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out of his pocket,  Reynolds says.  He let the officer know that he had a firearm and that he was reaching for his wallet, and the officer just shot him in his arm.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army said it would suspend combat operations in the southern city of Deraa for 48 hours from Saturday, as mediators announced two separate attempts to convene new peace talks next month. The Syrian army general command said a ceasefire at noon (5 a.m. ET) was being implemented to support  reconciliation efforts , according to a statement carried by state news agency SANA. The announcement came on the same day as the United Nations said it wanted to start a fresh round of peace talks between Syrian factions on July 10 in Geneva, and Moscow said it hoped to hold talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana on July 4-5. Since a resumption of peace negotiations last year, there have been multiple rounds brokered by the United Nations in Geneva between representatives of Syrian rebels and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, resulting in scant progress. Another track of talks brokered by Russia - a key Assad ally - has also been happening in Astana, Kazakhstan, since January. In an emailed statement, the office of United Nations special mediator for Syria Staffan de Mistura said he wished to convene a seventh round of Geneva talks in July and further rounds in August and September. The United States welcomed the ceasefire announcement and called on the Syrian government to live up to its ceasefire commitments.  We will judge this initiative by the results not the words,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. She urged the Syrian opposition groups to halt attacks to allow humanitarian aid to reach those in need. Pause in Hostilities In more than six years, the Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. In May, Iran, Russia and Turkey brokered a deal in Astana to create four  de-escalation  zones in Syria. A Free Syrian Army fighter speaks on radio at al-Nuaimah village in Deraa province, Syria June 17, 2017.Alaa al-FaqierViolence levels have been vastly reduced in those proposed de-escalation areas, but fighting has continued in major frontline areas, including in Deraa city. The Syrian army and Iran-backed militia forces have stepped up attacks against a rebel-held part of Deraa city in recent weeks, in a possible prelude to a large-scale campaign to gain full control.   De Mistura said this week a new round of talks would depend on the progress made in setting up the de-escalation zones. The United States and Russia have been holding talks in Jordan on creating a separate de-escalation zone in southwestern Syria that would include Deraa province, on the border with Jordan, and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  Slideshow (4 Images)Jordan's government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said on Saturday he hoped all parties would abide by the ceasefire, which was important for those in need of humanitarian aid, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. Momani also said it was important that parties work through the Geneva peace process.  A war monitor said the level of violence in Deraa had fallen seven hours after Saturday's ceasefire was due to take effect, but it and rebels said there was some bombardment for the first couple of hours. A rebel commander in Deraa told Reuters hostilities had not stopped three hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.   We have not heard of any such talk and the regime is still attacking us with the same intensity,  the commander said at 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT).  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said there was a  cautious calm  by 7 p.m.    There are breaches and we are distrustful of the regime's intentions in abiding by the ceasefire,  Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front grouping of the Free Syrian Army rebels, told Reuters.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Rescue crews searched into the early hours on Sunday for seven American sailors missing after a U.S. destroyer collided with a container ship in the pre-dawn hours off the coast of Japan. U.S. 7th Fleet Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin said the search was continuing in a statement released nearly 24 hours after the USS Fitzgerald, an Aegis guided missile destroyer, collided with the much larger Philippine-flagged merchant vessel 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka.  It's been a tough day for our Navy family. It's hard to imagine what this crew has had to endure, the challenges they've had to overcome,  Aucoin said. U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels continued the search after the Fitzgerald sailed into the port of Yokosuka south of Tokyo. Three aboard the destroyer were treated at the U.S. Naval Hospital, including ship Commander Bryce Benson. It was not clear what caused the collision, which the U.S. Navy said occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT).

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - At least 58 people are feared to have died in the fire that engulfed a London tower block this week, police said on Saturday, as Prime Minister Theresa May admitted that the response from the authorities had not been good enough.  With anger mounting over the government's handling of the blaze, May met residents from the Grenfell Tower and vowed to personally oversee the recovery as protesters gathered to demonstrate in the streets around her residence for a second day.  Weakened by a botched election gamble last week, May has been criticized for her muted response to the fire and had to be rushed away from a meeting with residents on Friday under heavy police guard as protesters shouted  Shame on you .  The response of the emergency services, National Health Service, and the community has been heroic,  May said in a statement.    But, frankly, the support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough.  London Police Commander Stuart Cundy said the toll of 58 represented those who were missing and presumed dead from a fire which ripped through the 24-story social housing block as residents slept in the early hours of Wednesday morning.   Sadly at this time, there are 58 people who we have been told were in Grenfell Tower on the night that are missing and therefore sadly I have to assume that they are dead,  he said.   If the number is confirmed, it would make the Grenfell Tower blaze the deadliest in London since World War Two. The toll had previously been put at 30. While the blaze has prompted an outpouring of generosity, with many people donating provisions and clothes, it has also unleashed rage at the authorities as the charred tower was cast as a deadly symbol of a deeply divided society. On Friday angry protesters chanting  We want justice  stormed their way into the Kensington and Chelsea town hall to try to confront the leaders of the local council.  Related CoverageRailway track near London tower blaze closed due to debris riskResidents of the destroyed tower said May was far too slow to visit the stricken community, that the building had been  unsafe and that officials have failed to give enough information and support to those who have lost relatives and their homes. Anger in London On Saturday May spent over two hours meeting residents from the north Kensington area at her Downing Street residence and chaired a meeting on the government's response to the fire. She has promised to set up a public inquiry and pledged 5 million pounds ($6.39 million) of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. Those who lost their homes will be rehoused within three weeks, she said.  It has been decided today that the public inquiry will report back to me personally,  May said.  As Prime Minister, I will be responsible for implementing its findings.   One of her closest allies, Damian Green, defended May, saying she was  distraught about what has happened .  A woman lights a candle at a spot where people have left tributes to those who perished in the Grenfell apartment tower block fire in North Kensington, London, Britain, June 17, 2017.Hannah McKay We're all desperately sad,  said Green, who was appointed May's deputy in the wake of the general election.  We're all angry, but of course none of us as angry as those who were directly affected. I absolutely get why they're angry.  May was asked repeatedly in an interview on Friday whether she had misread the public mood. While failing to answer, she said the focus was now on providing support to the victims. On Saturday more than 1,000 people gathered near May's Downing Street office to protest against her plan to form a government with the support of a socially conservative Northern Irish party.  One banner showed a drawing of May with the words  Shame  and  Disgrace .   Not a Viable Pm  Slideshow (18 Images)After a turbulent three months which has seen Britain hit by three deadly Islamist militant attacks and now the tower blaze, Queen Elizabeth said the mood was deeply somber but that the British people were resolute in the face of adversity. Having visited residents and volunteers near the tower on Friday with her grandson William, the queen also led a minute's silence in Buckingham Palace on Saturday.       It is difficult to escape a very somber national mood,  Elizabeth said in a message on her official birthday.  The country has witnessed a succession of terrible tragedies.  Put to the test, the United Kingdom has been resolute in the face of adversity,  Elizabeth said.  United in our sadness, we are equally determined, without fear or favor, to support all those rebuilding lives so horribly affected by injury and loss.  Such a direct message from the monarch is rare and indicates the extent of the turmoil in Britain.   Opponents said May's handling of the fire had thrust her position further into doubt by showing a failure to feel the public mood and act decisively. Her failure to win a majority in an election she did not need to call had already sparked a tumultuous week and pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago.  Britain is now likely to go into arduous talks on Monday about its exit from the European Union with a weakened leader who is dependent on Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get legislation passed.  Matthew Parris, a columnist and former Conservative lawmaker, said May's response to the fire had shown a lack of judgment which made her unsuitable to be prime minister.  Wallowing in the wash of a general election that stripped our prime minister of her authority on the very eve of EU negotiations, neither common sense nor the evidence suggest she can re-establish public confidence,  Parris wrote in the Times.   This prime minister is not viable.

{"content":"ERIN, Wisconsin (Reuters) - American Justin Thomas capped a record-setting third-round with a sensational eagle at the last at the U.S. Open on Saturday, moving closer to adding a maiden major title to an already glorious season of golf. The 24-year-old Thomas carved a three-wood from the fairway to within eight feet of the cup on the 667-yard finishing par-five and drained the putt for a nine-under-par 63, the best U.S. Open round ever in relation to par. His nine-under tour of rain-softened Erin Hills eclipsed the eight-under-par 63 carded by Johnny Miller in winning the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, and matched the all-time low for any major of 63.  That means I'm a part of history,  Thomas told reporters.  It means I have a lot better chance to win the tournament than I did when the day started.  Thomas was tied for 24th at two under par, five strokes off the pace after Friday's second round. The thrilling finish vaulted Thomas into the clubhouse lead on 11 under par late in the third round but with numerous contenders still out on the course and threatening to catch him. A three-time winner on the PGA Tour this season, Thomas also joined the exclusive ’59’ club by breaking 60 at the Sony Open, but he may have saved his best for Father's Day weekend and his quest for his first major crown. Thomas had 300 yards to the hole for his second shot at the 18th.  I knew I hit it really well,  he said.  It was downwind to where I knew if I hit it solid, I could definitely get it there.  All Jimmy (caddie Jimmy Johnson) and I were trying to do is give ourselves a best chance to make a four. Make four, get out of there and post a great number.  Those things are bonuses, you know? I wouldn't have been able to do that without that rain last night. So I guess I'm thankful for that.  Thomas set the U.S. Open scoring record despite registering a pair of bogeys, offsetting them with nine birdies and his closing eagle. Another eagle was available when Thomas drove the short, 288-yard par-four 15th hole. The world number 13 said he was hungry at that point and that might have affected him.  I was a little mad at myself because I could feel I was hungry on 14 (where he parred the par-five) and 15. I just get a little shaky and jittery on putts and that's what happened on 15.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The British parliament will hold a rare two-year legislative session to tackle the complexities of Britain's departure from the European Union, the government said on Saturday.     Britain's negotiations with the EU over its exit from the bloc begin on Monday and stand to be complicated by the surprise loss of Prime Minister Theresa May's parliamentary majority in a national election last week. A parliamentary session usually runs for a year, from spring to spring. But the government will double the length of the session to let lawmakers debate Britain's approach to Brexit without interruption. Related CoverageMoscovici on Brexit negotiations: EU will be 'amicable and firm'Britain gave official notification that it would leave the EU at the end of March, meaning it will leave the bloc, which is its biggest trading partner, in March 2019.  Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Britain's lower legislative house, said that Brexit would require a lot of legislation, including a law to enshrine current EU rules into British law, known as the  Great Repeal Bill .   We will build the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans and that means giving Parliament the maximum amount of time to scrutinize these bills by holding a two-year session of Parliament,  she said. The government's plan for the next parliament will be outlined in the Queen's speech on Wednesday, and will include laws needed to deliver Brexit and new immigration legislation. May has said that Britain's vote to leave the EU was in part a vote to reduce immigration. The government also said the extra legislative time was needed to pass its domestic agenda. However, it faces the prospect of delivering a Queen's speech while still thrashing out a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  May's Conservatives need the support of the Protestant DUP's 10 lawmakers to have a majority in parliament, and some have called for the government to take a cross-party approach to Brexit given May's weakened position following the election.

One of the Twitter accounts suspended belonged to Radio Miraflores, a station set up by Maduro that broadcasts from the presidential palace, including a salsa music program the president hosts.   Twitter in Venezuela today deactivated thousands of people's accounts,  Maduro said at televised rally.  Simply for being 'Chavistas,'  he said, using the term for followers of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Chavez was a pioneer among politicians in the use of Twitter, gathering millions of followers and frequently announcing news on the platform. Even today, Chavez's 4 million followers beat Maduro's 3 million.

Twitter's guidelines say accounts can be suspended for abusive behavior, security or spam, among other reasons. Despite the strong words, Maduro encouraged his supporters to keep using the service as a way of countering online the opposition, which has taken to the streets over the past two months to demand elections, protest restrictions and complain about crippling food and medicine shortages.

The battle on social media is very important.     On Saturday, hundreds of opposition activists held prayer services in Caracas and other cities to oppose Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution, while the government held rallies in several regions to support the initiative.  The protesters have kept the pressure on the government, with clashes with security forces killing at least 72 people since April.  Maduro threatened opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles on Saturday, saying he would sooner or later  face justice  for deaths in an earlier round of protests.  In April, authorities banned Capriles, who narrowly lost the presidential election in 2013, from holding political office for 15 years, a key factor fuelling the protests.

{"content":"MINNEAPOLIS -- Jose Ramirez homered from both sides of the plate as the Cleveland Indians pulled into a tie with the Minnesota Twins with an 9-3 victory in the first game of Saturday's split doubleheader between the two teams. Ramirez recorded three hits for the third straight game and drove in four runs to continue his torrid stretch. Bradley Zimmer added two hits and four RBIs for Cleveland, which has won three games in a row and the first two of the series in Minnesota. Saturday's nightcap is a makeup of rainout on April 9. Related CoverageCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchZach McAllister (1-0) earned the win with two hitless innings of relief for starter Ryan Merritt, who was recalled from Triple-A Columbus to make his season debut. The left-hander gave up three runs, two earned, on seven hits in four innings. Twins left-hander Adam Wilk (0-1) was also a Saturday call-up from Triple-A as Minnesota deals with a depleted rotation due to an injury to Hector Santiago as well as poor performance from the back end of the rotation. Friday's starter, Nik Turley, was making his second major league start. Wilk made the fourth major league start of his career on Saturday and ran into trouble immediately. After two quick outs on five pitches, Wilk allowed Ramirez's first homer of the day batting right-handed. Edwin Encarnacion walked and Carlos Santana singled before Zimmer plated both with a single to right field. Wilk lasted just 3 1/3 innings, surrendering six runs on eight hits and three walks. Encarnacion walked three times in the game, had a hit and scored twice. Wilk was done after Ramirez's two-run double in the fourth, but reliever Alex Wimmers labored in relief. Wimmers walked three batters in 1 2/3 innings and allowed Ramirez's second homer, this time from the left side, to lead off the sixth. NOTES: To make room for starter Ryan Merritt, Cleveland optioned LHP Kyle Crockett to Triple-A. RHP Mike Clevinger was recalled to start the second game as the Indians' 26th man for the doubleheader. Clevinger (2-3, 4.09 ERA) will have to be returned to Triple-A after the game but is expected to make a start in Baltimore. ...

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will face an immediate leadership challenge from eurosceptic lawmakers in her party if she seeks to water down her plans for Brexit, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing senior Conservative sources.  May, who won the top job in the wake of last year's vote to leave the European Union, had in January set out her plans for Brexit, saying Britain would leave the single market so it could control immigration.  But May's failure to win a majority in last week's election has weakened her position badly and reopened the debate around the Brexit strategy just days before the country opens its divorce talks with Brussels on Monday. Prompted by her poor election showing, particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity from Brexit, some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink.  If we had a strong signal that she were backsliding I think she would be in major difficulty,  the newspaper quoted one unidentified former minister as saying.  The point is she is not a unifying figure any more. She has really hacked off the parliamentary party for obvious reasons. So I'm afraid to say there is no goodwill towards her.  The newspaper quoted another former minister as saying:  If she weakened on Brexit, the world would fall in... all hell would break loose.  May called the election in a bid to increase her majority and strengthen her hand within her party ahead of the Brexit talks.  But the unexpected weak performance has plunged Britain into a political crisis and left May battling to unite both wings of the Conservative Party - those who want a so-called  hard Brexit  and those who did not want to leave the EU in the first place.  The Sunday Times said ministers within May's cabinet had 'let it be known' they would oust the prime minister if they thought she could not pass the government's legislative program in a vote expected on June 28. The Times also reported that party members who had campaigned to keep Britain in the EU were likely to have a candidate lined up to replace May, with interior minister Amber Rudd the likely option.   Having lost a majority in parliament, May is in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to secure the support of its 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote, including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain's divorce from the EU.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Greens are open to working with any party except the right-wing Alternative for Germany after a September vote but will list gay marriage as a condition, which could make it tricky to work with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. The Greens, which also named climate protection as their price for participating in government, could be a kingmaker in three potential coalitions after the Sept. 24 election, although recent polls have shown their support slipping to between 6.5 and 8 percent after spending much of last year above 10 percent. At their party congress in a velodrome in Berlin, the roughly 800 Greens delegates declared they would not sign a coalition deal unless it allowed gay marriage, a step up from the civil partnerships Germany has allowed since 2001.  Unless the discrimination against lesbians and gays on this point ends, you can't count on our cooperation,  said Greens politician Volker Beck, who proposed the motion. Delegates also decided to demand that the 20 dirtiest coal-fired power plants close immediately and that no new vehicles with combustion engines be allowed from 2030. In a speech Katrin Goering-Eckardt, one of the party's two top candidates, lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump for abandoning the Paris climate accord, saying he had  climbed into the ring against the earth  and the Greens would  take on this fight . As she drew applause, she sent Trump a Tweet featuring a photograph of delegates holding up posters spelling out  climate first  while others held cartoon cut-outs of a red-faced Trump and pictures of a frowning, sweating planet. Cem Ozdemir, the Greens' other top candidate, said he and Goering-Eckardt would not sign a coalition agreement that did not lay out the rules of climate protection and added this meant phasing out coal. Top candidate Katrin Goering-Eckart of Germany's environmental party Die Gruenen (The Greens) holds a speech at a party congress in Berlin, Germany June 17, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeA recent poll by Infratest dimap showed 57 percent of Germans think the Greens are not very important as the party's political rivals now address environmental and climate issues. Oskar Niedermayer, politics professor at Berlin's Free University, said the Greens had no unique selling point when it came to the environment - at a time when environmental issues are also  totally unimportant  for Germans who are more concerned with immigration, security and terrorism.  The Greens don't draw big crowds on those issues,  he said. Slideshow (3 Images)Alfons Hener, a retired civil servant, said he was concerned about the party's slump in polls and that the Greens had become  too harmless  and  too old  as too few young people had joined. One of the party's founding members, he said he finds it hard to explain how the Greens, who he said were once characterized as  anarchists, Communists and organic eaters , are different to the other parties.  I can't find any words on that anymore and that annoys me about the Greens,  he said. Greens member Benita von Brackel-Schmidt said the party needed to make clear to voters how its topics affect their lives. Ozdemir told Reuters the polls were not decisive, the election result would decided on Sept. 24 and the Greens were stepping on the gas now.  It's necessary to be fit for the next 100 days. I often go cycling and occasionally do yoga too so my fitness is good enough,  the 51-year-old politician of Turkish origin said in an interview.

We've never had so many people watching us, helicopters following us and people cheering,  Heli Schulz, who is the sail trimmer for Austria's Candidate Sailing Team, told Reuters.

The introduction of foiling boats into the youth event has leveled the playing field between the national teams of varying experience ranging from near professional multi-hull sailors to those who stepped on a catamaran for the first time a year ago.  We had no multi hull or foiling experience, it's been a steep learning curve,  Bermudan skipper Mackenzie Cooper said.

The sport still has some way to go in other areas. Britain's Annabel Vose is the only woman racing in the competition and is doing strategy for her team. Female participation on high performance multi-hulls has previously been curtailed by a high weight limit and the physical demands, but a lower weight limit in this competition helped Vose to get on board.

{"content":"(Reuters) - A retrial of Bill Cosby on sexual assault charges will likely offer major advantages to the defense, former prosecutors and defense lawyers say, but the enormous publicity surrounding the case may also produce a second jury that is more eager to convict. Judge Steven O'Neill of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberations. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele immediately announced he would seek a retrial. New York lawyer Paul Callan, a former prosecutor, said he thought it would  exceptionally difficult  for the state to win a second trial against Cosby.  Callan noted the defense would soon be able to access a full transcript of all the prosecution witness testimony to try to highlight inconsistencies. Linda Fairstein, former head of the sex crimes unit with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, agreed that retrials are usually better for the defense.   From my perspective, a retrial is never an advantage because, as a prosecutor, you put your best case on,  she said.  New York defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein noted Cosby's lawyers had shown fewer of their cards, resting without calling any witnesses. The comedian also did not testify in his own defense. FILE PHOTO - Actor and comedian Bill Cosby departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles Mostoller/File Photo They might decide to re-evaluate that position,  said Fishbein. The prosecution is also under more pressure than the defense in terms of expending public resources, he added. One hung jury raises the possibility of another one, and the government needs to weigh how far it wants to go to win a conviction. But that calculus can also change in very high-profile cases, noted Fishbein, who recently had that experience while representing Pedro Hernandez, who was charged with murdering six-year-old Etan Patz in New York in 1979. After a lone holdout deadlocked the jury in Hernandez's first trial, the public and media outcry made it extremely hard to find an impartial panel for the retrial, said Fishbein.   We had to go through 1,000 people to get a jury,  he said. Hernandez was convicted and sentenced to 25-years-to-life in April. Fishbein said he was appealing the verdict. Fishbein said he sees similarities with the Cosby case in terms of public opinion.   There's a lot at stake here with the fact that so many women have filed complaints against him,  said Fishbein.  It's going to be very hard to find a fair and impartial jury anywhere in the Northeast.

The New Zealand team's double victory erased a one-point advantage the U.S. team earned in an earlier regatta and gave them an early lead as they showed superior speed over the defending champions in the opening races.  We were far from our best today .... we need to sharpen up and that's what we'll focus on tonight, Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill told a news conference. The two wins gave New Zealand a psychological boost as the Kiwis try to win the  Auld Mug  back after losing to Oracle in San Francisco in 2013.    Day one is massive, it’s the most important day, if someone comes out with a speed advantage, psychologically that’s huge for the rest of the series,  said Ben Ainslie, skipper of Land Rover BAR at a morning briefing.  The first direct comparison of the 50-foot catamaran's performance has been much anticipated in the first-to-seven competition. Both teams have modified their boats and the two light wind duels showed the Kiwis' pace.      Peter Burling, 26, the helmsman of Emirates Team New Zealand won both of the starts against Jimmy Spithill, despite having less match racing experience, which has earned the Kiwi team a reputation as underdogs.   It was fantastic to win both starts, I'm really happy for the guys,  New Zealand skipper Glenn Ashby said.  In light easterly winds, the New Zealand team's foils, which lift the boat out of the water at speed, appeared to be more efficient, consolidating the Kiwis' reputation as light wind specialists. Sailing - America's Cup Finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 17, 2017 - Emirates Team New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling and crew celebrate after winning first two races over Oracle Team USA in America's Cup Finals.Mike SegarFirst Start Oracle Team USA were over the line in the first start, allowing New Zealand to gain an advantage and extend their lead during the race, despite an uncomfortable moment at the last mark, when the Kiwis came off their foils.  I'm not happy with how we sailed today, even though we've got two points on the board,  Burling said. Slideshow (3 Images)The second race saw a tense start, which was also won by New Zealand. The Kiwis led for much of the race, despite Oracle closing to three seconds after a wind shift put them back in touch. Oracle fell back, however, allowing the New Zealand team to secure their second win. After going into the competition one point down, the New Zealanders needed to win eight races to win the America's Cup, the world's oldest international sporting competition.  A win by the Kiwis would deny the U.S. crew their third successive win. The New Zealanders have massive support at home, where sailing is a national sport.  “Oracle is a multinational team and they’re not wearing their heart on their sleeve perhaps as much as the Kiwis and when it gets to those key moments when its all on the line, who is going to be more motivated to win it?,  Ainslie said. The New Zealanders are well aware that it is possible not to win the America's Cup despite an early advantage, after being 8-1 up in San Francisco four years ago before losing to Oracle.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Two people who disrupted a controversial New York production of Shakespeare's  Julius Caesar  took to social media on Saturday to defend their protest of the performance that portrays the assassinated Roman leader with an actor costumed to resemble U.S. President Donald Trump.  The open-air stage production featuring a magnetic blond businessman as the ill-fated Caesar, prompted outrage from the president's supporters who said the link with Trump would encourage political violence. The flap led two corporate sponsors to pull out.  Last night, Conservatives took back the theater, an institution they have been locked out of for too long. The left lost their safe space!  Laura Loomer, a journalist for right-wing media organization The Rebel, wrote on Twitter.  Loomer, 24, was arrested for misdemeanor criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct after rushing the stage during the open-air performance of the play on Friday evening, said a New York police spokesman. She was later released with a ticket ordering her to appear in court. The Public Theater, which is staging the play in Central Park, has responded to the criticism by saying the production is valid artistic expression in keeping with a long tradition of William Shakespeare adaptations. At the same time as Loomer jumped on the stage, a second protester stood up in the audience to loudly criticize the production and audience.  You are inciting terrorists, the blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands,  the man yelled. He was then led away by security guards. The protester later identified himself online, where he posted the video, as Jack Posobiec, who wrote a book called  Citizens for Trump.   U.S. Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was critically wounded on Wednesday when he and three others were shot on a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, who had raged against Trump on social media, was killed by police returning fire. Earlier this week, Delta Air Lines Inc and Bank of America Corp pulled funding of the production, hours after Trump's son Donald Jr. sent a Twitter message questioning whether it was art or political speech. In Posobiec's video from New York, audience members are heard booing to show displeasure with the disruption, as Posobiec shouts to call them  Nazis.  Posobiec was not arrested. The nonprofit Public Theater noted that like its critics, it also has the right of free speech under the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. It vowed to continue with its staging of  Julius Caesar  in an enclosed theater in New York's Central Park.  While we are champions of the first amendment, this interruption unfortunately was part of a paid strategy driven by social media,  it said on Twitter. Loomer and Posobiec denied they were paid to protest. About two weeks ago, comedian Kathy Griffin faced a backlash over her posing for a photograph with a fake severed and bloodied head resembling Trump. As a consequence, she lost her job as a co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.

{"content":"The Milwaukee Brewers seek to extend their winning streak to five games when they host the San Diego Padres on Saturday for the second contest of their three-game series. Milwaukee slugged four homers in the opener, with Eric Thames drilling the winning shot in the 10th inning for a 6-5 victory. The Brewers have scored 27 runs during their four-game winning streak and hold a 2 1/2-game lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League Central. Thames, who is tied for the NL lead with 19 homers, is 7-for-14 with three blasts and six RBIs over his last three games after beginning the month in a 4-for-37 funk. San Diego recorded just four hits in Friday's loss, but three were homers - including a three-run shot by Wil Myers. Hunter Renfroe went deep for the 15th time to snap a tie with Nate Colbert (1969) for most homers by a Padres rookie prior to the All-Star break. TV: 4:10 p.m. ET, FSN San Diego, FSN Wisconsin (Milwaukee) PITCHING MATCHUP: Padres RH Dinelson Lamet (2-2, 8.50 ERA) vs. Brewers RH Chase Anderson (5-2, 2.83) Lamet is making his fifth major-league start and has yet to last more than five innings. The 24-year-old has been roughed up for seven earned runs in each of his last two outings - both losses - and served up three homers to Kansas City in his last turn. Lamet has struck out 25 batters in 22 innings and has limited right-handed hitters to a .138 average. Anderson has allowed just one run in 27 2/3 innings over his last four starts, registering 30 strikeouts during that stretch. He didn't allow a run in three consecutive turns before giving up one over six innings while losing to Arizona in his last turn. The 29-year-old Anderson yielded four runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings against San Diego on May 15 but did not factor in the decision and is 3-1 with a 4.02 ERA in seven career starts versus the Padres. Walk-Offs 1. Brewers CF Keon Broxton hit a three-run homer in the series opener, giving him four blasts and nine RBIs over his last six games. 2. San Diego RHP Jered Weaver (hip) pitched a three-inning simulated game on Friday and will be re-examined on Saturday. 3. Milwaukee LF Ryan Braun (calf) could start a rehab assignment next week once the team works out the logistics between multiple minor-league clubs.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings (CALC) (1848.HK) is among the inaugural customers for a larger new version of Boeing's 737 jetliner, two industry sources said on Saturday. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 will be launched at the Paris Airshow on Monday with the backing of at least two Chinese lessors - CALC and the aviation arm of China Development Bank, whose interest in the aircraft emerged earlier this week. Boeing and CALC declined to comment. CALC's purchase of the newest variant of Boeing's most-sold jet is seen as part of an order for 50 aircraft from the 737 MAX family announced by the Hong Kong leasing firm this week. CALC, part-owned by China Everbright Bank (601818.SS), reported the overall order on Thursday but did not disclose a breakdown by type of model. It is the company's first Boeing order and will diversify its portfolio following previous Airbus purchases. The stock exchange posting on the eve of the world's largest air show is the most concrete sign so far that the widely expected launch of the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is going ahead, subject to the formal approval of Boeing directors. The launch is expected to trigger a procession of roughly 150 mostly small- to medium-sized orders from airlines, industry sources said. These include low-cost operators Lion Air of Indonesia and India's Spicejet. Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) has confirmed it is looking at the jet, but is not expected to strike a deal in time for the show. Expectations were diminishing as the show approached of an order for the jet from United Airlines (UAL.N), which Boeing had been actively wooing as a marquee customer. The 190-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10 is designed to plug a gap at the top end of Boeing's single-aisle range after strong sales of the competing Airbus A321neo. It will be delivered from 2020. Boeing and Airbus are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a recent flood of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years at the show starting on Monday. As often happens when markets soften, leasing companies will be looking for bargains in Paris next week and are expected to feature prominently in any announcements beyond the MAX 10. A handful of airlines were said to be shopping for planes in advance of the show including Peruvian low-cost startup Viva Air, owned by Irelandia Aviation led by the son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, which could place an order for Airbus. Saudia budget subsidiary Flyadeal, which has already leased Airbus jets, could soon opt to buy some, industry sources said. Airbus declined comment. Neither airline could be reached.

{"content":"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was set to name a former Lebanese culture minister as new U.N. envoy to Libya, ending an unusually contentious four-month search that followed U.S. rejection of his first suggestion. Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences-Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday. Diplomats said objections were unlikely and the U.N. Security Council will greenlight the appointment on Tuesday. The council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys. Traditionally, the U.N. chief informally discusses candidates with the 15-member body to ensure agreement before officially proposing a name. The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been  unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.   In practice ... if (countries) have a significant objection then they usually make it clear before the secretary-general has made the proposal,  said a senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  So it was very unusual that the United States blocked the Palestinian candidate very late in the day.  Guterres described the U.S. rejection as  a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.  Following that objection, Russia and other council members then rejected a British candidate and an American candidate, said diplomats. Kobler's posting was briefly extended until the end of June.   Over 20 people were approached and either ruled themselves out – i.e. they weren't available – or they were ruled out ... by one of the Security Council members,  the senior council diplomat said.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component. Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric, conducted checks after a problem was found in a turbine disc. Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed. They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilization rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney. Each one percent in improved utilization has the same benefit for airline finances as a five percent fuel saving, they said. CFM also said it expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of its LEAP engine. That means planes will be able to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast. Non-Committal on Design CFM, like rival engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, is meanwhile poring over proposals for a new mid-market jetliner from Boeing, seating around 220-270 people. Many in the industry expect Boeing to opt for an engine with a gear to increase the efficiency of its fan, which produces most of the thrust, especially on take-off. Pratt & Whitney has introduced such a design to re-enter the civil market after mainly focusing on the U.S. military in recent years. Its Geared Turbofan is now in use on some Airbus and Bombardier jets. The head of Pratt & Whitney last month warned Rolls-Royce that the use of a gear in its planned Ultrafan engine project could cause a patent dispute, according to Flightglobal. CFM officials declined on Saturday to be drawn on whether they would offer a similar design for Boeing's new jet, but did not rule out using a gear that one described as generic technology.  We are not ruling out any architecture. We have no religion on the gear,  Executive Vice President Francois Bastin said.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump had personal liabilities of at least $315.6 million to German, U.S. and other lenders as of mid-2017, according to a federal financial disclosure form released late on Friday by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. He had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee Washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the White House last September. Revenues also increased at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort known as the  Winter White House.  Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0ZM) The 98-page disclosure document posted on the ethics office's  website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL], a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where he has opened a hotel.  Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital Corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trump's income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. Income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. Revenue from Trump Corporation, his real-estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from Mar-a-Lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. The private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump's election. He earned $11 million from the Miss Universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.  U.S. President Donald Trump delivers a speech on US-Cuba relations at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami, Florida, U.S., June 16, 2017.Carlos BarriaRevenue from television shows like  The Apprentice  fell to $1.1 million, down from $6 million a year earlier. His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. But he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family's income, assets and liabilities.  President Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,  the White House said in a statement, adding that the form was  certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.  An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown. Before taking office in January, Trump was a New York real estate developer and television celebrity.

{"content":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney celebrates the first anniversary of its $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai on Friday, a key plank of the entertainment giant's push into the world's second-largest economy through everything from English schools to films. China matters for Mickey Mouse's owner: its box office takings there have tripled over the last two years and Shanghai Disneyland has seen more than 10 million guests in its first year, setting it on track for faster profits than Disney reaped from parks in Paris and Hong Kong, both loss-making for most of the years they have been open. The company was  extraordinarily encouraged  by the number of guests who visited Shanghai Disneyland and the satisfaction scores it received, Bob Chapek, head of parks and resorts, told reporters.  I think those are the sort of right precursors, if you will, for future development,  he said when asked about expansion plans.  We're very encouraged by what we've seen.  Disney released 10 films in China last year, including  Zootopia  and  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  with ticket sales of about $1 billion, according to box office tracker EntGroup. That was up from four films and $313 million in 2014. Last month, it rolled out the red carpet in Shanghai for a rare world premiere of the latest film in its  Pirates of the Caribbean  franchise. Stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Javier Bardem made an appearance.     It has also been tying up with partners like state-backed producer Shanghai Film Group, its digital subsidiary BesTV for online content, and Shanghai Shendi, its partner for Shanghai. Now, for the first anniversary of the Shanghai park, it will celebrate Disney-style, with lights, fireworks and visits by  executives including Chapek and Chief Executive Bob Iger. Chapek said their hotels at Shanghai Disneyland had hosted almost 750,000 people and had maintained occupancy levels significantly higher than the overall market.  Guests were also spending more time at the park than  anticipated, averaging about nine hours, he said. Broadening Buzz Fireworks explode over the Shanghai Disney Resort during a celebration ceremony to mark its first anniversary in Shanghai, China June 16, 2017.Stringer ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. CHINA OUT.But along with the hotel rooms and rides, Disney is pursuing a steadier path to build brand and profit in downtown classrooms in six Chinese cities, where children study English with the help of Winnie the Pooh and Captain America.  With the theme park, films, co-productions, Disney English and retail, they're creating an ecosystem to bring consumers in and foster a broader buzz and awareness,  said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.  The aim is to recreate that feeling in the U.S. where you have multiple generations who know the characters and cartoons.  Disney said China was a strategically important market. Slideshow (2 Images) Not only is it home to Shanghai Disney Resort, our largest ever foreign investment, but it has a thriving studio, consumer products and media distribution business,  it said in a statement. Disney is hiring for schools in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai - all decorated with Disney characters and motifs. It has not all been plain sailing. Disney was forced to launch an investigation this year after an employee was found to have set up firms which made deals with local authorities using the Disney name. Local children are also more used to Asian cartoon heroes, while Disney faces caps on imported films, partial bans on foreign cartoons on TV and long-established domestic theme park rivals. However, for 7-year-old Sunny Sun who has been attending classes once a week at Disney English for the past two years, Disney characters are now familiar.  Her mother, freelance writer Happy Chen, plans to take her to the Shanghai park this summer, and says her daughter goes to almost every new Disney animation at the cinema.  Now she really yearns to go to the Disney park,  said Chen, pointing to the crossover between the classes, films, characters and the theme park.   It's all connected.

{"content":"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer denied allegations made by a billionaire businessman in a magazine interview published on Saturday that he led a corruption scheme in which politicians squeezed high-profile executives for bribes, and vowed to sue the businessman. In a statement, Temer's office said he will take  all appropriate actions  against billionaire Joesley Batista, who told Época magazine that the 77-year-old politician has run a bribe-for-favors scheme at the government since 2010.  In his first interview since striking a leniency agreement with Brazilian prosecutors, Batista told Época that Temer asked for money several times in recent years as he led a group of senior politicians regularly demanding kickbacks in exchange for political favors.  Temer is the leader of a lower house criminal organization,  Época quoted Batista as saying.  Those who are not under arrest are in the government. They're very dangerous.  Temer's lawyers said in the statement released by his office that they will file civil and criminal lawsuits against Batista as early as Monday. Press representatives for Batista and his family's investment holding company, J&F; Investimentos SA, were not immediately available for comment. The coming week already promises to be a tense one for Temer and Batista, one of Brazil's richest businessmen. The Supreme Court is to discuss the validity of Batista's plea deal, and Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot could file charges against the president for corruption accusations that Batista made in May. Temer, in his statement on Saturday, rebuffed Batista's allegations in the Época interview that, saying that the billionaire repeatedly sought Temer's help for his personal benefit but was denied.  FILE PHOTO: Brazil's President Michel Temer speaks at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil, May 18, 2017.Ueslei Marcelino/File PhotoTemer also attacked terms of the leniency deal that allowed Batista to escape prosecution, saying in the statement that the terms made the billionaire  Brazil's most successful criminal ever.  The statement said Batista's testimonies  puts the blame of his crimes on others, while protecting his real partners.  The statement did not identify anyone. Threat of Ouster Last week, Temer escaped the threat of ouster as president after Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case over alleged illegal campaign funding for the 2014 election - in which he ran on the same ticket of former President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached last year on accusation she oversaw the doctoring of budget accounts. J&F; agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency fine, after Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing almost 1,900 politicians in recent years. J&F-controlled; JBS SA, the world's No. 1 meatpacker, is being investigated for alleged insider trading ahead of the announcement of the Batista family's leniency deal. Batista denied having ordered insider trades at JBS, according to the Época interview, adding that he believed they were all made in line with the law. He said J&F; will sell  as many assets as necessary  to quash concerns about the group's solvency. J&F; diversified from meatpacking in recent years, expanding into fashion, home cleaning, banking and pulpmaking with the help of state loans, prosecutors said.

{"content":"LHP Jose Quintana improved to 6-2 with a 1.77 ERA in his nine career starts against the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night. He allowed five hits and two runs in seven innings in the 11-4 victory. Entering the game, he had received the lowest run support of any starter in the major leagues at 2.65 per game. It was his first win since May 2, a span of seven winless starts.  Every time is good when you get a lot of (run) support,  Quintana said.  Wow, it was a lot of runs, though. I needed that outing to get my confidence high again. Threw a lot of strikes, had good command. I don't know. I know I have really good outings here.

LF Melky Cabrera had five RBIs in the 11-4 win over his former team, the Toronto Blue Jays, on Friday night. He had a two-run double in the second inning and a three-run homer in the fifth. He was 1-for-4 with a walk and has had six multi-hit performances in his past nine games. During that span, he is batting .421 (16-for-38). RHP James Shields (strained right lat) is scheduled to be reinstated from the DL on Sunday to start the series finale. He has been on the disabled list since April 21.

RHP Mike Pelfrey (2-5, 3.81 ERA), who is 2-1 with a 2.08 ERA in his past five starts, will face the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday in the second game of a three-game series at Rogers Centre. He allowed six hits, five walks and two runs in 3 2/3 innings in a no decision against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday. He pitched one scoreless inning in relief two days later against the Orioles. He was 0-2 with a 7.50 ERA in two starts with Triple-A Charlotte after signing a minor-league deal with the White Sox on April 5.

LHP Danny Duffy, out since May 30 with a strained right oblique, threw a light side session Friday and likely will throw again Sunday. If all goes well, he could begin facing live hitters in batting practice on Tuesday. Duffy was 4-4 with a 3.54 ERA in 11 starts before the injury. RHP Ian Kennedy got his first win of the season Friday against the Angels after going 0-6 with five no-decisions in his first 11 starts. He was perfect through 5 2/3 innings, retiring the first 17 batters he faced before Angels 2B Cliff Pennington hit a solo homer with two outs in the sixth inning. He gave up a double to OF Cameron Maybin and a walk to OF Kole Calhoun but was able to finish the sixth with the lead intact. Kennedy was replaced to start the seventh, but the Royals bullpen held the lead to give Kennedy his first victory since Sept. 11 over the White Sox, ending a streak of 15 consecutive starts without a win.  It was only matter of time,  Kennedy said of getting his first win.

Robby had a nice night offensively and that was nice to see,  said manager Kevin Cash. He played shortstop Thursday night but was at second Friday. CF Mallex Smith made a bold try to steal home in the fourth inning Friday night, but fell inches short. It was an exciting play that is not seen much in the majors any more.

I think Sucre, he's done a nice job with the pitchers,  manager Kevin Cash said.  He's earned an opportunity to get more reps back there. I know the pitchers like throwing to him. I like the way he can shut down a running game. He seems really athletic back there. I want to give him a chance to ignite our pitching staff, help them out.  RHP Erasmo Ramirez served up a leadoff home run to 2B Ian Kinsler of Detroit but then retired nine in a row before the roof caved in on him in the fourth and fifth innings. The Tigers scored five in each frame to put the game away.  Erasmo came out after the first-inning home run by Kinsler, looked like he was in a fairly crisp, efficient manner, throwing strikes,  manager Kevin Cash said.  Their bats just came to life. They had a lot of hard-hit balls. He just threw too much over the white (of the plate). We like our pitchers to attack, attack, attack. And obviously there's a fine line in there, especially against some of these hitters that can hit the ball really hard.  SS Tim Beckham returned to Tampa Bay's starting lineup Friday night, having missed time with a right knee strain. He singled and was thrown out trying to steal in the second, lined into a double play and tripled and scored in the ninth.  We're excited to have him back,  manager Kevin Cash said.  I think it showed up the last couple nights us not having him in the lineup messes a little bit with our defense. Beck's been so good for us offensively and defensively. Hopefully it's a little bit of a three-day rest and recovery and now we can have him fresh and help us win some games.

Wright is 0-0 with a 5.56 ERA in games out of the bullpen for the Orioles. RHP Gabriel Ynoa was called up from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday. He threw six scoreless innings out of the bullpen on May 5 against the Chicago White Sox in his first game with the Orioles this season. He came on in the sixth inning Friday in relief of starter Kevin Gausman and gave up back-to-back homers to the Cardinals and later allowed another homer.  He elevated a changeup, fastball was up. Lot of center-cut fastballs. That's been a challenge he's had in Norfolk and it carried over for us. He had one good outing for us. They had a predominantly right-handed lineup. We were hoping he could duplicate that but he didn't,  manager Buck Showalter said. RHP Jimmy Yacabonis was sent to Triple-A Norfolk on Friday. He was 0-0 with a 10.80 ERA in his first three appearances out of the bullpen at the big league level this year. LHP Zach Britton (left forearm strain) will make a minor league rehab start on Monday at Aberdeen in the short-season New York Penn League, he said Friday.  He will start the home opener (at Aberdeen) then pitch at Delmarva,  manager Buck Showalter said Friday. Showalter said he expects Britton to make about five minor league rehab appearances but he most likely won't be ready to pitch for the Orioles by July 1. He went on the DL May 6. LHP Wade Miley (2-4, 3.97) will get the start on Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals in Baltimore. He has failed to give the Orioles some length, not going past the third inning in his past two starts and allowing at four runs in four of his last six starts. INF Ryan Flaherty (right shoulder strain) continues to recover after he went on the disabled list.  He is inching along. He is frustrated with how long it is taking,  said Buck Showalter, the Orioles manager. RHP Ubaldo Jimenez will start Sunday for the Orioles, manager Buck Showalter said Friday.  He has thrown well in the bullpen,  Showalter said. He began the year in the rotation that was sent to the bullpen after a poor start at home against the Minnesota Twins in May. OF Seth Smith, slowed by back woes, started at home Friday against the Chicago White Sox and has managed to avoid the disabled list so far. He was available to pinch-hit Thursday in Chicago against the White Sox, manager Buck Showalter said Friday. Smith was 1-for-2 Friday. 1B Chris Davis (right oblique strain) has been uncomfortable sleeping, manager Buck Showalter said Friday. He went on the DL on June 14, retroactive to June 13. RHP Darren O'Day (right shoulder strain) is eligible to come off the disabled list Saturday.  He is eligible tomorrow; he won't make that,  manager Buck Showalter said Friday. Showalter hopes O'Day may be ready early next week and may not have to make any minor league rehab outings.

It's something I used to struggle with a lot, especially my first couple of years when I really struggled. I made some improvements on that over a couple of years. But, once in a while, it kind of flares up a little bit. ... I'm quite frustrated with that, but it's nicer to at least know what it is rather than having no idea.  1B Justin Smoak hit his team-leading 19th homer of the season, a two-run blast in the ninth inning of the 11-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Friday night. He is one homer short of his career best set in 2013. RHP Marcus Stroman (7-2, 3.09 ERA) is 6-0 with a 2.77 ERA in his past 10 starts with hitters going .259/.315/.362 against him. He has not lost since April 18, his third start of the season. He will be trying to make it seven straight winning decisions Saturday when he faces the Chicago White Sox in the middle of a three-game series at Rogers Centre. Stroman is 2-2 with a 3.20 ERA in seven starts this season at home. He is 0-2 with a 7.11 ERA in seven career starts against the White Sox. INF/OF Steve Pearce (strained right calf) was reinstated from the disabled list Friday, started in left field and homered in his first at-bat in the 11-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox. He was 1-for-2 with a walk. He filled the roster spot left when INF/OF Chris Coghlan (left wrist contusion) was put on the DL on Friday. Pearce completed a rehabilitation assignment at Double-A New Hampshire and Triple-A Buffalo, going 2-for-22 (.091) combined. He was batting .205/.256/.373 when he went on the DL. INF/OF Chris Coghlan (left wrist contusion) was put on the 10-day disabled list Friday and his roster spot was taken by INF/OF Steve Pearce (strained right calf), who was activated from the disabled list and started in left field.

He is batting .375 (15-for-40) during the streak, the second-longest behind SS Xander Bogaerts by a Boston player this season. Moreland is one shy of his career-best streak of 11 games, done twice in 2015. RHP Carson Smith had his scheduled rehab assignment for Sunday pushed back due to shoulder inflammation. Smith tossed a simulated inning earlier this week and was set to report to Triple-A Pawtucket for his first game since undergoing Tommy John surgery last May. RHP Joe Kelly extended his career-long scoreless appearance streak to 17 games by allowing one hit and one walk over 2/3 scoreless innings. Kelly earned the win in relief and has a 15-game winning streak, the longest active streak in the majors. RF Mookie Betts extended his hitting streak against Houston to 13 games with a go-ahead solo home run in the eighth inning off Astros RHP Will Harris. Betts is batting .373 (22-for-59) with two homers and 14 RBIs during the streak. Betts also has nine extra-base hits in his last nine games while 11 of his 12 homers have come on the road.

The first eight Cubs batters reached but Williams then retired 12 in a row before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the fifth after throwing 76 pitches.  I thought he got into a nice routine again,  manager Clint Hurdle said, adding that it wasn't easy to lift Williams for pinch-hitter John Jaso.  Started getting in a rhythm, aggressive. Two-seamer played. The slider. The mix was really good for innings two through five for him.  RHP Juan Nicasio (1-3), one of the pitchers who has moved into the closer's role, took the loss. He pitched to four batters in the ninth, giving up four runs on three hits without getting an out. LHP Tony Watson came in during Chicago's game-turning rally in the ninth inning. He allowed two runs on three hits in two-thirds of an inning. It might have seemed a curious move given that Watson was recently removed as Pittsburgh's closer, but manager Clint Hurdle didn't want to throw a less experienced reliever into that spot.  It would have been (Edgar) Santana or (Jhan) Marinez right there,  Hurdle said.  Tony's seen these guys. He's pitched a lot of leverage situations. That wasn't the plan going in, either. We got to the point where we tried to do the best we could with where we were, and we couldn't get out of it.  1B Josh Bell was 2-for-4 with a homer and a triple, driving in three of Pittsburgh's five runs and scoring another. He wasn't sure his leadoff homer to left-center in the fifth was gone.  No, definitely not,  Bell said.  I knew I squared it up good, but I didn't know it was going to carry like that. I've short-hopped that fence three or four times now, so it was cool to finally clear it.  Conversely, he thought his two-run triple in the sixth might have been gone.  I was just stoked that I got the ball up in the air,  he said.  For a split second, yeah, (I thought it might go out), but I'll take a triple.  RHP Shane Baz signed with the Pirates. He was selected by Pittsburgh 12th overall in the draft earlier this week. He turns 18 Saturday.  I might have the best 18th birthday of all time,  he said. Baz was 6-2 with a 0.93 ERA with 96 strikeouts this season for Concordia Lutheran High School in Tomball, Texas.

CF Charlie Blackmon hit his major-league leading 10th triple of the season on Friday night and established a career high in that category. Blackmon had nine triples in 2015 and now has 29 triples in his career, which ranks sixth in Rockies history. 2B DJ LeMahieu went 4-for-4 with a double and two RBIs on Friday night.

He gave up all four runs in the second inning when he walked to first two batters he faced then allowed four hits, including a double.  His arm slot, he just couldn't seem to find,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  Then he found it about the fourth inning and was really pretty good after that. That happens, too. Can't really tell you why it happens but it happens.  C Kyle Higashioka was recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Friday. With No. 1 C Gary Sanchez nursing a sore groin, the Yankees needed a healthy catcher to back up C Austin Romine. Higashioka is on his second career major-league stint, both this year with the Yankees. He's 0-for-18 with two runs and two walks in nine games when Sanchez was on the DL with a biceps injury. He did not get into Friday night's 7-6 loss to Oakland. RHP Giovanny Gallegos was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Friday.

Williams, who began his first stint of the season with the Yankees, played 20 games for them the previous two seasons, batting .292 with four doubles, one home run, five RBIs and seven runs. The Yankees chose him in the fourth round of the 2010 draft.  He's a tremendous competitor,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  With us he's had good at-bats.  RF Aaron Judge hit his major-league high 23rd home run of the season, a three-run blast in the third inning Friday night in a 7-6 loss to Oakland. Judge sent LHP Sean Manaea's 0-1 changeup into the right field seats for an opposite-field homer. The home run was Judge's fifth in his past seven games. The rookie reached base safely for the 18th straight game, a career high. Judge went 2-for-3 with a home run, a triple, two walks, two runs and three RBIs, giving him 52 for the season. C Gary Sanchez (strained groin) missed Friday night's game against Oakland and remained day-to-day.

He's the first Dodgers pitcher to begin a season with 10 or more consecutive starts without a loss since Orel Hershiser went 11 starts to begin the 1985 campaign.  He worked every quadrant tonight,  said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  His ability to locate and command all three pitches. Very rarely does a pitcher have the command of all three of his pitchers like he's had for this period of time.  Eight innings pitched tied a career high for Wood, who struck out five and did not walk a batter in his 10th start. He also contributed a two-out single in the eighth inning to drive in a run. It was his second hit and third RBI of the season.  I closed my eyes and got a knock,  Wood said. While on the mound, he worked ahead in the count for most of the night and said he only regretted four of his 89 pitches. RHP Josh Ravin was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City on Friday. It's his second stint with the Dodgers this season.  He's really dominating right-hand hitters, according to our reports,  said manager Dave Roberts.  It's just getting that slider to be what it is. He's got a big arm. If he's got the fastball strike and throwing the slider the way he can, (then) he's getting lefties and righties out.  Roberts said situations will dictate how Ravin is used.

He's a part of what we're doing right now and we need him to be good going forward. Just mentally to get away and reset will be beneficial for him.  In his past two appearances, Stripling allowed seven earned runs on 10 hits, including a pair of homers in 3 2/3 innings.

Last year, Hill posted a 1.83 ERA in six starts after joining the Dodgers and delivered some clutch performances in the postseason.  There are guys you have certain expectations,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Friday.  With Rich, in particular, you invest in a guy and what we saw last year a guy who can pitch in big games and be elite. We've got to get him back to that. He demands more from himself than anyone.

LHP Patrick Corbin evened his record at 6-6 on Friday night, getting picked up by his offense in a 5-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.

Hegave up five hits and four runs (two earned) while striking out five and walking none.  I think he threw the ball really well,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  The line score might not show it, but the mistakes he made were identifiable. 3B Jake Lamb extended his MLB-leading RBI total to 58 on Friday night with a sacrifice fly that scored what proved to be the winning run in a 5-4 victory. In 11 career games against the Phillies, he's hitting .386 (17-of-44) with 12 RBIs.

Just give it tonight and hopefully we'll be ready to go tomorrow.  Manager Bruce Bochy, commenting on Posey feeling better and likely returning to the lineup Saturday, said,  I don't know if we could've got better news, because he was in a lot of pain.

Manager Craig Counsell said finalizing plans for Braun were complicated by the upcoming minor league all-star breaks. Braun has missed 29 games in two separate stints on the DL for the calf, including the last 22 since being sidelined May 26.","keywords":"Brett Phillips,Corey Knebel,Craig Counsell,Eric Sogard,Jonathan Villar,Lewis Brinson,Ryan Braun,BBO,BREWERS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Milwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9Q2L"}
{"content":"RHP Tim Adleman produced a quality start Friday night against the Dodgers, but four walks and almost constant traction made it seem less so. The four walks tied a career high for Adleman, who allowed two runs on five hits in six innings over his 108 pitches. I thought he did a nice job,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  He's been our most consistent pitcher over his last five or six starts, and that's what we need. That's a good sign.  C Stuart Turner could be activated from the disabled list Sunday.  Today is the final day of 20, then he has a travel day, so he could be activated on Sunday,  Reds manager Bryan Price said Friday.  We'll get through the first two games of this series, then see where we are.  Turner batted .148 in 13 games but was valuable off the bench while Devin Mesoraco was rehabbing shoulder and hip injuries. 3B Eugenio Suarez was a shortstop by trade prior to being acquired by the Reds. With Zack Cozart and Jose Peraza locked into the middle infield positions, Suarez had to learn how to play third and has worked hard to become an above-average defender at the hot corner.  The transition over to third base was not rosy, but I think he's done a phenomenal job,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  I get to see him every day, and I think he and Nolan Arenado are the top two defensive players.  Suarez doubled in three at-bats in Friday's game. RHP Homer Bailey threw a bullpen Friday and is scheduled to make his next rehab start for Triple-A Louisville on Monday.  He looked as good as ever,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  He needs to get more innings and get stretched out. Then we'll reassess.  Bailey has made just eight starts the past two seasons due to multiple elbow surgeries.","keywords":"Bryan Price,Devin Mesoraco,Eugenio Suarez,Homer Bailey,Jose Peraza,Nolan Arenado,Stuart Turner,Tim Adleman,Zack Cozart,BBO,REDS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Cincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P2K"}
{"content":"2B Ian Happ played in his hometown for the first time. The rookie went 2-for-5 with a single and a double, and scored a run. He moved to center field later in the game and finished with two putouts and two assists. 1B Anthony Rizzo was 1-for-4 with a two-run single in the ninth. He also walked and scored in the first, but that could have been a bigger inning for him. He led off the game with a blast to right field that cleared the seating and one-bounced into the Allegheny River. It was initially called a homer, then reversed by the umpires to a foul ball. Cubs manager Joe Maddon was so livid that the initial call did not stand and was not reviewed that he argued until he got ejected. Rizzo thought it was the wrong call.  That was absolutely a home run,  he said.  There is no way it could have gone over the pole foul because this is one of the shortest right fields in the league. I hit it too hard for it to have time to go foul. I respect the umpires and I never like to criticize them because I know they give their very best, but they got that one. At least we won the game and that's all that really matters.  3B Tommy La Stella was recalled from Triple-A Iowa to take Ben Zobrist's roster spot. He started and was 2-for-4 with a double and a run scored. La Stella was with the Cubs for 16 games last month, going 3-for-7 (.304) with a homer. With Iowa, La Stella was hitting .213 with a .266 slugging percentage, one home run and four RBIs. RHP Eddie Butler allowed four runs on four hits, with three walks and no strikeouts, through 5 2/3 innings after initially shutting down the Pirates. Butler did not allow a hit through 3 1/3 innings. He pitched to the minimum numbers of batters to that point, 10. Then he didn't last the sixth, when he left after Pittsburgh scored twice to tie it and also got charged with a go-ahead run.  I started to get tired,  Butler said.  I lost some velocity in that inning, but I still could have gotten through it if I had located my pitches better. I kept trying to get that third out and I just never got it.  2B Ben Zobrist was put on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Tuesday, because of left wrist inflammation.  I tried to swing right-handed, and it still wasn't good,  Zobrist told the Chicago Sun-Times.  At this point, you don't want to have the team be down a player.  Zobrist hurt the wrist on a swing May 26. He is 5-for-49 (.102) since.  I thought we were trending right every time I would talk to him, but it wasn't getting better,  manager Joe Maddon said.  It wasn't getting worse, but it wasn't getting better. So we thought if we were going to continue to have that same dialog, let's just shut it down, calm it down so he can come back and play like he can. Hopefully, minimal stay.

{"content":"RHP John Brebbia has impressed manager Mike Matheny after he threw two scoreless innings and allowed just one hit Wednesday against the Milwaukee Brewers. That lowered his ERA to 2.08 this year in eight appearances out of the bullpen.  Just one of those great surprises for our club,  Matheny said Friday.  He is doing a great job. I didn't know much about him.  2B Paul DeJong, in his 14th big league game, had three straight hits Friday, with a two-run homer. That was his second career homer and he ended the night with three RBIs. He became just the third St. Louis player to collects three hits, score three runs, drive in three runs and hit a homer out of the No. 9 spot in the batting order, joining All-Star pitchers Dizzy Dean (1937) and Bob Gibson (1965).  It was a fun night to be a Cardinal,  said DeJong (pronounced de-YOUNG), standing by his locker.  Sometimes I over-swing and don't make contact. Hitting is contagious sometimes and tonight was one of those.  The Florida native made his MLB debut on May 28 and hit a homer in his first Major League at-bat. DeJong is now hitting .286 with a .469 slugging mark. On Friday he started at second base and was one of five St. Louis players to homer off a beleaguered Baltimore pitching staff. Other homers came from Matt Carpenter, Dexter Fowler, Tommy Pham and Jedd Gyorko, playing in front of family from Morgantown, West Virginia. RHP Carlos Martinez allowed just four hits for the fourth game in a row. He has allowed just one run in his last two outings.  He's just in a nice place right now, making good pitches,  manager Mike Matheny said. RHP Luke Weaver, who pitched in nine games for the Cardinals last year as a rookie, has been with Triple-Memphis this year and last pitched June 11. He has experienced some back tightness, manager Mike Matheny said Friday. Weaver, a first-round draft pick in 2014 out of Florida State, is 6-1 with a 2.33 in nine starts for Memphis. RHP Adam Wainwright will start on Saturday at Baltimore. He has not gone longer than five innings in his last two starts but did get the win Sunday over the Philadelphia Phillies as he gave up six hits and two runs with four strikeouts in five innings. Wainwright is 7-4 with a 4.73 ERA. OF Dexter Fowler as the used as the DH on Friday in Baltimore. Fowler hit a homer in the sixth, coming after a longball by Matt Carpenter. It was the second time this year the Cardinals hit back-to-back homers. Fowler was 2-for-3 Friday and is hitting .245. St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said he take it one game at time as far as his DH for the series. Fowler got some boos from the fans as they recall that appeared to have signed with the Orioles prior to the 2015 season, before he went to the Chicago Cubs. LHP Brett Cecil changed his uniform to No. 21 from No. 27. Cecil, a University of Maryland product, had worn No. 21 when he was with the Toronto Blue Jays but when he got to St. Louis this season that number was worn by Jhonny Peralta, who was released earlier this week by the Cardinals.

{"content":"IF Matt Reynolds was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas on Friday. Reynolds returned to the Mets just six days after he was optioned to Las Vegas, but he is allowed to return before the usual 10-day waiting period because he was called up to replace an injured player. This is the third trip to the majors this season for Reynolds, who was first recalled Apr. 26 and is batting .174 with one homer and one RBI in 20 games. He is expected to serve as a backup infielder for the Mets. Reynolds batted .286 with one homer and five RBIs in 15 games for Las Vegas. RHP Seth Lugo will make his second start of the season Saturday afternoon, when he takes the mound for the Mets in the third game of a four-game series against the Washington Nationals at Citi Field. Lugo, who missed the first 60 games of the season with a partially torn right UCL suffered while pitching for Team Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic, won his debut on Sunday after allowing one run on six hits and two walks while striking out six over seven innings as the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves, 2-1. He is 1-0 with a 1.00 ERA in two games (one start) against the Nationals. RHP Matt Harvey (stress injury to the scapula bone in his right shoulder) was officially placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday, retroactive to Thursday. Harvey was diagnosed with the injury Thursday, one day after his fastball was clocked in the mid-to-high 80s and he complained of a tired arm during a four-inning start against the Chicago Cubs. He is expected to miss at least several weeks. This is the third major arm injury suffered by Harvey, who missed the 2014 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery and made just 17 starts last season before undergoing surgery to repair thoracic outlet syndrome in July. Harvey is 4-3 with a 5.25 ERA in 13 starts this season and 8-13 with a 5.02 ERA since the start of 2016. CF Juan Lagares (broken IP joint in his left thumb) was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday. Lagares was injured Thursdaynight, when he dove while trying to catch a sinking liner by Nationals 3B Anthony Rendon. There is no timetable for Lagares' return. The trip to the disabled list is the fifth of Lagares' five-year career and the third in the last two seasons due to a left thumb injury. He was placed on the disabled list exactly a year ago Friday with a sprained left thumb and remained on the shelf until July 2. He was sidelined again, this time due to a torn ligament in the thumb, from July 29 through Sept. 16. Lagares is batting .269 with two homers and eight RBIs in 47 games this season, including .379 with one homer and six RBIs in his last nine games dating back to June 6.

Nimmo batted .223 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 38 games for Las Vegas. He is expected to serve as a backup outfielder for the Mets. Nimmo made his major league debut last season, when he batted .274 with one homer and six RBIs in 32 games. OF Michael Conforto returned to the starting lineup Friday, when he went 0-for-3 as the Mets fell to the Nationals, 7-2. Conforto didn't start the previous four games due to a stiff back, though he got an at-bat apiece on Wednesday, when he served as a pinch-hitter, and Thursday, when he entered as a defensive replacement. He is expected to remain the Mets' everyday leadoff batter. Conforto is batting .286 with 14 homers and 36 RBIs in 60 games this season.

Let's get 20, 30, 40 at-bats, some consistent work, which he has not gotten. Who's to say what will happen in the next five days, 10 days, but much rather have him with a bank of at-bats and ready to go than sitting on the bench and not getting consistent ABs.  Rua is hitting .202 but with only four at-bats since June 7. LHP Dario Alvarez is making his third stint with the Rangers in 2017 after being recalled from Triple-A Round Rock.

Ross exceeded just about every expectation, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning of the Rangers' 10-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Friday. Ross, who hadn't pitched since Opening Day of 2016 for San Diego because of shoulder problems that ultimately led to off-season thoracic surgery, Ross retired the next nine hitters after a leadoff walk and 14 of the next 15.  His official line was 5 2/3 innings pitched, two hits, two runs, three walks and five strikeouts. The victory was his first since Aug. 31, 2015, coincidentally against the Rangers at Petco Park.  I'm pretty stoic in my demeanor, but inside I was real excited to be out there, crossing over those white lines and being handed the ball,  Ross said.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm just happy I was able to do a good job for the team and put us in a position to win. It's a long road, it's tough to go through, and I'm happy to be back in action and I look forward to moving forward.  INF/OF Jurickson Profar was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock before the Rangers' 10-4 victory over Seattle on Friday. Profar was hitting .137.

He threw 22 more pitches afterward in the bullpen. 1B Mike Napoli returned to Texas  lineup after a stint on the disabled list with a strained lower back, going 1-for-4 in the Rangers' 10-4 victory over Seattle on Friday. He'll share time with Joey Gallo at first, though, manager Jeff Banister said the rotation won't be a platoon. The more versatile and athletic Gallo can play four positions, including DH, so he'll see time elsewhere. Napoli returned to the active roster with a .192 average with 11 home runs including eight in May -- and 25 RBIs over 51 games. He returned after only one injury rehab game, at Double-A Frisco, going 0-for-4 on Thursday.

Before his injury, Gomez was batting .246 with four home runs and 13 RBIs in 38 games. Gomez saw time in four injury rehab games with Double-A Frisco and Triple-A Round Rock, going 3-for-14 with a homer and three RBIs.  When he left he was swinging the bat very well,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  He was hot.  The Rangers are hoping he still is. RHP Dillon Gee was designated for assignment by the Rangers to make room for RHP Tyson Ross on the 40-man roster. Gee, who has pitched in parts of eight seasons, was 0-0 with a 4.15 ERA in four games, including one start. The Rangers have seven days to trade, release or outright Gee to the minors.  I hope he gets claimed and put on someone's big-league team, that's how much I think of him,  manager Jeff Banister said.","keywords":"Adrian Beltre,Carlos Gomez,Cole Hamels,Dario Alvarez,Dillon Gee,Jeff Banister,Joey Gallo,Mike Napoli,Mike Zunino,Ryan Rua,Tony Barnette,Tyson Ross,BBO,RANGERS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Texas Rangers - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P2B"}
{"content":"RHP Cam Bedrosian, the Angels' closer to start the season, is expected to be activated from the disabled list Saturday. He has been on the DL since April 22 because of a strained groin. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said only that Bedrosian would be used in the  back end  of the bullpen, not committing him to the closer's role right away. RHP Bud Norris has pitched well as the closer in Bedrosian's absence, posting 11 saves with a 2.59 ERA and .200 opposing hitters batting average. RHP Alex Meyer will start Saturday against the Royals. Meyer gave up two runs and five hits in his last start Monday against the Yankees but lasted only 4 2/3 innings because of a high pitch count (93). He did have five strikeouts, including Yankees RF Aaron Judge twice.  I've seen him in the minor leagues,  Judge said.  He's a great guy, electric stuff as well. A fastball with good two-seam action and a wipeout slider. A guy like that you have to focus on location or pick out a pitch and stick to it. He's good, really good.  Meyer has never faced the Royals. RHP Matt Shoemaker is not likely to make his next scheduled start Tuesday in New York against the Yankees. Shoemaker had to leave his last start Wednesday against the Yankees in the fourth inning because of a strained muscle in his right forearm. Because of an off-day Monday, the Angels could skip Shoemaker's place in the rotation and not have to find another starter. RHP Jesse Chavez gave up two runs and nine hits in seven innings on Friday against the Royals while taking the loss. The only two runs he gave up were driven in by OF Lorenzo Cain, who hit a solo homer in the third inning and had a two-out RBI single in the fifth. Chavez has been hit or miss in his 14 starts this season -- he has allowed five runs or more in four starts but two runs or fewer in seven starts, including Friday.  Jesse's success is really contingent on making pitches,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  What we're hopeful of is as he gets into that third time around the order, that 18th, 19th out where he can finish seven like he did, then he's going to have success. He's pitched this deep before in games. Tonight he had good rhythm and good tempo and made pitches. Jesse keeps trying to evolve as a pitcher and I think he did some things tonight that will continue to move him forward.  OF Eric Young Jr. had started all 17 Angels games since the club called him up May 29 to replace injured CF Mike Trout on the roster, but Young was not in the starting lineup Friday against Kansas City. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he wanted to give Young a breather. Young has performed well playing both left and center field, hitting .316 with three doubles, three homers, 10 RBIs, 14 runs scored, six stolen bases and a .409 on-base percentage. Young got into Friday's game as a pinch hitter and struck out. OF Ben Revere started in left field for the Angels on Friday against the Royals, just his second start in the past nine games. With OF Cameron Maybin healthy and OF Eric Young Jr. playing well, Revere hasn't been used much but got a chance Friday and went 1-for-3 with a single.","keywords":"Aaron Judge,Alex Meyer,Ben Revere,Bud Norris,Cam Bedrosian,Cameron Maybin,Eric Young Jr.,Jesse Chavez,Lorenzo Cain,Matt Shoemaker,Mike Scioscia,Mike Trout,BBO,ANGELS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Los Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P2A"}
{"content":"LHP Daniel Coulombe (1-1) pitched 1 1/3 perfect innings of relief and earned his first victory of the season Friday night in a 7-6 win against the Yankees. Coulombe lowered his ERA to 1.99. He has not allowed a run in 16 of his past 17 appearances. He has not allowed a run in four career appearances against the Yankees over 4 1/3 innings. LHP Sean Manaea allowed five runs on eight hits, including home runs to RF Aaron Judge and 1B Chris Carter, over six innings with seven strikeouts and two walks in a no-decision on Friday night in a 7-6 victory against the Yankees at the Oakland Coliseum. He had gone 5-0 with a 1.97 ERA in his previous five starts, including a 4-1 victory at Yankee Stadium on May 26.  I left a couple pitches up, a few mistake pitches and that's kind of what cost me, led to the home run and the solo shot in the sixth inning,  Manaea said. SS Marcus Semien (right wrist surgery) took pre-game batting practice for the first time Friday night since going on the disabled list April 15. Manager Bob Melvin said there's a chance Semien could begin a rehab assignment late next week. Last season, Semien had 27 doubles, 27 home runs and 75 RBIs, all career highs. 3B Matt Chapman had a two-run single in the eighth inning -- his first major-league hit -- lifting the Oakland Athletics to a 7-6 victory against the New York Yankees on Friday night at the Oakland Coliseum. Chapman singled off Yankees RHP Jonathan Holder with the bases loaded after the Yankees intentionally walked C Stephen Vogt.  The kid is here for a reason,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Chapman, who made his major-league debut Thursday against the Yankees.  We've seen in spring training he's a tough kid. He wants to play, he likes to play. He's not afraid of the situations.  Chapman had his first major-league RBI with one out in the second inning on a ground out to third base that initially was ruled an infield single. After a video review, Chapman was ruled out, taking away his hit.  I guess having your first hit taken away from you, just was waiting for something sweeter,  Chapman said. RF Matt Joyce went 2-for-3 with a walk and had his eighth multi-hit game of the season on Friday in a 7-6 victory against the Yankees. He extended his hitting streak to four games and has gone 5-for-10 during that stretch.","keywords":"Aaron Judge,Bob Melvin,Chris Carter,Daniel Coulombe,Jonathan Holder,Marcus Semien,Matt Chapman,Matt Joyce,Sean Manaea,Stephen Vogt,BBO,ATHLETICS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Oakland Athletics - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P29"}
{"content":"LHP Zac Curtis was recalled from Double-A Arkansas before Seattle?s 10-4 loss to Texas on Friday. His reintroduction to the majors was a rough one. Curtis gave up three runs on four hits -- including a three-run home run by Carlos Gomez -- and a walk in three innings of Seattle's 10-4 loss to Texas. In his first stint with the club, Curtis appeared in two games, striking out one in 12/3 scoreless innings. Curtis, recently selected to the Texas League All-Star team, was 0-2 with a 2.66 ERA in 19 relief appearances at Double-A. RHP Chase De Jong was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma before the Mariners' 10-4 loss to Texas on Friday. In four stints with Seattle, the 23-year-old, who made his major-league debut on April 5, is 0-3 with a 6.35 ERA and 13 strikeouts in seven games, including six starts. In his last outing, he allowed only one hit, two walks while striking out two over four scoreless innings. LHP James Paxton doesn't like where he is right now after struggling for a second straight start. Paxton (5-2) gave up seven runs on seven hits and three walks while striking out four over 3 2/3 innings in taking the loss as Seattle fell 10-4 to Texas on Friday night. Two consecutive two-out walks in a five-run third were backbreakers. Elvis Andrus followed with an RBI double and Beltre drove in two with a base hit.  He just doesn't have any rhythm at all,  manager Scott Servais said.  Even the secondary stuff wasn't very sharp tonight as well. It is what it is. We've got figure it out. Everything looks like a struggle. He's a big part, trying to dig us out of this little hole we've created here. We've got to get him right, back on track.  RHP Mike Clevenger will be recalled from Triple-A Columbus to start the second game of Saturday's doubleheader in Minnesota. Manager Terry Francona said Clevenger will be called up as the 26th man for the doubleheader, which would leave him still available to make his next start in Baltimore because of the 26th man rules for doubleheaders. Clevenger needs to be reassigned to Triple-A after the game but isn't subject to the 10-day waiting period to be recalled. RF Mitch Haniger, like Ben Gamel, another impressive Seattle rookie, was back on base in Seattle's 10-4 loss to Texas on Friday. He was 1-for-3 a day after failing to reach base for the first time in games he has played in, snapping a streak of 25 games. He had hits in 21 of those. He is now hitting .327. LHP Vidal Nuno was called up from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday. He is 1-3 with a 3.00 ERA in 13 games this year for the Tides. He gave up one run in two innings Friday as the Orioles lost 11-2. LF Ben Gamel continues to impress his manager with his outlook at the plate. He was good again on Friday, albeit in a 10-4 loss to Texas, going 1-for-2 with two walks and three runs. Since making his season debut on April 29, Gamel is hitting .347 with 32 runs, 12 doubles, two triples, two home runs and 20 RBIs in 46 games. He has reached base in 14 of his last 24 plate appearances. What's his secret?  He's not trying to hit homers, in a nutshell,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  There's so much emphasis on hitting home runs in our games. He's just trying to have good at-bats and it's worked out really well for him. It allows him to use the whole field.

{"content":"C/1B John Hicks was recalled from Triple-A Toledo on Friday night, his third tour of action with Detroit this season. In 14 previous games with the Tigers, Hicks is batting .306 with three home runs and 12 RBI. RHP Warwick Saupold has had some success serving as a bridge man for Detroit this season. Saupold was brought in with a man on first, nobody out and a run having scored in the seventh. That made it 13-3, however, and Saupold protected the lead with two innings of shutout relief. He's turned in three strong relief outings and one clunker. 1B Alex Avila replaced DH Miguel Cabrera as the first baseman on Friday night. He'll catch some, play first and be the designated hitter as manager Brad Ausmus rotates players as his designated hitter while DH Victor Martinez is out.  Alex Avila, the way he's swinging the bat, we'd like to keep him in the lineup,  Ausmus said.  This is a good way to keep him in the lineup without having him catch all the time.  Avila was the swing man on a 1-3-2 double play that thwarted a steal of home attempt by CF Mallex Smith in the fourth inning and also hit a leadoff home run, his 10th, that triggered a four-run fourth. RF J.D. Martinez moved up from fifth to fourth in the batting order Friday night and will probably reside in that spot while DH Victor Martinez is on the disabled list.  I'm hoping he's all right,  he said of Victor Martinez.  It's not going to change anything for me. They all know (how to pitch to) me anyway.  LHP Daniel Norris went two batters into the seventh Friday night and left with a big lead that made him the winning pitcher.  He was good,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  With some of the time in the dugout with the high-scoring innings, I think that kind of caught up with him there at the end, but I thought he threw very well. He was better at throwing strikes.  Norris gave up a triple and a single to open the seventh and was replaced by RHP Warwick Saupold. DH Miguel Cabrera served as Detroit's designated hitter Friday night in the absence of DH Victor Martinez, placed on the disabled list with an irregular heartbeat.  It may be depending on the opposing pitcher,  manager Brad Ausmus said of his DH situation.  There may be some kind of rotation. Kevin Rand came and said Miggy's hip was bothering him. So I just figured the obvious choice would be Miggy. As long as he's able to hit. Of course, Miggy being Miggy, said, 'Why don't you DH Alex (Avila)?' I said that's a good idea and I might some time but I figure if we can get you off your feet rather than standing for nine innings, maybe we can knock this thing out.  Cabrera doubled and scored a run in the five-run fifth but also had a key walk to help Detroit score five times in the fourth. He may be back at first base Saturday. DH Victor Martinez was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. Martinez was hospitalized overnight after reporting cold sweats and a racing heartbeat during Detroit's 5-3 win over Tampa Bay.  I talked to Vic,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  It's a little bit scary. It's not something at his age you generally consider an issue or worry about. That being said, he's making it through. There's a little bit of an unknown factor that's causing more anxiety than anything else.  Ausmus said he expected to have more information on Saturday because Martinez was being held overnight for more observation and tests.","keywords":"Alex Avila,Brad Ausmus,Daniel Norris,John Hicks,Kevin Rand,Miguel Cabrera,Victor Martinez,Warwick Saupold,BBO,TIGERS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-17 13:01:00","news_title":"Detroit Tigers - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P27"}

{"content":"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer denied allegations made by a billionaire businessman in a magazine interview published on Saturday that he led a corruption scheme in which politicians squeezed high-profile executives for bribes, and vowed to sue the businessman. In a statement, Temer's office said he will take  all appropriate actions  against billionaire Joesley Batista, who told Época magazine that the 77-year-old politician has run a bribe-for-favors scheme at the government since 2010.  In his first interview since striking a leniency agreement with Brazilian prosecutors, Batista told Época that Temer asked for money several times in recent years as he led a group of senior politicians regularly demanding kickbacks in exchange for political favors.  Temer is the leader of a lower house criminal organization,  Época quoted Batista as saying.  Those who are not under arrest are in the government. They're very dangerous.  Temer's lawyers said in the statement released by his office that they will file civil and criminal lawsuits against Batista as early as Monday. Press representatives for Batista and his family's investment holding company, J&F; Investimentos SA, were not immediately available for comment. The coming week already promises to be a tense one for Temer and Batista, one of Brazil's richest businessmen. The Supreme Court is to discuss the validity of Batista's plea deal, and Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot could file charges against the president for corruption accusations that Batista made in May. Temer, in his statement on Saturday, rebuffed Batista's allegations in the Época interview that, saying that the billionaire repeatedly sought Temer's help for his personal benefit but was denied.  FILE PHOTO: Brazil's President Michel Temer speaks at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil, May 18, 2017.Ueslei Marcelino/File PhotoTemer also attacked terms of the leniency deal that allowed Batista to escape prosecution, saying in the statement that the terms made the billionaire  Brazil's most successful criminal ever.  The statement said Batista's testimonies  puts the blame of his crimes on others, while protecting his real partners.  The statement did not identify anyone. Threat of Ouster Last week, Temer escaped the threat of ouster as president after Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case over alleged illegal campaign funding for the 2014 election - in which he ran on the same ticket of former President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached last year on accusation she oversaw the doctoring of budget accounts.

Batista denied having ordered insider trades at JBS, according to the Época interview, adding that he believed they were all made in line with the law. He said J&F; will sell  as many assets as necessary  to quash concerns about the group's solvency.

{"content":"HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - French sailing hero Franck Cammas is hoping that defending champions Oracle Team USA will beat Emirates Team New Zealand and win the America's Cup to ensure France's future in the competition. Much more is at stake than who wins the  Auld Mug , the world's oldest international sporting trophy, as the final of the competition gets underway in Bermuda's Great Sound on Saturday. A win by New Zealand could threaten France's continued sponsorship by French insurance group Groupama [GRPMHA.UL] as the Kiwis have not signed up to a framework agreement that was designed to ensure continuity for the competition.     Yes, I'm hoping for an Oracle win, it's just my point of view for Team France ... Oracle will be good for the future of the America’s Cup itself,  the French skipper said. If New Zealand are victorious, the location and format of the regatta as well as the high-adrenalin 50-foot foiling catamarans that are battling for sailing's ultimate prize could change dramatically.  All five other teams signed up to the framework agreement in January, which aims to encourage more teams to compete by using the same boats to cut the multi-million dollar costs of mounting a campaign, encouraging more teams to participate, and helps to secure television broadcast rights.  If we have to change hulls, its almost twice the price to have our chance to perform,  Cammas said.  The French team is waiting to hear if Groupama will continue their sponsorship, which is expected within the month, after a good performance in the America's Cup despite coming to the competition late and with the smallest budget.  I’m pretty sure Groupama won’t go if the Kiwis win so we have to change out proposal. We will try but I think we will have less chance to achieve that,  Cammas said.  The French are working on other funding alternatives as they wait to hear if they will be able to continue their campaign, which produced a competitive boat and crew in a remarkably short space of time.      Convincing Victories Despite the odds, Cammas and his crew proved that their boat was fast and had winning form, with unexpected but convincing victories over Sweden's Artemis Racing by three seconds and Britain's Land Rover BAR.  Cammas, a former Jules Verne Trophy holder and skipper of Groupama Team France, is one of France's most accomplished sailors. Although it was sometimes difficult for him to be coming from behind, he and his team now have a clearer vision of what it takes to perform in the America's Cup. Uncertainty around the format is, however, making the French team's story a difficult commercial sell. Securing sponsorship quickly is vital as the hi-tech boats are so complex that they require design and sailing time that the French team just did not have this time around.   If you go to the sponsor now and you tell them we don't know where the competition is, which boat or how much money we need, we cannot sell anything,  Cammas said.  Despite the difficulties of not knowing, Cammas is determined to keep his campaign and team together at their base in Lorient, Brittany.    My first objective is to do the next campaign with more possibility of performance,  he added.  Cammas, who showed his determination by battling back to the peak levels of fitness required to sail the demanding boats after a serious injury in training in late 2015 nearly severed his foot, sees his future with the America's Cup, which remains his goal.   Before the first match I was very happy to be at the start line against Oracle, it was the first time for me and the America’s Cup is my dream,  he said.

Much more is at stake than who wins the  Auld Mug , the world's oldest international sporting trophy, as the final of the competition gets underway in Bermuda's Great Sound on Saturday. A win by New Zealand could threaten France's continued sponsorship by French insurance group Groupama as the Kiwis have not signed up to a framework agreement that was designed to ensure continuity for the competition.  Yes, I'm hoping for an Oracle win, it's just my point of view for Team France ... Oracle will be good for the future of the America’s Cup itself,  the French skipper said. If New Zealand are victorious, the location and format of the regatta as well as the high-adrenalin 50-foot foiling catamarans that are battling for sailing's ultimate prize could change dramatically. All five other teams signed up to the framework agreement in January, which aims to encourage more teams to compete by using the same boats to cut the multi-million dollar costs of mounting a campaign, encouraging more teams to participate, and helps to secure television broadcast rights.  If we have to change hulls, its almost twice the price to have our chance to perform,  Cammas said. The French team is waiting to hear if Groupama will continue their sponsorship, which is expected within the month, after a good performance in the America's Cup despite coming to the competition late and with the smallest budget.  I’m pretty sure Groupama won’t go if the Kiwis win so we have to change out proposal. We will try but I think we will have less chance to achieve that,  Cammas said. The French are working on other funding alternatives as they wait to hear if they will be able to continue their campaign, which produced a competitive boat and crew in a remarkably short space of time. Convincing Victories Despite the odds, Cammas and his crew proved that their boat was fast and had winning form, with unexpected but convincing victories over Sweden's Artemis Racing by three seconds and Britain's Land Rover BAR. Cammas, a former Jules Verne Trophy holder and skipper of Groupama Team France, is one of France's most accomplished sailors. Although it was sometimes difficult for him to be coming from behind, he and his team now have a clearer vision of what it takes to perform in the America's Cup. Uncertainty around the format is, however, making the French team's story a difficult commercial sell. Securing sponsorship quickly is vital as the hi-tech boats are so complex that they require design and sailing time that the French team just did not have this time around.  If you go to the sponsor now and you tell them we don't know where the competition is, which boat or how much money we need, we cannot sell anything,  Cammas said. Despite the difficulties of not knowing, Cammas is determined to keep his campaign and team together at their base in Lorient, Brittany.  My first objective is to do the next campaign with more possibility of performance,  he added. Cammas, who showed his determination by battling back to the peak levels of fitness required to sail the demanding boats after a serious injury in training in late 2015 nearly severed his foot, sees his future with the America's Cup, which remains his goal.  Before the first match I was very happy to be at the start line against Oracle, it was the first time for me and the America’s Cup is my dream,  he said.

{"content":"LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Toyota made a smooth start to their bid for an historic first victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on Saturday with the Japanese manufacturer's cars reaching the three-hour mark in one-two formation. Starting from pole position on a hot afternoon at the Sarthe Circuit, the number seven Toyota with Japan's Kamui Kobayashi at the wheel was leading the number eight of Britain's Anthony Davidson by some 30 seconds. Porsche, chasing their third win in a row, held third and fourth places with their number one car 35 seconds off the pace in a largely incident-free opening period. Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991 with a rotary-engined car, but Toyota - after 18 failed attempts - have set the pace this year. They have won the first two rounds of the world endurance championship and lined up for Le Mans on the back of a record qualifying lap. Ex-Formula One driver Kobayashi, who shares the seven car with Britain's Mike Conway and Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin, lapped the circuit with the fastest time ever - an average speed of 251.882kph. Five-times runners-up Toyota came agonizingly close to winning last year but a last lap power failure on Kazuki Nakajima's leading car handed the victory to Porsche. With once-dominant Audi pulling out of Le Mans after last year's race, the 2017 edition is a straightforward battle between Porsche and Toyota. The only other entrant in the top LMP1 category, the number four ByKolles Racing ENSO CLM, retired after Britain's Oliver Webb made contact with the wall on the opening lap.

{"content":"MOSCOW/ERBIL (Reuters) - The Russian defense ministry said on Saturday it had killed two Islamic State field commanders, named as Abu Omar al-Beljiki and Abu Yassin al-Masri, in air strikes near the eastern Syrian city of Deir al-Zor, Interfax news agency reported. The statement came a day after Russia said it may have killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an air strike last month. Washington said it could not corroborate Baghdadi's death and Western and Iraqi officials were skeptical.  The Russian defense ministry said on Saturday it killed around 180 militants and the two commanders al-Beljiki and al-Masri in air strikes close to Deir al-Zor on June 6 and June 8. Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based expert who advises several Middle East governments on Islamic State affairs, said he was skeptical about Russia's claim on Saturday. He said Abu Yasin al-Masri is the same person as Abu al-Haj al-Masri, who the Russians on Friday said they killed near Raqqa in May. Al-Hashimi said the other IS leader, al-Beljiki, was unlikely to have been in Syria at the time of the attack.  The Russians are trying to improve their record fighting Daesh as it was the Americans who have killed the top commanders of the group so far, like Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani and Abu Ali al-Anbari,  he said, using an Arabic acronym of Islamic State.  If (Russia's) announcements prove wrong, their credibility will be hurt,  al-Hashimi said. Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, after nearly three years ruling over millions of people in a wide area in both countries. A U.S.-led coalition is assisting Iraqi forces in the Mosul battle and supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab and Kurdish militias, in Raqqa.

{"content":"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian luxury group Tod's on Saturday launched a menswear capsule collection for Yoox Net-a-Porter in a bid to increase its reach to online customers.  The brand is pushing to regain appeal among fashionistas despite expecting like-for-like retail sales to be flat overall in 2017.  The  Tod's X Mr Porter  collection is aimed at YNAP's in-season online store dedicated to men, with 27 items for the summer, designed by Tod's menswear Creative Director Andrea Incontri. It includes new, colored models of the group's iconic 'Gommino' loafers, suede bomber jackets and printed swimming shorts, all in the tones of blue, red and white.  Despite already selling shoes, clothes, and accessories through YNAP's websites, the collection is the Italian brand's first exclusive collaboration with the successful online luxury group.  It's the first dedicated 'see-now-buy-now' collection for the group, presented on Saturday in Milan and on sale this coming week, a statement said.    Since launching Tod's ready-to-wear business in 2015, we have wanted to work on an exclusive collection ... giving our global customer base something special which they cannot find anywhere else,  Mr Porter Buying Director Fiona Firth said in a statement.  Luxury groups have been coming under pressure from increasingly young clients to present more collections during the year, including highly-attractive limited and exclusive capsule lines.  Chairman Diego Della Valle said in April that the company would see positive results in the next couple of years from different strategies aiming at both  traditional and new clients , increasing products offered and investing in technology more alongside traditional retail shops.  After posting a 4.4 percent drop in first-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Emilio Macellari said last month it would be challenging to meet market expectations for earnings this year.. The group will showcase its menswear Spring Summer 2018 collection on Sunday, in one of many events for Milan's Men's fashion week.

But he confirmed that seven soldiers had been evacuated after being wounded in the incident at Camp Shaheen, the headquarters of the Afghan army's 209th Corps in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. At least one Afghan soldier was killed and another wounded, the U.S. official said. He could not immediately say if the suspected shooter was among the dead or wounded. Abdul Qahar Araam, spokesman for the Afghan army's 209th Corps, announced earlier that an Afghan soldier had shot and killed four U.S. soldiers inside the base.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Rescue crews searched into the early hours on Sunday for seven American sailors missing after a U.S. destroyer collided with a container ship in the pre-dawn hours off the coast of Japan. U.S. 7th Fleet Vice Admiral Joseph P.

It's been a tough day for our Navy family. It's hard to imagine what this crew has had to endure, the challenges they've had to overcome,  Aucoin said. U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels continued the search after the Fitzgerald sailed into the port of Yokosuka south of Tokyo. Three aboard the destroyer were treated at the U.S. Naval Hospital, including ship Commander Bryce Benson. It was not clear what caused the collision, which the U.S. Navy said occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT).

{"content":"MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - Lanco Infratech Ltd confirmed on Saturday that India's central bank had directed the company's lead lender IDBI Bank to initiate a corporate insolvency resolution process under the country's bankruptcy laws. Lanco is among 12 companies that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ordered lenders to take to bankruptcy court as it strives to cut the country's $150 billion in soured debt, sources told Reuters on Friday. The 12 companies together account for about 2 trillion rupees ($31 billion), or roughly a quarter, of Indian bank loans that have been categorised as non-performing. Lanco, whose businesses include power and infrastructure, said it had outstanding fund-based loans of 81.46 billion rupees and another 32.21 billion rupees in non-fund-based exposure as of March 31, 2016.

{"content":"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli authorities said on Saturday they had found no evidence of Islamic State involvement in attacks by three Palestinians that killed an Israeli policewoman, despite the group's claim of responsibility. Palestinian militant factions also denied Islamic State was involved in the attacks in Jerusalem on Friday, in which a second Israeli police officer was wounded. Islamic State's claim of responsibility was reported by the group's Amaq news agency on Friday. Police spokeswoman Luba Simri said the Israeli military had so far found no connection between the three assailants and any armed group.       It was a local cell. At this stage no indication has been found it was directed by terrorist organizations nor has any connection to any organization been found,  Simri said.     The SITE intelligence monitoring group said it was the first time Islamic State had claimed responsibility for an attack inside Israeli-controlled territory. However, a senior official from Hamas, the Islamic group that rules the Gaza Strip, and the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three attackers, who were all shot dead at the scene, were their own members.   The three hero martyrs who executed the Jerusalem operation have no connection to Daesh (Islamic State), they are affiliated with the PFLP and Hamas,  Hamas' Izzat El-Reshiq wrote on Twitter.

The media office of the PFLP armed wing mourns two of its hero comrades, two freed prisoners,  it said. Israeli police said on Friday all the assailants were from the occupied West Bank. Two of them, both from the area of Ramallah, were aged between 18 and 19 and the third was a 30-year-old from Hebron, Simri said.     The assaults took place simultaneously in two areas near the Damascus gate of Jerusalem's walled old city.

In the second incident, a Palestinian fatally stabbed a border policewoman before being shot dead by police. A wave of Palestinian street attacks began in October 2015 but has since slowed. Thirty-eight Israelis, two American tourists and a British student have been killed in stabbings, shootings and car-rammings, many of which took place in the vicinity of the Old City's Damascus gate.  At least 252 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have been killed since the violence began. Israel says at least 170 of those killed were carrying out attacks. Others died during clashes and protests.     Israel blames the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, denies that and says assailants have acted out of desperation over Israeli occupation of land sought by Palestinians for a state.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Search and rescue efforts went on after dark for seven U.S. sailors missing after the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged container ship more than three times its size off eastern Japan early on Saturday. The Fitzgerald, an Aegis guided missile destroyer, collided with the merchant vessel some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, the Navy said. Three aboard the destroyer had been medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, including the ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. The other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises, while other injured were being assessed aboard the ship, it said. The USS Fitzgerald sailed into port on Saturday evening but search and rescue efforts by U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels were continuing for the seven missing sailors, the Navy said. Their names are being withheld until the families have been notified, it added. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Unclear What Happened It was unclear how the collision happened.  Once an investigation is complete then any legal issues can be addressed,  a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet said. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it took place at 1:30 a.m. local time. The Fitzgerald suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline, causing  significant damage  and flooding to two berthing spaces and other areas of the ship, the Navy said. The flooding was later stabilized, but it was uncertain how long it would take to gain access to those spaces once the ship docked, to continue the search for the missing, it said. Back in Yokosuka, divers will inspect the damage and develop a plan for repairs, the Navy said. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, is towed into the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, Japan June 17, 2017.Toru HanaiThe ship was able to operate under its own power with limited propulsion, the Navy said. The Japanese Coast Guard said separately the Fitzgerald was towed back to Yokosuka by a tugboat at about 3 knots.  Part of an eight-ship squadron based in Yokosuka, the Fitzgerald had in February completed $21 million worth of upgrades and repairs. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ASX Crystal, said in a statement it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton U.S. warship, and was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. Slideshow (17 Images)None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said. The ship arrived at Tokyo Bay around 5:00 p.m. (0800 GMT), sailing under its own power, the Coast Guard said. Busy Waterways     The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japan’s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama.  International maritime rules for collision avoidance do not define right of way for any one vessel, but provide common standards for signaling between ships, as well as regulations on posting lookouts. Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed aerial footage of the Fitzgerald, which had a large dent on its right, or starboard, side. Images broadcast by NHK showed it had been struck next to its Aegis radar arrays behind the vertical launch tubes. Such incidents are rare. In May, the U.S. Navy's USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel but both ships were able to operate under their own power. The 7th Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, thanked the Japanese Coast guard in a post on the fleet's Facebook page, adding:  We are committed to ensuring the safe return of the ship to port in Yokosuka.

{"content":"(Reuters) - A decision by Goldman Sachs Group Inc last year to move an investment banking veteran to Seattle, as well as Evercore Partners Inc's hiring of a top banker defending companies against activist investors, has paid off handsomely. Goldman advised Amazon.com Inc and Evercore advised Whole Foods Markets Inc on Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that will see the U.S. organic grocery chain become part of the world's largest internet retailer. The deal was Amazon's first valued at more than $1 billion, making it a coveted trophy for investment bankers in search of fees and glory. Goldman had laid the ground for this moment. Last year, it dispatched senior bankers to several North American cities where big companies are based, including Atlanta, Toronto and Seattle.    One of those bankers, David Eisman, moved from San Francisco to Seattle to help lead a small team tasked with strengthening ties with the city's biggest companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp and Starbucks Corp.   When Amazon decided to approach Whole Foods last month, it picked Goldman for advice. Eisman advised the company alongside fellow Goldman bankers Colin Ryan, who focuses on technology mergers, and Cosmo Roe, who focuses on consumer and retail companies.  FILE PHOTO - Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in Manhattan, New York, U.S. on January 29, 2016.Mike Segar/File PhotoEvercore itself clinched a role in the deal with the help of a Goldman alumnus. Last year, Evercore poached Goldman's head of activism defense Bill Anderson, who for more than 12 years had advised more than 175 companies on how to tackle activist investors and hostile bids. When Jana Partners LLC in April said it had raised its stake in Whole Foods in April and pushed for a sale of the company, Whole Foods interviewed several investment banks to hire an adviser to help defend against the activist hedge fund.  From the moment Jana had announced its stake in Whole Foods ... an onslaught of attention from media and banks ensued,  Whole Foods' chief executive, John Mackey, said in a Texas Monthly article this month. Whole Foods' conversations with banks took place before the company was approached by Amazon, so Goldman was also vying for a role with Whole Foods. With Anderson among its ranks, however, Evercore prevailed. When Amazon approached, Whole Foods turned again to Evercore. Anderson advised Whole Foods alongside senior Evercore bankers Eduardo Mestre and William Hiltz. Goldman now stands to receive $30 million to $35 million in advisory fees, while Evercore stands to receive $40 million to $50 million, according to estimates from investment banking advisory firm Freeman & Co LLC. Goldman and Bank of America Corp, which provided bridge financing to Amazon, could receive between $35 million and $50 million in debt arranging fees, according to Freeman.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Friday it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion, in an embrace of brick-and-mortar stores that could turn the high-end grocer into a mass-market merchant and upend the already struggling U.S. retail industry. Amazon used aggressive pricing to become an e-commerce retail juggernaut and has recently been experimenting with brick-and-mortar outlets. It will take over a natural and organic grocer pioneer with 456 stores, a mecca for young, high-end shoppers, that has been struggling to rein in prices and integrate technology. The deal represents a dramatic turn in strategy for Amazon, which has offered food delivery through its Fresh service for a decade but has not made a major dent in the $700 billion grocery market. “The ramifications for all of retail are seismic – not just retailers that sell grocery, but for everyone,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. For graphic - Whole Foods at a glance - click: tmsnrt.rs/2skJDSv Shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value on Friday as the news reverberated across financial markets. Shares of grocer Kroger Co swooned 9.2 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc fell 4.7 percent, signaling fears that Amazon could broaden Whole Foods' product mix and cut prices. Amazon's shares rose 2.4 percent to $987.71, adding $11 billion to its market capitalization, which in one sense makes the acquisition nearly free for Amazon shareholders.   Supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and non-traditional grocers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,  said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service. Amazon agreed to pay $42 per share in cash for Whole Foods, a 27 percent premium on the Austin, Texas-based grocer's closing share price on Thursday.  Related CoverageFor Whole Foods workers, fears of robots, drones and culture clashSeattle love, dread of activist investor help clinch Amazon M&A rolesAmazon-Whole Foods deal hits shares across the food chainBut in a sign that investors believe a rival bid is likely, Whole Foods shares rose above the offer price to close at $42.68. No Value in Status Quo A former grocery expert at Amazon predicted that the chain, nicknamed  Whole Paycheck , would add a selection of discounted food and build out non-grocery areas within stores, particularly for pharmacy and Amazon devices.  There’s no value in Amazon keeping the status quo at Whole Foods. Whole Foods was losing market share to Kroger,  said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to roll out AmazonFresh globally.   It’s pharmacy. It’s having the ability to put stores that are similar to Apple stores inside Whole Foods,  he said.  Amazon has been looking at shop layouts that could allow traditional in-store purchase, online ordering with on-site pickup, and home delivery, using store warehouse space as a distribution point, Ladd said. A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo AllegriDespite Amazon's reputation for harnessing technology, a prototype store inside its corporate office in Seattle, called Amazon Go, which uses sensors and tech-savvy cameras to detect shoppers' selections and then charge their Amazon accounts, has rolled out more slowly than planned, a person familiar with the matter said.  And while some analysts expect Amazon to bring vast buying power to Whole Foods, Amazon's heft in the food market is far smaller than in other areas, and high demand for organic products gives farmers unusual bargaining power. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said plans do not include reducing jobs as the result of the deal and that the company does not plan to automate Whole Foods cashiers jobs with Amazon Go technology.  Whole Foods Was Under Pressure The deal unfolded after Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive officer, approached Whole Foods CEO John Mackey about a month ago and received an eager response from Mackey, two people familiar with the matter said. Slideshow (18 Images)The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, and Mackey will remain CEO, the companies said.  Whole Foods has posted seven straight quarterly sales declines at established stores and recently overhauled its board of directors in the face of pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. Jana, which disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in Whole Foods in April and is the company's second biggest shareholder, stands to make roughly $300 million from the sale to Amazon. The deal is for $13.4 billion in cash and the remainder in debt. The acquisition price implies a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Whole Foods of 31 times, versus a 14.4 average for the S&P; 500 Food Retail index. Amazon and Whole Foods expect to close the deal during the second half of 2017. Eyes on Grocery Shoppers Amazon, started in Seattle in 1994 by Bezos, a former hedge fund manager, has grown into the world's biggest diversified online retailer, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. It has expanded from a book seller into a merchant of nearly all consumer products, as well as producing videos.  Both Amazon and Whole Foods cater to younger consumers including millennials as well as the affluent.  Amazon could bring technology to all Whole Foods locations, or it could absorb Whole Foods into AmazonFresh. Either way, it's good for consumers like myself,  said Di Wu, a New York resident in her early 30s who is a member of Amazon's Prime fast-shipping club and who shops at Whole Foods at least twice a week.   Amazon is known to drive down prices and make the shopping experience more efficient,  Wu said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc advised Amazon on the deal and provided bridge financing. Bank of America Corp also provided financing to Amazon, while Evercore Partners Inc advised Whole Foods.

{"content":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The death last year of actor Carrie Fisher, best known for her role as Princess Leia in the  Star Wars  franchise, was due to sleep apnea and other causes, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said in a statement on Friday. Fisher died aged 60 on Dec. 27, four days after she became unresponsive on a flight from London to Los Angeles and was rushed to a hospital.  Fisher was a mental health advocate who spoke about her struggles with bipolar disorder and cocaine addiction. Aside from her film work, she was also popular as a writer and humorist and her memoir  The Princess Diarist  was released a few weeks before she died.    The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office conducted an examination of her body on Dec. 30 and has since found she died of sleep apnea and  other undetermined factors,  the coroner's statement said. Fisher also had atherosclerotic heart disease and had used drugs, the statement said, but noted the significance of these factors in relation to her demise had not been ascertained.  A watch commander for the coroner's office declined to provide additional details on the findings, referring questions to a representative who was not immediately available.

The day after Carrie Fisher died, Reynolds, who starred in Hollywood musicals such as  Singin' in the Rain,  suffered a stroke and died, aged 84. Eddie Fisher died in 2010.  Born in Beverly Hills, Carrie Fisher got her show business start at age 12 in her mother's Las Vegas nightclub act. She made her film debut as a teenager in 1975 comedy  Shampoo,  two years before her breakthrough in the first  Star Wars  movie. Fisher reprised the role in later  Star Wars  sequels, gaining sex symbol status in  Return of the Jedi  in 1983 when her Leia character wore a metallic gold bikini while enslaved by the diabolical Jabba the Hutt. In the 2015 film  Star Wars: The Force Awakens,  also known as  Episode VII  of the franchise, she appeared again as Leia, who by then had become an astute military general. After undergoing treatment in the mid-1980s for cocaine addiction, Fisher wrote the bestselling novel  Postcards from the Edge,  about a drug-abusing actress forced to move in with her mother. The book was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine.

Former speakers Eduardo Cunha and Henrique Eduardo Alves, as well as Temer's current chief of staff Eliseu Padilha and Cabinet Minister Wellington Moreira Franco, participated in Temer's scheme, Batista said in the interview.  Temer is the leader of a lower house criminal organization,  Época quoted Batista as saying.  Those who are not under arrest are in the government. They're very dangerous.

Efforts to reach the lawyers of Cunha, Alves, Moreira Franco and Padilha were unsuccessful. The comments took Batista's accusations against Temer a bit further since the billionaire entrepreneur told prosecutors that Temer worked to obstruct an ongoing corruption investigation as president. Last week, Temer escaped the threat of ouster after Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case over alleged illegal campaign funding for the 2014 election - in which he ran on the same ticket of former President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached last year on accusation she oversaw the doctoring of budget accounts.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Andy Murray believes that he can compete at the top level for only another  couple of years  even though Roger Federer has proved that it is possible to win major titles at the age of 35. Despite the recent success of Australian Open champion Federer and 31-year-old Rafael Nadal, who claimed a 10th French Open title last Sunday, Murray believes that his physical condition and fitness could limit his performances in the future.  I know some of the players have been doing really well until their mid-30s recently... maybe the next couple of years are the last few where I have a chance to compete for the majors and the biggest tournaments,  the 30-year-old Wimbledon champion told the BBC.  Most of the players are traveling with physios now, spending a lot more time working in the gym to protect their bodies from the kind of pounding you give it on the court as well. I think some of that explains it.  I don't know how long I'm going to be playing for any more. I want to make the most of every tournament I compete in... I'll continue to play so long as my body is fine.  The Briton, who has won just one tournament this year, believes that the experience gained over his 12-year professional career helps him deal with the pressure during Wimbledon.  For me, it is obviously always going to be the biggest tournament during the year,  Murray said.  A lot of pressure comes with it as well. There's a lot of expectation during this period, so it can be a bit stressful...  I'm older and more experienced in dealing with it. The pressure and stress that goes with it maybe doesn't affect me quite as much when I was younger.  Murray will start the grasscourt season at the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club, where he faces British number four Aljaz Bedene in the first round.

{"content":"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has asked Germany to keep fighting for the Paris climate change deal and to 'tear down walls' that inhibit international cooperation, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday, offering a stark contrast between her agenda and U.S. policy.  U.S. President Donald Trump announced this month that he would withdraw from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger from world leaders.  Slideshow (15 Images) The Pope encouraged me to continue and fight for international agreements, including the Paris agreement,  Merkel told reporters after an unusually long, 40-minute private audience with him. Merkel, who faces elections in September, said the Pope  expressed his support for the agenda of the G20 major economies, who hold a summit in Hamburg next month.  This (G20) agenda assumes that we are a part of a world in which we work together through multilateral cooperation,  Merkel said of her discussion with the Pope.  It is a world in which we want to tear down walls and not build them, and in which we all seek prosperity, wealth, honor and dignity for mankind.  Trump, who has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, has shunned some multilateral cooperation.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Search and rescue efforts went on after dark for seven U.S. sailors missing after the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged container ship more than three times its size off eastern Japan early on Saturday. The Fitzgerald, an Aegis guided missile destroyer, collided with the merchant vessel some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, the Navy said. Three aboard the destroyer had been medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, including the ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. The other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises, while other injured were being assessed aboard the ship, it said. The USS Fitzgerald sailed into port on Saturday evening but search and rescue efforts by U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels were continuing for the seven missing sailors, the Navy said. Their names are being withheld until the families have been notified, it added. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Unclear What Happened It was unclear how the collision happened.  Once an investigation is complete then any legal issues can be addressed,  a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet said. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it took place at 1:30 a.m. local time. The Fitzgerald suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline, causing  significant damage  and flooding to two berthing spaces and other areas of the ship, the Navy said. The flooding was later stabilized, but it was uncertain how long it would take to gain access to those spaces once the ship docked, to continue the search for the missing, it said. Back in Yokosuka, divers will inspect the damage and develop a plan for repairs, the Navy said. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, is towed into the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, Japan June 17, 2017.Toru HanaiThe ship was able to operate under its own power with limited propulsion, the Navy said. The Japanese Coast Guard said separately the Fitzgerald was towed back to Yokosuka by a tugboat at about 3 knots.  Part of an eight-ship squadron based in Yokosuka, the Fitzgerald had in February completed $21 million worth of upgrades and repairs. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ASX Crystal, said in a statement it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton U.S. warship, and was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. Slideshow (17 Images)None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said. The ship arrived at Tokyo Bay around 5:00 p.m. (0800 GMT), sailing under its own power, the Coast Guard said. Busy Waterways     The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japan’s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama.  International maritime rules for collision avoidance do not define right of way for any one vessel, but provide common standards for signaling between ships, as well as regulations on posting lookouts. Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed aerial footage of the Fitzgerald, which had a large dent on its right, or starboard, side. Images broadcast by NHK showed it had been struck next to its Aegis radar arrays behind the vertical launch tubes. Such incidents are rare. In May, the U.S. Navy's USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel but both ships were able to operate under their own power. The 7th Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, thanked the Japanese Coast guard in a post on the fleet's Facebook page, adding:  We are committed to ensuring the safe return of the ship to port in Yokosuka.

{"content":"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The Iraqi army and Sunni tribal fighters have dislodged Islamic State from the al-Waleed border crossing into Syria, an Iraqi military statement said on Saturday. The capture of al-Waleed removes Islamic State fighters from the vicinity of a U.S. base located on the other side of the border, in Syrian territory. Aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi air force took part in the operation, the statement said. Al-Waleed is close to Tanf, a strategic Syrian border crossing with Iraq on the Baghdad-Damascus highway, where U.S. forces have assisted Syrian rebels trying to recapture territory from Islamic State. U.S. forces have been based at Tanf since last year, in effect preventing Iranian-backed forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from receiving heavy weaponry from Iran by using the main highway between Iraq and Syria. The involvement of Iraqi Sunni tribal fighters in the operation to dislodge the militants from al-Waleed is another indication that Iran will not yet be able to use the highway. Pro-Assad forces in Syria, mainly comprising Iraqi Shi'ite militias, last week reached the Iraqi border north-east of Tanf, potentially preventing the U.S.-backed rebels from taking more territory from Islamic State alongside the border area with Iraq.   In Mosul, where a U.S.-backed offensive against Islamic State on Saturday entered its ninth month, the militants have been squeezed into an enclave on the western bank of the Tigris river. Islamic State also controls territory along the border with Syria and urban pockets west and south of Mosul. In Syria, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, made up predominantly of Kurdish fighters, have seized territory to the north, east and west of Raqqa, Islamic State's Syrian bastion.  About 100,000 civilians remain trapped in harrowing conditions behind Islamic State lines in Mosul, with little food, water and medicine and limited access to hospitals, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Friday. Islamic State snipers are shooting at families trying to flee on foot or by boat across the Tigris River, as part of a tactic to keep civilians as human shields, it said. Iraqi government forces regained eastern Mosul in January, then a month later began the offensive on the western side that includes the Old City, a dense maze of narrow alleyways where fighting is mainly done house by house. The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in a speech from an historic mosque in the Old City three years ago, covering parts of Iraq and Syria. Moscow said on Friday its forces may have killed Baghdadi in an air strike in Syria last month, but Washington said it could not corroborate the death and Western and Iraqi officials were skeptical. About 200,000 people were estimated to be trapped behind Islamic State lines in Mosul in May, but the number has declined as government forces have thrust further into the city. About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with friends and relatives or in camps.

{"content":"PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a delivery target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component. Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric, conducted checks after a quality problem was found in a turbine disc. Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed. They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney. Each 1 percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a 5 percent fuel saving, they said. CFM expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of LEAP. That means planes will be able to fly up to 3 hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast.

{"content":"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian luxury group Tod's on Saturday launched a menswear capsule collection for Yoox Net-a-Porter in a bid to increase its reach to online customers.  The brand is pushing to regain appeal among fashionistas despite expecting like-for-like retail sales to be flat overall in 2017.  The  Tod's X Mr Porter  collection is aimed at YNAP's in-season online store dedicated to men, with 27 items for the summer, designed by Tod's menswear Creative Director Andrea Incontri. It includes new, colored models of the group's iconic 'Gommino' loafers, suede bomber jackets and printed swimming shorts, all in the tones of blue, red and white.  Despite already selling shoes, clothes, and accessories through YNAP's websites, the collection is the Italian brand's first exclusive collaboration with the successful online luxury group.  It's the first dedicated 'see-now-buy-now' collection for the group, presented on Saturday in Milan and on sale this coming week, a statement said.    Since launching Tod's ready-to-wear business in 2015, we have wanted to work on an exclusive collection ... giving our global customer base something special which they cannot find anywhere else,  Mr Porter Buying Director Fiona Firth said in a statement.  Luxury groups have been coming under pressure from increasingly young clients to present more collections during the year, including highly-attractive limited and exclusive capsule lines.  Chairman Diego Della Valle said in April that the company would see positive results in the next couple of years from different strategies aiming at both  traditional and new clients , increasing products offered and investing in technology more alongside traditional retail shops.  After posting a 4.4 percent drop in first-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Emilio Macellari said last month it would be challenging to meet market expectations for earnings this year..

Once a rising star in the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, Anwar is seen as the greatest threat to Prime Minister Najib Razak and his coalition, after leading a three-party opposition alliance to stunning electoral gains in 2013. Anwar was convicted and jailed for sodomizing a former aide, a charge he and his supporters describe as a politically motivated attempt to end his career.  Government sources have told Reuters that a general election could be held later this year in a bid to prevent the opposition from gaining ground. An election has to be called by mid-2018. Anwar endorsed a political compact spearheaded by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, as ruling party rebels and the opposition joined hands to fight against Najib, who is embroiled in a corruption scandal.  In order to call for a focus on the general elections, I am choosing not to offer myself as the candidate for prime minister,  Anwar said in a statement.   In hopes of amassing all strengths in a team to go against UMNO-BN, it is fair to ensure the participation of all leaders effectively. This includes benefiting from the position and role of Mahathir,  he said, referring to the ruling coalition.  Mahathir, 91, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, said earlier in June that he would consider taking up the premier position again, but only if there was no acceptable candidate after an opposition election victory. Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He has denied any wrongdoing, even as the fund became the subject of money laundering investigations in the United States and at least five other countries.

{"content":"CAIRO (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-backed government said on Saturday it agreed to a two-point plan advanced by the United Nations to ease suffering in the country's civil war, but the Iran-aligned Houthi movement remained skeptical. On Thursday the U.N. Security Council urged the warring parties to agree on a U.N.-brokered plan to keep the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah out of the fighting and to resume government salary payments.     The U.N. has proposed that Hodeidah, a vital aid delivery point on the Red Sea where some 80 percent of Yemen's food imports arrive, should be turned over to a neutral party. The U.N. Security Council warned the Saudi-led Arab coalition, that is fighting the Houthis, against any attempt to extend the war to the port.  Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi said in a tweet his government renewed its acceptance of the proposals first made by U.N. Yemen envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed in May. But a spokesperson for the Houthis said the Security Council through its statements was encouraging the Saudi-led alliance to resume its strikes and that they reserved the right to respond to any aggression.

Yemen has been torn apart by more than two years of civil war that pits the Houthi group against the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led alliance. More than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and hunger is widespread. United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, speaks to reporters upon his arrival at Sanaa airport on a visit to Sanaa, Yemen May 22, 2017.Khaled AbdullahThe Saudi-led coalition has accused the Houthis of using Hodeidah to smuggle in weapons and ammunition and has called for U.N. monitors to be posted there. The Houthi movement denies the allegations.  Many thousands of Yemeni state workers are also facing destitution as their salaries have gone largely unpaid for several months after the internationally-recognized government shifted Yemen's central bank to Aden from the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.  U.N. Yemen envoy Ould Cheikh Ahmed had told the Security Council on May 30 that he had proposed a deal to avoid military clashes in Hodeidah to be negotiated in parallel with an agreement to resume civil service salary payments nationally.  However, he noted the Houthis and the allied General People's Congress, the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, would not meet with him.

{"content":" (Editor's note: Attention to language in paragraph 18 that some readers may find offensive) By Todd Melby ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - A Minnesota police officer was acquitted on Friday in the slaying of a black motorist he shot five times during a traffic stop last year, an incident that drew national attention after the victim's girlfriend live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez, who testified that he feared for his life when he fatally shot Philando Castile last July, was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. The jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and two of whom were black, sided with the officer after deliberating for more than 25 hours spanning five days, acquitting Yanez on all charges. The shooting death of Castile, 32, in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights triggered local protests and fueled debate across the country over the appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. Friday's verdict drew an angry reaction from Castile's mother.  I'm mad as hell right now,  Valerie Castile told reporters after the verdict.  My first-born son died. ... Just because he was a police officer, that makes it OK.  She said the verdict shows  the system continues to fail black people.  Yanez, the son of a Mexican immigrant, testified during the trial in Ramsey County District Court that he feared for his life after Castile began reaching for a firearm that Castile had disclosed he had in his possession.  Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the state capitol in St. Paul on Friday evening, and a series of speakers demanded justice for minorities in the American judicial system and stronger accountability measures for police. Many people waved signs and chanted in unison  stand up, fight back  and  if we don't get no justice, they don't get no peace.  After the rally, police said roughly 2,000 people marched peacefully down streets in St. Paul, at times blocking traffic at intersections and then on Interstate 94, a major highway. Marchers also blocked commuter trains at one point and chanted  Yanez Guilty.  An attorney for Yanez, Earl Gray, praised the verdict. Two woman hold protest signs in support of Philando Castile during a rally on the capitol steps after a jury found St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Castile, in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. June 16, 2017.Eric Miller Justice was done,  Gray told Reuters by telephone.  We're very happy. Yanez was innocent. He was just doing his job.  Shortly after the verdict, the City of St. Anthony said Yanez would not return to active duty and that it was negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him. Castile  Was Compliant  The video footage of the aftermath of the shooting taken by Castile's girlfriend, which went viral, had shaped many public perceptions of the fatal shooting before the trial.  Slideshow (19 Images)The video begins with the girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, in the passenger seat as Castile, covered in blood, sits in the driver's seat and a patrolman points his gun into the vehicle.   He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out of his pocket,  Reynolds says.  He let the officer know that he had a firearm and that he was reaching for his wallet, and the officer just shot him in his arm.  Castile was shot with Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter in the car. The video showed blood oozing through Castile's shirt as he appeared to lose consciousness.  Fuck!  a voice is heard screaming.  I told him not to reach for it.  Prosecutors said Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying that Castile was courteous and non-threatening.  John Choi, the Ramsey County prosecutor assigned to the case, told reporters following the verdict that Castile  did nothing that justified the taking of his life.   He was compliant,  Choi said. After the shooting, then-President Barack Obama described as tragedies the deaths of Castile and of 37-year-old Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - the second black man slain during an altercation with police in two days.  All of us as Americans should be troubled by these shootings, because these are not isolated incidents,  Obama said at the time.  They're symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.  Writing and additional reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in CHICAGO and Eric M.

{"content":"KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Employees of troubled construction company Saudi Oger will be moved to other firms, the Saudi labor ministry said, amid unconfirmed reports that workers there will be laid off from July 31. The ministry said there were 1,200 Saudis among a total of around 8,000 workers at the company, which is owned by the family of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and has built  many huge infrastructure projects in the kingdom, from universities and roads to airports and hospitals. It said it planned to move some 600 Saudi employees to other facilities and would continue to look for jobs for the remaining Saudis working there. It was also working with Saudi Oger to transfer around 6,000 foreign workers to other firms. A document described as an internal Saudi Oger memo and seen by Reuters notified employees that July 31 would be the last working day there, in light of  the circumstances that the company is going through.   The letter, which was also mentioned in a news article by Saudi-owned newspaper al-Hayat on Saturday, was signed by the administration of Saudi Oger. Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity.  The letter did not specify whether the company would close down operations.  A spokesman for Saudi Oger could not be reached for comment, while a source close to the company said there was no decision to close it down. This was confirmed by another senior official. Sources have told Reuters Saudi Oger plans to transfer some staff working on a mega government project to a new company, in an attempt to mitigate increasing financial pressure. The collapse in oil prices has prompted the Saudi government to tighten spending, hurting contractors such as Oger that rely on the state for most of their projects. The contractor owes banks in the kingdom about 13 billion riyals ($3.5 billion) and faces a funding crisis because it has not received any new funds from the government for projects. Sources told Reuters in April the government had appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a review of Saudi Oger's major projects in the country and examine how much it is owed by the government. The review is likely to determine how much the company will receive in outstanding payments, as well as whether it will continue working on the projects. The labor ministry has previously intervened to transfer 3,800 foreign staff at Saudi Oger to other companies, while a further 11,500 left the firm.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - New French President Emmanuel Macron's government on Friday reaffirmed its plan to boost the representation of smaller parties in parliament as its predicted majority after this weekend's runoffs grew, and likely voter turnout shrank. Three opinion polls ahead of Sunday's second round of legislative elections indicated that the upstart centrist president and his one-year-old Republic on the Move (LREM) party would win 80 percent or more of the seats in the lower house. Those were the highest predictions of the campaign to date. Macron's opponents, still smarting from his presidential victory just over a month ago, warn that such a majority in a country with obvious and deep political divisions is a threat to democracy. LREM's dominance of parliament would be the biggest in decades by any party, even though it gathered only about a third of votes in round one. Over half of the electorate did not vote, and many said they saw no point in doing so. The latest polls indicated that even fewer would turn out in round two. France's two-round voting system, used in all types of elections including the presidential contest that brought Macron to power, eliminates low-scoring candidates after the first round. Thanks to this system, and to electoral pacts aimed at keeping far-right National Front candidates out of parliament, the National Front looks set to get only a handful of seats in the National Assembly, even though its leader Marine Le Pen won the support of a third of voters in the presidential election. Some surveys indicate that she may even be the only National Front member in the 577-seat Assembly. Left and far-left lawmakers are also expected to be few in number.  We will ask parliament to work on this subject,  technology minister Mounir Mahjoubi said on France 2 television. French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte vote in the first of two rounds of parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, France, June 11, 2017.Christophe Petit Tesson/Pool By introducing a dose of proportional representation, parties that get such (low) scores would have more representation. That would be fairer, and above all it would improve debate.  Challenges Ahead? Polls by Opinionway and Harris Interactive on Thursday had LREM and its center-right Modem ally winning between 440 and 470 seats in the lower house, a majority unseen since conservative president Charles De Gaulle took over 80 percent of seats in 1968. A poll by Odoxa published on Friday, the last day of campaigning, put them on 430 to 460 seats. Macron has promised to push through pro-business labor reforms that go beyond those he was involved in as economy minister in the Socialist government of 2012 to 2017. While the proposals have been part of his appeal to the broader electorate, and are welcomed in French business circles, they are deeply unpopular with some sections of society who fear erosion of workers' rights. Controversy over the subject resulted in strikes and street protests last year, tore the then-ruling Socialist party apart, and helped cause its disastrous election showings this year. Jean-Luc Melenchon, a far-left candidate backed by a fifth of the electorate in the presidential vote, is set to be one of the few left-wing lawmakers to sit in the new parliament. On Friday, he said Macron should not expect an easy ride.  If you believe the workers of this country and salaried employees generally are going to be fleeced simply because all the glossy magazines have published a smiling photo of the young prince (Macron), you are dreaming,  he said on Europe 1 radio.  This is France, and a century and a half of struggle for the rights enshrined in the labor code are not going to be wiped out at the stroke of a pen. There will be a struggle.

{"content":"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The African Union urged Djibouti and Eritrea to remain calm and exercise restraint on Saturday after Djibouti accused its neighbor of occupying disputed territory along their border following the withdrawal of Qatari peacekeepers. On Friday, Djibouti's Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf said Eritrean troops had seized Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island, areas the neighbors contest, and his country's military was on alert. Authorities in the Eritrean capital Asmara were not available for comment. Qatari peacekeepers were previously deployed along the frontier. Doha announced on June 14 that it had pulled its contingent out, days after the East African countries sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies in their standoff with Qatar. In a statement, the African Union Commission's Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat appealed for calm.   The AU Commission, in close consultations with the authorities in Djibouti and Eritrea, is in the process of deploying a fact-finding mission to the Djibouti-Eritrea border,  he said.  The United Nations Security Council is due to discuss the situation behind closed doors on Monday, according to diplomats. Clashes broke out between the Horn of Africa countries in June 2008 after Djibouti accused Asmara of moving troops across the border, raising fears the spat could engulf the region. The dispute triggered several days of fighting in which a dozen Djiboutian troops died and dozens were wounded. Eritrea had initially denied making any incursions, accusing Djibouti of launching unprovoked attacks. At the time, the U.N. Security Council requested both sides withdraw, before the neighbors accepted a Qatari request to mediate and deploy peacekeepers. Qatar has not given reasons for its withdrawal, but it comes amid a diplomatic crisis with some of its Arab neighbors. They cut ties a week ago, accusing Qatar of backing Islamist militants and Iran - claims Doha strongly denies.

{"content":"VIENNA (Reuters) - Thomas Wieser, the EU official who runs preparations for Eurogroup meetings, hopes Greece will be able to tap international markets for money between autumn this year and spring 2018, he told ORF radio on Saturday. Euro zone governments threw Greece another 11th-hour credit lifeline on Thursday worth $9.5 billion and sketched new detail on possible debt relief as the IMF finally offered to help out after two years of hesitation. The 8.5 billion euros ($9.51 billion) of loans from the euro zone's 18 other states lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognizes unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made. Wieser said in an interview broadcast on Saturday it was up to the Greek government to work towards attracting money that did not come from other European taxpayers.

The 8.5 billion euros ($9.51 billion) of loans from the euro zone's 18 other states lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognizes unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made.

{"content":"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese prosecutors have filed new lawsuits against employees of firms connected to fugitive Guo Wengui, the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday, as Beijing turns up the pressure on the tycoon at the center of a feud with the ruling Communist Party. Chinese-born Guo, now based in New York, has unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials and is facing multiple lawsuits in a number of different jurisdictions. Prosecutors in the northern city of Dalian on Friday filed a lawsuit against some staff of Beijing Pangu Investment on suspicion of misappropriation of funds, Xinhua said citing judicial sources. Guo is accused of misappropriating 400 million yuan, while staff at Beijing Pangu Investment are alleged to have assisted the act by forging documents, said Xinhua. On the same day in Kaifeng City in Henan province, prosecutors filed a suit against Guo-controlled Henan Yuda Real Estate company and its employees on allegations of loan fraud and bill acceptance, Xinhua added. In this case, Guo together with senior staff in Henan Yuda is alleged to have fraudulently obtained loans and bill acceptance totaling 1.5 billion yuan from seven banks by setting up shell companies and fabricating contracts and projects, according to Xinhua. Billionaire businessman Guo Wengui speaks during an interview in New York City, U.S., April 30, 2017.Brendan McDermidGuo did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. However, he has previously said the main purpose of legal cases against him was to paint him as a criminal, bolstering an Interpol global  red notice  for his arrest, issued at Beijing's request in April. The move comes after the Dalian Xigang People's Court in China's northeastern Liaoning province on Friday handed down prison sentences on three employees, Lu Tao, Xie Honglin and Yang Ying, who were first detained in early 2015.  Xie and Yang's sentences were wholly suspended. Guo has disputed the facts of the Dalian case. In a live-streamed online interview with U.S.-based Chinese-language political gossip site Mingjing News on Friday night, which lasted more than four hours, the Chinese-born businessman said the legal cases were designed to silence him.

{"content":"CAIRO (Reuters) - A Cairo criminal court on Saturday recommended the death penalty for 30 people convicted of involvement in the 2015 assassination of Egypt's top prosecutor, the most senior state official killed by militants in recent years. The court set a verdict session for July 22, after referring its recommendation to the country's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for a non-binding legally-required opinion. The July 22 verdict can be appealed against. Public prosecutor Hisham Barakat was killed in a car bomb attack on his convoy in Cairo, an operation for which Egypt blamed the Muslim Brotherhood and Gaza-based Hamas militants, though both groups have denied it.  The brutal conspiracy by hired hands to target the public prosecutor Hisham Barakat and assassinate him, where the corrupt and weak-willed forces of evil and tyranny conspired, could only be carried out by an unjust group that has shed innocent blood,  said Judge Hassan Farid. Farid initially read out 31 names but two of them referred to the same person and the judge then corrected himself. A sign of peace and the Rabaa sign, symbolizing support for the Muslim Brotherhood, are seen behind bars as defendants accused of involvement in the 2015 assassination of Egypt's top prosecutor sit in a cage in a courtroom, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, June 17, 2017.Amr Abdallah DalshOnly half of the defendants are in custody, with 15 on the run.  The Interior Ministry released a video last year showing clips of several young men confessing and admitting going to Gaza for training from Hamas, though some of them later denied the accusations in court.  Slideshow (7 Images)The defendants said they were forced to confess under torture and their lawyers asked that they be medically examined. Farid said he granted the request to a majority, but not all, and that doctors in a prison hospital had found no signs of torture. Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by Islamic State in North Sinai, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed.  The group has also increasingly carried out attacks in Egypt targeting Christians in a spate of church bombings and shootings that have killed some 100 since December. Barakat was the highest-ranking state official to die in a militant attack since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former military chief, ousted President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood leader, in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.

{"content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said new sanctions under consideration by the United States would damage relations between the two countries, but it was too early to talk about retaliation, state news agency RIA reported on Saturday. The U.S. Senate voted nearly unanimously earlier this week for legislation to impose new sanctions on Moscow and force President Donald Trump to get Congress' approval before easing any existing sanctions.  This will, indeed, complicate Russia-American relations. I think this is harmful,  Putin said, according to RIA. In an interview with Rossiya1 state TV channel, excerpts of which were shown during the day on Saturday, Putin said he needed to see how the situation with sanctions evolved. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with journalists following a live nationwide broadcast call-in in Moscow, Russia June 15, 2017.Sergei Karpukhin That is why it is premature to speak publicly about our retaliatory actions,  RIA quoted him as saying. Russia and the West have traded economic blows since 2014, when Moscow annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and lent support to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.  The West imposed economic and financial sanctions that battered the rouble and the export-dependent economy. Moscow retaliated by banning imports of Western food, which also hit ordinary Russians by spurring inflation, and barred some individuals from entering Russia. The threat of a new wave of sanctions emerged this month as  U.S. policymakers backed the idea of punishing Russia for  alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and for supporting Syria's government in the six-year-long civil war. Putin had previously dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washington had always used such methods as a means of trying to contain Russia.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman arrived in Beijing on Saturday after what he said was a  really good  5-day trip to North Korea. Rodman, 56, said last week before departing for Pyongyang that he was trying to bring sports to the increasingly isolated nuclear-armed country, where he has previously met leader Kim Jong Un.  Everybody's going to be happy. It was a good day. It was a good trip. A really good trip,  Rodman said.  Wearing black clothing with the PotCoin logo - a crypto-currency used by the legal marijuana industry - Rodman fended off questions from dozens of journalists at the arrival gate. Asked repeatedly if he had met Kim, Rodman said:  You'll find out.  He also declined to answer questions about whether he had played a role in the release of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was returned home on the day of Rodman's arrival suffering from brain damage and in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, after more than a year in detention in North Korea. Tensions have escalated on the Korean peninsula over North Korea's nuclear and missile tests and its vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, presenting U.S. President Donald Trump with perhaps his most pressing security worry.

{"content":"* Social Democrats promise tax cuts for workers, other incentives * Party vows to tax big banks' assets * For opinion polls table click on By Robert Muller PRAGUE, June 17 (Reuters) - The Social Democrats, the senior partner in the Czech Republic's ruling coalition but trailing in the polls, will try to lure back voters before the October elections by offering tax cuts for workers while tightening control of big business. The party unveiled its election programme days after Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said he would step down as leader of the country's oldest party in an attempt to reverse its slide in opinion polls. In its programme, the party promised to cut taxes for employees, extend holidays to five weeks, raise the minimum wage to at least 16,000 crowns ($685) a month by 2022 and other incentives. It also repeated a pledge from previous elections to introduce progressive taxation on big banks' assets and to clamp down on tax evasion by big business conglomerates. In an attempt to shake things up, Sobotka proposed this week that his more popular and eloquent foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, should lead the party's campaign into the Oct. 20-21 general election. Zaoralek said on Saturday that the country needed consensus at home to make progress.  The Left will not be convincing if it will not honour national interests,  he said, adding that the party could also borrow the slogan  to help and to protect  from police cars. Although the government has presided over a growing economy that helped it deliver the first balanced budget in two decades, the Social Democrats have slipped in the polls behind their main rival and coalition partner ANO. All recent polls have shown ANO leading the Social Democrats, in some cases by a double-digit margin. ANO was founded and is chaired by billionaire and former Finance Minister Andrej Babis, who has attracted voters with his managerial approach to governing and with his image as a political outsider. The parties, together with the Christian Democrats, came to power in a centre-left coalition in January 2014 and are on course to becoming the first government in 15 years in the central European country to finish its term.

Instead, the visiting Nationals have widened the gap with two comfortable wins over the Mets, and they’ll try to make it three straight Saturday. Washington entered the series having lost five of six, while New York had won five of six and pulled within 8 1/2 games of the division-leading Nationals. The prospect of the Mets making a charge seemed plausible, but the Nationals have won the first two contests 8-3 and 7-2 as injuries continue to mount for the Mets. The Nationals belted three home runs in Friday’s victory and have 12 blasts in their last five games.

The 28-year-old struck out 10 Braves, but he also surrendered three home runs. Strasburg is 7-4 with a 2.64 ERA in 13 starts against the Mets. Lugo hit the disabled list in the opening week of the season with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament, but he looked fully recovered in his season debut Sunday at Atlanta. The 27-year-old struck out six and limited the Braves to one run and six hits over seven innings in a 2-1 win.

The Yankees rallied from numerous deficits in the first two contests of the four-game series but ultimately fell to 1-4 on their seven-game California trip. New York trailed 4-0 early in Friday's contest but scored six unanswered runs, with rookie Aaron Judge belting his major league-leading 23rd homer - a three-run shot in the third inning - before suffering its third one-run defeat during its slide. Judge's blast ended a three-game drought, giving him five homers and 11 RBIs over his last seven contests. Rookie Matt Chapman was Oakland's hero on Friday, driving in the tying and winning runs with his first major-league hit - a single down the left-field line in the eighth inning.

The Cubs also aim for their first series victory away from home since taking two of three from the Pirates from April 24-26. The Cubs have lost six straight road series, but they have a chance to change that thanks to a late rally in Friday’s 9-5 win in the series opener. The back end of the Pirates’ bullpen was a mess Friday, when Juan Nicasio couldn’t preserve a ninth-inning lead and the Cubs teed off on Nicasio and demoted closer Tony Watson in a six-run ninth.

{"content":"The Los Angeles Dodgers are inching their way up the standings with wins in seven of their last eight games and finally are beginning to play well on the road. The Dodgers will try to improve to 4-1 on their six-game trip and clinch another series win when they visit the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday. Los Angeles improved to 17-16 on the road and 42-26 overall with its 3-1 win on Friday and remains locked in a three-way battle for supremacy in the National League West with Arizona and Colorado. Dodgers rookie sensation Cody Bellinger continues to give the team a spark, recording a single on Friday to improve to 8-for-25 with six home runs, eight RBIs and seven runs scored in his last six games. Friday's setback marked the seventh straight for the Reds, who began their slide by dropping three in a row at Los Angeles last weekend. Cincinnati will try to get the better of the Dodgers on Saturday by sending Asher Wojciechowski to the mound, while Los Angeles counters with Hyun-Jin Ryu.

The South Korean lasted just four innings against the Reds at home on Sunday, allowing four runs and six hits - three home runs - in a no-decision. Cincinnati's high-powered trio of Adam Duvall, Scott Schebler and Joey Votto each took Ryu deep as he fell to 2-1 with a 4.44 ERA in four career starts against the Reds. Wojciechowski still is searching for his first win as a starter and struggled at Los Angeles last Saturday, when he was charged with four runs and six hits in five innings without factoring in the decision. The 28-year-old turned in his lone quality start against St. Louis on June 5, allowing two runs and eight hits while striking out six in six frames. Wojciechowski has registered 13 strikeouts and three walks in 19 innings this season. Walk-Offs 1.

The Diamondbacks will try to make it six in a row and clinch their fourth straight series win when they visit the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday for the second contest of their three-game series. The Diamondbacks are in a three-way battle with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Colorado for first in the NL West and need to avoid overlooking the lowly Phillies with a three-game series at Colorado looming next week. Arizona fell behind 4-2 on Friday before rallying for three runs in the seventh inning on a two-run homer by Gregor Blanco and Jake Lamb's sacrifice fly en route to a 5-4 victory. The Phillies have twice as many losses as wins at 22-44 and have dropped nine of their last 10 contests. Philadelphia, which visits Arizona for a four-game series next weekend, will send Jerad Eickhoff to the mound on Saturday opposite Zack Godley.

The 27-year-old held Milwaukee to two runs on two hits and a walk over 6 2/3 innings while striking out four last Saturday to snap his four-start winless streak. Godley will be making his first career start against the Phillies after tossing a perfect inning of relief versus them last season. Eickhoff is the first Phillies pitcher to go winless in his first 13 starts since Cliff Lee in 2012 and is coming off a no-decision at Boston in which he allowed four runs - three earned - and seven hits in six innings. The 26-year-old is not getting much support from Philadelphia's offense, which totaled one or no runs in four of his last six turns. Eickhoff is 0-1 with a 4.22 ERA and 16 hits allowed in 10 2/3 career innings against Arizona. Walk-Offs 1.

{"content":"The Detroit Tigers look to stay hot with the bats when they host the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday afternoon in the third of a four-game set. The Tigers have posted 18 runs on 24 hits while winning the first two games of the series after getting four RBIs from Nick Castellanos and three from Justin Upton on the way to a 13-4 victory on Friday without one of their key offensive weapons. Detroit’s veteran designated hitter Victor Martinez was hospitalized after Thursday’s game due to an irregular heartbeat and later placed on the disabled list, as catcher John Hicks was recalled to take his place on the roster. Michael Fulmer tries to get back on track when he takes the mound for the Tigers on Saturday against Tampa Bay’s ace Chris Archer, who is also looking to turn things around. The Rays have dropped three in a row after running off six victories in a seven-game span, but infielder Tim Beckham (knee) returned to the lineup Friday with a pair of hits.

Miguel Cabrera is 6-for-15 with a homer against Archer, who has limited opponents to a .221 batting average on the road. Fulmer permitted five runs in each of his last two starts, but gained the victory June 2 against the Chicago White Sox after completing seven innings. The 24-year-old Oklahoma City native started the season with 10 consecutive quality starts, including one against Tampa Bay on April 18 when he allowed three runs over six innings in a 5-1 loss.

{"content":"The St. Louis Cardinals hit the road reeling after dropping the final three contests of their seven-game homestand but quickly got themselves right again at the expense of the struggling Baltimore Orioles. The Cardinals will try to take advantage of the Orioles once again and clinch their three-game interleague series when they visit Baltimore on Saturday. St. Louis is four games under .500 but remains in the thick of the race in the tightly packed National League Central and has a chance to build some real momentum on a six-game road trip that takes it to major league-worst Philadelphia following the series at Baltimore. The Cardinals wasted little time taking advantage of the Orioles on Friday, scoring four runs over the first four innings while cruising to an 11-2 win. Baltimore fell to 1-8 in its last nine games and is searching for signs of progress from a pitching staff that is allowing an average of 9.1 runs over those nine contests. The Orioles will try to coax a quality start out of Wade Miley on Saturday, while the Cardinals counter with the veteran Adam Wainwright.

The Georgia native had his string of four straight victories in which he allowed a total of one run come to an end at Cincinnati on June 6, when he was lit up for nine runs on seven hits and three walks in 3 2/3 frames. Wainwright, who will be facing Baltimore for the first time in his career, is 13-8 with a 3.33 ERA in 33 career interleague games (27 starts).

{"content":"Mookie Betts and the Boston Red Sox have heated up in June and look to take their second straight over the host Houston Astros when the teams meet again Saturday at Minute Maid Park. The Red Sox picked up a 2-1 win in the opener of the three-game series Friday night, as Betts snapped a tie with a solo shot in the eighth - his third home run in the last three games and ninth extra-base hit in a span of eight contests. Boston has won six of its last eight while American League West-leading Houston has dropped seven of 10 since its 11-game winning streak. Hanley Ramirez was out of the lineup for the second straight game as Boston's designated hitter is dealing with a neck issue. The Red Sox will be hoping for a solid outing from reigning Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello, who has lost three straight decisions and is giving up hits in bunches. Houston counters with rookie David Paulino as it tries to improve upon a 2-5 homestand. TV: 8:15 p.m. ET, FOX PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox RH Rick Porcello (3-8, 4.67 ERA) vs. Astros RH David Paulino (0-0, 6.59) Porcello has surrendered 66 hits in 43 1/3 innings over his last seven starts and opponents are hitting .310 against him - 80 points higher than during his remarkable 2016 season. He has a 3.76 ERA on the road but that number balloons to 5.89 over his last three outings away from home. The 28-year-old did not face the Astros during his Cy Young campaign and has seen them only twice over the course of his career, allowing five runs in 13 2/3 frames. Paulino has failed to get beyond four innings in two of his three major-league starts this season and he gave up five runs in four frames of a no-decision against the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday. Opponents have 19 hits - including six doubles and three home runs - in just 13 2/3 innings against Paulino since he was recalled last month. The 23-year-old from the Dominican Republic had a 5.14 ERA in three starts at Triple-A prior to the promotion. Walk-Offs 1.

{"content":"Justin Bour returned from the disabled list just in time to face the Atlanta Braves, who the Miami Marlins first baseman continues to punish entering Saturday’s middle contest of a three-game weekend series in Atlanta. Bour – who missed eight games with an ankle contusion – came off the disabled list and belted his 17th homer of the season in Friday’s series-opening 5-0 victory, raising his career numbers against the Braves to .306 with 11 homers and 27 RBIs in 35 games. Bour is not the only Miami hitter who historically tees off on Atlanta pitching: center fielder Christian Yelich went 3-for-5 with three RBIs in the opener and is hitting .322 in 69 career games versus the Braves. Atlanta had scored 29 runs in its previous three games and entered the series averaging 5.6 runs per game in June, but mustered just four hits in the series opener. First baseman Matt Adams has eight homers and 21 RBIs since May 21 while filling in for the injured Freddie Freeman. The Braves are 5-25 when scoring three runs or less; when they score four runs or more, they are 24-12.

After striking out seven while allowing just one run in his debut June 1 against Arizona, Locke has surrendered three earned runs in each of his past two outings, losing to the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates. The 29-year-old, who went 1-0 with a 1.77 ERA in four minor-league rehab starts, is 2-3 in eight career starts against the Braves with a 5.44 ERA. A free agent at season’s end, Garcia’s trade potential continues to rise with each passing start despite losing four of his past five decisions. The 30-year-old gave up two runs on seven hits with nine strikeouts in a 2-1 loss to the Mets on Sunday, and he has posted a 1.49 ERA with 28 strikeouts and seven walks in his past five starts.

Kansas City won the first two contests of the four-game series and has belted 16 homers during its six-game winning stretch. Lorenzo Cain hit two solo homers and finished with three RBIs as the Royals notched a 3-1 victory on Friday. Cain has recorded two multi-homer performances in his last six contests and has gone deep eight times this month while batting .368 with 16 RBIs in 57 at-bats. Los Angeles has struggled against the Royals this season, scoring just six runs while losing all five encounters.

{"content":"The Texas Rangers' season has been marred by inconsistency, although one constant has been an inability to enjoy much success against the Seattle Mariners prior to Friday. After halting their recent struggles against the Mariners to get back to .500 in the opener, the Rangers eye their seventh win in eight contests overall Saturday when they continue a three-game set against their American League West rival in Texas. Since May 9, the Rangers (33-33) have posted a 10-game winning streak, immediately followed by a 4-12 stretch before they went 5-1 during a six-game road trip against division leaders Washington and Houston leading into this series. Texas mustered a total of 16 runs while losing five of its first six meetings to Seattle, but Carlos Gomez put an emphatic end to those struggles with a season-high four RBIs in Friday's 10-4 series-opening rout - his first game back since missing over a month recovering from a hamstring injury. Seattle won nine of 10 to get back to the break-even mark on June 7 after falling a season-low eight games under .500, but it is only 3-6 since. Mariners rookie Ben Gamel went 1-for-2 and scored three times Friday to continue his blistering offensive pace during his eight-game hitting streak - a stretch during which he is batting .500 with six multi-hit games and 10 runs scored.

The outing halted a two-game stretch in which the 31-year-old had surrendered 10 runs, 12 hits (three homers) and five walks over 10 innings and lowered his marks in three June starts to 1-1 with a 7.31 ERA. Gallardo settled for a no-decision versus the Rangers on May 5 despite permitting one run and four hits in six frames. Perez watched his winless streak extended to four outings following last Saturday's no-decision in Washington, yielding two runs on seven hits while fanning five across five innings. The 26-year-old Venezuelan was tagged for 11 runs (10 earned) and 16 hits (four home runs) over only 8 2/3 frames in his last turns at home. Kyle Seager is 16-for-35 with four homers and Nelson Cruz is 7-for-15 with three blasts against Perez, who is 3-0 with a 2.37 ERA in his five career home starts against Seattle. Walk-Offs 1. The Rangers went deep twice Friday to extend their streak with at least one home run to 10 games. However, they have hit two or fewer homers in 32 straight - the longest active streak in the majors. 2.

{"content":"NEW YORK/BERLIN (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) ended its 41-year-old sponsorship of the Olympic Games three years early, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday, reflecting the U.S. fast-food giant's focus on its core business as well as rising Olympics sponsorship costs and declining TV ratings.  McDonald's deal would have run through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, and bowing out will likely to save it hundreds of million of dollars if it had continued into the next four-year Olympics cycle and beyond.  McDonald's has been trying to hold down costs as it invests in improving food quality, restaurant service and online ordering to woo back U.S. diners. Intense competition has gnawed away at sales.  We are reconsidering all aspects of our business and have made this decision in cooperation with the IOC to focus on different priorities,  said McDonald's Global Chief Marketing Officer Silvia Lagnado. The company, first involved with the games in 1968 and a sponsor since 1976, was the Olympics' food retail sponsor. Despite pulling out with immediate effect, McDonald's will continue at next year's Pyeongchang winter Olympics as a domestic sponsor. The company's move may also reflect a rising view among consumer brands that exclusive Olympics sponsorship deals do not offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC.  Moreover, in a trend that began after the Beijing games in 2008, shrinking television audiences for the games could be diminishing the value of sponsors' ads. With the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, many viewers turned to social media alternatives like Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).  In the United States, Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal said it had attracted 8.6 percent fewer eyeballs for Rio than it did for London in 2012. FILE PHOTO - Athletes line up at a McDonald's inside the Olympic village in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 1, 2016.Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoThe fast food chain has been part of the IOC's top sponsors program that contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle for the games. While terms of Olympic sponsorship are not disclosed, a source who negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors like McDonald's spend about $25 million a  year or about $100 million for a four-year period that includes a summer and winter games.     Reuters previously reported that the IOC had wanted to roughly double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021. While it is unusual for an Olympic sponsor to leave early, sponsors change regularly within the IOC's top program. The most recent addition was China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), which signed a deal in January for a partnership through 2028.  The next three Olympics take place in Asia, and this could turn off U.S. sponsors trying to reach a U.S. audience. The U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost recent sponsors such as AT&T; (T.N) and Citigroup (C.N) ahead of the 2018 winter games in South Korea.  The IOC said it was not planning a direct replacement for McDonald's, but it is expected to announce a new global deal with Intel Corp (INTC.O) next week, according a source familiar with the matter. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Companies with a deep focus on technology are barging in while others migrate out,  said Peter Land, who works with Olympics and Paralympics sponsors for communications firm Finsbury.  The IOC has faced criticism from public health campaigners for allowing sponsors such as Coca-Cola (KO.N) and McDonald's to use the games to market their products, which are perceived to be unhealthy. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald's, said last year the company would reevaluate its Olympic relationship after changes to a rule that ended a marketing blackout for companies that sponsor athletes rather than the event itself. Shares of McDonald's rose $1.06, or about 0.7 percent on Friday. Reporting by Liana B.

A source at the Qatar-based broadcaster, which is caught up in an economic and diplomatic dispute between Qatar and other Arab powers, said a technical issue had been to blame. On another of its Twitter feeds, the broadcaster had earlier tweeted:  The account of al Jazeera on twitter @ajarabic is currently suspended due to what seems to be an organized campaign and we are doing the necessary work to get the service back.  It did not say who was behind the alleged campaign.  The @ajarabic account later resumed, with a message saying:  We bring the attention of our followers to the fact that our main al jazeera account @ajarabic is now working again.   No comment was immediately available from Twitter. Al Jazeera is the flagship broadcaster for Qatar, which is the target of a diplomatic and economic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, in a stand-off that is endangering stability in the region. The other Arab powers accuse Qatar of supporting Islamist militants, which it denies, and some of them have criticized Al Jazeera as a terrorist mouthpiece and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected those accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence.

{"content":"SHANGHAI/BEIJING, June 17 (Reuters) - Chinese prosecutors have filed new lawsuits against employees of two firms connected to fugitive Guo Wengui, the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday, as Beijing continues to turn up the legal pressure on the New York-based tycoon at the centre of a political feud with the ruling Communist Party. Chinese-born Guo has recently unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials and is facing multiple lawsuits in a number of different jurisdictions. Prosecutors in the northern city of Dalian on Friday filed a lawsuit against some staff of Beijing Pangu Investment on suspicion of duty encroachment and misappropriation of funds, Xinhua said citing judicial sources. On the same day in Kaifeng City in Henan province, prosecutors filed a suit against Guo-controlled Henan Yuda Real Estate company and its employees on allegations of loan fraud and bill acceptance, Xinhua added. Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. However, he has previously said the main purpose of legal cases against him was to paint him as a criminal, bolstering an Interpol global  red notice  for his arrest, issued at Beijing's request in April. The move comes after the Dalian Xigang People's Court in China's northeastern Liaoning province on Friday handed down prison sentences to three employees, Lu Tao, Xie Honglin and Yang Ying, who were first detained in early 2015. Xie and Yang's sentences were wholly suspended. Guo has disputed the facts of the Dalian case. In a live-streamed online interview with U.S.-based Chinese-language political gossip site Mingjing News on Friday night, which lasted more than four hours, the Chinese-born businessman said the barrage of legal cases against him were designed to silence him. In New York, he faces defamation lawsuits from aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA Group, property developer SOHO China, and prominent journalist Hu Shuli.

{"content":"(No changes to text) By Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday will announce plans to tighten restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and clamp down on U.S. business dealings with the island’s military, rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama’s historic opening to Havana. Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump will issue a presidential directive to reverse some of the loosened regulations that Obama introduced after a 2014 breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes, senior White House officials said. Trump, taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, will outline stricter enforcement of a long-time ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. But, facing pressure from U.S. business and some of his fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with communist-ruled Cuba, he also will leave intact many of Obama’s steps toward normalization. The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise-ship companies now serving the island. However, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility and will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights - though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties. The administration, according to one White House official, does not intend to “disrupt” existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a Havana hotel. Nor are there plans to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use. As a result, the changes – though far-reaching – appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared. Human Rights Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obama’s easing of U.S. restrictions amounted to  appeasement  and has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a “bad deal” struck by Obama, U.S. officials said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free elections and releasing political prisoners. International human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms in exchange for further engagement with Washington. “If you want Cuba to change and reform, we are doing the opposite of what would be most likely to bring about reforms,” said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide who helped negotiate rapprochement. Trump’s critics have also questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while downplaying the issue in other parts of the world. Trump will announce his new approach early Friday afternoon at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami’s Little Havana, the heart of America’s largest Cuban-American community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a key player in forging the new policy, was expected to attend along with other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. No deadline has been set, the officials said. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of “people to people” educational trips for visitors, a popular classification that a White House official said was “ripe for abuse” by those looking for beach vacations. Trump’s new policy will eliminate such self-certified visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining some individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, officials said. In a contentious internal debate, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans.

On another of its Twitter feeds, the broadcaster had earlier tweeted:  The account of al Jazeera on twitter @ajarabic is currently suspended due to what seems to be an organized campaign and we are doing the necessary work to get the service back.

{"content":"PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings (CALC) is among the inaugural customers for a larger new version of Boeing's 737 jetliner, two industry sources said on Saturday. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 will be launched at the Paris Airshow on Monday with the backing of at least two Chinese lessors - CALC and the aviation arm of China Development Bank, whose interest in the aircraft emerged earlier this week. Boeing and CALC declined to comment. CALC's purchase of the newest variant of Boeing's most-sold jet is seen as part of an order for 50 aircraft from the 737 MAX family announced by the Hong Kong leasing firm this week. CALC, part-owned by China Everbright Bank, reported the overall order on Thursday but did not disclose a breakdown by type of model. It is the company's first Boeing order and will diversify its portfolio following previous Airbus purchases. The stock exchange posting on the eve of the world's largest air show is the most concrete sign so far that the widely expected launch of the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is going ahead, subject to the formal approval of Boeing directors. The launch is expected to be backed by low-cost operators Lion Air of Indonesia and India's Spicejet. Ireland's Ryanair has confirmed a Reuters report that it is looking at the jet. It could also include an order from United Airlines, which Boeing has been actively wooing as a marquee customer. The 190-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10 is designed to plug a gap at the top end of Boeing's single-aisle range after strong sales of the competing Airbus A321neo. It will be delivered from 2020.

{"content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The University of Cambridge has refused a request by an Australian man to return important Aboriginal artifacts taken by British explorer Captain James Cook nearly 250 years ago. Rodney Kelly is seeking the return of four spears from the university’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology on behalf of the Gweagal people, who traditionally inhabited southern parts of Sydney, Australia's largest city. According the to the university, Cook took the spears following a violent first encounter between Aborigines and Europeans on the shores of Botany Bay in Sydney in 1770. He also took a shield, which is currently held by the British Museum and for which Kelly has also sought repatriation.  The artifacts are recognized as a significant symbol of first contact between the British and indigenous Australians and of Aboriginal resistance to colonization. However, the University of Cambridge has rejected a request for their return lodged by Kelly.   Removing parts of the Cook-Sandwich collection, which is of great historical, scientific and educational importance nationally and internationally, would cause considerable harm by depriving the collection of its integrity,  a spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday. The university said the request contained no clear proposal for housing and conserving the spears if they were to be returned, and added it was important that any request for change be made with  accredited representatives of the Gweagal people . Kelly, who submitted a formal request for the repatriation of the spears in November last year, claims to be a direct descendant of the Gweagal warrior Cooman, from whom he claims the spears and shield were taken. However, a report prepared by the University of Cambridge has questioned Kelly’s ability to prove his descent - something disputed by the Sydney man.  It makes me angry they are trying these tactics to discredit me and my history,  Kelly told Reuters in an interview. Cook's landing in Botany Bay on April 29, 1770 marked the first point of contact between the British and Aborigines and preceded the arrival of the first waves of colonists to Australia eight years later. Two Aboriginal men holding spears tried to resist Cook’s party landing and one was injured by British musket fire, the university says. The Gweagal then retreated and Cook and his crew entered their camp and took the spears and a shield. According to Kelly, Cooman was the injured man in the historical account, a claim the university says is not well-supported. Both the Australian Senate and state parliament of New South Wales voted last year to support the repatriation of the artifacts from the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Kelly said he would continue to fight for the artifacts' return.  I want to do everything I can to bring those artifacts home for my people and every indigenous and non indigenous person in Australia,  he said.

{"content":"MOSCOW/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Moscow said on Friday its forces may have killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an air strike in Syria last month, but Washington said it could not corroborate the death and Western and Iraqi officials were skeptical. The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he declared a caliphate to rule over all Muslims from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, after leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. If the report does prove true, it would be one of the biggest blows yet to Islamic State, which is trying to defend its shrinking territory against an array of forces backed by regional and global powers in both Syria and Iraq. But in the absence of independent confirmation, some U.S. officials said U.S. agencies were skeptical of the report. Several Iraqi security officials said Iraq was doubtful as well.  His death has been reported so often that you have to be cautious till a formal Daesh statement comes,  a European security official said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.  U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said:  We have no information to corroborate those reports.  A senior Trump administration official noted “a number of infirmities” in the reports, which have given U.S. officials reason to question their accuracy. “Some of those infirmities suggested that this happened at the end of May and that there were upwards of 300 or more soldiers killed in that strike,” said the official, who asked not to be identified. “A strike of that size and that claim that would have happened that long ago without any knowledge is something that made me curious,” the official added. The Russian Defence Ministry said on its Facebook page that it was checking information that Baghdadi was killed in the strike on the outskirts of Raqqa in Syria, launched after Russia received intelligence about a meeting of Islamic State leaders.  On May 28, after drones were used to confirm the information on the place and time of the meeting of IS leaders, between 00:35 and 00:45, Russian air forces launched a strike on the command point where the leaders were located,  the statement said.  According to the information which is now being checked via various channels, also present at the meeting was Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was eliminated as a result of the strike,  the ministry said. Operating Cautiously However, a colonel with the Iraqi national security service told Reuters Baghdadi was not believed to have been in Raqqa at the time of the strike in late May. One of Baghdadi's aides may have been killed rather than Baghdadi himself, the colonel said. He said that Baghdadi was believed to be operating cautiously in the border area between Iraq and Syria with just a handful of close aides, and avoiding using telecommunications equipment to evade surveillance. Another Iraqi intelligence official said the Russians had not shared any information with Iraqi authorities to indicate Baghdadi was killed. Iraq was checking the report and would announce his death if it received  solid confirmation . Hoshiyar Zebari, a long-serving former Iraqi foreign minister and now a senior adviser to the government of the Kurdish autonomous region, also told Reuters there was no confirmation of Baghdadi's death. The Russian defense ministry statement said the strike was believed to have killed several other senior leaders of the group in addition to Baghdadi, as well as around 30 field commanders and up to 300 of their personal guards. The IS leaders had gathered at the command center, in a southern suburb of Raqqa, to discuss possible routes for the militants' retreat from the city, the statement said. The United States was informed in advance about the place and time of the strike, the Russian military said. Close to Defeat  Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, after nearly three years ruling over millions of people in a wide swathe of territory in both countries. Russia supports the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is fighting against Islamic State fighters, one front in a multi-sided civil war. The United States supports Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria who are separately planning an assault on Raqqa. In Iraq, the U.S.-backed government has been battling to recapture Mosul since October last year after driving the group out of most of the rest of the territory it had seized. The last public video footage of Baghdadi shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is an Iraqi in his mid-forties, who broke away from al Qaeda in 2013 after years participating in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq and the Iraqi government. The U.S. State Department has offered a $25 million reward for information leading to his arrest. A number of senior IS figures have been killed in air strikes or special forces raids since the United States launched its campaign against the group in 2014, including Baghdadi's deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, the group's  minister of war  Abu Omar al-Shishani, and its media director Abu Muhammad al-Furqan. Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, cast doubt on the report Baghdadi may have been killed. He said that according to his information, Baghdadi was located in another part of Syria at the end of May. “The information is that as of the end of last month Baghdadi was in Deir al-Zor, in the area between Deir al-Zor and Iraq, in Syrian territory,” he said by phone.

{"content":"(Repeats Friday story without changes) By Tom Bergin LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - The manufacturer of the panels used to clad the London tower block where at least 30 people died in a fire this week advised customers against using its polyethylene-cored tiles -- the ones reportedly used at Grenfell Tower -- in high rise buildings. Diagrams in a brochure dated 2016 for Reynobond tiles reviewed by Reuters show how polyethylene (PE) core tiles are suitable only for buildings of up to 10 metres in height.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters' ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material,  the brochure says. The brochure was issued by French-based Arconic Architectural Products, which is responsible for the marketing in Europe of systems produced by U.S. company Arconic, which owns Reynobond. The Guardian and the BBC have reported in recent days that panels with a PE core were used in a refurbishment of the 24-storey tower bock that was completed last year. Construction company Rydon Group, which undertook the work, and the local authority which owns Grenfell Tower declined to confirm whether the panels were PE. Arconic did not respond to requests for comment. Rydon had earlier said the revamp  met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards . Other diagrams in the Reynobond brochure show that panels with a fire retardant core -- the FR model, according to Arconic's website -- can be used for buildings of up to 30 metres tall. Above that height, it says, panels with a non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used. Grenfell Tower is over 60 metres tall. Documents submitted in 2015 by the local authority's property division to its planning division seeking approvals for the refurbishment said the concrete and brick building would be clad in Reynobond insulation panels. John Cowley, director of Omnis Exteriors which supplied the padding for the refurbishment but did not install it, told the Guardian that the company had been asked to supply the Reynobond PE variant. The newspaper said the PE panels were 2 pounds ($2.56) cheaper per square metre than the Reynobond FR option. Reuters has not been able to confirm independently whether the PE panels were ultimately used or whether the use of PE-core panels is legal in Britain. Fire safety experts say polyethylene is generally avoided in tall buildings as it has been linked to a number of rapidly spreading fires at skyscrapers in Dubai and elsewhere.  Polyethylene is a thermoplastic material, which ... melts and drips as it burns, spreading the fire downwards as well as upwards,  architectural consultants Probyn Miers said in a note on insulation materials posted its website. Witnesses to Wednesday's blaze said the flames spread quickly up the building, which was left a charred shell. The London Fire Brigade has yet to say what the cause of the fire was. Building regulations documents did not specifically say PE-core panels should not be used, but three industry experts interviewed by Reuters said that did not mean builders were clearly permitted to use them. That is because British safety regulations across many industries are usually principles- rather than rules-based. This means the law often requires companies to act safely without giving a specific definition of what this would involve, said Christopher Miers of Probyn Miers. Firms are instead expected to be able to prove in court that they behaved in a way that their industry would consider safe, given current knowledge and technology, these experts added.

{"content":"(Adds details, background) DUBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - State-owned Qatargas said on Saturday it had signed an agreement with Shell for the delivery of up to 1.1 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year for five years. The agreement will start in January 2019 and will be for the supply of LNG from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (4) (Qatargas 4), a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum which holds 70 percent and Shell with the remaining 30 percent. The LNG will be delivered to either the Dragon LNG Terminal in Britain or the Gate LNG Terminal in the Netherlands, Qatargas said in a statement, which gave no value for the deal. Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of LNG, faces competition from Australian and U.S. producers. Supply deals into Europe offer a valuable option as Asia's gas-consuming economies rein in new deals in light of a growing supply overhang. The Shell agreement also comes as the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world continues to simmer. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar this month, accusing it of supporting terrorism, a charge which Doha denies. Qatargas has said its LNG supply to the world's largest LNG importer Japan would not be affected by the economic, diplomatic and transport boycott.

{"content":"(Repeats for wider audience. No change to text.) SINGAPORE, June 17 (Reuters) - Lee Hsien Yang, the brother of Singapore's prime minister, said on Saturday his father had expressly instructed the drafting of a last will directing the demolition of the family's iconic home, the latest salvo in a public feud between the city-state's leader and his two younger siblings. The comments by Lee Hsien Yang, made on his Facebook account, followed those made by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that there were  serious questions  and  deeply troubling circumstances  over how the final will of their father, Lee Kuan Yew, was drawn up. The prime minister's office was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. The feud between the children of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, over the future of the family home erupted publicly this week in a flurry of accusations and denials through press releases and Facebook postings, which also touched on Lee Hsien Loong's leadership. Both Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling say they had lost confidence in their older brother as a leader and feared that state power would be used against them in their dispute with him. The prime minister has denied these allegations, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicise private family matters. In his last will, part of which was released by Lee Hsien Yang on Thursday, Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled Singapore for three decades, said he wanted his house, a humbly furnished home near the bustling Orchard shopping district, to be demolished. Lee Hsien Loong questioned in a six-page timeline whether Lee Kuan Yew knew a clause about the demolition, which was removed in the fifth and sixth versions of the will, was re-instated in the seventh and final will, saying there was no evidence that he did. The prime minister said he had recused himself from all government decisions regarding the house, and in his personal capacity, would also like to see Lee Kuan Yew's wish honoured. His brother Lee Hsien Yang said on Saturday Lee Kuan Yew's final will was engrossed on the basis of Lee Kuan Yew's  express instruction  to revert to his first will, attaching to the statement what appeared to be an email message from Lee Kuan Yew that states his plan to sign it before a solicitor.  Lee Kuan Yew's final will was simply Lee Kuan Yew's first will of 20 Aug 2011 re-executed on his instruction,  Lee Hsien Yang said on his Facebook account.

{"content":"Royals win sixth straight with help from Cain ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Apparently, Lorenzo Cain does not play favorites. The Kansas City center fielder drove in the only two runs that Los Angeles starter Jesse Chavez allowed in seven innings. Then in the top of the eighth against Angels reliever Keynan Middleton, Cain led off with his second homer that helped the Royals extend their winning streak to six with a 3-1 victory. Cain had a home run and an RBI single against Chavez, continuing the torrid pace he has been on since the start of the month. With three more hits, Cain is batting .368 (21-for-57) with eight homers, 16 RBIs and 18 runs scored in June.  I'm just swinging at better pitches,  Cain said of his recent success.  Laying off the sliders in the dirt, laying off the bad pitches, just being able to do damage with the pitches when I get a chance to hit 'em.  Likely Cain's biggest fan was Royals starter Ian Kennedy, who began the night looking for his first win of the season. Kennedy was 0-6 with five no-decisions in his 11 starts. Kennedy was perfect through 5 2/3 innings, retiring the first 17 batters he faced until Cliff Pennington crushed a 91 mph fastball on a 3-1 count, hitting the ball into the right-field seats for his first home run of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at AngelsKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch I know Cliff pretty well,  Kennedy said.  I told him he's a terrible friend. I'm deleting his phone number from my phone.  That not only ended the no-hit and shutout bids but also seemed to crack the door open for the Angels' offense, if only temporarily. Cameron Maybin followed with a double and Kole Calhoun walked. Kennedy fell behind in the count 3-1 to Albert Pujols but got the final out of the inning on a pop to second. Kennedy was finished after the sixth and relied on the bullpen -- Mike Minor (seventh inning), Joakim Soria (eighth) and Kelvin Herrera (ninth, 14th save) -- to finish the game and preserve win No. 1.  It was only matter of time,  Kennedy said of getting his first win.  I felt really good my last start and I worked through some of those bad habits I created when I was trying pitch through my injury (strained hamstring in May) and try to do things to just be able to go out there.  Kennedy's best performance of the season before Friday came April 16 when he shut out the Angels on two hits in eight innings, only to come away with a no-decision.  He had good command tonight, in and out, changed some speeds and we didn't get too many good looks at him,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said of Kennedy.  We had three or four balls hit hard, but he worked the corners, worked the fringes, got underneath some swings. In the sixth, we had some opportunities but just couldn't get that one hit.  Chavez had one of this best games of the season, giving up two runs while scattering nine hits in seven innings. He has been hit or miss in the majority of his 14 starts this year -- he has allowed five runs or more four times but two runs or fewer seven times, including Friday.  Jesse's success is really contingent on making pitches,  Scioscia said.  What we're hopeful of is as he gets into that third time around the order, that 18th, 19th out where he can finish seven like he did, then he's going to have success.  He's pitched this deep before in games. Tonight he had good rhythm and good tempo and made pitches. Jesse keeps trying to evolve as a pitcher and I think he did some things tonight that will continue to move him forward.  The Royals took a 1-0 lead on Cain's two-out homer in the third inning, marking the third consecutive game that Cain has homered. In the fifth, the Royals got a leadoff single from Alex Gordon and a perfectly-placed, hit-and-run single to right field by Whit Merrifield, moving Gordon to third. Merrifield, though, was doubled up at first base after Pennington made a leaping catch of Jorge Bonifiacio's line drive at second. Chavez, though, couldn't get out of the inning unscathed because Cain followed with a two-out single to right field, scoring Gordon to put Kansas City up 2-0. NOTES: Angels RHP Cam Bedrosian, the club's closer to start the season but on the disabled list since April 22 with a strained groin, is expected to be activated from the disabled list. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said only that Bedrosian would be used in the  back end  of the bullpen, not committing him to the closer's role right away. RHP Bud Norris has pitched well in the closer's role in Bedrosian's absence, logging 11 saves with a 2.59 ERA and .200 opposing hitters batting average. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy, out since May 30 with a strained right oblique, threw a light side session and likely will throw again Sunday. If all goes well, he could begin facing live hitters in batting practice on Tuesday. Duffy was 4-4 with a 3.54 ERA in 11 starts before the injury. ... Angels OF Eric Young Jr. was not in the starting lineup for the first time since being called up to replace injured OF Mike Trout on May 29. Scioscia, who said he was giving Young a  breather,  started OF Ben Revere in Young's place. ...

{"content":"Ross returns in style, Rangers drub Mariners ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Texas Rangers began a season-long stretch of 20 consecutive games on Friday. It might well make or break their season. What they saw out of a long-lost rotation piece and a lineup perhaps finally coming together gave them a boost of hope. Right-hander Tyson Ross exceeded just about every expectation in his first start in 15 months, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning of the Rangers' 10-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners. Ross, who hadn't pitched since Opening Day 2016 for San Diego because of shoulder problems that ultimately led to off-season surgery, allowed a run without giving up a hit in the first after walking the game's first hitter. After the walk, Ross retired the next nine hitters and 14 of the next 15. His official line was 5 2/3 innings pitched, two hits, two runs, three walks and five strikeouts. The victory was his first since Aug. 31, 2015, coincidentally against the Rangers at Petco Park.  I'm pretty stoic in my demeanor, but inside I was real excited to be out there, crossing over those white lines and being handed the ball,  Ross said.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm just happy I was able to do a good job for the team and put us in a position to win. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at RangersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch It's a long road, it's tough to go through, and I'm happy to be back in action and I look forward to moving forward.  Ross, who signed with Texas as a free agent in January, received plenty of run support from an offense that accounted for 13 hits and combined to score seven runs in the third and fourth innings and three in the sixth on Carlos Gomez's three-run homer to center off reliever Zac Curtis. Gomez, who was activated from the disabled list before the game, went 2-for-5 with four RBIs. Jonathan Lucroy and Adrian Beltre each had two hits and two RBIs. For Beltre, the base hits represented 2,956 in his career. Robinson Chirinos led off the fourth with his eighth home run. The strikeout-prone Rangers only whiffed six times, snapping a string of 11 consecutive games in June with eight or more. Texas also welcomed Mike Napoli back from the DL. Napoli, with a base hit on Friday, is batting only .194, but he was swinging the bat better when he went down with a sore back.  When we put those guys back in the lineup -- Gomez, Beltre, Napoli -- the experience of these guys, there's no room to maneuver around,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  When we came out of spring training, that's what we envisioned: tough outs, hitters -- with two strikes, two outs -- grinding away being able to push runs across for us.  The Rangers also finally figured out Seattle left-hander James Paxton, who entered having logged three career outings of at least six scoreless innings against Texas, including in April, when he held the Rangers to two hits and one walk while striking out nine in eight innings. Paxton (5-2) gave up seven runs, seven hits and three walks while striking out four in 3 2/3 innings. Two consecutive two-out walks in the third were backbreakers for Paxton in the third. Elvis Andrus followed with an RBI double and Beltre drove in two with a base hit.  He just doesn't have any rhythm at all,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Even the secondary stuff wasn't very sharp tonight as well. It is what it is. We've got figure it out. Everything looks like a struggle. He's a big part, trying to dig us out of this little hole we've created here. We've got to get him right, back on track.  While the Rangers' offense erupted, Ross and three relievers limited the Mariners to seven hits. Mike Zunino had the Mariners' first hit, in the fifth, but Texas lefty Dario Alvarez left the catcher stranded. Nelson Cruz broke out of an 0-for-11 skid with an RBI single in the sixth, and Jarrod Dyson had a solo home run in the seventh off Jose Leclerc, who surrendered two runs in an inning pitched. The Rangers sent nine to the plate in the third, scoring five runs with four hits and two walks. Paxton stayed in to face four more hitters in the fourth and was touched for two more runs. Chirinos led off the inning with a home run and Delino DeShields followed with a base hit. DeShields stole second and scored on Gomez's double to left. Paxton labored, finishing with 91 pitches in 3 2/3 innings, including 40 in the third inning.  Something's definitely not right,  said Paxton, who had a stint on the DL in May.  The past few starts you can tell something's not quite there. But I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to fix it.  There's no issue with my arm. I'm not hurt. Just timing's off.  NOTES: The Rangers made several roster moves before the game, starting with designating RHP Dillon Gee for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for Ross. Texas also activated 1B Mike Napoli and OF Carlos Gomez from the DL and recalled LHP Dario Alvarez from Triple-A Round Rock. To make room, Texas put RHP Tony Barnette on the 10-day DL (sprained right ring finger) and optioned INF/OF Jurickson Profar and INF/OF Ryan Rua to Round Rock. ... Texas LHP Cole Hamels (oblique strain) gave up one hit in three innings and 35 pitches in an injury rehabilitation start on Friday for Double-A Frisco. He threw 22 more pitches afterward in the bullpen. ... Seattle recalled LHP Zac Curtis from Double-A Arkansas and optioned RHP Chase De Jong to Triple-A Tacoma. ...

{"content":"Thames' blast sends Brewers past Padres MILWAUKEE -- Six of the first seven home runs hit Friday night at Miller Park were of the no-doubt-about-it variety -- mammoth shots that bounced off the scoreboard or deep into the stands. The seventh, though, may have been a wall scraper, but it was still enough for the Milwaukee Brewers. Eric Thames' solo shot to lead off the 10th inning bounced off the top of the wall in center field and gave the Brewers a 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres.  That was about as close as it gets,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. Thames gave Milwaukee its fourth straight win when he got just enough of a 1-1 fastball by Ryan Buchter (3-3) for his 19th homer and was mobbed by his teammates as he crossed the plate. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at BrewersMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch I hit it and was like 'I got under it.' Hopefully the wind is blowing out,  Thames said.  I saw it hit (the wall) and I saw the outfielder. I was kind of blowing a little bit and I guess it worked.  Travis Shaw, Keon Broxton and Manny Pina also homered for Milwaukee, which has outscored its opponents 62-24 in the first inning this season. This time, Milwaukee found itself in a 4-0 hole after Junior Guerra allowed a three-run homer to Wil Myers and a solo shot to Hunter Renfroe in the opening inning. He settled in from there, holding the Padres without a hit over his final five innings and finished with just two hits and four walks while striking out three.  Junior really settled down after the first inning,  Counsell said.  The command was a little off with his fastball and he fell behind in some counts. The pitch to Meyers was just a middle fastball really. They took advantage of some balls in the middle of the late.  Shaw put the Brewers on the board with a leadoff homer in the second and with two on in the fourth, Broxton tied the game with his ninth of the season and fourth in the last six games. Starter Miguel Diaz, who the Padres plucked out of the Brewers' system last winter in the Rule 5 draft, didn't make it out of the fourth. He allowed four runs on five hits and a walk with five strikeouts in his second big league start.  He was much better today,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  He was in the strike zone. Times like the home run to Broxton, you just don't want to miss there. It was just a bad spot to miss to him. He wasn't set up there. He was looking for a fastball up and out over. He just missed his spot and he paid the price for that missed spot. The Brewers had a golden chance to pull ahead in the seventh, putting two on with one out only for Domingo Santana to end the threat by bouncing into a double play. San Diego pulled ahead in the eighth on a solo home run from Yangervis Solarte but the Brewers answered in the bottom of the frame when Pina hit his third of the season, tying the game at 5. The bullpens took over from there. Jacob Barnes got out of the eighth without further damage, Corey Knebel struck out a pair in a scoreless ninth while Jared Hughes worked a perfect 10th for Milwaukee. The Padres' bullpen had held its own before Thames homered. NOTES: Padres RHP Jered Weaver threw a three-inning simulated game Friday as he works his way back from hip inflammation that's sidelined him since May 20. ... Padres manager Andy Green said that RHP Trevor Cahill (lower back strain) and CF Manuel Margot (right calf) have made progress in their rehab processes and could see game action in the near future. ...

{"content":"Betts' homer guides Red Sox by Astros HOUSTON -- Houston Astros setup man Will Harris had no real quarrel with the quality of the pitch that yielded the decisive run on Friday night, opting instead to sincerely acknowledge the talent of Mookie Betts, who crushed the pitched over the fence. Betts homered on the first pitch of the eighth inning as the Boston Red Sox claimed a tense, 2-1 victory over the Astros at Minute Maid Park. Betts belted his 12th homer after Brian McCann hit the first pitch he saw from Boston starter Drew Pomeranz out to right field with one out in the seventh. Betts, who drilled the Harris (2-2) offering 394 feet into the Crawford Boxes in left field, also scored the first run for Boston (38-29) in the third inning, coming home on a two-out single by Mitch Moreland off Astros right-hander Mike Fiers. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at AstrosBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch I think it's huge anytime you come in and win game one, especially in a fashion like that,  Betts said.  It was a low-scoring game. It kind of shows that you can play with them even though they're good. We're good, too.  Fiers was terrific but so too was Pomeranz, who carried a three-hit shutout into the seventh before McCann parked his 10th homer. That closed the book on Pomeranz, who allowed one run on four hits and three walks with four strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings, only the second time this season he's recorded 19-plus outs.  I think he did a good job of hanging out on the outer part of the strike zone,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Pomeranz.  We chased a little bit, got a few calls to go his way and he continued to execute his pitches and his game plan. He's got a pretty good breaking ball; he's got a good arm. He cuts the ball on occasion and right up to the very end he did a good job. We couldn't solve him.  The Astros (45-23) had ample opportunity to make inroads down the stretch. George Springer was erased at the plate for the final out of the sixth inning, unwisely trying to score on a sharp Carlos Correa single to Betts in right field.  He cuts down a run to finish the sixth, then the first pitch thrown in eighth, he gives us the lead,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  Just in a small snapshot, there's Mookie's skill set on both sides of the ball. He's a dynamic player. Those throws aren't just by coincidence. The work he puts in, he throws a strike from right field at a key point in the game right there.  With two runners in scoring position in the seventh, pinch-hitter Nori Aoki ended a splendid at-bat against Red Sox right-hander Joe Kelly (3-0) with a lineout to third base. In the eighth, with Jose Altuve at third base representing the tying run, Evan Gattis rolled into an inning-ending double play against righty Matt Barnes. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth inning for his 19th save. Fiers stranded runners in scoring position in the first (Dustin Pedroia) and second (Jackie Bradley Jr.) before bending in the third on the Moreland RBI single. But when Fiers induced a double-play ground ball from Red Sox catcher Christian Vasquez, it allowed him to erase Josh Rutledge, who singled, and cap the fourth. Fiers then retired the Red Sox in order in each of his final three innings.  I was locked in all game; I felt really good,  Fiers said.  Just another game of getting ahead in the count and being the aggressor. Not letting these guys get in too many hitters' counts and putting them away as early as you can and not try to go deep into the at-bat.  NOTES: Red Sox RHP Carson Smith had his scheduled rehab assignment for Sunday pushed back due to shoulder inflammation. Smith tossed a simulated inning earlier this week and was set to report to Triple-A Pawtucket for his first game since undergoing Tommy John surgery last May. ... A pair of Astros starters, LHP Dallas Keuchel and RHP Lance McCullers, appear poised to begin throwing programs in the coming days. Keuchel has been on the 10-day disabled list since June 5 with neck discomfort; McCullers since June 9 with lower back discomfort. ... Seeking a superior defensive option for fast playing surface against an Astros team that puts the ball in play, Red Sox manager John Farrell started 3B Josh Rutledge over Pablo Sandoval, who has a June slash line of .129/.206/.258.","keywords":"A.J.

{"content":"ERIN, Wisconsin (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy and Steve Elkington engaged in a social media spat after the Australian took a potshot at the world number two who missed the cut at the U.S. Open on Friday. Elkington, the 1995 PGA Championship winner, suggested that McIlroy had lost interest in adding to his collection of four major championships.  Rory is so bored playiing golf...without Tiger the threshold is prolly 4 majors with 100mill in bank,  Elkington wrote on Twitter.  Nobody more gifted than Rory... Hes so bored playing golf on tour,  Texas-based Australian Elkington wrote in a separate tweet. McIlroy was not amused.  More like 200mil... not bad for a 'bored' 28 year old... plenty more where that came from,  replied the Northern Irishman. Elkington said Jack Nicklaus never discussed his earnings, to which McIlroy called out the Australian's spelling and wrote  That's why jack designed 100's of golf courses... and it's knew... mustn't have taught grammar in the 50's.  The exchange came after McIlroy struggled to avoid the brutal Erin Hills rough in a shocking first-round 78 en route to an early exit from the year’s second major. For the first time since 1974, four players head into the weekend tied atop the leaderboard, with Americans Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman and English duo Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood  locked at seven-under 137. That foursome does not quite roll off the tongue like the 1974 gang of Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Raymond Floyd and eventual winner Hale Irwin, but nevertheless. Rain started falling a couple of hours after the end of the second round on Friday night, and with thunderstorms likely on Saturday afternoon, chances are the course will not be firm and fiery. The wind is also forecast to be light all day, so birdies should again be plentiful. But the long fescue rough remains a severe punishment for wildly inaccuracy, so precision off the tee will remain of paramount importance, no matter what the conditions. Webb Simpson, the 2012 champion, and fellow American Tyler Light will be the Saturday dew sweepers, teeing off at 8:26 a.m. Central (1336 GMT), with the final pairing of Casey and Harman out at 2:29 p.m. Central (1929 GMT).

{"content":"Indians power their way to 8-1 win over Twins MINNEAPOLIS -- Edwin Encarnacion is starting to look like the slugger he'd shown for years in Toronto and he's producing in the middle of the Cleveland lineup as the Indians try to chase down the Minnesota Twins. Encarnacion homered for the second straight game, hitting a three-run shot to the second deck in left field, and Jose Ramirez had three hits for Cleveland in an 8-1 win against Minnesota on Friday night. Carlos Carrasco (7-3) cruised through five innings before some late trouble, but the right-hander left after 6 1/3 innings and gave up one run on four hits as Cleveland climbed within a game back of the American League Central-leading Twins.  He's probably pretty damn close to where he was last year,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Encarnacion.  He had a really slow start, but that slow start's over.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at TwinsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchIn his first season in Cleveland, Encarnacion hit .200 with four homers in 24 April games. He's become the big slugger in the heart of the order the Indians believed they were signing in the offseason and hit .337 (30-for-89) with nine homers and 19 RBIs in his last 25 games. Encarnacion gave Carrasco all of the support he would need with a big blast in the third. Jason Kipnis and Francisco Lindor reached on walks and Encarnacion hammered the first pitch he saw from rookie starter Nik Turley to the second deck in left-center field, an estimated 435 feet.  If you get something straight that's over the plate you always want to be ready to hit,  Francona said.  Edwin, that's kind of how you envision it, where with one swing you can kind of spread a game out. He certainly has been showing like he's got that in him, so that's been really, really good.  Turley (0-1) surrendered eight runs on nine hits and four walks in his second major league start for the Twins.  You can't defend walk, walk, homer,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  That's what's going to get you. He had a chance to keep us in the game there even after the Encarnacion homer and got two outs there in the fifth, and again, things kind of got away from him there.  Cleveland added four more runs in the fifth off Turley, with a two-run single by Yan Gomes and a two-run double from Lonnie Chisenhall.  Got two pretty quick outs and then things just started snowballing,  Turley said of the fifth.  Started trying to do a little too much instead of sticking with my game plan and staying within myself. There were a lot of emotions going on. It was just hard to control.  Carrasco hasn't fared well against Minnesota in his career (2-6, 4.76 ERA), but he was in control from the beginning on Friday. He struck out two batters in the first and allowed just one hit and two walks through his first five innings. Eddie Rosario homered for the only run off Carrasco to start the sixth inning. Brian Dozier and Miguel Sano added singles but Carrasco struck out Max Kepler to strand two runners. Carrasco finished with seven strikeouts.  Those guys went out there and got some runs, so the only thing we had to do as a pitching staff is come in there and throw up zeroes on the board,  Carrasco said.  That's what we try to do every game. That's what we're here for.  NOTES: Cleveland OF Brandon Guyer (left wrist sprain) was scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus. ... Minnesota LHP Hector Santiago (left shoulder strain) will throw another bullpen session on Saturday after coming out well from Thursday's 31-pitch sessions.

Rooker, who won the Triple Crown in the Southeastern Conference with a .387 average, 23 homers and 48 RBIs in 67 games, will report to Rookie League Elizabethton. ...

{"content":"Cubs rally with six in ninth for 9-5 win over Pirates PITTSBURGH -- Joe Maddon didn't have a chance to watch from the dugout as his club came back in a big way Friday night. The Chicago manager was long gone, having been ejected from the game in the first inning, when the Cubs erupted for six runs in the ninth in a 9-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. Madden still liked what he saw from the clubhouse.  That was pretty nice to watch,  Maddon said.  A lot of good opposite-field hitting there. Moving the ball the other way is what really stood out. Up and down (the lineup), guys did a good job.  The Cubs, who blew an early 3-0 lead, trailed 4-3 entering the ninth. The damage, against three Pirates pitchers, was done by Willson Contreras (RBI double), John Jay (RBI single), Anthony Rizzo (two-RBI single) and Addison Russell (two-RBI double).  You just keep playing -- that's all you can do,  Russell said.  You can't get frustrated. We just kept playing, and eventually we came through when it counted and got a really nice win.  Koji Uehara (2-3) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win. Juan Nicasio (1-3) took the loss after giving up four runs and three hits in the ninth. Pittsburgh (30-37), which has lost two in a row, got three RBIs from Josh Bell on a homer and a triple. Andrew McCutchen drove in Bell with a single in the sixth for a 4-3 lead. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at PiratesMcCutchen doubled and scored on Francisco Cervelli's single in the ninth to make it 9-5 as the Pirates sent nine men to the plate but couldn't get a bigger rally going.  It was a roller-coaster ride,  Bell said.  It's too bad that we didn't come out on top, but just giving ourselves a chance in that last inning was fun.  Chicago (33-33) had lost 10 of its previous 11 road games and avoided matching a season low of two games below .500. Cubs starter Eddie Butler allowed four runs and four hits with three walks and no strikeouts through 5 2/3 innings after initially shutting down the Pirates. Butler did not allow a hit through 3 1/3 innings. He pitched to the minimum number of batters to that point. McCutchen was the only runner during that stretch with a two-out walk in the second, but he was picked off first. Pittsburgh starter Trevor Williams, who was 2-1 in his previous six starts, allowed three runs and four hits, all in the first inning, with three strikeouts and two walks. The first eight Cubs batters reached -- two walks, two singles, two double and two fielder's choices. Williams then retired 12 in a row before leaving for a pinch hitter in the fifth after throwing 76 pitches.  (Catcher Francisco Cervelli) came up to me and just said, 'Why are you trying so hard? Why are you trying to do too much?'  Williams said.  It's a reminder that I've been trying to work through this entire year.  I've been trying to make perfect pitches, especially early. You can't make perfect pitches every time. It's just about execution.  (Cervelli) reminded me, and it really got me back to center and I figured out how to become the pitcher I am.  Things got heated quickly when Rizzo, the first batter of the game, hit a 1-1 ball over the right-field stands and into the Allegheny River on one bounce. It was initially called a homer -- it would have been his third leadoff homer in as many games -- but was changed by the umpiring crew to a foul ball. Maddon was among the Chicago contingent who argued vehemently, and he got ejected.  Rizzo hit a home run that was called fair, so that's the call on the field,  Maddon said.  They get together, whereas instant replay is available, and somehow decided the ball was foul. Nobody was definitive about it.  They might have thought it was foul, but nobody was sure it was foul. If it would be foul (by replay review), I would have been in the game for nine innings. It wasn't followed by procedure and they basically neutered instant replay by not (having a video review).  Rizzo eventually walked, and while he was later thrown out at third, Chicago scored three times in the first. Ian Happ scored from third on a wild pitch and Contreras doubled in two runs for a 3-0 lead, although he was out at third trying for a triple to end the inning. Pittsburgh didn't manufacture anything out of its first hit, a one-out single by Josh Harrison in the fourth, but its second hit off Butler was Bell's leadoff homer to left-center in the fifth, making it 3-1. In the sixth, Bell chased Butler with a two-out, two-RBI triple off the right-field wall to tie it 3-3.  I started to get tired,  Butler said.  I lost some velocity in that inning, but I still could have gotten through it if I had located my pitches better. I kept trying to get that third out and I just never got it.  McCutchen greeted reliever Pedro Strop with an infield single, bringing home Bell for a 4-3 Pirates lead. NOTES: Chicago 2B Ben Zobrist was put in the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Tuesday, because of left wrist inflammation. ... The Cubs recalled 3B Tommy La Stella from Triple-A Iowa to take Zobrist's roster spot. ... Pittsburgh signed RHP Shane Baz, the 12th overall selection in the draft earlier in the week. He turns 18 Saturday and will begin his pro career in the Gulf Coast League. ...

{"content":"Castellanos, Upton lead Tigers' hit parade in 13-4 win DETROIT -- After several forgettable seasons, Alex Avila is putting together a year to remember. Avila broke the dam open with a home run leading off the fourth inning Friday night and the Detroit Tigers used a consecutive five-run frames to register a 13-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Nick Castellanos drove in four runs with a double and a triple and Justin Upton drove in three with two hits while Daniel Norris (4-4) allowed two runs on six hits through six innings. Norris was taken out after giving up a triple to right center by Mallex Smith plus an RBI single to Daniel Robertson to begin the seventh.  We weren't getting the results but we were having good at-bats,  Upton said.  That's all you can ask for. Alex kind of opened things up and we went from there.  Avila's 10th home run of the season came on a 1-2 slider that he drove the other way and over the left field wall for a 2-2 tie. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at TigersTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch Batting second, you can't swing at every first pitch every time,  Avila said.  And you can't go up and take the first pitch every time. Usually when an inning like that happens, pitchers are making mistakes and you're hitting them.  Sometimes you get a bloop or a misplay that keeps the inning going.  Erasmo Ramirez (3-2) gave up a leadoff home run to Ian Kinsler but then set down nine straight batters before Avila's home run knocked down the barrier. Kinsler's home run was his fifth of the season, third leading off a game and 43rd of his career, putting him sixth all-time on that list.  Their bats just came to life,  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.  They had a lot of hard-hit balls. He just threw too much over the white (of the plate). We like our pitchers to attack, attack, attack.  And obviously there's a fine line in there, especially against some of these hitters that can hit the ball really hard. Looked a couple pitches were up in the zone and a couple, from the Jumbotron feed, looked middle, middle.  Once manager Brad Ausmus plucked Norris from the game, Warwick Saupold came in to throw a double play grounder. He also worked the eighth, with Daniel Stumpf pitching the ninth and giving up a run on a sacrifice fly to center by Robertson. Norris struck out eight and walked one. The Tigers exploded for five runs in the fourth to take a 6-2 lead and added five more in the fifth for an 11-2 margin. Ramirez gave up nine hits in 4 2/3 innings with two walks (one intentional) and two strikeouts. Miguel Cabrera walked after the Avila home run and J.D. Martinez singled to right. Upton lined an RBI double to center and Castellanos lined a two-run double to extreme left. James McCann added a sacrifice fly. Upton got the scoring started in the fifth with a two-run double to left. Austin Pruitt relieved and two runs scored on a two-out throwing error on a ground ball to short by McCann while Jose Iglesias grounded an RBI single to drive in the last of three unearned runs in the inning. Castellanos hit his two-run triple with two out in the sixth to make it 13-2.  Avila comes up and hits the home run to lead that inning off. Then a four-pitch walk to Cabrera,  Cash said.  That's a little telling to me. The hard hits are going to happen. We got to avoid that walk to extend the inning and allow Martinez, Castellanos, and Upton all those guys come up there to bang.  The Rays tied the score, 1-1, in the third when Peter Bourjos tripled to right and scored on a fielder's choice grounder to third by Steven Souza Jr. when Castellanos threw wildly to the plate on the play. Logan Morrison walked to start the fourth and scored on singles by Smith and Robertson off Norris, giving Tampa Bay a 2-1 lead. Smith tried a steal of home in the fourth but his lead was too short and he was thrown out 1-3-2.  I'm fine with that,  Cash said.  Looking back on it, ideally, he's thinking along with the game. We got a 2-1 lead doing everything we can to extend it, make it 3-1.

{"content":"Bour, Straily lead Marlins to shutout of Braves ATLANTA -- Justin Bour always likes hitting against Atlanta and Dan Straily enjoyed pitching against the Braves as well Friday night. Bour hit his 11th career homer off the Braves in his first game back from the disabled list and Straily pitched 6 1/3 masterful innings to lead the Miami Marlins to a 5-0 victory. Straily (5-4) allowed four hits, walked none and struck out eight as he bounced back from a rough game in his previous start at Pittsburgh to lower his ERA to 3.58.  He kind of kept them off balance. Couldn't really ask for anything much more than that,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Straily's outing.  I was able to control my fastball more than anything,  said Straily, who was 14-8 with a 3.76 ERA for Cincinnati last season.  That was something, after the last couple of starts, that we kind of focused on. It's something I was frustrated with. It comes down to fastball command, and other stuff plays a lot better.  It was the 13th victory in the past 18 games for the Marlins (30-35). The only time the Braves got a runner into scoring position was when Ender Inciarte doubled leading off the first inning. He moved up on a ground out, but Straily struck out Nick Markakis and Tyler Flowers to end Atlanta's lone threat. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BravesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch The last thing you want is to start with a runner on third and one out,  Straily said.  You just have to find a way to keep him from scoring. I was fortunate enough to have a couple of strikeouts and get out of the inning.  Bour hit his 17th homer in his second at-bat since being activated from the disabled list because of a left ankle contusion. He tied Giancarlo Stanton and Marcell Ozuna for the team lead. Rookie left-hander Sean Newcomb (0-2) took the loss in his second start but again showed the promise the Braves (29-37) were hoping to see.  He set the bar pretty high in the first one and I thought it was pretty good again,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  This is a hot team (he faced). They've been playing good and scoring a lot of runs.  Newcomb, who hit 100 mph four times, allowed three runs, five hits and four walks, striking out three. The 23-year-old made his major league debut Saturday by allowing just four hits and an unearned run in 6 1/3 innings of a loss to the New York Mets. He struck out seven and walked two in that game. The Marlins had two hits and drew three walks in the sixth inning, but Newcomb limited the damage. The only run scored on a double play.  I liked what I saw there. He competed very well,  Snitker said. Christian Yelich's two-run single, his third hit, padded the Marlins' lead in the ninth. Gordon also had his third hit in the inning. Marlins relievers Jarlin Garcia, David Phelps and Kyle Barraclough retired eight straight batters to close out the victory. The Braves scored 29 runs in taking two of three games at Washington early in the week, but they have scored just three runs while losing their past four home games. Gordon led off the game with a single for Miami and, after a stolen base, scored on a one-out double by Yelich. After walking the next batter, Newcomb retired 10 straight batters before Bour connected with a high fastball clocked at 97 mph in the fourth inning, sending it over the fence in center field for a 2-0 Marlins lead. Since winning their first four games at SunTrust Park, the Braves are 9-18 and have been outscored 160-103.  He was just really good changing speeds and we didn't really get any good swings on him all night,  Snitker said of Straily.  We had a real good game pitched against us.

{"content":"Ramirez powers Indians to doubleheader split with Tigers DETROIT -- The Cleveland Indians needed a jolt. A pitch thrown behind Carlos Santana did the trick. Santana, Cleveland's first basemen, got plunked in the back by Detroit Tigers starter Jordan Zimmermann in the fifth inning. Santana yelled at Zimmermann before taking first base, but no one was ejected. The following inning, the Indians erupted in a constructive way. Jose Ramirez's two-run homer capped a four-run sixth inning and the Indians salvaged the second game of a day-night doubleheader with a 4-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday night at Comerica Park. Three Detroit batters had been hit by pitches during the day before the pitch that whizzed behind Santana.  A couple of their guys got hit. I understand that. But I don't think you ever throw behind somebody,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.  Looking back, though, it might have been the best thing that happened to us because it woke us up and our guys really got after it from there. We played with a lot more energy.  Related CoverageCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchMichael Brantley and Edwin Encarnacion drove in the other runs for the American League Central-leading Indians (43-37). Carlos Carrasco (9-3) held the Tigers (36-44) to one run and four hits in seven innings. Carrasco bounced back from an outing in which he gave up eight earned runs in 3 1/3 innings against Texas on Monday. Andrew Miller posted his second save. Carrasco retired the last 10 batters he faced after hitting Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias with a fourth-inning pitch.  I don't want to hit anyone. I just want to get a ground ball to get an out,  Carrasco said.  The game's 1-0 and a man on (second), I don't want to hit anyone. I was just trying to throw inside to get a ground ball and that hit him. After that, I started to pitch a little more aggressive.  Zimmermann (5-6) gave up four runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He held Cleveland to one hit before the sixth.  That's the way it's been going for me,  Zimmermann said.  I've been pitching well and I'm just not getting the results.  Zimmermann said there was no intent on the pitch to Santana.  I got him out the first time up and in,  he said.  I was having a tough time all night going in on lefties. Everything kept running back, running back. I told myself 'Drive it in there.' I drove it in there and threw behind him.  I don't know what he was saying. I couldn't understand him. Obviously, he was upset and probably thought it was intentional, but it wasn't.  Mikie Mahtook had two hits and drove in Detroit's run. The Tigers won the opener 7-4, breaking a 4-4 tie with three runs in the seventh inning. Nicholas Castellanos had three hits, including a go-ahead triple in the seventh, and J.D. Martinez and Miguel Cabrera hit back-to-back homers for Detroit. Shane Greene (2-2) got one out and the victory and Justin Wilson notched his eighth save. Losing pitcher Bryan Shaw (2-3) allowed three runs and three hits in two-thirds of an inning. Roberto Perez led off Cleveland's big sixth inning in the nightcap with a single and Jason Kipnis followed with a double. Brantley's RBI groundout brought in the first run and Encarnacion's bloop single knocked in the second run. Ramirez then crushed the next offering into the right field stands, making it 4-1 and ending Zimmermann's night. The Tigers grabbed the early lead in the second inning. Castellanos led off with a double and one out later Mahtook brought him home. Mahtook checked his swing and he made enough contact to bloop the ball over second baseman Jason Kipnis for a single.

{"content":"Cabrera blast lifts Mets over Phillies NEW YORK -- Asdrubal Cabrera requested a trade from the New York Mets eight days ago. The Philadelphia Phillies might want to acquire him just so he stops using them as a one-man bobblehead doll cottage industry. Cabrera celebrated his bobblehead doll day in style Saturday afternoon, when he hit the go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh inning to lift the Mets to a 7-6 win over the Phillies at Citi Field. Cabrera's homer Saturday wasn't quite as dramatic as the one that was recreated on Saturday's giveaway -- a walk-off, bat-flipping blast he hit against the Phillies on Sept. 22. The bobbleheaded Cabrera is pictured raising his arms upright and far apart while the bat lays next to him.  I think the bobblehead looks better,  Cabrera said with a grin. If Cabrera's two-out shot to right off Pat Neshek doesn't become a bobblehead, it'll at least make the social media rounds Saturday night. Cabrera held his bat aloft for a couple seconds while watching the ball, which landed on one of the dugout roofs in right-center field. He made the sign of the cross upon touching home plate before emphatically slapping his hands together. The homer capped a wild seventh inning in which seven runs were scored by the two teams -- the Phillies took the lead in the top half on a three-run homer by Tommy Joseph -- and gave the Mets (38-42) more reason to believe they can make an unlikely surge into postseason contention. New York has won four straight and seven out of eight to move within 8 1/2 games of the first-place Washington Nationals in the National League East. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MetsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch These are the games when you've got to say to yourself, look, we're not out of it,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Nor does it look as if Cabrera will be heading out of town anytime soon. Cabrera asked for a trade on June 23 upon learning that he'd play second base instead of his usual shortstop. General manager Sandy Alderson has said numerous times that the July trade market isn't developing yet. And even if it was, Cabrera is turning himself into an even more valuable piece for the Mets by hitting .394 (13-for-33) with five multi-hit games -- including a 2-for-4 effort Saturday -- since the position change.  'Cabby' understood the whole dynamics of everything,  Collins said.  I knew when he got out there that he'd settle in and play very, very well. I tell you, if we get him hot, we're going to have a good finish.  Cabrera has been reluctant to discuss his trade demand or his feelings about the position change since his initial comments on June 23.  I just come every day to get better,  Cabrera said.  I do my best to help the team.  The homer by Cabrera came just 12 minutes before heavy rains began and umpires waved the players off the field with two outs and a runner on in the top of the eighth. Following a delay of 57 minutes, Addison Reed entered and struck out Freddy Galvis before finishing off his 14th save by working around a leadoff double in the ninth by Aaron Altherr, who was stranded at third. Fernando Salas (1-2) tossed two innings and earned the win despite giving up Joseph's tie-breaking homer. Jose Reyes opened the Mets' scoring with an RBI double in the second. Jay Bruce had an RBI groundout immediately before Lucas Duda homered in the fourth. T.J. Rivera led off the seventh with a homer off Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson. Neshek (2-2) took the loss after giving up three runs on three hits -- including an RBI single to pinch-hitter Wilmer Flores, two batters before Cabrera homered -- while striking out one over two-thirds of an inning.  Every night there's going to be a winner and a loser, pitching (and) at the plate, and today wasn't me,  Neshek said. Entering Saturday, Neshek had surrendered just two runs in his first 31 2/3 innings this season.  What a shame,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  Neshek has been just about unhittable the whole season.  Joseph also had an RBI double in the fifth for the Phillies (26-53), who plated their first two runs in the fourth when Joseph and Nick Williams scored after Mets starter Zack Wheeler dropped a relay throw at first on a potential inning-ending double play grounder by Ty Kelly. Wheeler, who was activated from the disabled list prior to the game, gave up two unearned runs on two hits and two walks while striking out four over 3 2/3 innings. Hellickson allowed four runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out four over 6 1/3 innings. NOTES: To make room for RHP Zack Wheeler on the 25-man roster, the Mets placed OF Michael Conforto (left hand bone bruise) on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 28. ... The fourth-inning homer by Mets 1B Lucas Duda was the 122nd of his career, tying him for eighth on the team's all-time list with former OF Kevin McReynolds. ...

{"content":"(Reuters) - Nevada, the only state where both gambling and prostitution are legal, is adding recreational marijuana to its list of sanctioned indulgences for adults, with sales kicking off at more than dozen shops beginning on Saturday. As result of a legalization measure approved by Nevada voters in November, the state will join four other U.S. states and the District of Columbia in allowing recreational sales. Authorized marijuana shops will be able to sell up to one ounce (28 grams) for recreational use by customers 21 years and older, said Stephanie Klapstein, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Taxation.    Public consumption of marijuana is prohibited, and Nevada has enacted new regulations against edible forms of pot that could appeal to children, such as fruit-shaped candies infused with cannabis. Nevada is also imposing a 10 percent excise tax on pot sales in addition to the regular 4.6 percent state sales tax.  Nevada has yet to finalize the exact number of stores that regulators will approve. Sixty applications were submitted from across the state, according to Klapstein, whose department is overseeing the state's pot market. Only medical cannabis dispensaries, which became legal in the state in 2015, are eligible to apply for licenses for recreational sales.

Tens of millions of visitors per year from all over the U.S. and around the world will see firsthand that regulating marijuana works,  said Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a group that backed the November 2016 ballot measure. Voters in three other states - California, Maine and Massachusetts - have also approved marijuana legalization. In 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Oregon and Alaska.  Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. Most U.S. states allow it for medical purposes, but not for recreation.  A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman in an email declined to comment on Nevada's state-sanctioned marijuana sales and added that the department is reviewing its policies on marijuana enforcement.  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has long opposed easing marijuana restrictions. At a speech in March, he described marijuana as  only slightly less awful  than heroin and said the United States needed to discourage drug use.

{"content":"Morrison homers twice, Rays batter Orioles BALTIMORE -- Tampa Bay Rays manager Kevin Cash would love to see Logan Morrison play in this year's All-Star Game. The power-hitting first baseman is making a strong case for himself. Morrison hit two of Tampa Bay's four home runs, leading the Rays past the Baltimore Orioles 10-3 on Saturday. Tampa Bay can complete its first three-game sweep in Baltimore since 2013 with a win on Sunday. The Orioles have lost three of their past four and allowed 10 runs or more 11 times this season.  Great win,  Cash said.  It's kind of nice not to have a nail-biter here. The offense poured it on. When we can do those little things that allow the inning to extend, this offense is capable of a lot big things.  Related CoveragePreview: Rays at OriolesTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMorrison now has a career-high 24 home runs. Steven Souza and Wilson Ramos also homered for the Rays.  I feel like I've been taking good swings; I just haven't been getting the ball in the air enough,  Morrison said.  The problem is if you don't hit them out, guys can catch them.  Baltimore's Manny Machado had a single in the third inning, snapping an 0-for-17 skid. Jonathan Schoop hit his 16th home run for Baltimore. Rays right-hander Jake Odorizzi (5-3) was charged with three runs and five hits with three strikeouts and two walks in five innings (111 pitches). He has allowed at least three earned runs in six straight starts and given up a home run in his past 13 outings.  We made him throw a lot of pitches,  Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini said.  I think he ended up with five innings, and over 100 pitches, so we did a good job of getting on base. Just couldn't capitalize on some of those situations.  The Rays took a 3-0 lead off Dylan Bundy (8-7) in the first when Mallex Smith scored from first on a single by Evan Longoria and Morrison followed with a homer. Baltimore cut the lead to 3-1 on a two-out RBI single by Craig Gentry. Tampa Bay responded in the third with solo homers by Morrison and Souza, the 11th time the Rays have hit back-to-back home runs this season. Bundy was pitching on six days' rest and made back-to-back starts against Tampa Bay. The time off did not help him as he labored through just four innings, allowing five runs and seven hits with seven strikeouts. It was the shortest start of the season for Bundy, who has given up a home run in 11 straight games.  Yeah, long ball got me in trouble today, obviously,  Bundy said.  I mean, just pitches right down the middle or pitches that were up in the zone and they were able to hammer today, so, tough game plan. They came out swinging the bats early and tried to manage it, but wasn't able to today.  Ramos' three-run shot off Alec Asher provided an 8-1 lead in the fifth. After Schoop's two-run homer cut into the margin, the Rays answered with two more runs in the sixth on a throwing error by right fielder Gentry and a double by Corey Dickerson. NOTES: There was a one-hour, 12-minute delay because of rain. ... Orioles 1B Chris Davis (strained right oblique) could begin throwing Monday. ...

{"content":"Span scores on wild pitch in 11th as Giants jolt Pirates PITTSBURGH -- Considering the difficult time the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates had in scoring runs, perhaps it was fitting that the winning play wasn't a towering home run. Or even hit. Or a walk. It was a wild pitch. Denard Span scored on a wild pitch in the 11th inning Saturday as the Giants won their fifth game in a row with a 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh at PNC Park.  You take it,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  I mean, wild pitch, both teams are having a hard time.  Span walked with one out. He advanced to second on a passed ball and to third on Joe Panik's single to left. After Hunter Pence struck out, reliever Daniel Hudson (1-4) walked Buster Posey, but the fourth ball was wild and Span raced home.  I did my best. I missed. It happens. It's the game,  Pirates rookie catcher Elias Diaz said of the wild pitch. When the ball flipped toward the backstop, Hudson crouched and held his head in his hands.  If I was going to get beat there, I was going to get beat by the best pitch,  said Hudson, Pittsburgh's fifth pitcher.  (Against) a right-hander this year, that's my slider. I was just trying to make a quality pitch. If I walk him, I walk him. I just got a little bit too much bite on it and got a bad kick.  Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PiratesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchThe fifth straight win matches the season high for the Giants (32-51). Pittsburgh (37-44) reached the halfway point of season with a two-game losing streak. Josh Osich (2-1) picked up the win after pitching a scoreless 10th inning. Sam Dyson worked the 11th for his first save. San Francisco starter Matt Moore has been inconsistent all season, but had one of his better outings, if a little on the short side. He allowed one run on four hits over 5 2/3 innings, with five strikeouts and six walks in the no-decision.  Pitching with runners on base, a lot of runners on base all day,  said Moore, who is 1-4 in his past eight starts.  I think I had one clean inning (the fifth) in there.  But as the game went on, I think I settled in with just a little bit more of my mechanics.  Pittsburgh starter Chad Kuhl, facing San Francisco for the first time, no-hit the Giants through five innings. He gave up one run, a homer by Austin Slater, on two hits, with three strikeouts and one walk over six innings. It was the first time since April 18 that Kuhl lasted more than five innings.  He knows what the situation is,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Kuhl.  He wants to pitch deeper into games. He put himself in a situation to do that today.  Kuhl needed medical attention on the mound when the game's first batter, Span, hit a chopper that hit the right-hander in the left wrist area, above the glove. However, Kuhl was able to stay in the game. With two outs in the bottom of the first, Moore walked the bases loaded and got a visit from pitching coach Dave Righetti before he got Diaz to ground back to the mound. The Pirates took a 1-0 lead in the third. With two outs, Andrew McCutchen slapped a double to the left-field corner. After David Freese walked, Josh Bell's single to right scored McCutchen. San Francisco not only broke up Kuhl's no-hit bid in the sixth but also tied it. Slater led off with his third homer, a shot that just cleared the wall and McCutchen's glove in center to make it 1-1.  He's pretty strong. He gets carry on the ball. I think (his bat) has paint on it from scraping the wall as it went over,  Bochy said, even though that part of the wall is padded.  That was huge.  Pittsburgh had a chance to win it in the ninth. With two outs, reliever Hunter Strickland walked the bases loaded before striking out Diaz.  Things weren't really going my way for a little bit,  Strickland said. Those three runners were among the 15 Pittsburgh stranded as the Pirates had seven hits and 10 walks.  That's one of those games,  Bochy said.  We were fortunate. We know it. We were dodging bullets all game.  NOTES: San Francisco 3B Ryder Jones got hit by a pitch in the left wrist area in the 10th inning. Manager Bruce Bochy said X-rays showed no break but that Jones was sore and won't play Sunday. ...

{"content":"WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump honored military veterans in Washington on Saturday at a Kennedy Center event that resembled both a political rally and an evangelical Christian religious service ahead of the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Using the podium again to lash out at the news media, Trump worked to energize evangelicals in his political base, noting that the U.S. currency was inscribed with the words: “In God We Trust.   Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that liberty comes from our creator. Our rights are given to us by God, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away,  he said. Attendees at the event for veterans waved miniature American flags from their seats in the theater and raised their hands as a sign of praise while a large choir sang ahead of Trump's remarks. The president praised veterans from each of the U.S. military branches and highlighted his administration's work to reform veterans' services. Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, flew back to Washington for the rally but did not spend the night at the White House, preferring to return to Bedminster. Trump has held campaign-like rallies regularly during his first few months in the White House and kicked off his own re-election campaign far earlier than other incumbents in recent history. Part of his strategy to connect with his supporters has included criticizing the media, and he included harsh words for the press again in his remarks.  The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them,  he said.  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I'm president, and they're not.

{"content":"Swanson delivers in clutch as Braves edge A's OAKLAND, Calif. -- After a rough start to his season, Atlanta Braves rookie shortstop Dansby Swanson got hot in June, and he didn't cool off when the calendar flipped on Saturday. Swanson hit a tiebreaking RBI double in the seventh inning and another one in the ninth inning, leading the Braves to a 4-3 victory against the Oakland Athletics at the Oakland Coliseum.  Just a learning curve and trying to get where I need to be personally, mentally,  said Swanson, who was drafted No. 1 overall by Arizona in 2015.  Just trying to become the best version of myself every day. Taking the positives and moving forward with those and taking the negatives and learning from them again. Ups and downs. This game's hard. Just trying to learn each day and become better.  Swanson was batting .185 at the end of May, but he's raised his batting average to .229. He hit .296 in June. Batting ninth in the order on Saturday, he went 2-for-4 with two RBIs and had his 12th multi-hit game of the season.  He had a really good June,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  I know he and (hitting coach Kevin Seitzer) have been working, and he made some adjustments. He keeps working and he keeps his head and believes in himself. He has confidence in his abilities and we're seeing it.  Braves knuckleballer R.A. Dickey allowed one run over six innings in a no-decision. Dickey struck out four and walked three. He has allowed a combined two runs over 20 innings over his past three starts, going 2-0.  I had a good enough knuckleball where I was getting a lot of weak contact,  Dickey said.  Even the inning they scored their run, it was little nubber up the middle, a ground ball to the right side, a bleeder to left. So that's kind of how I gauge how the knuckleball was, how well they were squaring it up. They only really squared up a couple.  Related CoveragePreview: Braves at AthleticsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchA's right-hander Paul Blackburn received a no-decision despite allowing one unearned run on three hits over six innings in his major-league debut. Blackburn, who was called up Saturday from Triple-A Nashville, struck out four, walked one and threw 96 pitches. He pitched in front of a large contingent of family members and friends from his hometown of Brentwood, some 45 miles northeast of Oakland.  Honestly, this is probably one of the best days of my life,  Blackburn said.  I'm just trying to take it all in. I'm not really sure it's me yet, but it was a lot of fun.  Blackburn made a strong impression on A's manager Bob Melvin.  I thought his composure was great,  Melvin said.  From the very start you worry about nerves a little bit, but it didn't seem like there were any.  The Braves have won the first two contests of the three-game interleague series and will go for the sweep Sunday afternoon. Atlanta took a 2-1 lead in the seventh when Danny Santana, the No. 8 hitter, blooped a one-out single, stole second and third and scored on Swanson's double. The Braves increased their lead to 3-1 in the eighth. Nick Markakis hit a leadoff double and scored with one out from third on Matt Adams' sacrifice fly. But the A's pulled even with two runs in the bottom of the eighth. After reliever Arodys Vizcaino walked Jed Lowrie, Khris Davis crushed his next pitch 458 feet off a window in a luxury suite far beyond and above the fence in left-center field. Davis' homer was his team-high 22nd of the season. The Braves moved ahead 4-3 in the ninth with an unearned run. A's rookie shortstop Franklin Barreto booted Santana's ground ball with one out for his second error of the game. Santana stole second and scored on Swanson's double down the left field line off Santiago Casilla (1-3). Jim Johnson, a former Athletic, pitched a perfect ninth with two strikeouts for his 18th save of the season and second straight against Oakland.  I think it just kind of shows what this team is about,  Swanson said of the ninth-inning rally.  We just keep going at it and going at it.  Santana went 2-for-4 with a double and an RBI, stole three bases and scored twice. Ryon Healy went 3-for-3 with a walk and an RBI for the A's. The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the second inning, scoring an unearned run off Blackburn. Tyler Flowers led off with a ground ball to Barreto, who airmailed his throw to first for a two-base error. Flowers scored on Santana's one-out double. Oakland pulled even with a run in the fourth off Dickey. Davis walked with one out, moved to second on Yonder Alonso's bloop single to left and scored when Healy grounded a sharp single to center. Matt Olson grounded a single to right, loading the bases, but Dickey got Josh Phegley to ground into a double play.

{"content":"Brewers erupt early in rout of Marlins MILWAUKEE -- Tom Koehler returned to the major leagues after six weeks of trying to get back on track in Triple-A, but his first start back with the Miami Marlins didn't go much better than his last. Koehler allowed seven runs -- all of them coming in the second inning -- as the Marlins fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-4 on Saturday afternoon at Miller Park.  The results were terrible but I felt closer to myself than I did,  said Koehler, who hadn't started a big league game since May 16, when he allowed eight runs over three innings to the Astros.  It's a really odd thing to say after a game like that. But there's still work that needs to be done. You've got to be able to put guys away.  It's just tough. You want to come back and set the tone and have a quality outing right away and put the team in a position to win the game, and when you don't do that it's very frustrating.  After his offense staked him to an early 2-0 lead on Justin Bour's two-run double, Koehler needed just nine pitches to get through the first inning but needed 50 to go through the second. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BrewersMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchKoehler got off to a bad start by walking leadoff batter Travis Shaw in the second. Domingo Santana followed and ripped an 0-2 offering to the wall in right that grazed the edge of Giancarlo Stanton's glove and dropped into a picnic area for his 14th home run of the season, tying -- and possibly changing the course -- of the game.  If I catch it the game is completely different, and we can probably have a chance to win that game,  Stanton said. It was all downhill for Koehler from there. Stephen Vogt followed with a single and Keon Broxton struck out for the first out of the inning. Orlando Arcia was up next and he reached on a base hit to left. A botched pickoff attempt let both runners advance to second and third, respectively, and Vogt put the Brewers ahead when he slipped underneath the tape of catcher J.T. Realmuto as Zach Davies reached on a fielder's choice. Jonathan Villar drove home Arcia with a single, putting the Brewers up 4-2, and Koehler gave up another single, this time to Eric Thames, loading the bases for Ryan Braun, who struck out. Shaw plated another pair with a single and Santana drew a walk, loading the bases again, and bringing Koehler's day to an end.  We got off to a decent start and got two runs,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  Even if they got three or four, you can keep the game there and manage it. It gets to seven and then you have trouble getting back into it. It is a big hill to get back into it. Every run they score seems like a spike.  Milwaukee scored one more when Vance Worley walked Vogt with the bases loaded before Broxton struck out a second time to end the inning.  We just had good at-bats against Koehler and made him work really hard, so we survived,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He got a big out with striking out Brauny and we were still in. Travis had a nice at-bat. Domingo had a nice at-bat. Stephen Vogt had a nice at-bat. So that was big two-out at-bats there.  Davies gave up two more in the third but settled in from there and worked six full innings, allowing four runs on five his and two walks while striking out five.  I really thought he got it going,  Counsell said.  The last three innings, especially the last two innings, I thought they may have been his best two innings of the season. I mean, the command was as good as we've seen it. The glove wasn't moving. He was hitting the glove really well. Certainly encouraging and hopefully something he can take out of it.  NOTES: Umpire Joe West was behind the plate Saturday, a day after he was hit in the head by a baseball thrown from the stands at Miller Park. Neither West nor the Brewers were commenting on the matter, but the culprit had not yet been identified. Souvenir balls were pulled from the racks of souvenir stands. ... With the exception of recently acquired C Stephen Vogt, Milwaukee was with its regular starting lineup for the first time since mid-May. ...

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A doctor who killed another physician at a New York City medical center and wounded six other people before taking his own life had sent an email to a newspaper blaming hospital officials for wrecking his career, the New York Daily News reported on Saturday. The paper posted on its website a copy of the email that appeared to have been sent by Dr Henry Bello hours before the deadly shooting on Friday afternoon at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. The gunman, wearing a white medical lab coat, stalked two floors of the hospital, opening fire on victims before trying to set himself on fire and then shooting himself to death, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said on Friday. He was dead when police found him. In the email, Bello said the hospital blocked his path to obtaining a license to practice medicine in New York state.  First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse,  Bello said in the email. He said he had been accused of threatening a colleague, one in a series of what he called  bogus complaints.    The email did not appear to threaten violence.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Swede David Lingmerth limped to a three-over-par 73 on Saturday but it was enough to keep him at the top of the Quicken Loans National leaderboard heading into Sunday's final round.     On a day that featured soaring scores for the final groups and a rain delay of more than an hour, Lingmerth rebounded from an early double bogey to stay on top by one shot at TPC Potomac in Maryland.     Lingmerth sits at seven-under for the tournament ahead of American Daniel Summerhays, who shot even-par 70 to remain at six-under.      It's not the day I wanted but I think I'm right where I need to be for tomorrow,  Lingmerth told reporters on Saturday.  You have to be in the fairway here to score. I struggled with it. It was a tough day.      Spencer Levin produced the day’s best round with a five-under 65 and is two shots back of the Swede.

He bogeyed the first and made a double at the fourth but still led by two until a bogey at the par-3 17th tightened the tournament to one shot.  I felt pretty good to begin with but got myself into some trouble,  Lingmerth said.  I think my tempo was a little bit off with the driver today.  Summerhays, looking for his first win on the PGA Tour, kept the pressure on with a steady round that featured a birdie and a bogey.

{"content":"Stephens excels in debut as Reds slip past Cubs CINCINNATI -- Even if his major league debut on Saturday afternoon is the only start right-hander Jackson Stephens makes before heading back to the minor leagues, the 23-year-old left quite an impression. Stephens allowed three runs in five innings and also had a two-run single to lift the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Great American Ball Park. Stephens (1-0), who was recalled from Triple-A Louisville prior to the game, had eight strikeouts and only one walk to earn his first career win.  He threw strikes in the first inning, which isn't always easy for a guy in his debut,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  He challenged batters in the zone. He had two competitive innings in four and five (allowing one hit with three strikeouts). Great debut for a young guy.  Adam Duvall had an RBI double and Joey Votto went 2-for-3 with a walk to get within three hits of 1,500 for his career as Cincinnati (35-45) has taken the first two games of the weekend series. Raisel Iglesias pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to earn his 15th save. Jon Jay hit his first home run of the season and Willson Contreras added a two-run shot for Chicago. The Cubs (40-41) were hoping Thursday's ninth-inning rally at Washington would provide a spark heading into this series. Instead, they have dropped the first two games to a Reds team they've beaten in 23 of the past 30 meetings. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at RedsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch We get everybody healthy right now ... I'm very confident that we'll start looking like we're supposed to look,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  Overall, the starting pitching has been erratic, I can't deny that. But if you hit with a little more consistency, you cover some of that.  If Stephens was nervous on Saturday, it wasn't easy to tell. He allowed three hits through the first two innings with four strikeouts.  Of course, there were butterflies,  said Stephens, who had around 30 family members and friends in attendance Saturday.  I was able to keep myself composed. I feel like I belong here. I didn't lay an egg. I just embraced the opportunity.  Stephens' first taste of big-league level adversity came during his second time through the Cubs' lineup. Jay homered with one out. Two batters later, Contreras crushed a 1-1 pitch deep to left-center, making the score 3-0. It was Contreras' 10th home run of the season.  The only time he was vulnerable was when he gave up the home run to Jay,  Price said.  His breaking ball got a lot better after that inning.  Cubs starter Eddie Butler (4-3) allowed four earned runs on five hits in 3 2/3 innings. Duvall's RBI double and a bases-loaded walk by Butler cut the Reds' deficit to 3-2 in the fourth. Price decided to allow Jackson to bat for himself, mostly because he wanted to get another inning to see what he could do at the major league level. The decision paid off handsomely when Jackson laced Butler's first pitch past a diving Addison Russell for his first major league hit, driving in two runs to put Cincinnati ahead 4-3 for his first professional RBIs.  It was just enough to get past Addy,  Stephens said.  I was just happy to get a hit. The hard part was going back out there and trying to put up another zero.  Stephens' knock highlighted a frustrating afternoon for Butler.  I located probably my best fastball of the day to the pitcher and he hits a six-hopper up the middle,  Butler said.  That's frustrating.  The Cubs missed several scoring chances on Saturday. They had inning-ending double plays in the second and sixth innings.  It's our inability to move the ball in RBI situations,  Maddon said.  We have to score more than three runs.  With the Reds needing to add depth to what is now a seven-man bullpen, Price wasn't certain if Stephens could hang around for another start. Regardless, Price said Saturday's experience was worthwhile.  There are a lot of balls in the air on this one,  Price said.  The big thing, he faced the world champs. They had Bryant back in the lineup, Zobrist on the bench. I enjoyed watching him pitch.  NOTES: Cubs Ben Zobrist was reinstated from the disabled list on Saturday.

{"content":"OLYMPIA FIELDS, Illinois (Reuters) - Danielle Kang stayed in contention to make her first professional victory a major after finishing tied for the lead with Chella Choi in the third round of the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship on Saturday. Californian Kang avoided potential disaster at the 12th hole, chipping in for par after fluffing her first shot from the deep rough, en route to an otherwise steady three-under-par 68 on a breezy afternoon at Olympia Fields. South Korean Choi bookended her round with birdies at the par-five first and 18th holes for a 67, joining Kang at 10-under 203 with one round remaining. They lead by two strokes from South Korean Shin Ji-yai, who shot a best-of-the-day 64, while defending champion Brooke Henderson, of Canada, is three behind the leaders. Kang, a two-times U.S. Women’s Amateur champion still seeking her first LPGA victory, moves in celebrity circles and is not shy about name-dropping. She counts among her friends Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlon champion who subsequently underwent a transgender procedure, and ice hockey great Wayne Gretzky. “Wayne texted me this morning. He said ‘just go win it,'” Kang said. “Caitlyn Jenner called me yesterday. I have a couple of people rooting for me. I love it.

If Kang gets her motivation from celebrity friends, Choi’s support network is more family oriented. Her father is back on her bag after a recent 10-week hiatus and Choi, who has one LPGA Tour victory, is relishing it. “I’m very excited to work with my dad and he gives me a lot of confidence,” Choi said. “He just carries bag and says ‘calm down and focus on golf, just one shot (at a time).

Choi was penalised two strokes for an almost identical incident at the 2014 Canadian Pacific Women’s Open after a television viewer notified the LPGA of the infraction, which happened in the second round. Choi said she sympathised with Thompson, but also had learned a lesson.  I felt very bad for Lexi, but that incident helped me realise and learn that I need to play more as a role model,” Choi said.

{"content":"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - In a major shake-up of the Vatican's administration on Saturday, Pope Francis replaced Catholicism's top theologian, a conservative German cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff's vision of a more inclusive Church. A brief Vatican statement said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller's five-year mandate as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a department charged with defending Catholic doctrine, would not be renewed. The position is the most important one that a pope fills in the Vatican hierarchy after the Secretary of State. Most incumbents keep it until they retire, which in Mueller's case would have been in six years.   Mueller, 69, who was appointed by former Pope Benedict in 2012, will be succeeded by the department's number two,  Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer. Ladaria, a 73-year-old Spaniard who, like the Argentine pope is a member of the Jesuit order, is said by those who know him to be a soft-spoken person who shuns the limelight. Mueller, by contrast, often appears in the media.  They speak the same language and Ladaria is someone who is meek. He does not agitate the pope and does not threaten him,  said a priest who works in the Vatican and knows both Mueller and Ladaria, asking not to be named. Since his election in 2013, Francis has given hope to progressives who want him to forge ahead with his vision for a more welcoming Church that concentrates on mercy rather than the strict enforcement of rigid rules they see as antiquated. Mueller is one of several cardinals in the Vatican who have publicly sparred with the pope. Second Conservative Departure in Three Days  FILE PHOTO: Former Pope Benedict embraces newly elected cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller of Germany during a consistory ceremony led by Pope Francis in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican February 22, 2014.Max Rossi/File PhotoHis departure follows the high-profile exit of fellow conservative Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican economy minister who took a leave of absence on Thursday to face charges of historical sexual abuse in his native Australia.   In 2015 both were among 13 cardinals who signed a secret letter to the pope complaining that a meeting of bishops discussing family issues was stacked in favor of liberals. The letter was leaked, embarrassing the signatories.  Clearly, the pope and Cardinal Mueller have not been on the same page for five years,  the priest said. Slideshow (2 Images)Mueller has criticized parts of a 2016 papal treatise called  Amoris Laetitia  (The Joy of Love), a cornerstone document of Francis' attempt to make the 1.2 billion-member Church more inclusive and less condemning. In it, Francis called for a Church that is less strict and more compassionate toward any  imperfect  members, such as those who divorced and remarried, saying  no one can be condemned forever .  Conservatives have concentrated their criticism on the document's opening to Catholics who divorce and remarry in civil ceremonies, without getting Church annulments. Under Church law they cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex with their new partner, because their first marriage is still valid in the eyes of the Church and therefore they are seen to be living in an adulterous state of sin. In the document the pope sided with progressives who had proposed an  internal forum  in which a priest or bishop decide jointly with the individual on a case-by-case basis if he or she can be fully re-integrated and receive communion. After the document was published Catholic bishops in some countries, including Germany, enacted guidelines on how priests could allow some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive the sacraments. But Mueller has said there should be no exceptions, making him a hero to conservatives who have made the issue a rallying point for their opposition to Francis.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Gunfire erupted at a hip-hop concert in a Little Rock, Arkansas nightclub early on Saturday morning, wounding 25 people and leading the governor to call for a fresh effort to reduce violent crime in the state capital. Two of those wounded at the Power Ultra Lounge were in critical condition, Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters at a press conference, while the rest of the victims suffered what he described as non-life-threatening injuries. Three other people were hurt in a frantic rush to the exits. The ages of the wounded ranged from 16 to 35. Buckner said no suspects had been taken into custody in connection with the melee, which may have stemmed from a dispute between rival groups. He said the general public was not believed to be at risk and that the incident was not related to terrorism.  On a Fourth of July weekend, where we wish to anticipate having fun with our friends and family, this is certainly a terrible, terrible tragedy,  Mayor Mark Stodola said at the news conference. The shooting started at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, about 30 minutes after the downtown club's scheduled closing time, local media reported. A bystander's video broadcast by local media showed the crowded club at the moment gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of people screaming in the dark. After the shooting, the city revoked the Power Ultra Lounge's liquor license and the club would shut down, Stodola said.  This activity downtown is going to cease,  he said.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was time for the state to do more to reverse what he described as an intensifying crime problem in the state capital.  We are still gathering facts, but it is clear that we need to have a comprehensive enforcement strategy in place that helps take the violent threats off the streets,  he said in a statement.  The club was hosting a concert by the hip-hop artist Finese 2Tymes on Friday night, according to the club's Facebook page.

A two-times Women’s British Open champion, South Korean Shin moved into the hunt for a third major title in a rare appearance in the United States, ending the day two strokes behind leaders Chella Choi and Danielle Kang at Olympia Fields. Shin quit the U.S. LPGA Tour four years ago and switched to Japan to be closer to home. “I think I’m a little bit lucky because I started early in the morning,” said Shin, who got most of her round under her belt before a testing breeze sprang up, posting an eight-under 205 total with one round left. Shin has won 15 times on the JLPGA Tour, where purses average around $1 million.  “I very much enjoy (it there) because there is less traveling and more three-day tournaments, so physically I feel much better,” said the 29-year-old. “This year I gained more distance -- I think between 15 and 20 yards -- so that makes it a little bit easier.

{"content":"Hamels rides power surge as Rangers jolt White Sox CHICAGO -- Texas Rangers left-hander Cole Hamels smiled when he was asked how he bounced back from a rocky first inning to retire the final 19 batters he faced Saturday afternoon.  I just didn't hang any pitches,  Hamels said. Sometimes, the simplest approach is most effective. Hamels showed flashes of dominance as he pitched into the seventh inning, and the Rangers pulled away for a 10-4 win over the Chicago White Sox. The veteran southpaw did not allow a hit after the first inning, when Melky Cabrera doubled off him and Jose Abreu took him deep for a two-run home run. Elvis Andrus, Mike Napoli and Rougned Odor each hit a home run for the Rangers. Texas (40-41) snapped a three-game losing streak and won at Guaranteed Rate Field for the first time since 2015. Hamels (3-0) said he was not aware he retired his final 19 opponents. He held the White Sox to two runs on two hits in 6 2/3 innings before manager Jeff Banister pulled him after 96 pitches to keep him fresh. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at White SoxTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch My whole game plan is to throw strikes,  Hamels said.  It didn't happen to the first couple guys the way I'd like. It's more just bear down and throw strikes. Be aggressive in the strike zone.  White Sox left-hander Derek Holland (5-8) was not nearly as sharp in his first career matchup against his former teammates. The longtime Rangers southpaw gave up five runs on five hits in five innings. Chicago (35-45) lost for the ninth time in the past 13 games. The White Sox dropped to 3-24 when opponents rack up double-digit hits.  It was intense,  Holland said of facing his friends on Texas.  I mean, obviously you know they want to hit the home runs off me and they want to crush me just like I want to strike them out. I thought everything was there. Just a few things got away. Nothing to beat myself up over.  The White Sox opened the scoring on a two-run shot by Abreu in the first inning. The blast marked Abreu's 15th home run of the season and his second in as many days at Guaranteed Rate Park. Texas trimmed the deficit to 2-1 in the second. The Rangers loaded the bases with nobody out but pushed across only one run on a groundout by Jonathan Lucroy. In the fifth, Texas scored three more runs to seize a 4-2 lead. Lucroy drew a leadoff walk and scored the tying run on a double by Delino DeShields. Andrus followed with a two-run home run that landed just beyond the glove of Cabrera in left field. As Cabrera retreated to the warning track, Andrus did not know whether the ball would clear the fence for his 11th home run.  I hit it good but too high,  Andrus said.  And then when I saw him going back, back, I kind of was blowing that ball, too. I'm really glad it went out.  Napoli belted a two-run homer in the sixth to make it 6-2. The White Sox pulled within 6-4 on a pinch-hit, two-run double by Kevan Smith during the seventh. Smith's hit down the right-field line scored Yolmer Sanchez and Adam Engel. Odor hit a home run down the right-field line to lead off the eighth. After the Rangers loaded the bases later in the inning, Nomar Mazara put the game out of reach with a triple that bounced past Cabrera.  Those are huge,  Banister said.  Those add-on runs give us a little bit of breathing room.  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said Andrus and Napoli earned their homers despite a strong wind blowing out.  Those are both two strong men,  Renteria said.  They were able to get it and use what they needed to generate the loft and the carry. We had the same opportunity, so it plays equally.  NOTES: Rangers manager Jeff Banister revealed Saturday that he would use a closer-by-committee approach until further notice. The skipper's announcement came one day after RHP Matt Bush blew his fifth save opportunity of the season. Bush will be part of the closer committee along with LHP Alex Claudio, RHP Jose Leclerc and RHP Keone Kela. ... White Sox OF Avisail Garcia was held out of the lineup for the third straight game because of a sore knee. He said he hoped to return within the next two days. ... Rangers LHP Martin Perez (broken right thumb) tentatively is slated to start Monday against the Boston Red Sox. The 26-year-old sustained the injury when he caught the tip of his thumb in the door of his hotel room. ... White Sox SS Tim Anderson returned to the lineup after a two-day stint on the bench. He went 0-for-4.","keywords":"Adam Engel,Alex Claudio,Cole Hamels,Delino DeShields,Derek Holland,Elvis Andrus,Jeff Banister,Jonathan Lucroy,Jose Abreu,Jose Leclerc,Kevan Smith,Martin Perez,Matt Bush,Melky Cabrera,Mike Napoli,Rick Renteria,Rougned Odor,Tim Anderson,Yolmer Sanchez,BBO,RANGERS,WHITE_SOX,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-01 19:13:00","news_title":"Hamels rides power surge as Rangers jolt White Sox","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED71FMBLES"}
{"content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Risking a historic drop to junk bond status, Illinois began its third straight fiscal year without a budget on Saturday as political maneuvering dimmed hopes for a bipartisan spending and revenue package anytime soon. While the House scheduled session on Sunday to take up a revenue package, the Senate is not slated to return until Monday. The nation’s fifth-largest state has lacked a full operating budget since July 2015 and is under a warning from S&P; that it will drop Illinois’ creditworthiness to the lowest of any state in history if it fails to pass a fiscal 2018 budget that starts to address a chronic structural deficit. Talks between Democrats who control the Illinois House and Republicans had shown signs of progress as both sides rallied behind a $36.5 billion spending blueprint on Friday and were poised to build on that positive movement in a rare Fourth of July holiday weekend legislative session. Instead, tensions broke out on the House floor between House Republican Leader Jim Durkin and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, who initially informed the legislative chamber that no budget votes would be taken on Sunday. “Saying we’ll gavel out and return at some point [Sunday] to me does not send a message to Illinoisans that we’re prepared to bring this to resolution any time soon,” said Durkin, the Republican Party’s legislative proxy for Governor Bruce Rauner, who has stayed on the sidelines of recent budget negotiations. Madigan walked off the floor a short time later to the shout of “Speaker Junk” from State Representative Grant Wehrli, a suburban Chicago Republican. By late afternoon, Madigan reversed course and said there indeed would be a vote on a tax-increase package Sunday, neglecting any mention of accompanying votes on a local property tax freeze or workers compensation reforms that are two of Rauner's key demands under negotiation. In a statement, Madigan said he was “encouraged by the progress” in talks with Durkin and vowed to vote Sunday on a revenue package “modeled on the bill supported by the governor and House and Senate Republicans.” Durkin made clear in his own statement that “there is no agreement on a comprehensive budget package that includes reforms and revenue,” contradicting Madigan and painting a dim outlook for bipartisan consensus on Sunday. “This impasse can only be resolved in a negotiated manner,” Durkin said. “It is our hope that Democrats will remain at the negotiating table.”  Additional reporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Marguerita Choy","keywords":"Bruce Rauner,Grant Wehrli,Jim Durkin,Junk,Michael Madigan,US,ILLINOIS,BUDGET,Crime / Law / Justice,Lawmaking,Government Finances,Municipal Debt,General Obligation Debt,Taxation,Government / Politics,Corporate Events,Economic Events,Illinois,Municipal Bond Market,Illinois,Revenue Bonds,Debt / Fixed Income Markets,United States","news_time":"2017-07-01 19:13:00","news_title":"As new fiscal year dawns, hope for Illinois budget dims","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19M3UJ"}

{"content":"TORONTO (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks.  Since at least May, hackers used tainted  phishing  emails to  harvest credentials  so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.  A virus dubbed  NotPetya  attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories.  On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E; News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators. Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E; News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.  Department of Homeland Security emblem is pictured at the National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) located just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia September 24, 2010.Hyungwon Kang/File PhotoThe activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.  Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.  U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG (PEG.N), SCANA Corp (SCG.N) and Entergy Corp (ETR.N) said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said. A projection of cyber code on a hooded man is pictured in this illustration picture taken on May 13,  2017.Kacper Pempel/IllustrationAnother nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy (D.N), said it does not comment on cyber security.  Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe.  Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create  decoy documents  on topics of interest to their targets. In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

Slideshow (20 Images)A convoy of more than 50 floats snaked through central Madrid amid a carnival atmosphere as part of celebrations marking the WorldPride parade, a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights that has been held in several cities across the world since its inception in 2000.

{"content":"(Reuters) - No U.S. nuclear power plant has been penetrated in a cyber attack, an industry spokesman said on Saturday, when asked to comment on a U.S. government warning last week about a hacking campaign targeting the sector.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a report dated Wednesday that nuclear sector was among those targeted in a hacking campaign data back to at least May.  Hackers used  phishing  emails to obtain credentials to gain access to networks of their targets, according to a report from the two agencies, which Reuters reported on Friday.  “None of America’s 99 operating nuclear plants have been penetrated by a cyber attack,  said John Keeley, a spokesman for industry trade group Nuclear Energy Institute.  If a plant's operations had been breached, that would require mandatory notification to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would notify the public, he said.  Those requirements do not cover cyber intrusions on business networks of firms that operate nuclear power plants, said Keeley. He said had no information as to whether such attacks had occurred. Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Victor Dricks declined to comment on the joint report, saying the agency does not comment on security-related issues. The report from the FBI and Homeland Security, which was  reviewed by Reuters on Friday, did not identify any victims or describe the impact hackers had on targeted networks.  It did say that cyber attackers have historically  targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict.   Homeland Security and FBI officials did not respond to requests for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. Reporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto.

{"content":"ADEN (Reuters) - The death toll from a major cholera outbreak in Yemen has risen to 1,500, Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organization's (WHO) representative in Yemen, said on Saturday, and appealed for more help to put an end to the epidemic. Yemen has been devastated by a 27-month war between a Saudi-led coalition and the armed Iran-aligned Houthi group, making it a breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Gunfire erupted at a hip-hop concert in a Little Rock, Arkansas nightclub early on Saturday morning, wounding 25 people and leading the governor to call for a fresh effort to reduce violent crime in the state capital. Two of those wounded at the Power Ultra Lounge were in critical condition, Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters at a press conference, while the rest of the victims suffered what he described as non-life-threatening injuries. Three other people were hurt in a frantic rush to the exits. The ages of the wounded ranged from 16 to 35. Buckner said no suspects had been taken into custody in connection with the melee, which may have stemmed from a dispute between rival groups. He said the general public was not believed to be at risk and that the incident was not related to terrorism.  On a Fourth of July weekend, where we wish to anticipate having fun with our friends and family, this is certainly a terrible, terrible tragedy,  Mayor Mark Stodola said at the news conference. The shooting started at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, about 30 minutes after the downtown club's scheduled closing time, local media reported. A bystander's video broadcast by local media showed the crowded club at the moment gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of people screaming in the dark. After the shooting, the city revoked the Power Ultra Lounge's liquor license and the club would shut down, Stodola said.  This activity downtown is going to cease,  he said.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was time for the state to do more to reverse what he described as an intensifying crime problem in the state capital.  We are still gathering facts, but it is clear that we need to have a comprehensive enforcement strategy in place that helps take the violent threats off the streets,  he said in a statement.  The club was hosting a concert by the hip-hop artist Finese 2Tymes on Friday night, according to the club's Facebook page.  A promotional page for the performance shows a young man looking down the sight of what appears to be a gun, with the barrel pointed at the viewer.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Honda's triple MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez lived up to his reputation of 'King of the Sachsenring' with an eighth successive German Grand Prix pole position on Saturday. The Spaniard set a fastest lap of one minute 27.302 seconds on a drying track after afternoon rain to beat Italian Danilo Petrucci, on a non-works Octo Pramac Ducati, into second place with Honda team mate Dani Pedrosa third. Ducati's championship leader Andrea Dovizioso qualified only 10th with closest rival Maverick Vinales, on a Yamaha, set to start 11th. Vinales clashed with Marquez during the session, with their bikes making contact.

The 24-year-old Spaniard also won all seven of those races to date at the Sachsenring and will be the big favorite on Sunday.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nineteen people were killed in Mexico's northwestern state of Sinaloa late on Friday in a run of related shootouts between police and gunmen, state authorities said. Armed men in pickup trucks opened fire on a group of police officers on a major highway near the beach resort of Mazatlan, according to the state police and state attorney general's office.  State Public Security Minister Genaro Robles Casillas said in a news conference on Saturday that drug gangs have been fighting over trafficking routes in the area where the violence occurred.  Aided by federal forces, the police fought off the attackers and pursued them to the nearby town of La Amapa, where the gunfight resumed, according to a press release from the state police. Seventeen gunmen were killed in the shootouts with police, and another two people died nearby in what appears to be earlier, related shootings, the attorney general's office said in another press release. No police died. However, five suffered gunshots and are in stable condition, with two of those officers suffering head wounds, according to state police.  Found at the scene were 16 semiautomatic rifles, nine handguns and a shotgun, the attorney general's office said. The coastal state of Sinaloa is a focal point in Mexico's drug war. It is home to the Sinaloa cartel, whose most well known boss, Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman, was extradited to the United States in January to face trial.  Police killed 17 people for every officer lost in gunbattles in 2014, according to a study by Mexico's National Autonomous University, a number experts say is consistent with excessive use of force. In 2015, Mexican police executed nearly two dozen suspected gang members after ambushing them at a ranch near the town of Tanhuato in the violent western state of Michoacan, one of the worst abuses by security forces in a decade of grisly drug violence. Some 30,000 people have disappeared in Mexico since drug violence increased sharply around 2007. Since former president Felipe Calderon sent the army out to battle drug gangs at the end of 2006 more than 150,000 have been killed.

{"content":"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Reigning champion Chris Froome wasted no time flexing his muscles at the Tour de France as he powered to sixth place in a treacherous opening time trial won superbly by Team Sky colleague Geraint Thomas on Saturday. Heavy rain turned what, on paper, had looked like a regulation 14-km circuit alongside the Rhine river into an incident-packed Grand Depart that could have major consequences in the three-week battle for the yellow jersey. While it was a great start for Team Sky, with Thomas, three-times champion Froome, Vasil Kiryienka and Michal Kwiatkowski  all in the top eight of the 198 riders to start, Movistar's Alejandro Valverde's Tour is already over after a sickening crash. Several riders continued after crashing on the greasy roads but there was no getting up for Valverde, third overall in 2015, after he careered into crowd barriers after skidding off before being taken to hospital with leg injuries. It was heart-breaking for Valverde and also a huge blow for team mate Nairo Quintana who would have been counting on Valverde's experience in the mountain stages to come to have a real chance of halting Froome's bid for a hat-trick. Welshman Thomas, riding his eighth Tour de France, looked completely at home in the puddles as he became the eighth Briton to wear the yellow jersey -- making up for the disappointment of crashing out of the Giro d'Italia as team leader. He displayed brilliant bike-handling to cross the finish line alongside the sprawling Messe Duesseldorf exhibition complex in 16 minutes 04 seconds.

At first we thought it was just a crash, like happens often, but when we saw that he could not get up, we knew it was serious,  said sports director Jose Vicente Garcia.  It is a sad day for us.  Valverde and Quintana were seen as a formidable double act on this Tour, but the Colombian, second overall in 2013 and 2015, will now have to make do without the help of the Spanish veteran.  It's really difficult for all of us - he's a very important person and a great team mate. I just hope it's nothing really serious. It's awful to see his race ending that way, so early,  said Quintana.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Syrian rebel group accused the Syrian army of using chlorine gas against its fighters on Saturday in battles east of Damascus - an accusation the military swiftly denied as a fabrication. The Failaq al-Rahman group said more than 30 people suffered suffocation as a result of the attack in Ain Tarma in the Eastern Ghouta region, which government forces have been battling to take back from insurgents. In a statement circulated by state-run media, a military source said the army command completely denied the accusation.  It has not used any chemical weapons in the past, and will not use them at any time . The United States said on Wednesday the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad appeared so far to have heeded a warning issued earlier in the week not to carry out a chemical weapons attack after saying it saw possible preparations for one. Western governments including the United States say the Syrian government was behind an April gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens. In response, the United States fired cruise missiles at the air base from which it said the attack was launched. The Syrian government has denied any role in that attack. On Saturday the government also dismissed a report by the international chemical weapons watchdog that said the banned nerve agent sarin was used in the April attack in Khan Sheikhoun, saying it lacked  any credibility . A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.

{"content":"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - So often Team Sky's unsung hero Geraint Thomas grabbed the limelight with a masterclass of bike-handling in a rain-drenched Tour de France opening stage in Duesseldorf on Saturday. The 31-year-old Welshman, reveling in weather conditions more akin to a rainy day back home, claimed his first ever Tour de France stage win by five seconds from Swiss rider Stefan Kueng to have first use of the yellow jersey. Thomas was the 154th of the 198 starters so had an anxious wait as the following riders, including the likes of favorite Tony Martin, tried to beat his time over the 14-km time trial. Kueng got closest but no other rider could match Thomas's poise on the greasy road surfaces.  It rains a lot in Wales,  Thomas, one of three-times Tour champion Chris Froome's most loyal support riders, told reporters.  It was a case of taking it steady in the corners and then getting the power on.  It's the stuff of dreams (to be wearing yellow). I remember running home from school as a 10-year-old to watch the Tour and now I'm on the other side of the camera.  I'm going to enjoy tomorrow and any extra day I have in the yellow jersey will now be a bonus.  With Tour favorite Froome finishing 12 second back -- significantly ahead of all of his General Classification rivals -- it was a perfect day for Team Sky who have seized early control. Thomas was given the responsibility of being team leader at this year's Giro d'Italia and had high hopes of winning his first Grand Tour before a crash caused by a police motorbike forced him out with a shoulder injury. Cycling - The 104th Tour de France cycling race - The 14-km (8.7 miles) individual time-trial Stage 1 - Duesseldorf, Germany - July 1, 2017 -  Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas of Britain rides during the stage.Christian HartmannHis hopes a medal in the Olympic road race last year were also wrecked by a crash and he has taken his fair share of punishment while riding for Sky. So he will enjoy his hard-earned top-dog status for as long as it lasts in his eighth Tour de France before resuming duties as Froome's trusty deputy on the roads of France.  It's been a rough time on the bike this year and it's nice to finally have this win,  he said.  It certainly makes up for most of the Giro.  With three Team Sky riders in the top six it was a day of dominance for the British team under a cloud because of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of wrongdoing -- a situation brought on by a mystery package delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Team Sky have denied any wrongdoing.   Even on Saturday, Thomas's moment was slightly overshadowed by a reporter questioning the legality of the team's skin suits.  I just wear the suit and pedal as fast as I can,  a slightly nonplussed Thomas said. He was happier to talk about a great day for Welsh sport, having watched Sam Warburton, who went to the same Cardiff school, lead the British and Irish Lions to victory over rugby giants the New Zealand All Blacks.  I was just thinking of the Lions last night when I went to bed, now I have my own little lion as well,  he said.  It was an inspiration for me. It was great to watch that, I'm buzzing off of that. Helped take my mind off this.

{"content":"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The investment arm of Brazil's state development bank BNDES has given JBS SA until July 10 to convene a shareholder meeting to remove the controlling Batista family from the meatpacker's management and board, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Saturday. Earlier this week BNDES Chief Executive Officer Paulo Rabello de Castro said BNDES Participações SA [BNDESP.UL] wants JBS board members to explain how they will address dwindling access to credit and assess losses caused by executives and their involvement in a corruption scandal. BNDESPar has a stake of about 21 percent in JBS. The two sources could not speak for attribution because they were not authorized to talk to the media about the ongoing negotiations.  The deadline for the meeting had been Friday - but was extended so JBS could put together more detailed financial information to present to minority shareholders.  Currently, family patriarch José Batista Sobrinho has a board seat on JBS, like his son - Chief Executive Officer Wesley Mendonça Batista. Reuters first reported BNDESPar's plans on June 22. Minority shareholders aligned with BNDESPar want the Batistas to compensate them for a recent plunge in shares of JBS, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on June 22. According to the sources, the company's image and reputation have been deeply hurt by the admission of crimes by Wesley and his brother Joesley. Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot reached a plea deal with the brothers, whose family owns 42 percent of JBS, to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme.

Shares of São Paulo-based JBS have fallen more than 35 percent since mid-May.  For over a decade, both brothers helped transform JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's midwestern high plains into the world's largest meatpacker. JBS has operations in five continents and a global payroll of over 200,000. Part of that expansion was financed with loans and capital injections from BNDES.

{"content":"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Team Sky enjoyed a huge confidence boost from their impressive collective performance in Saturday's opening Tour de France time trial, but they would be well advised to surrender the yellow jersey and the pressure that comes with it, three-time champion Greg LeMond told Reuters. Geraint Thomas snatched the overall lead after a skilful ride on the wet streets of Duesseldorf as Sky finished with four riders in the top eight, with defending champion Chris Froome gaining time on all his rivals.  For the riders it must be disappointing to see how strong Sky are,  American LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, told Reuters.  Colombian Nairo Quintana, runner-up to Froome in 2013 and 2015, limited his losses to 36 seconds, but lost key Movistar team mate Alejandro Valverde, who abandoned after crashing into a safety barrier.  Now if you're Quintana you have no Valverde and you have to attack. I haven't seen in the last couple of years anybody strong enough to drop Chris Froome,  added LeMond. Almost all the top climbers behind Froome finished within seven seconds of each other -- from Australian Richie Porte, who lost 35 seconds, to Alberto Contador who lost 42.  There could have been bigger differences but the weather limited the losses for the climbers,  noted LeMond.  Every Tour de France is different but Sky got a big confidence booster today. It could be a race for second. But I think it's good that they have the pressure.   There is one way to release the pressure, however -- let another team assume the duties of controlling the race by not fighting to keep the yellow jersey.  I was impressed by (sprint specialist) Marcel Kittel. I think he is going for the yellow jersey and if Sky are smart they are not going to control it -- let the sprinters take over. That is what I would do,  said LeMond. Kittel ended up 16 seconds behind Thomas on Saturday, and with 10 seconds of time bonus for Sunday's stage winner, the ride to Liege could see the German claim the lead if Thomas lets the sprinters' teams ride away in the final straight.  Some of those flat stages you're not going to want to follow those crazy sprinters,  added LeMond.  I think Marcel is going to try to focus on the yellow jersey.

The Czech, who reckoned it was  great to be back  just six months since her career was left hanging in the balance after an attacker stabbed her playing hand, explained on Saturday how life had been put into perspective for her by the trauma.  I think I am little bit different on the court and off the court, too,  said the 27-year-old, who hopes that the three-year gap between her titles in 2011 and 2014 could prove a happy omen in  2017.  I think I see life and tennis from a little bit different angle than before. Before, I was very nervous before every match. Now I see that I shouldn't be. There's things in the life that should be more important than just tennis.  I'm not sure if it is the result of what happened, but maybe I feel a bit fearless because of what happened.   I find out what's important and what is not. Sometimes I'm thinking on the court that I already won the biggest fight, and if I fight in the match, it doesn't matter if I win or lose the last point. I will still be happy to play.  This attitude of being somehow freed to play uninhibited tennis has already served the left-hander well as evidenced by victory in the warm-up Edgbaston grasscourt tournament in just the second event of her comeback.  I felt very surprised. I'm still surprised,  she said.  I think the grass is always giving me extra confidence. Through the tournament, I felt like every round I played better and better, which is always good sign.  It's tough to say the level of my game. As I said, in Birmingham, it was going up. I will see how I wake up on Monday. Wimbledon feels like my second home. It feels great to be here again.  I think we still do have a great players in the draw, even if (defending champion) Serena (Williams) is not playing. I think there's a few favourites but it's very open. So who knows who going to win?  If Kvitova prevails, it would be a fairytale comeback, and she is adamant she has never lost the  passion  for the task at hand.   I found out how I missed tennis through the period I didn't play. It was a difficult time to watch girls playing on the TV, me sitting on the sofa with the hand in a splint. I find out then how I love this sport. I still do have the passion.

{"content":"SPEYER, Germany (Reuters) - Leaders from the United States, Russia and across Europe paid tribute on Saturday to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl as the architect of German reunification and a driving force for European integration. Kohl, who died on June 16 at 87, was lauded at a ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other figures. A funeral service was held later on Saturday with 900 invited guests at Speyer Cathedral, where as a teenager Kohl found shelter from World War Two aerial bombings.  His casket was flown by helicopter from Strasbourg to his hometown Ludwigshafen before being carried by boat up the Rhine to Speyer, one of Germany's oldest towns where Kohl took former world leaders including Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Mikail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Margaret Thatcher for private meetings.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said in Strasbourg of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial in Strasbourg, a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France, symbolized the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward. A blue European Union flag was draped over Kohl's casket in Strasbourg. A German flag later covered the coffin in Germany, where thousands watched from the streets as his coffin moved through Ludwigshafen and later from the banks of the Rhine.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skillfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.  The coffins is blessed with holy water during the pontifical requiem mass for late former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the cathedral in Speyer, Germany, July 1, 2017.Arne Dedert/POOL'European Patriot' The resting place of many rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, itself a Europe-spanning polity, Speyer Cathedral was seen by Kohl as a symbol of European unity.  Helmut Kohl was a German patriot and a European patriot,  said Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister and close friend of Kohl who switched between German and French in his tribute.  We've lost a giant of the post-war era.  Slideshow (25 Images)Chancellor Angela Merkel, who served as a minister under Kohl in the 1990s but later had a falling out over his role in receiving $1 million in illegal campaign cash donations, remembered Kohl as an at-times controversial figure with numerous enemies.  I could tell you stories as well,  she said.  But all that paled in comparison to his life's achievements.  Merkel said Kohl had changed the lives of millions across all of Europe. The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union.  The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him. His sons, however, boycotted the Cathedral's funeral mass, because their father will not be laid to rest alongside Hannelore Kohl, his wife of decades.

{"content":"(Adds comments from Christie, details on shutdown) By Elinor Comlay ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., July 1 (Reuters) - A partial shutdown of New Jersey government services snarled   traffic near the state's Atlantic shore resorts on Saturday, the first day of the July 4 holiday weekend, as troopers turned back beachgoers from a shuttered beach and other state parks. The shutdown went into effect just after midnight on Saturday after legislators failed to pass a budget, stymied by a dispute over a plan to take money from the state’s biggest health insurance company. Lawmakers were in the state capital, Trenton, on Saturday to work on resolving the standoff over the measure, pushed by Governor Chris Christie as way to help fund drug addiction services. Despite the shutdown, state police, prisons, child welfare services, NJ Transit buses and trains, and other health and safety operations were still functioning, but other services such as motor vehicle inspections ground to a halt. Christie, a Republican who has the lowest approval rating of any governor in New Jersey history, said he returned to his office at 9:30 a.m. ready to work. His family was at the governor’s residence at the state beach that had been closed to the public as a result of the shutdown. At issue is a push by the governor to force the nonprofit insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to spend some of its billions in reserves on public health services or return money to subscribers. Christie said he would remove about $150 million in school funding and other items previously agreed with Democrats unless the Assembly passed the Horizon bill. But Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto and other Democrats say the Horizon bill, introduced only on Thursday, is “bad public policy.” Prieto blamed the governor for “holding the state budget hostage.” Some Democrats in the Senate and Assembly have sided with Christie. An Assembly vote on the budget stalled late on Friday, as some Democrats abstained from voting, fearing Christie’s veto of important items without an agreement on the Horizon bill. The governor, at a news conference on Saturday morning, repeatedly blamed Prieto for the impasse. “If the Horizon bill comes in, I will sign the budget,” he said, adding that he was open to counteroffers. Christie said the plan to restructure Horizon was only recently presented because it had not occurred to him earlier. It has been vetted by legal advisors, he said, adding, “It’s about transparency and accountability ... and the potential for a fiscal play down the line.” All 80 of the Assembly's seats are up for re-election in November, when New Jersey will also vote on a new governor to replace Christie, whose second and final term as governor is ending.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Roger Federer warned on Saturday that he and the rest of the big four of men's tennis were going to be as tough to beat as ever at Wimbledon this year as they seek to continue their astonishing monopoly of the event. In the last 14 editions, one of either Federer, the seven-times champion, double winners Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, or triple victor Novak Djokovic has lifted the men's singles title at The All England Club. While reporters quizzed Federer on Saturday about who in the game's young brigade could become the first man outside that quartet to win since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002, the Swiss felt it would be best to keep faith with the usual suspects. Federer's rivals have had mixed preparations for Wimbledon. Murray's harboured hip trouble after an early exit at Queen's, Nadal decided to skip grasscourt warm-ups to rest his body after winning the French Open while Djokovic burst into life earlier on Saturday by winning the Eastbourne title. Do not be fooled, suggested Federer. All these 30-something luminaries would again be  tough to beat .  Depending how fit it is, if he's anything close to 100 percent physically, I consider him (Murray) one of the big favourites to win the tournament. It's that simple. It's the same for Novak and the same for Rafa,  reckoned Federer.  I think it's very even when we put it all out on the line. Everybody has their own little story right now.  Queen's for Andy (where he was knocked out early) doesn't matter so much because I feel like he's one of the best players in the first week at Wimbledon, so I don't worry too much for him there. He can play himself into shape for week two.  Novak is just coming back from winning Eastbourne now. Rafa is coming in red hot from the clay. So I see it positive for them rather than negative in some shape, which I'm sure people will try to see that way.  But I see that they are going to be tough to beat here.  Federer himself seemed to have recaptured a touch of his fantastic early-season spark which saw him down Nadal in an epic Australian Open five-set final as he lifted his favourite pre-Wimbledon grasscourt title in Halle. Yet the 35-year-old is too old a hand to insist that this is going to be a four-horse race.   Yeah, it's been very dominant by a few players here at Wimbledon. That's surprising. It's like that -- but it can change tomorrow very quickly.  It is not just the younger guns, headed, he says, by Milos Raonic, Kei Nishikori, Grigor Dimitrov, Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Dominic Thiem who  are in a good spot right now where they can go very deep .  Then, I do believe the favourites are the other players. I include the likes of (Marin) Cilic into that, Stan (Wawrinka), guys who have done it before,  added the Swiss. Nobody, of course, has done it before as often as the 18-time grand slam champion Federer himself, who admitted it  hurt  to miss out on competing on the sapping clay of the French Open when he knew he was fit and raring to go.  No compromise really. I gave myself the best chance for the grass, so I would never look back and have regrets once I came here,  he said.   Even though I was happy on the clay for a couple days, I just felt like, you know what, anything other than winning there feels like I'm not giving myself the best chance for Wimbledon.

{"content":"(Reuters) - A budget impasse between Maine Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers triggered a shutdown of nonessential state services on Saturday, after the conservative Republican threatened to veto a bipartisan compromise reached by lawmakers. LePage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes.  This is about the future of Maine. The Maine people are taxed enough. I will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased,  LePage said in a statement announcing the partial shutdown, the first in the state since 1991. The governor's order for a partial closure of state government went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local time after negotiations stalled over a $7.055 billion, two-year budget. A six-member bipartisan budget committee with lawmakers from the House and Senate had reached a deal on a proposed budget late on Thursday night, but LePage signaled he would veto the package because it included some tax increases. The Republican-controlled Senate passed the package by a 34-1 vote on Friday, and later in the day the Democratic-controlled House approved it by an 87-60 vote. But the margin of approval fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed to override LePage's threatened veto. Even if two-thirds of the House voted for approval, state law gives the two-term governor up to 10 days to respond to the legislation, allowing for a partial shutdown during that time.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will continue to operate during the current shutdown, LePage has said. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Lawmakers met in the state capital Augusta on Saturday, but they had no formal counterproposal from the governor to consider, said Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon.  Right now we are in a very fluid situation where we don’t have anything in front of us,  Casale said by telephone. The stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. But it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, Casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government on Saturday dismissed a report by the international chemical weapons watchdog that said the banned nerve agent sarin was used in an April attack in northern Syria, saying it lacked  any credibility . Western governments including the United States have said the Syrian government carried out the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun which killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. The report into the attack was circulated to members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but was not made public. In a statement, the Syrian foreign ministry said the fact-finding team had based its report on  the testimonies offered by terrorists in Turkey . Turkey is a major backer of the Syrian opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, the fact-finding mission of the OPCW concluded that  a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance .  Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, has described the report as biased. The attack on April 4 in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the Assad government. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict. A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-U.S. agreement, averting military intervention under then U.S. President Barack Obama. The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack.  Russia warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack.

{"content":"RENNES, France (Reuters) - France inaugurated two new high-speed rail lines on Saturday linking the capital to the western cities of Bordeaux and Rennes in what is likely to be the last launches of their kind for years as public cash becomes increasingly scarce. The state-owned SNCF railway operator expects 35,000 passengers to use the new route to Bordeaux daily and 30,000 to use the line to Rennes. Nearly eight billion euros ($9.1 billion) were invested in the stretch to Bordeaux while 3.4 billion euros went into the Rennes line, both under public-private partnerships, SNCF said. While local politicians often fight hard to bring high-speed lines to their regions to boost jobs and activity, such projects have fallen out of favor with the central government due to the costs. A 60-kilometre (37-mile) high-speed stretch is due to open at the end of the year in the south of France, but after that nothing major is in the works, with the government preferring to support instead high-use commuter lines. With nearly 45 billion euros in debt, the SNCF capacity to finance major new projects is also now severely constrained by a rule taking effect this year limiting how much new debt it can take on as a function of its operating margin. Budgetary pressure is also adding up for France's new government, which is due to announce a wave of spending cuts in the coming days after an audit found this week that the 2017 finances were overshooting targets. The line to Bordeaux, which links up with existing high-speed rail lines in the central city of Tours, was financed under a unique public-private partnership that will see a consortium led by construction group Vinci operate it under concession for 50 years. However, the price of usage has left the SNCF concerned and its president Guillaume Pepy told Le Monde newspaper it would lose 90 million euros on the line this year. Despite the huge costs of high-speed lines, a study from the INSEE statistics agency found this year that they do bring significant economic activity, boosting companies' profitability and productivity.

{"content":"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thirty years ago, Ireland's Stephen Roche won a Tour de France that started from Germany, and this year's edition, which kicks off in Duesseldorf, offers his nephew Dan Martin a unique opportunity to bring the yellow jersey back in the family.  It's funny that it also started in Germany 30 years ago. It was a very similar route, unpredictable,  Martin, whose cousin Nicolas Roche is also in the race, told Reuters.  There are a few good omens in my pocket there.  The 30-year-old Martin, ninth overall last year, knows that family ties will be of no help when he tackles the unusually steep climbs of this year's route.  It will be a worthy winner and I just hope that I get through the first stages without bad luck and let the legs do the talking,  the Quick-Step Floors rider said. While three-time champion Chris Froome can rely Team Sky's climbing specialists in the mountains, Martin will have to ride on his own as his team has been built around German sprinter Marcel Kittel, who hopes to add to his nine Tour stage wins. That will not be a problem for Martin, who even believes the team set-up is an advantage as he will be sheltered on the flat stages, where the lightweight climbers are more exposed.  At the end of the day, if every team had five climbers there'd be 100 riders at the top of the climbs and that's not what the Tour is about,  he explained.  Even the teams who have so called climbers there, you saw the Dauphine (a warm-up race to the Tour last month)... on the last stage we were only 10 riders at the top of the climb after 25 km. If the racing here is as aggressive as on the Dauphine then there will be no team mates.  Luckily for Martin, the way the route has been designed, with only three summit finishes, makes for unpredictable, aggressive racing.  The course suits me well -- the steeper climbs are better. You don't need a team as much for sure and it is definitely a good route for exciting racing, I hope so anyway,  he said.  There will be opportunities to gain or lose time every couple of days in this race, it's important be in good condition from the start.  The peloton is usually extremely nervous in the opening block of racing and crashes are legion. With Quick-Step Floors, arguably the most experienced teams on the flat where wind gusts can cause splits in the peloton, Martin is well protected.  Its definitely one of the strongest teams in the race on the flat stages and that's my weak point,  he said.  I've always been able to handle myself in the mountains but my worry has always been those first stages.  The Tour starts on Saturday with a 14-km time trial in Duesseldorf, where Martin will be out to limit his losses.

I think it's a good message for all of our guys in our system, that we don't pick up a stat sheet and say this is who you are. We look at certain sections at the season. He's been competing a lot better in the zone with his stuff, and we like his mix of pitches.  Stephens has four pitches he can command in the zone.

RHP Zack Wheeler is expected to be activated from the 10-day disabled list Saturday afternoon, when he is scheduled to take the mound for the Mets in the middle game of a three-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citi Field. Wheeler, who was placed on the disabled list June 21 (retroactive to June 20), will have missed the minimum amount of time due to biceps tendinitis. In the final two starts he made before being shelved, Wheeler went 0-2 while giving up 15 runs over just 3 2/3 innings, a stretch in which his overall ERA soared from a season-low 3.45 to 5.29. He took the loss on June 19 after surrendering seven runs over two innings as the Mets fell to the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-6.

RHP Jacob deGrom continued a dominant stretch Friday when he earned the win after allowing one run on three hits and one walk while striking out 12 over seven innings as the Mets edged the Phillies 2-1. It was the fourth win in as many starts for deGrom, who opened Friday with 4 2/3 no-hit innings before Phillies C Andrew Knapp was credited with a triple after CF Curtis Granderson lost his routine fly ball in the dusk. DeGrom has allowed just three runs in 32 innings over his last four starts, a stretch in which he's gone at least seven innings while allowing one run or fewer each time and lowering his overall ERA from 4.75 to 3.55. Overall this season, deGrom has pitched at least seven innings while allowing one run or fewer six times, tied for second-most in the majors behind Los Angeles Dodgers LHP Clayton Kershaw (eight).

However, general manager Sandy Alderson indicated prior to Friday's game that even if Conforto's tests showed no serious damage, the team could still place him on the disabled list Saturday when RHP Zack Wheeler is scheduled to be activated. A disabled list stint could be backdated to Wednesday, which would allow Conforto to return before the All-Star break.

Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said Friday that Wright, who hasn't appeared in a big league game since May 27, 2016, is currently undergoing physical therapy in California and is still 3-5 weeks away from resuming baseball activities. Alderson hinted any delay in that timetable would make it difficult for Wright to return in 2017.

Hellickson didn't factor into the decision in his most recent start on Sunday, when he gave up one run on three hits and no walks while striking out a season-high seven over six innings as the Phillies fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks 2-1 in 11 innings. He has given up just two runs over 13 innings in his last two starts, a stretch in which Hellickson has lowered his overall ERA from 4.91 to 4.40. Since his last win on May 19, Hellickson is 0-4 with a 5.58 ERA. The Phillies have won just one of those starts. Hellickson is 2-4 with an 8.21 ERA in seven career starts against the Mets. The ERA is the highest Hellickson has produced against any team he's opposed more than twice. RHP Pat Neshek continued to make his case for a spot on the National League All-Star team Friday, when he tossed a scoreless eighth inning in the Phillies' 2-1 loss to the Mets. Neshek allowed one hit and struck out one as he lowered his ERA to 0.57, the lowest among major league relievers. He has thrown 18 straight scoreless innings, which is the second-longest active streak in baseball. Boston Red Sox RHP Joe Kelly has tossed 19 1/3 consecutive scoreless frames.

{"content":"3B Johan Camargo extended his hitting streak to a season-high six games with a double in the third inning of a 3-1 victory over Oakland on Friday night. Camargo went 1-for-3 and scored the Braves' first run. He's batting .295 for the season with six doubles and 12 RBIs in 32 games. 1B Matt Adams was out of the lineup Friday night against Oakland with a left foot contusion and remained day to day. Adams left Thursday's game against San Diego after fouling a ball off his left foot in the second inning. He was still limping before Friday's game.  He wasn't moving around too good,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  We'll just kind of re-evaluate, treat him day to day, see if we can get him back in there tomorrow. I don't know.  RHP Jim Johnson pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 17th save of the season Friday night in a 3-1 victory over the Oakland A's, one of his former teams. Johnson gave up a double to 2B Jed Lowrie and then struck out the next three batters to end the game. He's 5-1 with a 3.63 ERA. He went 4-2 with a 7.14 ERA in 38 relief performances for the A's in 2014. C Tyler Flowers (left forearm contusion) returned to the starting lineup Friday against Oakland after missing one game and went 0-for-4 in a 3-1 victory. He left Wednesday's game against San Diego in the sixth inning after being hit by a pitch. According to Braves manager Brian Snitker, Flowers will probably start Saturday afternoon's game against the A's and catch RHP R.A. Dickey. On Friday night, he was behind the plate when RHP Mike Foltynewicz came within three outs of a no-hitter.","keywords":"Brian Snitker,Jed Lowrie,Jim Johnson,Johan Camargo,Matt Adams,Mike Foltynewicz,R.A.

{"content":"RHP Austin Bibens-Dirkx pitched 5 2/3 innings and was in line for his fourth straight win -- in his fifth major league start -- before Matt Bush blew the lead. Had the Rangers held on, the 32-year-old Bibens-Dirkx would have matched Yu Darvish as the last Texas pitcher start his career at 4-0. Darvish did it in 2012. RHP Alex Eubanks signed with the Rangers on Friday. The 21-year-old was drafted in the 14th round in June. 2B Rougned Odor hit a two-run homer off White Sox starter Mike Pelfrey in a four-run fourth inning Friday night that put Texas ahead 5-2. It was Odor's 13th homer of the season and first since June 17, ending a 12-game drought. 1B Joey Gallo hit his team-leading 21st homer and went 1-for-3 with a walk, but his batting average remained at .194. Gallo has struck out an MLB-leading 107 times, but didn't fan in this one. RHP and closer Matt Bush gave up three runs in the ninth inning on Friday night for his fifth blown save in 15 chances as the White Sox rallied for an 8-7 win. Bush entered with a 7-5 lead but said he struggled to put away hitters with high fastballs as Adam Engel, Willy Garcia and Alen Hanson singled before Melky Cabrera's walk-off double with one out.","keywords":"Adam Engel,Alen Hanson,Alex Eubanks,Austin Bibens,Dirkx,Joey Gallo,Matt Bush,Melky Cabrera,Mike Pelfrey,Willy Garcia,Yu Darvish,BBO,RANGERS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-01 13:01:00","news_title":"Texas Rangers - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED71F8LP6V"}
{"content":"RHP Parker Bridwell gave up five runs on 11 hits and one walk in six innings, getting the loss Friday against the Mariners. Bridwell was hurt by one bad inning --  the fifth when the Mariners scored four times, three coming on a home run by Robinson Cano. The Angels went into the game 4-0 in games Bridwell had pitched in this season. Bridwell's season ERA went up from 2.95 to 3.95.  Early on, Parker got some pitches in good zones and got out of a little bit of trouble and managed to keep us in the game,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  But he couldn't get the ball into good spots in the fifth. One thing with Parker, he was pitching ahead in the count in his good games, and tonight, he reversed that. He had to work back into counts a lot of those guys swung the bats well.  RHP Brooks Pounders was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. It's Pounders' fourth stint with the big league club, having gone 1-0 with a 4.91 ERA in eight appearances. Pounders pitched 2 1/3 innings in Friday's game against Seattle and was optioned back to Salt Lake after the game to make room for RHP Bud Norris. CF Mike Trout took live batting practice on the field Friday for the first time since he tore a ligament in his left thumb and had surgery. Trout, who said things went well, will need at least another three days of batting practice before he will begin a rehab assignment, which likely will last for a game or two. With Friday's 10-0 loss to the Mariners, the Angels are 16-15 since Trout was injured on May 28 INF/OF Nick Franklin was acquired Friday from the Milwaukee Brewers in a trade for a player to be named or cash considerations. Franklin, who is expected to be activated to the big league roster Saturday, hit .195 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 53 games for Milwaukee this season. LHP Jose Alvarez was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. Alvarez, who was the only lefty in the bullpen, was 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in a staff-high 40 games. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Alvarez is dealing with command issues and also lost his release point on his breaking ball. RHP Ricky Nolasco will start Saturday against the Mariners. He had lost seven consecutive starts, and the Angels had lost 10 in a row in games started by Nolasco. With that weight on his shoulders, he had to face a hot Dodgers club last Monday that had won 10 in a row. But Nolasco flipped the script, throwing 6 1/3 scoreless innings to end the losing streak. He is 1-4 with a 4.76 ERA in seven career starts against Seattle. RHP Bud Norris, on the disabled list since June 19 with right knee inflammation, has completed his minor league rehab assignment and is expected to be activated to the major league roster on Saturday. Before the injury, Norris was the Angels primary closer, with 11 saves and a 2.43 ERA in 34 games.","keywords":"Brooks Pounders,Bud Norris,Jose Alvarez,Mike Scioscia,Mike Trout,Parker Bridwell,Ricky Nolasco,Robinson Cano,BBO,ANGELS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-01 13:01:00","news_title":"Los Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED71F8LP6U"}
{"content":"RHP Kendall Graveman (strained right shoulder) threw a bullpen session Friday for the first time since going on the disabled list May 26. He threw 20 pitches, and the next step in his throwing plan will be determined Saturday, A's manager Bob Melvin said. Graveman, who made all 31 of his scheduled starts last season, is on his second DL stint this year, both for right shoulder strains. He is 2-2 with a 3.83 ERA in eight starts. RHP Ryan Dull (strained right knee) threw a bullpen session Friday for the first time since going on the disabled list May 20. He threw 20 pitches. The next step in his throwing plan will be determined Saturday. Dull is 2-2 with a 6.32 ERA in 18 relief appearances. Last year, he went 5-5 with a 2.42 ERA in 70 relief appearances. RHP Paul Blackburn will be called up from Triple-A Nashville on Saturday and start against Atlanta in his major-league debut. Blackburn will start in place of RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister), whose next start will be pushed back a few days. Blackburn went 5-6 with a 3.05 ERA in 15 games, including 14 starts, for Nashville. The A's acquired him from Seattle on Nov. 12, 2016, in exchange for 1B/3B Danny Valencia. Blackburn reported to the A's before Friday night's game against Atlanta. The A's will have to make a corresponding roster move on Saturday. RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister) will miss his scheduled start Saturday against Atlanta. According to A's manager Bob Melvin, Cotton's start will be pushed back a few days and he's not expected to go on the DL. He left his last start against the White Sox on June 22 after throwing five-plus innings. 1B/OF Matt Olson broke up a no-hitter with a leadoff home run in the bottom of the ninth inning off Atlanta RHP Mike Foltynewicz on Friday night at Oakland Coliseum. The rookie homered on a 3-2 fastball to deep right in the 3-1 loss. Olson's homer was his fourth of the season.  I was just trying to have a good at-bat, the way he was throwing against us,  said Olson, a native of Atlanta.  Hitting a home run to break up the no-hitter was just the cherry on top. I was seeing him fairly well all night and just missing. He had a lot of life on his fastball.  RHP Sonny Gray (3-4) allowed one run and two hits in a season-high eight innings but took the defeat Friday night in a 3-1 loss to Atlanta at Oakland Coliseum. He struck out four, walked one and threw 98 pitches.  He's been consistent with his stuff,  A's managers Bob Melvin said of Gray.  Finally got results tonight. We just didn't score any runs for him.  RHP Jorge Lopez was optioned to Double-A Biloxi on Friday. He made just one appearance for the Brewers, covering the final two innings of a victory Thursday in Cincinnati. In 16 appearances this season for Biloxi, Lopez is 3-6 with a 5.04 ERA. 3B Matt Chapman (left knee cellulitis) fielded ground balls and took batting practice for the first time since going on the disabled list June 19. He'll go through a pregame workout again Saturday, and if all goes well, the rookie could go on a rehab assignment Sunday, A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Feeling back to normal,  Chapman said.  It's good to be back, good to be back out on the field and see my teammates again. Seems to be coming along nicely. We're taking all the right steps to get me back on the field as soon as possible but making sure that it's right.  Chapman spent four nights in a hospital while receiving antibiotics intravenously. He checked out of the hospital on Sunday. Melvin said Chapman will probably need only one or two rehab games before he's ready to be activated. Chapman started his first four major-league games during a four-game series sweep against the Yankees on June 15-18. He hit .214 with one double and three RBIs and played stellar defense at third base.  He made an impact right away,  Melvin said.  He's one of those guys you just feel better when he's in the lineup.  1B Yonder Alonso (right knee contusion) was out of the lineup for the second straight game Friday night when the A's opened a three-game series against Atlanta. He pinch hit in the eighth inning of Oakland's 3-1 loss and struck out. He left Wednesday's game against Houston after fouling a ball off his knee in the eighth inning.  He's a little better,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He took some ground balls today and hit a little bit. Felt pretty good but just not enough to start the game today. So hopefully he will start tomorrow.

{"content":"RHP Sam Gaviglio will start Saturday against the Angels. Gaviglio, who was drafted in 2011 by the St. Louis Cardinals, traded to the Mariners in 2014 and reached the majors for the first time this season, getting the opportunity because of injuries in the rotation. This will be his first start against the Angels, but he's established himself in the Mariners rotation, going 3-2 with a 3.38 ERA in nine games (eight starts). LHP Ariel Miranda gave up only two hits over seven scoreless innings to earn the victory in the Mariners 10-0 win over the Angels Friday. Miranda, who improved to 4-0 in five career starts against the Angels, gave up only a bloop single to RF Kole Calhoun in the fourth inning and a leadoff double to SS Andrelton Simmons in the fifth.  My aggressiveness on the first two pitches,  Miranda, speaking through an interpreter, said when asked what was the key for him.  I was more aggressive trying to get ahead in the count and if I didn?t get ahead with the first one, I was aggressive with the second one too.  DH Nelson Cruz went 1 for 5 with a double Friday against the Angels, extending his homerless streak to 21 games. His last home run came on June 4, but his 14 homers trail only 2B Robinson Cano (16) for the team lead. Despite the home run drought, Cruz still ranks second in the American League with 59 RBIs.

He was scheduled start one of the two games but will now serve in long relief if needed due to Friday's postponement. Boyd made 11 starts with the Tigers, going 2-5 with a 5.69 ERA, before he was optioned to Triple-A Toledo. He's pitched well in the minors, going 3-0 with a 2.86 ERA in five starts. RHP Michael Fulmer did something unusual in the ninth inning against Kansas City on Thursday. Fulmer came within one out of a complete-game shutout but didn't finish the game as the Royals scored three runs. He's the first pitcher to give up three or more runs after tossing 8 2/3 shutout innings with no one on base since the Yankees' Melido Perez on July 8, 1994. The last Detroit pitcher to lose a shutout bid in that fashion was Frank Lary on Aug. 8, 1959. OF Jim Adduci played eight innings in center field on Thursday as he continues his rehab assignment at Triple-A Toledo. Adduci was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to May 11, with an oblique strain. He has one hit in 10 at-bats in his first three games of the rehab assignment. The club wants him to get 30-40 at-bats before they decide whether to bring him back to the majors. LF Justin Upton did most of his damage during his first season with the Tigers last year in the final two months. He's enjoyed a much more satisfying first half this year, leading the team in home runs (15) and RBIs (52) and tying for the lead in runs scored (48).  He's definitely not breaking bats (in frustration) every day like he was last year around this time of the year,  right fielder J.D. Martinez said.  Last year, he really wasn't feeling comfortable with his swing. ","keywords":"Frank Lary,J.D.

Merritt could serve in a long-relief role if needed.  He'll be active for both games,  manager Terry Francona said. Merritt had one earlier start with the Indians this season against Minnesota. allowing three runs -- two earned -- in four innings. RHP Corey Kluber finished the month of June with a 4-0 record and 1.26 ERA. He recorded 64 strikeouts in six starts, reaching double digits in strikeouts in his last four outings. His strikeout total is the most by an Indians pitcher in a month since Sam McDowell notched 71 in May 1970. Kluber also matched his club record by recording 60 strikeouts and no losses in a single calendar month. He pulled the same feat in May 2014.  The bar has been so high,  manager Terry Francona said.  That's not easy to do.  RHP Dan Otero was scheduled to start one of the two games of the doubleheader on Saturday. Friday's postponement means Otero, who has made 28 relief appearances, won't get the spot start. Manager Terry Francona had opted to go with Otero over left-handed callup Ryan Merritt because of Detroit's predominantly right-handed hitting lineup.

This is a dream that you follow and chase your whole life. To be able to be here is great. He said it helped  a lot  to be in spring training. Being able to be at the big camp in spring training is like being in the big leagues,  Jorge said.

It was the first time season that manager Paul Molitor had to get Santana in the middle of the inning.  It felt unfamiliar,  Molitor said.  He has a way, even in the last game when he got the five-inning win, you try to give him opportunities to finish innings there and after the five-run fourth he got through another inning and we tried to get another out of him. I think it was a changeup that he left up to (Mike) Moustakas and then they got the triple and I thought that was time.

{"content":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Airways (SAA) has been provided with state funds to help it repay loans of about 2.3 billion rand ($176 million) to Standard Chartered, the government said on Saturday.  The airline faced around nine billion rand of debt maturing at the end of June involving six or seven lenders, according to the Treasury. On Thursday the Treasury told lawmakers it was in discussions with lenders to roll-over the nine billion owed to them.  In a statement issued on behalf of the Treasury, the government said the funds provided to SAA had been sourced from the National Revenue Fund (NRF), which under law allows any minister to authorize the use of funds for expenditure of an exceptional nature.  A default by the airline would have triggered a call on the guarantee, leading to an outflow from the NRF and possibly resulting in elevated perceptions of risk related to the rest of SAA's guaranteed debt, the statement said. SAA already relies on government guarantees of about 20 billion rand to keep it solvent. It has been cited by all three major rating agencies repeatedly as a threat to South Africa's economy. Two of those agencies cut the country's debt to sub-investment grade following President Jacob Zuma's firing of the finance minister in March. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's office said Standard Charted had requested immediate payment of the money owed but that the remaining lenders had indicated they were open to deferring the debt.  Drawing on the NRF was a tough decision versus the worse one of defaulting. It was taken to reassure lenders that state firms and more importantly government won't default,  ministry spokesman Mayihlome Tshwete said. The Treasury is under pressure to keep recent pledges to cut spending and reform governance at state firms to fend off credit downgrades deeper into  junk . Such downgrades would trigger a spike in already soaring borrowing costs on public debt of more than 2.2 trillion rand. On Friday Finance Minister Gigaba, speaking at the opening of ruling Africa National Congress's policy conference, unnerved markets when he said the country may need outside financial assistance. Asked by Reuters if he was referring to the International Monetary Fund, Gigaba smiled and said  Any .

{"content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin had telephone discussions with the leaders of Qatar and Bahrain, stressing the need for diplomacy to end the dispute between Qatar and several other Arab states, the Kremlin said on Saturday. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar last month, accusing it of supporting terrorism and opening up the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world. Moscow is trying to tread cautiously in the dispute, since it wants good relations with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Russia backs President Bashar al-Assad in the six-year-long Syria conflict and is close to Iran, which has fraught ties with the Saudis. Moscow sold a stake in its state oil champion Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to Qatar last year and has been coordinating oil output cuts with the Saudis as part of a global pact to lift oil prices. The Kremlin, which announced the phone calls with the leaders of Qatar and Bahrain in two separate statements on its website on Saturday, did not say when they happened.  It clarified that they happened on the initiative of Qatar and Bahrain.  Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of political-diplomatic efforts aimed at overcoming differences of opinion and the normalization of the difficult situation that exists,  said the statement on the talks between Putin and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The Russian and Qatari leaders also discussed cooperation between their countries in energy and investment. Putin told Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa that there should be direct dialogue between all sides of the dispute with Qatar.

{"content":"SPEYER, Germany (Reuters) - Leaders from the United States, Russia and across Europe paid tribute on Saturday to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl as the architect of German reunification and a driving force for European integration. Kohl, who died on June 16 at 87, was lauded at a ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other figures. A funeral service was held later on Saturday with 900 invited guests at Speyer Cathedral, where as a teenager Kohl found shelter from World War Two aerial bombings.  His casket was flown by helicopter from Strasbourg to his hometown Ludwigshafen before being carried by boat up the Rhine to Speyer, one of Germany's oldest towns where Kohl took former world leaders including Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Mikail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Margaret Thatcher for private meetings.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said in Strasbourg of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial in Strasbourg, a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France, symbolized the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward. A blue European Union flag was draped over Kohl's casket in Strasbourg. A German flag later covered the coffin in Germany, where thousands watched from the streets as his coffin moved through Ludwigshafen and later from the banks of the Rhine.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skillfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.

Helmut Kohl was a German patriot and a European patriot,  said Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister and close friend of Kohl who switched between German and French in his tribute.  We've lost a giant of the post-war era.  Slideshow (25 Images)Chancellor Angela Merkel, who served as a minister under Kohl in the 1990s but later had a falling out over his role in receiving $1 million in illegal campaign cash donations, remembered Kohl as an at-times controversial figure with numerous enemies.  I could tell you stories as well,  she said.  But all that paled in comparison to his life's achievements.  Merkel said Kohl had changed the lives of millions across all of Europe. The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union.  The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him. His sons, however, boycotted the Cathedral's funeral mass, because their father will not be laid to rest alongside Hannelore Kohl, his wife of decades.

{"content":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama urged Indonesians on Saturday to resist divisive politics based on race and religion, saying the world's most populous Muslim nation has a long history of tolerance that should be preserved. Indonesia's reputation for pluralism has come under scrutiny since Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was sentenced in May to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after Islamist-led rallies.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka is still coming to grips with carrying a stroller around with her tennis rackets when she travels to tournaments these days, but is looking forward to a special Wimbledon after arriving with an  extra member  in tow. The former world number returned to the circuit last month after giving birth to Leo in December, and both mother and son have traveled to London as the Belarussian gears up for her first grand slam since last year's French Open.  Being back here with an extra member of my team is really special,  a smiling Azarenka told a news conference on Saturday.  It feels great. I didn't play last year, so it feels like it's been, you know, almost two years that I didn't play here.  Being a mother comes with added responsibility -- and luggage -- but the good news is that Leo likes to travel, while Azarenka is confident she has struck the right balance between the demands of her sport and her family.  He's actually a very good traveler,  she said.  I think I stress out more because I want to make sure that everything is going great... He is totally fine. He loves the plane.  But it's definitely a little bit more luggage. And with a stroller there... I didn't know you can't bring your stroller out in London, so we had to carry him all through the airport... till we got to the customs, which was really weird.  The 27-year-old said she had initially struggled with being away from Leo and had to trick herself into not feeling any guilt as she prepared for her comeback.  Well, the changes, it's like 180 in your mentality, your daily activities,  she added.  Being in an individual sport, you have to be a little bit more selfish.  It's a little bit of a mind trick that I have to do... not feel guilty that I don't spend my every free second with my son, which is sometimes tough.  But it also gives me a really good balance when I am done with my practice or my matches, that I'm able to shut off from tennis, just lose myself with my son.  There have been a number of changes on the circuit during her absence, including a host of unfamiliar faces, and Azarenka's first challenge will be to get past 40th-ranked American teenager Catherine Bellis in her opening match on Monday.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and the European Union are on the cusp of a wide-ranging free trade agreement that could help blunt the forces of protectionism sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she was  quite confident  that a broad agreement can be announced at a summit on July 6 with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as both sides finalize the reduction of tariffs on autos and agricultural goods. Clinching a deal would offer Japan and Europe an important political victory and could raise questions about the U.S. government's influence on the agenda for the global economy.  You can do good, fair, transparent and sustainable trade agreements where you win and I win, and not the American view, which seems to be, 'You lose and I win,'  Malmstrom told reporters. Malmstrom spoke after two days of meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo about a deal that would eliminate a broad range of trade barriers.

{"content":"BELFAST (Reuters) - Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said on Saturday that Northern Ireland's political parties were unlikely to reach a deal to restore the province's power-sharing agreement in the next few days.  The region has been locked in a political crisis since January's collapse of the coalition between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists mandated under a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence. The British government last week said last week it would give the parties a few more days to agree a way to restore the executive after the latest deadline passed without a deal.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal is adamant that he will not be discouraged by the memory of recent Wimbledon woes as he prepares to follow up his landmark 10th French Open triumph with a third success on the sport's most storied lawns. Nadal spurned the chance of a warm-up tournament at Queen's Club to put less pressure on his body after his exertions at Roland Garros. He opted to fine tune his game in Mallorca instead. Now, Spain's two-times champion is determined to improve on a series of shock defeats he has suffered to unheralded opposition at Wimbledon since winning his last title in 2010 and reaching the final the following year. Nadal lost to Lukas Rosol in the second round in 2012 when struggling with knee problems, Steve Darcis in 2013 (first round), the then new boy Nick Kyrgios in 2014 (fourth round) and Dustin Brown in 2015 (second round) before missing last year with a wrist injury. Yet he is adamant that the losses have not left a scar.  My motivation is always high in all the events that I play. If not, I am not playing,  said Nadal, whose victory in Paris took his grand slam total to 15.  It's true that what happened with my knees in 2012 was more difficult (but) at the same time, it's true that in 2014 I played a good event when I lost in the fourth round against Nick. But I had my chances, too.

Let's see what's going on this year. I know it's always difficult. I am excited to be playing again here, in a tournament that I really love. But at the same time I tell you, it's a tournament that you can go out very early.  But if I am able to go through at the beginning, I think I am with confidence. I am playing well since the beginning of the season, so let's see.  This is somewhat of an understatement from the modest 31-year-old. Since reaching the Australian Open final at the start of the year, where only a dazzlingly rejuvenated Roger Federer could eclipse him, Nadal has won four clay titles. At times he has looked something near to his rampaging finest. Nadal confirmed that his coach Carlos Moya would not be attending Wimbledon with him but added that his uncle Toni would be part of his  great team . He sounded refreshed by his spell training at home.  It was great,  he said.  I would love to have been playing in Queen's, obviously,  but after the last three months and after what happened in Roland Garros, we decided that for my body it was better to have a slower change to the grass.

{"content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin had telephone discussions with the leaders of Qatar and Bahrain, stressing the need for diplomacy to end the dispute between Qatar and several other Arab states, the Kremlin said on Saturday. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar last month, accusing it of supporting terrorism and opening up the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world. Moscow is trying to tread cautiously in the dispute, since it wants good relations with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Russia backs President Bashar al-Assad in the six-year-long Syria conflict and is close to Iran, which has fraught ties with the Saudis. Moscow sold a stake in its state oil champion Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to Qatar last year and has been coordinating oil output cuts with the Saudis as part of a global pact to lift oil prices. The Kremlin, which announced the phone calls with the leaders of Qatar and Bahrain in two separate statements on its website on Saturday, did not say when they happened.  It clarified that they happened on the initiative of Qatar and Bahrain.  Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of political-diplomatic efforts aimed at overcoming differences of opinion and the normalization of the difficult situation that exists,  said the statement on the talks between Putin and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The Russian and Qatari leaders also discussed cooperation between their countries in energy and investment.

{"content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is working on moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy, Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's Bundesbank and a member of the ECB's rate-setting body, said on Saturday. Investors are watching for any sign that the ECB may reduce its stimulus, which includes massive bond purchases and ultra-low rates, after a hint in that direction by President Mario Draghi boosted the euro and government bond yields this week.      It will hopefully come and we're working on that, we're also discussing it,  Weidmann, a long-standing critic of the ECB's bond purchases, told an audience at the Bundesbank's open days. Inflation in the euro zone has been low for years and it is not expected to reach the ECB's target of just under 2 percent until at least 2019 despite the central bank's efforts. But price growth is now comfortably above 1 percent, leading some rate setters, particularly in the wealthier northern countries of the currency union, to call for a reduction in the ECB's monetary largesse.  What we are discussing and even arguing about is how expansive monetary policy should be given our target,  Weidmann said during a question-and-answer session with the public. ECB President Draghi said this week Frankfurt could make tweaks to its policy to accompany the recent economic recovery in the euro zone. This has strengthened market expectations that the ECB would wind down its 2.3 trillion euros ($2.63 trillion)bond purchases next year and start raising rates thereafter. The ECB's policy of low rates has been unpopular with sections of the German public and political class, who fear it erodes returns on savings while bankrolling indebted governments in the south of the bloc.   Weidmann said the issue for rate setters was when to show resolve and normalize the ECB's policy in the face of political pressures to keep it easy longer than necessary.

{"content":"(Reuters) - World number one Angelique Kerber says she has put her disastrous claycourt season firmly behind her and will have to start  from zero  at Wimbledon as she attempts to rediscover her best tennis over the next few months. The German suffered a humiliating first-round exit at the French Open in May, losing to 40th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova and becoming the first top seed to be eliminated from the tournament at the very first hurdle in the professional era. She was also forced to withdraw from a warm-up tournament in Birmingham last month with a hamstring injury, but said on Saturday that she had recovered from that setback.    It's great to be back,  Kerber told a news conference ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on Monday.  I'm feeling good ... I'm healthy so far, so this is very important for me.  I'm not thinking about Paris, about the claycourt season any more ... I'm starting from zero here. My mind is just day-by-day here, like last year. I will try to play good tennis again.  Kerber finished runner-up at Wimbledon last year, losing to Serena Williams in the final. And with expectant mother Williams not defending her title at SW19 this year, Kerber said the tournament would have a different feel about it.  Of course, it's different if Serena is not here,  the German added.   I will not put the pressure too far, too high. I'm here to really try to focus day-by-day, not thinking too far, not thinking about other things, making the things maybe, again, a little bit not too complicated.  I mean, everything is possible, in two weeks especially. It's a long time. So we will see.  Such has been the deterioration in Kerber's form over the past few months that the German said it could take her months to get back to her best.  I will not put the pressure on Wimbledon,  she added.  I have still the next months where I have big tournaments.  Of course I am here to play good tennis, try to win every single match. But I will think more about the next half-year ... I think this is more in my mind to not put too much pressure now for this tournament on my belt.  Kerber kicks off her campaign on Monday against American Irina Falconi, who is ranked 246th in the world.

{"content":"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland has a moral right to say 'no' to refugees, the country's most powerful politician said on Saturday. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling party Law and Justice (PiS), gave his views on immigration at a party convention in Przysucha, 100 km (60 miles) south of Warsaw.  We have not exploited the countries from which these refugees are coming to Europe these days, we have not used their labor force and finally we have not invited them to Europe. We have a full moral right to say 'no',  Kaczynski said in a speech broadcast on television. Last month the European Commission launched a legal case against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in asylum seekers, highlighting the feud within the 28-nation bloc over how to deal with migration.  Kaczynski, who has criticized the European Union's relocation schemes for migrants on many occasions, also said that the PiS could not be accused of being anti-European, as it backed Poland's joining the block in 2004 and now appreciates the inflow of EU funds.   The fact that we appreciate them (the funds), does not mean that we have lost the right to various assessments, including those regarding the historical context,  Kaczynski said, adding that Poland has never received any compensation for the losses it suffered during the Second World War.  During his 70-minute speech, the PiS leader suggested the government increase social spending if the economic situation allows. He also said there was a need to reduce the share of foreign capital in the media sector.

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered slightly on Friday, but posted its biggest quarterly decline against a basket of rival currencies in nearly seven years after hawkish signals from foreign central banks this week pressured the greenback further.  Investors have ramped-up expectations for tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada after hints from officials this week. This has made the greenback less attractive, in addition to skepticism that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year given a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data and doubts that U.S. President Donald Trump could enact his pro-growth agenda. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, declined about 4.6 .DXY percent for the second quarter to mark its steepest quarterly percentage drop since the third quarter of 2010. The euro accelerated more than 7 percent against the greenback for its biggest quarterly percentage gain since the third quarter of 2010. The euro racked up about 2 percent of its gains and the dollar index posted about 1.6 percent of its losses this week alone.

{"content":"CHICHESTER, England (Reuters) - BMW will decide whether to build its new electric Mini car in Britain or elsewhere by the end of September, its board member for sales told Reuters, in a test of the country's ability to continue to attract investment as it leaves the EU.  Mini makes around 70 percent of its approximately 360,000 compact cars at its Oxford plant in southern England but the car industry is concerned about the effect any loss of unfettered access to the EU, its largest export market, could have on plants after Brexit. BMW is deciding between its English site, a plant in the Netherlands where it has built more of its conventional line-up in recent years, and its Germany plants at Leipzig and Regensburg for the new low-emissions variant.  The firm's board member for sales told Reuters that the electric Mini investment, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, would come in the next three months and the board was currently considering a number of factors including Brexit.  One of the elements is what is the likelihood of a tax regime and if there's a tax regime, how would it apply,  Ian Robertson said during an interview at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in southern England.  If you made the motor in a German plant and you then assembled the car in a British plant, and you took the cars back to the German market, then the duty that you would pay would be reclaimed,  he said, in an example of the options companies are examining to plan for any duties or tariffs. The automaker is also looking into where the uptake of greener models is strongest and where the best supply chains are, he said.  Britain could approve its first major electric battery hub in the next few weeks after officials in central England submitted proposals to ministers in May. But last month, the car industry issued its strongest warning yet on the need for politicians to strike a transitional Brexit deal after two-year talks to ensure unfettered trade is maintained. Uncertainty has also been heightened after a snap June 8 election which left Prime Minister Theresa May without a majority and has led to ministers in her administration hinting at different versions of Britain's likely post-Brexit future. Last year, May's administration helped secure two new models at Japanese carmaker Nissan's plant in the north of England after what a source said was a government promise of extra support to counter any loss of competitiveness caused by Brexit. Robertson told Reuters there was an  open channel  with officials and that he had several meetings with the Brexit ministry and with business minister Greg Clark, who has visited BMW in Munich, with their teams in regular contact. But, asked whether the government could make promises now regarding future tax or tariff arrangements as BMW neared its decision, he said he did not believe that ministers were in a position to do so.   Any of these discussions about a guarantee, it's not possible,  he said.

{"content":"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - The leaning minaret of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque survived conquests by the Mongols and the Ottomans, neglect under Saddam Hussein, and air raids during the Iran-Iraq War and the U.S. invasion in 2003. But after three years of Islamic State rule, it is now little more than a pile of stones at the center of a shattered city. By all accounts except their own, the jihadists rigged the mosque and its 850-year-old tower with explosives and blew them up last week as advancing Iraqi forces came within steps of the complex. A Reuters visit to the site on Friday, a day after Iraq's military recaptured it, confirmed the extent of destruction: the 45-metre (148 ft) al-Hadba minaret had been reduced to a stump while the mint green dome was the only part of the prayer hall still standing. Fighting raged on a few blocks away. Bullets whizzed past the main gate, which is largely intact, and a mortar fell on an adjacent building. Below the mosque's dome in July 2014, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon presenting himself at the head of a modern-day caliphate spanning swathes of territory which the al Qaeda offshoot group had just seized in Iraq and neighboring Syria.  I am your leader, though I am not the best of you,  he said, wearing the black turban and robes denoting a claim to descend from the Prophet Mohammad. Within months, Islamic State was carrying out and inspiring militant attacks in places as far abreast as Paris, London and California. An international military coalition led by the United States quickly coalesced to confront the group. Three years on, the inscribed pulpit where he spoke lies in ruins. The mosque grounds are covered in stone and concrete, and a segment of a secondary minaret is one of the only discernable objects in the rubble. The risk of unexploded ordnance or mines prevented a thorough inspection of the site's interior.     Baghdadi's appearance at the Nuri mosque was the first time he revealed himself to the world, and the footage broadcast then is to this day the only video recording of him as  caliph . He long ago left the fighting in Mosul and Syria's Raqqa to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between the two countries, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. He has frequently been reported killed, including last month by Russia and Iran. The ruined Grand al-Nuri Mosque is seen after it was retaken by the Iraqi forces from the Islamic State militants at the Old City in Mosul, Iraq, June 30, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniAfter his speech in 2014, Baghdadi descended from the pulpit to lead his followers in worship, standing in a prayer niche which is now just barely recognizable amid the wreckage. Crumbling Caliphate Baghdadi's project, to revive the Islamic caliphate which mostly disappeared with the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, is also crumbling.     Slideshow (13 Images)The group still rules over an area which by one estimate is equivalent to the size of Belgium. But experts say its territorial losses undermine its legitimacy and attractiveness to potential recruits who once flocked from across the world in the tens of thousands. The Nuri mosque was named after Nuruddin al-Zanki, a noble who fought the early crusaders from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It was built in 1172-73, shortly before his death, and housed an Islamic school. By the time renowned medieval traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta visited two centuries later, the minaret was leaning. The tilt gave the landmark its popular name: the hunchback. The mosque's military and religious history embodied the spirit of Mosul, a diverse but predominately Sunni Muslim city which supplied Iraq's armed forces with officers for much of the 20th century. The Hadba minaret, whose tilt begs comparisons to Italy's Tower of Pisa, was built with seven bands of decorative brickwork in complex geometric patterns also found in Persia and Central Asia. Only slivers of that design are now visible among the rubble. The eight-month-old U.S.-backed battle for Mosul has also destroyed homes and basic infrastructure across the city and displaced nearly a million residents. Civilians, mostly women and children, rushed past the demolished mosque as they crossed the frontline towards Iraqi forces. They were thirsty and tired, and some were injured. Across the street, among the detritus of war, laid the partial remains of an Islamic State fighter dressed in red clothing.

The rally has been held since 2009 under stringent public assembly laws at Speakers' Corner, an area set aside for demonstrations, performances and exhibitions. But this year, Speakers' Corner was barricaded and participants had to show ID to prove they were citizens or permanent residents before they could enter, with a set maximum taking part.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republican senators in a tweet on Friday to repeal Obamacare immediately if they cannot agree on a new plan to replace it, muddying the waters as congressional leaders struggle for consensus on healthcare legislation. Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next week's recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trump's tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trump’s suggestion, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Related CoverageWhite House says fully committed to draft Senate healthcare billTrump wrote on Twitter Friday morning,  If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!   The White House said later that Trump was still  fully committed  to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The president hasn't changed his thinking at all,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks down while speaking to reporters about healthcare during an energy policy discussion with leaders of American Indian tribes and U.S. governors at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe current Senate legislation would repeal parts of Obamacare, roll back its expansion of the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, eliminate most of Obamacare's taxes and replace Obamacare insurance subsidies with a system of tax credits to help individuals buy private health insurance. Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted:  Glad you agree, Mr. Pres.  Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it,  senators would have done that in January. It doesn't have the votes, and it's a waste of valuable time to discuss it.  Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnell's spokesman declined to comment on Trump's tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPAN's  Newsmakers  program that lawmakers' goal should continue to be  not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.

The Czech world number three demonstrated once again just why, with her big serves and crushing groundstrokes, she could be the one to beat at Wimbledon over the next fortnight as she annexed her third title of the season. Denmark's Wozniacki, the world number six who had hoped to regain the title she last won in 2009, held on in game fashion but succumbed to a break of serve in each set and, despite a second set push, could not dent Pliskova's formidable delivery.  This feels better,  said the 25-year-old Pliskova on court afterwards, comparing her feeling to the defeat in the same final last year. Reminded that Jana Novotna had been the last Czech woman to win at Eastbourne before going to triumph at Wimbledon in the same year, she added:  My service is definitely my biggest weapon and if it's working it causes the other player a lot of problems.

{"content":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping swore in Hong Kong's new leader on Saturday with a stark warning that Beijing won't tolerate any challenge to its authority in the divided city as it marked the 20th anniversary of its return from Britain to China. Police blocked roads, preventing pro-democracy protesters from getting to the harbor-front venue close to where the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to China in the pouring rain in 1997. Xi said Hong Kong should crack down on moves towards  Hong Kong independence .       Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government ... or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible,  Xi said. He also referred to the  humiliation and sorrow  China suffered during the first Opium War in the early 1840s that led to ceding Hong Kong to the British. Hong Kong has been racked by demands for full democracy and, more recently, by calls by some pockets of protesters for independence, a subject that is anathema to Beijing. Xi's speech was his strongest yet to the city amid concerns over what some perceive as increased meddling by Beijing, illustrated in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature.  It's a more frank and pointed way of dealing with the problems,  said former senior Hong Kong government adviser Lau Siu-kai on Hong Kong's Cable Television.  The central government's power hasn't been sufficiently respected... they're concerned about this.  The tightly choreographed visit was full of pro-China rhetoric amid a virtually unprecedented security lockdown close to the scene of pro-democracy protests in 2014 that grabbed global headlines with clashes and tear gas rising between waterfront skyscrapers. Xi did not make contact with the people in the street or with any pro-democracy voices, forgoing an opportunity to lower the political heat through a softer, more nuanced approach.  The hardening stance of the democrats and Beijing could perhaps widen, spawning greater radicalism, though some activists also concede a spreading disillusionment has sapped momentum among the democracy movement since Xi came to power. Under the mini-constitution, the Basic Law, Hong Kong is guaranteed wide-ranging autonomy for  at least 50 years  after 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula praised by Xi. It also specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal. Pro-democracy protesters carry a banner which reads  One Country, Two Systems, a cheating for twenty years. Recapture Hong Kong with democracy and self-determination , during a demonstration on the 20th anniversary of the territory's handover from Britain to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China July 1, 2017.Bobby YipBut Beijing's refusal to grant full democracy triggered the nearly three months of street protests in 2014 that posed one of the greatest populist challenges to Beijing in decades.  Most Urgent  Protest in Years In the afternoon, tens of thousands gathered in sweltering heat in a sprawling park named after Britain's Queen Victoria, demanding Xi allow universal suffrage. Organizers put the figure at more than 60,000.   Xi shouldn't be interfering in Hong Kong too much,  Peter Lau, a 20-year-old university student, said.  Despite him visiting garrisons and muscle-flexing, Hong Kong people's confidence will never be shaken. Especially for our generation. We should ... fight for our freedom.   Slideshow (22 Images)Some demonstrators marched with yellow umbrellas, a symbol of democratic activism in the city, and held banners denouncing China's Communist  one party rule . Others criticized China's Foreign Ministry which on Friday said the  Joint Declaration  with Britain over Hong Kong, a treaty laying the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997,  no longer has any practical significance . At the end of the rally a simple white banner read:  Cry in grief for 20 years.  [For a link to Reuters handover stories, reut.rs/2sje26J] Xi in the morning addressed a packed hall of mostly pro-Beijing establishment figures, after swearing in Hong Kong's first female leader, Carrie Lam, who was strongly backed by China. Xi hinted that the central government was in favor of Hong Kong introducing  national security  legislation, a controversial issue that brought nearly half a million people to the streets in protest in 2003 and ultimately forced former leader Tung Chee-hwa to step down.  A small group of pro-democracy activists near the venue were roughed up by a group of men who smashed up some props in ugly scuffles. Nine democracy protesters, including student leader Joshua Wong and lawmaker  long hair  Leung Kwok-hung, were bundled into police vans while several pro-China groups remained, cheering loudly and waving red China flags. The activists, in a later statement, said the assailants had been  pro-Beijing triad members .

{"content":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Oscar-winning actress Olivia de Havilland filed a lawsuit against FX Networks on Friday, saying she did not give her permission to be portrayed in the miniseries  Feud: Bette and Joan  and that her depiction in the show had harmed her reputation.  Lawyers for de Havilland, whose 101st birthday is on Saturday, said the network and Ryan Murphy Productions did not consult with her and that she is the only living person to be depicted in the eight-part miniseries. De Havilland was portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones in  Feud,  which starred Jessica Lange as Joan Crawford and Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis. The series explored the complex tension and bad blood between the two Hollywood screen legends in the later years of their life, especially during their filming on 1962's  What Ever Happened to Baby Jane.  Critics warmly received the series, touting it as a strong contender for next month's Emmy nominations.   De Havilland's complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Representative for Murphy and FX Networks, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. In an April interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy said he did not contact de Havilland because he  didn't want to be disrespectful and ask her,  Did this happen? Did that happen? What was your take on that?   In the complaint, lawyers criticized Zeta-Jones' depiction of de Havilland giving an interview that they said had never taken place in real life, even though the series intended for viewers to believe it was true. The complaint adds that de Havilland was portrayed as a  petty gossip  in the show, which her lawyers argued was damaging to her  professional reputation for integrity, honesty, generosity, self-sacrifice and dignity.   The complaint requests a jury trial to determine damages that include emotional distress and economic losses as well as profits made by defendants using de Havilland's likeness. De Havilland, best known for the 1939 film  Gone With the Wind,  won two Oscars in a career spanning 50 movies that was also marked by a legendary feud with younger sister and fellow Oscar-winner Joan Fontaine that was worthy of a screenplay. Fontaine died in 2013. De Havilland moved to Paris in the 1950s, where she currently resides, and has only made rare public appearances since retiring.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in a radio interview to be broadcast on Sunday that there could be room to cut taxes by more than the 15 billion euros already announced after the Sept. 24 election. Schaeuble told Deutschlandfunk radio that he hoped there could be tax relief beyond that already promised 15-billion euro income tax cut. The conservative Christian Democrats will present details on that with their campaign platform on Monday.  We're planning, all in all, to do more than just correcting the income taxes by 15 billion euros,  he said, referring to plans to reduce the country's  cold progression  tax increases -- or  clandestine tax increases. Germany does not adjust tax brackets for inflation, unlikely many other countries. Schaeuble said that aside from fighting  cold progression , the Christian Democrats want to support young families to build new housing while also supporting research and development for small- to medium-sized companies.  He said he would like to start dismantling the so-called  Solidarity Tax  in 2020 that was introduced after German unification to help pay for the costs of rebuilding infrastructure in formerly Communist East Germany. Schaeuble has rejected criticism that the income tax cuts of 15 billion years a year were too low to significantly boost economic growth through consumption.  Economists and business lobby groups inside and outside Germany have demanded an overhaul of Germany's tax system, namely steeper tax relief that would boost consumption and growth and a lower corporate tax rate that would encourage private investments. The International Monetary Fund and European Commission have said that Germany has room to lift investments on hard and digital infrastructure, which would help reduce its current account deficit and benefit weaker euro zone peers.    Germany invested about 2.2 of output on roads, bridges schools and kindergarten each year on average between 2005 and 2014, significantly lower than the average of 3.3 percent among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A recent study by the Bertelsmann Foundation think-tank found that if Germany boost investments to the OECD average, its economy would grow 1.6 percent each year on average until 2025 -instead of 1.4 percent if investment levels remain at their current level - and tax revenue would grow by 80 billion euros. Schaeuble has said he prefers to use the higher tax revenues made possible thanks to steady growth fueled by consumption, a robust labor market, a booming construction sector and higher state spending to reduce public debt.

{"content":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A leader of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim organization has called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand risks ruining the  religious and cultured  core of the Southeast Asian nation. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But police raids on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community have risen in the world's most populous Muslim country. Anwar Abbas of Muhammadiyah, an organization that has around 30 million members, said the government should revoke Starbucks' operating license as the company's support for the LGBT community is  not in line  with the nation's ideology.  If Starbucks only does business, then fine. But don't bring ideology here,  Abbas told Reuters by phone on Saturday.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain, is a legal entity that  always obeys the prevailing regulations and appreciates the cultural values in Indonesia , an executive at its parent company said.  We also value the religious background of our customers and employees,  Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa Tbk, said in a text message. Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and pluralism is already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was sentenced in May to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. Asked why he had taken a stand against Starbucks, Abbas  said he was informed in a chat group about a pro-LGBT comment made by the company's senior executive, Howard Schultz. Schultz is now chairman of Starbucks after stepping down from his previous role as chief executive. Forbes reported that when a Starbucks shareholder complained in 2013 that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage, Schultz said it embraces diversity and that  not every decision is an economic decision . (bit.ly/2swGTQB)  If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company,  Schultz was reported as saying at that time. A video of the comment was also posted on YouTube. Starbucks customer Annisa Meidiana, who is a Muslim, said she would not stop buying coffee there because of the call for the boycott.  Islam condemns LGBT. It's a sin,  the 22-year-old university student said outside Jakarta.  But it doesn't matter to me. For me, being an LGBT is a human right.

{"content":"MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Kashmiri militant commander on Saturday denounced his designation as a terrorist by the United States, vowing to continue his armed fight against Indian rule over its part of the divided Himalayan territory. Syed Salahuddin called the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration  idiotic , saying it was a gift to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was visiting Washington on Monday, the day Salahuddin was declared a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.  They cannot quote a single incident to prove that we are terrorists,  Salahuddin told a news conference in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani portion of Kashmir, where he has been based for some 25 years as leader of the Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest of the anti-Indian Kashmiri militant groups.  This idiocy can neither weaken our courage, nor stop the freedom struggle and the target-oriented actions of freedom fighters,  he added, saying his fighters' attacks were on legitimate military targets as opposed to civilians. Gun-wielding Hizbul Mujahideen members wearing fatigues escorted his vehicle to the news conference venue. Syed Salahuddin (L), Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, is showered with flower petals as he arrives to speak at a news conference in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan July 1, 2017.M. Saif-ul-IslamPakistan denies giving material help to Kashmiri separatists but reiterated earlier this week that it would continue to provide diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination. India blames Pakistan for stoking the 28-year-old revolt in Muslim-majority Kashmir and has stepped up efforts to put pressure on Pakistan under Modi. Security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir have been accused by activists and rights groups of killing up to 100 separatist protesters since new mass anti-India demonstrations broke out in September. In Monday's announcement, the U.S. State Department said that in September 2016 Salahuddin had threatened to train more Kashmiri suicide bombers and vowed to turn the Kashmir valley  into a graveyard for Indian forces . As a consequence of the designation, U.S. individuals are banned from engaging in financial transactions with Salahuddin and all his property in the United States is blocked. Salahuddin, who is from Badgam town in Indian-administered Kashmir, was an Islamist politician who turned to militancy after he lost an election for the Kashmir legislative assembly in 1987, which he says was  massively rigged  by India.

{"content":" MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' police chief on Friday stood by anti-narcotics officers and rejected a Reuters investigation that pointed to a pattern of police sending corpses of drug suspects to hospitals to destroy crime scene evidence and hide executions.  President Rodrigo Duterte took office in the Philippines a year ago, launching a bloody war on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos.  PREVIOUSLY FROM REUTERS INVESTIGATES: Philippine police use hospitals to hide drug war killings Podcast: Dead on arrival in Duterte's drug war In a television interview to mark the anniversary, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Ronald dela Rosa appeared irritated by questions about the Reuters report, published on Thursday, and said police carrying out anti-drugs operations had a duty to save lives, even when encountering violent resistance.  He said police were not medically qualified to determine whether a victim was dead or alive and sent victims to hospital as part of operational procedure.   What do you want, we let the wounded die? You don't want us to rescue his life?  he told news channel ANC.  The Reuters investigation analyzed crime data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts and included accounts of doctors, witnesses, law enforcement officials and victims' families. [nL8N1JQ2NQ]  It showed a pattern of police sending dead bodies to hospitals, preventing thorough crime scene investigations from taking place after the killing of drug suspects. [nL8N1JQ2NQ]  Dela Rosa said Reuters, which has produced a series of in-depth reports into the war on drugs that have questioned official accounts, was  looking for faults  in the police.   PNP is damned if you do, damned if you don't. Reuters really is looking for faults in us. We have to stand by our police operational procedure that in case of an encounter, if a person is not yet declared dead by the physician, you need to bring him to the hospital.   He added:  Who are the policemen to say they are dead? They are not medical practitioners. If we did not bring them to the hospitals, the relatives might sue us.   A spokeswoman for Reuters said the news agency stood by its reporting.  Duterte's bloody campaign has been condemned by human rights groups and alarmed Western countries due to the high death toll and allegations of systematic extrajudicial killings and cover-ups by police. The PNP rejects those allegations.  Few Survivors  Reuters looked at police reports covering the first eight months of the drug war, which showed that in Quezon City Police District and neighboring Manila Police District, 301 victims were sent to hospital after police anti-drug operations. Only two survived and the rest were dead on arrival.  In nearly all cases where drug suspects have died during police operations in the year-long crackdown, the official accounts say police fired in self defense. Police say they do not shoot to kill.  Activists, however, say the circumstances behind many of the killings in police sting operations point to executions. A Reuters investigation last year found that when police opened fire in anti-drug operations, they killed 97 percent of people they shot.  The data analyzed in the latest Reuters investigation shows a sharp increase in the number of drug suspects declared dead on arrival in the Quezon City and Manila districts each month.  There were 10 cases when the drug war started a year ago in July 2016, or 13 percent of police drug shooting deaths. By January 2017, the tally rose to 51 cases, or 85 percent, at a time when criticism of Duterte's campaign intensified.  A police commander who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the increase was no coincidence and police were  trying to prevent crime scene investigations and media attention that might show they were executing suspects.  Human rights groups say the anti-drugs crackdown, the signature policy of the populist Duterte, has been disastrous and has almost entirely targeted the poor, with most of those killed or arrested drug users and small-time dealers, with narcotics kingpins largely untouched.  Dela Rosa said police should not be disparaged for trying to save victims and the removal of bodies from a crime scene did not mean a proper investigation could not be carried out.   Do not put malice in what the police does,  he said.  The  crime scene is there even without the dead body.

{"content":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping swore in Hong Kong's new leader on Saturday with a stark warning that Beijing won't tolerate any challenge to its authority in the divided city as it marked the 20th anniversary of its return from Britain to China. Police blocked roads, preventing pro-democracy protesters from getting to the harbor-front venue close to where the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to China in the pouring rain in 1997. Xi said Hong Kong should crack down on moves towards  Hong Kong independence .       Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government ... or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible,  Xi said. He also referred to the  humiliation and sorrow  China suffered during the first Opium War in the early 1840s that led to ceding Hong Kong to the British. Hong Kong has been racked by demands for full democracy and, more recently, by calls by some pockets of protesters for independence, a subject that is anathema to Beijing. Xi's speech was his strongest yet to the city amid concerns over what some perceive as increased meddling by Beijing, illustrated in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature.  It's a more frank and pointed way of dealing with the problems,  said former senior Hong Kong government adviser Lau Siu-kai on Hong Kong's Cable Television.  The central government's power hasn't been sufficiently respected... they're concerned about this.  The tightly choreographed visit was full of pro-China rhetoric amid a virtually unprecedented security lockdown close to the scene of pro-democracy protests in 2014 that grabbed global headlines with clashes and tear gas rising between waterfront skyscrapers. Xi did not make contact with the people in the street or with any pro-democracy voices, forgoing an opportunity to lower the political heat through a softer, more nuanced approach.  The hardening stance of the democrats and Beijing could perhaps widen, spawning greater radicalism, though some activists also concede a spreading disillusionment has sapped momentum among the democracy movement since Xi came to power. Under the mini-constitution, the Basic Law, Hong Kong is guaranteed wide-ranging autonomy for  at least 50 years  after 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula praised by Xi. It also specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal. Pro-democracy protesters carry a banner which reads  One Country, Two Systems, a cheating for twenty years. Recapture Hong Kong with democracy and self-determination , during a demonstration on the 20th anniversary of the territory's handover from Britain to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China July 1, 2017.Bobby YipBut Beijing's refusal to grant full democracy triggered the nearly three months of street protests in 2014 that posed one of the greatest populist challenges to Beijing in decades.  Most Urgent  Protest in Years In the afternoon, tens of thousands gathered in sweltering heat in a sprawling park named after Britain's Queen Victoria, demanding Xi allow universal suffrage. Organizers put the figure at more than 60,000.   Xi shouldn't be interfering in Hong Kong too much,  Peter Lau, a 20-year-old university student, said.  Despite him visiting garrisons and muscle-flexing, Hong Kong people's confidence will never be shaken. Especially for our generation. We should ... fight for our freedom.   Slideshow (22 Images)Some demonstrators marched with yellow umbrellas, a symbol of democratic activism in the city, and held banners denouncing China's Communist  one party rule . Others criticized China's Foreign Ministry which on Friday said the  Joint Declaration  with Britain over Hong Kong, a treaty laying the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997,  no longer has any practical significance . At the end of the rally a simple white banner read:  Cry in grief for 20 years.  [For a link to Reuters handover stories, reut.rs/2sje26J] Xi in the morning addressed a packed hall of mostly pro-Beijing establishment figures, after swearing in Hong Kong's first female leader, Carrie Lam, who was strongly backed by China. Xi hinted that the central government was in favor of Hong Kong introducing  national security  legislation, a controversial issue that brought nearly half a million people to the streets in protest in 2003 and ultimately forced former leader Tung Chee-hwa to step down.  A small group of pro-democracy activists near the venue were roughed up by a group of men who smashed up some props in ugly scuffles. Nine democracy protesters, including student leader Joshua Wong and lawmaker  long hair  Leung Kwok-hung, were bundled into police vans while several pro-China groups remained, cheering loudly and waving red China flags. The activists, in a later statement, said the assailants had been  pro-Beijing triad members .

{"content":"STRASBOURG, France, July 1 (Reuters) - Leaders from the United States, Russia and across Europe paid tribute to Helmut Kohl as the architect of German reunification and a driving force for European integration on Saturday. The former German Chancellor, who died on June 16 at 87, was remembered at a memorial ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by ex U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and others.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial, in a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France symbolised the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skilfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.  Afterwards, Kohl's casket was flown by helicopter across the Rhine to his hometown of Ludwigshafen, where his body was later carried in procession before being transported by riverboat to his final place of rest in Speyer. The resting place of many rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, itself a Europe-spanning polity, Speyer Cathedral was seen by Kohl as a symbol of European unity -- a place he showed to contemporary leaders including Gorbachev and Britain's Margaret Thatcher.  Helmut Kohl was a German patriot and a European patriot,  said Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister and close friend of Kohl who switched between German and French in his tribute.  We've lost a giant of the post-war era.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, who served as a minister under Kohl in the 1990s but later had a falling out over his role in receiving $1 million in illegal campaign cash donations, remembered Kohl as an at-times controversial figure with numerous enemies.  I could tell you stories as well,  she said.  But all that paled in comparison to his life's achievements.  Merkel said Kohl had changed the lives of millions across all of Europe.  The lives of millions of people would have been a lot different without Helmut Kohl -- including my own life,  the former East German said.  Dear Helmut Kohl, thanks to you I'm standing here today. Thanks for the chance that you made possible for me and many others.  The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union. The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him. His sons, however, will boycott the Cathedral's funeral mass, since their father will not be laid to rest alongside Hannelore Kohl, his wife of decades.

{"content":"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko reacted angrily to a question about doping on Saturday and sarcastically offered to perform a Russian dance if the media stopped asking him about the topic. Meanwhile, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, sitting alongside Mutko at a Confederations Cup press conference, said Russian players were regularly tested in international competition and results always came up negative. A report by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren last year said more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and paralympic sport were involved in or benefited from an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive doping tests. The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said that soccer was among more than 30 sports involved. The scheme included switching and changing samples by opening  tamper-proof  bottles -- using a method devised by the Russian secret service -- and numerous other methods to bypass and cover up drugs tests.  In an answer which lasted nearly nine minutes, Mutko, who is also head of the Russian Football Union (RFU), repeated previous denials concerning alleged doping in Russian football.  If I perform a Russia dance here in front of you, will you stop asking?  he said, speaking through a translator.  I don't know how to react to this,  added Mutko, whose country will host next year's World Cup.

Slideshow (3 Images)Infantino said that all Russian players at the last World Cup were tested by FIFA and that the results were negative. He added that the same applied to last year's Euro 2016 tournament in France, where European body UEFA conducted the tests, and to international club competitions.  These tests are not done in Russia,  he said.  It's all done outside Russia in WADA-accredited laboratories and they have given negative results.  These are the facts that need to be remembered.

{"content":"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - FIFA President Gianni Infantino signaled that he is in favor of introducing video assistant referees (VAR) at next year's World Cup following its success at the Confederations Cup, although he conceded the system needs to be improved.  Nothing is standing in the way of using VAR (at the World Cup), as far as I'm concerned,  Infantino told a news conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg on the eve of the Confederations Cup final.  So far it has been successful. We are learning, we are improving, we are continuing the tests.  VAR involves two video assistant referees watching the on-pitch action remotely and then drawing the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes. FIFA said the system corrected six game-changing decisions during the Confederations Cup.   Without the VARs, we would have had a different tournament,  Infantino said.  And a tournament which would have been a little less fair.  But Infantino, who said that the system had been tested so far in 74 matches, added that certain aspects needed to be refined.

FIFA President, Gianni Infantino and FIFA’s Chairman of the Referees Committee, Pierluigi Collina during the press conferenceMaxim Shemetov We need to work still on some of the details, on the communication and the speed of the decisions being taken,  he said.  The time needed to make decisions has been criticized. There has also been debate about which circumstances it should be used for as some close calls are decided without consulting the VARs. The use of the system has caused controversy at times, such as during Germany's 3-1 group stage win against Cameroon when referee Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player. Slideshow (7 Images)Chile were denied a legitimate-looking goal after video review in their 2-0 win against Cameroon on June 18, and it was again used at the end of the same match to overturn a linesman's offside call and award Chile a goal. Former World Cup final referee Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of FIFA's referees committee, said on Saturday that the system was a  very positive tool  to help referees make the right calls and took pressure off them.   We are in a sort of work in progress,  Collina told reporters.  We see the very positive result we had but we are aware that we can improve. This is normal.  Soccer's law-making body IFAB is expected to decide next March whether to allow video assistant referees to become part of the game on a permanent basis.

The Seafrontier tanker had 27 crew members and 40,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons on board at the time of the accident at 0100 GMT in British waters. The Huayan Endeavour was not loaded but was carrying a crew of 22, officials said.  There are no injuries to report on either vessel. The Seafrontier is currently drifting but monitored and the Huayan Endeavour has indicated it can still navigate,  the French maritime authorities said in a statement. The Channel between Britain and France is one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world with about 500 vessels passing through per day.

{"content":"SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian security forces shot dead a top Islamist militant who was accused of killing six police officers during a seven-hour gun battle in the disputed Kashmir region on Saturday, police and army officials said. Bashir Ahmad, alias Bashir Lashkari, was on India's most-wanted list and had a one million rupee (about $15,500)-bounty on his head. Ahmad killed six police officers in an ambush in the southern Anantnag district last month, the officials said. Another militant, who police named as Azad Malik, was also killed during Saturday's joint army and police operation in Dailigam village, part of Anantnag. Two civilians were also killed in the clash and 17 others, who had been trapped inside a house with the militants, were rescued, a police spokesman said.  Lieutenant Colonel Rajesh Kalia, an army spokesman based in Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar, said the two dead militants belonged to the Islamist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). India accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants, and helping them infiltrate across the de facto border, called the Line of Control, dividing Kashmir. Pakistan denies those allegations. The South Asian rivals fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.

{"content":"The Colorado Rockies look to put together a winning streak after ending a lengthy slide when they visit the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game set. Colorado concluded a roller-coaster month of June with a 6-3 triumph in the series opener on Friday, ending an eight-game skid that included the first six contests of its nine-game road trip. Raimel Tapia went 2-for-4 with his first career homer and two RBIs while Mark Reynolds pulled even with Nolan Arenado for the team lead by driving in his 61st run of the season. The Rockies could have DJ LeMahieu (groin) back in the lineup as the second baseman took batting practice on Friday. Arizona, which took two of three in Colorado last week, fell to 4-4 on its 10-game homestand as it suffered its third consecutive defeat. Chris Owings is coming off his second two-homer performance of the season while Jake Lamb registered his 65th RBI on Friday to pull within one of teammate Paul Goldschmidt for the major-league lead.

The 27-year-old Californian allowed only two runs over six frames in his previous outing after yielding just one in each of the prior three turns, winning twice. Chatwood improved to 5-2 with a 3.94 ERA in nine career appearances (eight starts) against Arizona on May 7 after permitting one run and two hits over seven innings. Greinke owns a perfect 7-0 record at home after defeating Philadelphia on Monday, when he allowed one run and three hits in five innings. The 33-year-old Floridian matched his season high in the outing with three walks but kept the damage to a minimum after surrendering a total of nine runs - four earned - over 13 frames in his previous two turns including one at Colorado on June 20. Greinke is 1-1 with a 3.98 ERA in three starts against the Rockies this season and 8-5 with one shutout and a 4.08 ERA in 23 career games (22 starts) versus Colorado. Walk-Offs 1. The Rockies welcomed back batterymates RHP Jon Gray and C Ryan Hanigan on Friday, with the former striking out 10 while allowing two runs in six innings of a victory following a stint on the disabled list due to a foot injury and the latter going 1-for-3 with an RBI after being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque. 2.

Vogt, an All-Star behind the plate for Oakland in 2015 and 2016, was designated for assignment last week after batting .217 in 54 games with the Athletics. The Brewers claimed the 32-year-old, who made his home debut with the club a memorable one with two homers and three RBIs in Friday's 3-2 win. The two blasts give Milwaukee a National League-leading 123 home runs and helped it open a two-game lead in the NL Central. The Marlins have lost three in a row for the first time since the middle of May and will be activating Tom Koehler - who has struggled mightily against the Brewers - for Saturday's start.

The 31-year-old made three rehab starts in the minors, including a solid outing for Triple-A New Orleans last Saturday in which he allowed a run and two hits in 6 1/3 innings. He has been rocked for 30 runs in 26 2/3 frames in his career against Milwaukee and has a 13.11 ERA over three starts at Miller Park.

The Red Sox will try to ride their pitching staff to another series win when they visit the Toronto Blue Jays for the second of a three-game series on Saturday. Boston's strength is in the bullpen this season, and the relief corps came through with five scoreless innings to close out Friday's series opener and give the offense enough time to come through for a 7-4 win in 11 innings. The Red Sox entered the series with the third-best bullpen ERA in the majors at 2.92 and continues to be led by closer Craig Kimbrel, who struck out one in a perfect 11th inning on Friday to increase his American League-leading save total to 23.

Holland spent eight seasons with the Rangers before signing with the White Sox during the offseason. Holland, who was a 16-game winner for Texas in 2011 and notched double-digit victory totals three times for the Rangers, admits it will be an interesting time pitching against familiar faces.  It's definitely going to be weird,  Holland told reporters.  Seeing all those guys, it's going to be hard to keep a straight face.  The White Sox rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, which was capped by Melky Cabrera's walkoff two-run double, to post an 8-7 victory in the opener for their second straight win after losing eight of their previous 10 contests.

{"content":"The New York Mets can secure their third straight series victory when they host the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday in the continuation of a three-game set. After finishing a 10-game road trip with five wins in their final six contests, the Mets rode a seven-inning gem by Jacob deGrom to a 2-1 triumph over the Phillies to begin the series Friday. DeGrom struck out 12 and teamed with three relievers to hold the top five hitters in Philadelphia's lineup to a combined 0-for-19. Curtis Granderson's run-scoring single got the scoring started for New York and the veteran outfielder is hitting .378 during a nine-game hitting streak. The Phillies are 3-4 on their current nine-game road trip, although two of the losses have come by one run. Zack Wheeler (biceps) will come off the disabled list to make the start for New York opposite Philadelphia veteran Jeremy Hellickson.

The 30-year-old Iowa native, who is 0-4 over his last seven starts, has lasted exactly six frames in four consecutive road outings. Hellickson has yet to face the Mets this year but struggled against them in 2016, giving up 21 runs in 24 1/3 innings spread over five starts (1-3). Wheeler was on an impressive roll before he gave up 15 runs in only 3 2/3 innings over two starts and was promptly placed on the disabled list in mid-June. He was 1-0 with a 3.38 ERA in two outings against the Phillies in April and is 3-1 with a 3.07 mark in seven career starts versus the division rivals. The 27-year-old owns a 4.81 ERA in his career at Citi Field and that number balloons to 5.91 in 2017. Walk-Offs 1. The Mets finished June with 50 home runs, the most the team has ever hit in any month. 2. Phillies RHP Pat Neshek worked a scoreless frame Friday to reduce his ERA through 31 2/3 innings to 0.57. 3.

Los Angeles belted three home runs, including two by Austin Barnes, in Friday's 10-4 romp to finish June with 53 - a franchise record for most blasts in a single month. Barnes launched his first career grand slam in the first inning and added a three-run shot in the sixth for a personal-best seven RBIs as the Dodgers improved to 10-2 on a stretch during which they play 20 consecutive contests in California. San Diego's quest to win three straight series for the first time this season took a hit as it managed only six hits while falling to 4-3 on its nine-game homestand.

The 37-year-old native of Boston made his season debut against San Diego on April 5, recording a victory after allowing just one run and two hits in five frames. With the triumph, Hill improved to 2-3 with a 4.97 ERA in five career starts versus the Padres. Overton will be making his debut for San Diego after being claimed off waivers from Seattle on June 19. The 25-year-old native of Oklahoma made one start and eight relief appearances for the Mariners this season, surrendering 15 runs - 13 earned - over 18 1/3 innings as opponents batted .280 against him.

The Giants aim to match their season high with a fifth consecutive victory when they play the second contest of their three-game road series against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday. The Giants collected a season-best 18 hits and matched their highest run total of the campaign in a 13-5 rout in Friday’s series opener. San Francisco has scored 31 runs during its four-game winning streak. Pittsburgh is 6-5 over its last 11 contests and remains within five games of Milwaukee in the National League Central despite sitting six games below .500.

{"content":"One of the most puzzling trends of the 2017 season has been the Chicago Cubs’ struggling offense. The defending World Series champions hope to bounce back from their seventh shutout of the season when they play the second of a three-game road series against the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday. The Reds blanked the Cubs 5-0 in Friday’s opener, snapping Chicago’s streak of 15 straight games at Great American Ball Park with at least one home run. The seven shutouts are one more than the Cubs endured all of last season, and they recorded just three hits Friday – their major league-high 10th game with three or fewer. It hasn’t helped that starters Jason Heyward and Ben Zobrist are on the disabled list, and reigning National League MVP Kris Bryant has missed the past two games with a sprained ankle. The Reds kept slugging in the opener, as Adam Duvall belted his 19th home run, which ranks in the top 10 in the NL but third on the team behind Joey Votto (23) and Scott Schebler (20).

{"content":"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko reacted angrily to a question about doping on Saturday and sarcastically offered to perform a Russian dance if the media stopped asking him about the topic. Meanwhile, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, sitting alongside Mutko at a Confederations Cup press conference, said Russian players were regularly tested in international competition and results always came up negative. A report by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren last year said more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and paralympic sport were involved in or benefited from an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive doping tests. The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said that soccer was among more than 30 sports involved. The scheme included switching and changing samples by opening  tamper-proof  bottles -- using a method devised by the Russian secret service -- and numerous other methods to bypass and cover up drugs tests.  In an answer which lasted nearly nine minutes, Mutko, who is also head of the Russian Football Union (RFU), repeated previous denials concerning alleged doping in Russian football.  If I perform a Russia dance here in front of you, will you stop asking?  he said, speaking through a translator.  I don't know how to react to this,  added Mutko, whose country will host next year's World Cup.  We are investing a lot of money into sports and we don't need doping to win a bronze medal that doesn't mean much.

FIFA has said that it was still investigating the allegation that footballers were among the 1,000-plus athletes mentioned in the McLaren report.    Infantino said he did not know how long this would take, adding that there were  a few facts, the rest is all speculation . Slideshow (3 Images)Infantino said that all Russian players at the last World Cup were tested by FIFA and that the results were negative. He added that the same applied to last year's Euro 2016 tournament in France, where European body UEFA conducted the tests, and to international club competitions.  These tests are not done in Russia,  he said.  It's all done outside Russia in WADA-accredited laboratories and they have given negative results.  These are the facts that need to be remembered.

{"content":"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - FIFA President Gianni Infantino signaled that he is in favor of introducing video assistant referees (VAR) at next year's World Cup following its success at the Confederations Cup, although he conceded the system needs to be improved.  Nothing is standing in the way of using VAR (at the World Cup), as far as I'm concerned,  Infantino told a news conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg on the eve of the Confederations Cup final.  So far it has been successful. We are learning, we are improving, we are continuing the tests.  VAR involves two video assistant referees watching the on-pitch action remotely and then drawing the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes. FIFA said the system corrected six game-changing decisions during the Confederations Cup.   Without the VARs, we would have had a different tournament,  Infantino said.  And a tournament which would have been a little less fair.  But Infantino, who said that the system had been tested so far in 74 matches, added that certain aspects needed to be refined.

The time needed to make decisions has been criticized. There has also been debate about which circumstances it should be used for as some close calls are decided without consulting the VARs. The use of the system has caused controversy at times, such as during Germany's 3-1 group stage win against Cameroon when referee Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player.

{"content":"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Saturday that Russian security services were involved in a recent cyber attack on the country, with the aim of destroying important data and spreading panic.  The SBU, Ukraine's state security service, said the attack, which started in Ukraine and spread around the world on Tuesday, was by the same hackers who attacked the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016. Ukrainian politicians were quick to blame Russia for Tuesday's attack, but a Kremlin spokesman dismissed  unfounded blanket accusations . Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts, which conked out computers, hit banks, disrupted shipping and shut down a chocolate factory in Australia. The attack also hit major Russian firms, leading some cyber security researchers to suggest that Moscow was not behind it. The malicious code in the virus encrypted data on computers, and demanded victims pay a $300 ransom, similar to the extortion tactic used in a global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. But Ukrainian officials and some security experts say the ransomware feature was likely a smokescreen. Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people. Hacking Ukrainian state institutions is part of what Ukraine says is a  hybrid war  by Russia on Kiev. Russia denies sending troops or military equipment to eastern Ukraine.    The available data, including those obtained in cooperation with international antivirus companies, give us reason to believe that the same hacking groups are involved in the attacks, which in December 2016 attacked the financial system, transport and energy facilities of Ukraine using TeleBots and BlackEnergy,  the SBU said.   This testifies to the involvement of the special services of Russian Federation in this attack.  FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken on March 1,  2017.Kacper Pempel/IllustrationThe SBU in an earlier statement on Friday said it had seized equipment it said belonged to Russian agents in May and June to launch cyber attacks against Ukraine and other countries. Referencing the $300 ransomware demand, the SBU said  the virus is cover for a large-scale attack on Ukraine. This is evidenced by a lack of a real mechanism for taking possession of the funds ... enrichment was not the aim of the attack.    The main purpose of the virus was the destruction of important data, disrupting the work of public and private institutions in Ukraine and spreading panic among the people.   A cyber attack in December on a Ukrainian state energy computer caused a power cut in the northern part of the capital Kiev. The Russian foreign ministry and Federal Security Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest allegations. Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) was one of the first companies to reveal it had been compromised by the virus and sources told Reuters on Thursday computers at state gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) had also been infected. The SBU's accusations chime with some of the findings of the cyber security firm ESET in Slovakia, which said in research published online on Friday that the Telebots group -- which has links to BlackEnergy -- was behind the attack.  Collecting ransom money was never the top priority for the TeleBots group,  it said, suggesting Ukraine was the target but the virus spread globally as  affected companies in other countries had VPN connections to their branches, or to business partners, in Ukraine.   The TeleBots group continues to evolve in order to conduct disruptive attacks against Ukraine,  it said.    Prior to the outbreak, the Telebots group targeted mainly the financial sector. The latest outbreak was directed against businesses in Ukraine, but they apparently underestimated the malware' spreading capabilities. That's why the malware went out of control.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called for a determined response to North Korea after talks with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in on Friday where he stressed the importance of their alliance but took aim at Seoul over trade and sharing the cost of defense. Trump said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and reiterated that an era of  strategic patience  over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended.  Together we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea,  Trump said as he stood alongside Moon in the White House Rose Garden.  The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response.  Despite the tough rhetoric, it remains unclear how Trump will find a way forward on North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned the consequences of any military solution would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale.  Trump had pinned his hopes on persuading China, North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner, to do more to rein in Pyongyang, although he has lately grown frustrated that Beijing has not taken stronger action.  Trump called on regional powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea  choose a better path and do it quickly.  Moon, who warned of a  stern response  to any provocations, urged Pyongyang to return promptly to talks.  Our two leaders will employ both sanctions and dialogue in a phased and comprehensive approach,  Moon said of South Korea and the United States. Trump and Moon have said they are open to renewed dialogue with North Korea but only under circumstances that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its weapons programs. Moon told an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank that moves by North Korea that could create conditions for dialogue could include a freeze on its nuclear and missile tests, or the release of three Americans it is holding in the country. To be successful, talks would have to involve North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and have as their ultimate aim the complete dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program, he added.    Trump sought to woo China since a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April but the honeymoon period appears to be over. On Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan - decisions that angered Beijing. Steel and Autos U.S. President Donald Trump  (R) greets South Korean President Moon Jae-in prior to delivering a joint statement from the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 30, 2017.Jim BourgSouth Korea is a long-standing American ally but Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances and threatened to tear up the bilateral trade pact.  We will do more to remove barriers to reciprocal trade and market access,  Trump said, adding that the two leaders had talked about the thorny trade areas of steel and autos. Trump said he was encouraged by Moon's assurances that he would seek a level playing field for American workers and businesses, particularly automakers. A joint statement said the two sides had agreed to work together to reduce over supply of basic materials such as steel and non-tariff barriers. It also said Trump had accepted an invitation from Moon to visit South Korea this year.  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was unwise for Trump to air the trade issue so publicly. Slideshow (8 Images) Public complaints by Trump about unfair trade and inadequate defense spending provide opportunities for China and North Korea to drive a wedge between the allies,  she said. Trump also emphasized the need to ensure equitable sharing of costs for defense, returning to a theme he raised during his campaign and brought up with other allies, including NATO countries and Japan. A senior U.S. official said in a briefing before the president's meeting with Moon that South Korea was in many respects a  model ally,  given its spending of 2.7 percent of GDP on defense and Moon's plan to grow capabilities.  We shouldn't view South Korea as somehow laggard on that front,  the official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the U.S.-Korea free trade pact known as KORUS took effect in 2012. The agreement was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year, but in 2016 they were $3 billion lower than in 2011. At the start of Friday's talks, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the largest component of the deficit was automotive trade and many non-tariff barriers to U.S. auto exports to South Korea remained.  I think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad imports side,  he said. Ross said later on Friday that some progress had been made in the talks. The current pact was agreed to despite protests by supporters of Moon, who was then in opposition. But analysts have suggested that given the need to preserve a unified front in the face of a hostile North Korea, there could be compromise on both sides to resolve issues.

{"content":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Some of India's biggest automakers and retailers announced price cuts on Saturday as Asia's third-largest economy switched to a new nationwide sales tax at the stroke of midnight, replacing a host of provincial and national levies. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), India's biggest tax reform in the 70 years since independence from British colonial rule, unifies the $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into one of the world's biggest common markets. Maruti Suzuki Ltd (MRTI.NS), India's biggest carmaker by sales, dropped prices on some models by up to 3 percent, passing the  entire benefit of GST rates  to customers. Maruti, however, said prices of two mild hybrid models had increased under the GST regime, following withdrawal of tax concessions.  Tata Motors' luxury British arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has reduced prices for all cars manufactured in India by up to 7 percent, a spokeswoman for the company told Reuters. Hypermarket Big Bazaar, owned by Future Retail Ltd (FRTL.NS), announced discounts of 2 percent to 22 percent on groceries and household supplies across its stores in 26 states. Fashion portal Myntra, part of India's biggest online retailer Flipkart, was also offering GST discounts.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is making Brexit minister David Davis's job of delivering Brexit harder because of her  absolutist  approach, according to his chief of staff who resigned last month. James Chapman told the BBC that said May's insistence that the European Court of Justice must not have any oversight once Britain leaves the European Union, outlined in a party conference speech last year, has made the job harder.  She's taken some absolutist positions on particular issues. I'm thinking of the European Court of Justice,  Chapman said.  There have been red lines that have been set for him that make the job he has to do very difficult.  Although Chapman praised Davis as a  tough, resilient operator  he said the position on the ECJ had left Britain  hamstrung  in the talks.

{"content":"Tempers flare as surging Dodgers blitz Padres SAN DIEGO -- Austin Barnes had the game of his career Friday night at Petco Park and no one will remember it. Barnes hit a grand slam in the first and a three-run homer in the sixth as the Los Angeles Dodgers routed the San Diego Padres 10-4 to finish the greatest June in franchise history. But the memory everyone will take from this game is the sight of the two managers -- Dave Roberts of the Dodgers and Andy Green of the Padres -- charging each other to trigger a benches-clearing face-off between the first and second innings. Both were ejected, although no players were. And it all apparently started with Dodgers starting pitcher Alex Wood making a verbal threat to San Diego's Jose Pirela, who doesn't understand enough English to know what Wood said.  They were threatening to hit my guy for stealing signs,  said Green.  You don't threaten another player. Wood stood on the mound and made an outright threat to Pirela.  That got Green's blood boiling. Wood's threats led plate umpire Greg Gibson to warn both teams. And after the end of the first, Gibson summoned both managers to cool the situation. It backfired. Green had some choice things to say about Wood. Roberts responded in defense of his pitcher and it was game on. The two managers actually tried to get at each other. As the discussion grew more heated, Roberts said something to Green as the Padres manager was being led away by another member of the umpiring crew. Green responded and Roberts charged him, bumping into the San Diego manager and the umpire as players from both teams rushed the field, separated the managers and stood face-to-face between home plate and the Padres dugout. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at PadresLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch I probably could have handled it differently,  said Roberts, who was raised in San Diego County and was both a player and a coach with the Padres and actually sought the managerial job before Green was hired -- and he was subsequently hired by the Dodgers.  I probably got too emotional. I didn't appreciate what Green said about my player.   Dave probably reacted to the last comment I made,  said Green, who thought the threat by Wood demanded a stronger response from the umpiring crew. But the bottom line was that Pirela had no idea he was being threatened by Wood. The 27-year-old Venezuelan speaks minimal English. He spoke Friday night through an interpreter.  I didn't know what he said,  said Pirela, who was on second with a leadoff double in the bottom of the first.  I wasn't stealing signs.  Actually, Wood was accusing Pirela of signaling pitch location to his teammates.  At first, I thought he might be mad at himself for giving up a double,  said Pirela.  I didn't understand what he was saying.  Asked if he was stealing signs, Pirela replied  No.  But second base umpire D.J. Reyburn heard the threat. And Wood repeated the threat to Gibson when the plate umpire went to the mound to change balls.  Right then, my hands are tied,  said Gibson, who then issued the warning.  The managers wanted to discuss it right then. I'm not going to discuss it then. I wanted to get the game moving. Maybe everybody forgets about it.  But at the end of the first, both managers simultaneously approached Gibson.  It was a strange situation,  said Gibson.  I've never been a part of anything like this. For about the first 30 seconds, it was a civil conversation. Then it was between those two. Green took exception to his team being warned. And then Andy said something to Dave and it escalated from there. Roberts was aggressive and went after Andy.  No players were ejected. On the field, the Dodgers scored seven runs off Clayton Richard in 4 1/3 innings while Wood ran his record to 9-0 -- becoming the first Dodger pitcher to start a season 9-0 since Rick Rhoden in 1976. The win gave the National League West-leading Dodgers a 21-7 record in June. The 21 wins tied a franchise record for June -- with the 1952 and 1954 Brooklyn Dodgers and 1973 Los Angeles edition -- and the .750 winning percentage is a franchise record for June. The win also continued the Dodgers' domination of their Southern California division rivals. The Dodgers are 6-1 against the Padres this season and 31-14 against San Diego since the start of the 2015 season. The game was essentially over after six hitters. Richard retired the first two hitters he faced before Justin Turner singled. Richard then walked Cody Bellinger and Logan Forsythe before Barnes drove a fastball 387 feet into the left field stands for the first grand slam of his career. It was the first of three homers hit by the Dodgers. Turner hit a 403-foot, two-run homer off Richard in the fourth to make it 6-0. And Barnes drove in three runs with his second homer, a 414-foot drive off reliever Jose Valdez, in the sixth to make it 10-1. Richard gave up seven runs on nine hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings. The left-handed Wood, meanwhile, allowed one run on two hits and three walks over six innings.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Stephen Curry has agreed to a record five-year, $201 million 'super-max' deal to stay at the Golden State Warriors, according to several reports on Friday.     The deal came immediately after the NBA's free agency period began and was done under the league's designated veteran player extension.     Under the new designation, which was added to the current collective bargaining agreement, Curry was eligible for the lucrative deal since he won at least one MVP award in the last three seasons.     The 29-year-old has claimed the MVP honor in two of the last three seasons while helping the Warriors to two NBA titles.     The reports said the Warriors paid Curry $12.1 million last season in the final season of a four-year deal worth approximately $44 million signed after the 2012-13 season.

{"content":"SEATTLE (Reuters) - The governors of Washington state and Alaska signed into law new operating budgets late on Friday, hours before deadlines that would have triggered a partial shutdown of government agencies. In Washington state, the $43.7 billion two-year operating budget, which includes a $5.2 billion revenue increase paid for in part with new taxes, was approved by both chambers of the legislature earlier on Friday. Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed the spending bill before midnight, preventing the closure of many state agencies and the layoff of thousands of employees. He called the budget  a transformational investment in the future of our state  in a message on Twitter.  Apart from funding government operations, the budget adds about $1.8 billion in new funding for K-12 public schools over the next two years and promises $7.3 billion total over four years, according to a summary of the legislation.  It was not immediately clear whether the education funding increase would satisfy a 2012 order by the state's Supreme Court that found the state was failing to fully fund basic education in violation of its own constitution. The court gave lawmakers a deadline - the first day of school in 2018 - to lay out a credible plan to fix the problem. The spending legislation was approved in the Senate 39-10 and in the House 70-23, according to the office of Senator Mike Padden, a Republican.  For specifics of the budget see: bit.ly/2taF0Li Also on Friday, Alaska Governor Bill Walker signed into law a new $4.9 billion operating budget for fiscal year 2018, avoiding a similar shutdown of government offices and services, his office said. Lawmakers in Juneau agreed to pay down a $2.5 billion deficit entirely from savings, while also cutting spending on operations by $145 million from the previous fiscal year, Walker's office said. The Legislature has been convening through special sessions to find a fix for the multi-billion dollar deficit before July 1, the start of Alaska's new fiscal year, in order to avoid shuttering government offices and services.

{"content":"Foltynewicz flirts with no-hitter in Braves' 3-1 win over A's OAKLAND, Calif. -- Atlanta Braves right-hander Mike Foltynewicz came within three outs of pitching the first no-hitter of his life -- at any level -- on Friday night at Oakland Coliseum. But after giving up a leadoff homer to rookie Matt Olson in the bottom of the ninth inning, Foltynewicz still savored a 3-1 victory, not the mention the standing ovation he received from a large contingent of fans behind the Braves' dugout as he walked off the field.  It was a very cool feeling,  Foltynewicz said.  It's something I'll never forget.  Foltynewicz (6-5) struck out eight, walked four and threw a career-high 119 pitches in eight innings, giving up one run and one hit. He extended his winning streak to three games. Entering the game, Foltynewicz hadn't pitched more than seven innings in an outing this season. He matched his career high of eight innings set May 14, 2016, in a 5-0 victory at Kauffman Stadium. Olson hit a 3-2 fastball high and deep into the right field seats, ending Foltynewicz's no-hit bid and his night. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at AthleticsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch He fouled off some good pitches,  Foltynewicz said.  I threw some good pitches. At the end of the day, it's 3-2 and I got to come at you with the fastball and he's ready for it.  The fourth time through the lineup it gets a little tougher. They start seeing you a little better. You just got to tip your hat to him. He put the bat on the ball and he put it out of the park.  Olson's homer was his fourth of the season.  I was just trying to have a good at-bat, the way he was throwing against us,  said Olson, a native of Atlanta.  Hitting a home run to break up the no-hitter was just the cherry on top. I was seeing him fairly well all night and just missing. He had a lot of life on his fastball.  Jed Lowrie greeted former A's reliever Jim Johnson with a double to left, but Johnson struck out the next three batters he faced for his 17th save of the season. A's right-hander Sonny Gray (3-4) allowed one run and two hits in a season-high eight innings. He struck out four, walked one and threw 98 pitches.  He's been consistent with his stuff,  A's managers Bob Melvin said of Gray.  Finally got results tonight. We just didn't score any runs for him.  The Braves grabbed a 1-0 lead in the third on doubles by Johan Camargo and Dansby Swanson. They extended their lead to 3-0 in the ninth, scoring twice off reliever Sean Doolittle. Swanson worked a leadoff walk and Ender Inciarte bunted into a forceout, but he stole second and scored on Brandon Phillips' single to right. Phillips took second on the throw home and scored from third on Matt Kemp's one-out single. Foltynewicz retired the first 12 batters he faced in order before issuing a leadoff walk to Khris Davis in the fifth. He retired the next three A's hitters in order, including Rajai Davis on a line drive to left fielder Danny Santana, who made a nice play, going back on the ball.  Off the bat I was like, 'That's a double, maybe even a triple,' and then he got there,  Braves catcher Tyler Flowers said of Santana.  He covers a lot of darn ground out there.  Foltynewicz issued two walks in the sixth but also struck out two, and the A's didn't get a runner past second base. Foltynewicz kept the A's off-balance with a mixture of mid-to-high 90s heat and sharp breaking balls.  Been through a lot with that kid the past couple of years,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  This is really cool to watch him grow up. Just proud of him.  NOTES: A's RHP Paul Blackburn will be called up from Triple-A Nashville on Saturday and start against Atlanta in his major-league debut.

{"content":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A leader of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim organization has called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand risks ruining the  religious and cultured  core of the Southeast Asian nation. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But police raids on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community have risen in the world's most populous Muslim country. Anwar Abbas of Muhammadiyah, an organization that has around 30 million members, said the government should revoke Starbucks' operating license as the company's support for the LGBT community is  not in line  with the nation's ideology.  If Starbucks only does business, then fine. But don't bring ideology here,  Abbas told Reuters by phone on Saturday.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain, is a legal entity that  always obeys the prevailing regulations and appreciates the cultural values in Indonesia , an executive at its parent company said.  We also value the religious background of our customers and employees,  Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa Tbk, said in a text message. Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and pluralism is already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was sentenced in May to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. Asked why he had taken a stand against Starbucks, Abbas  said he was informed in a chat group about a pro-LGBT comment made by the company's senior executive, Howard Schultz. Schultz is now chairman of Starbucks after stepping down from his previous role as chief executive. Forbes reported that when a Starbucks shareholder complained in 2013 that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage, Schultz said it embraces diversity and that  not every decision is an economic decision . (bit.ly/2swGTQB)  If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company,  Schultz was reported as saying at that time. A video of the comment was also posted on YouTube. Starbucks customer Annisa Meidiana, who is a Muslim, said she would not stop buying coffee there because of the call for the boycott.  Islam condemns LGBT. It's a sin,  the 22-year-old university student said outside Jakarta.  But it doesn't matter to me. For me, being an LGBT is a human right.

{"content":"Gray returns to help Rockies past Diamondbacks PHOENIX -- Jon Gray is in and the Colorado Rockies' eight-game losing streak is out. Gray, coming back from a foot injury suffered in April, pitched the Rockies to one of their season's most important wins Friday night he pitched six solid innings in a 6-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Our guys are calm,  Colorado manager Bud Black said.  Even through this last week.  We just haven't hit enough. We haven't pitched well enough. We've had a couple games where we've been in position to win and we didn't late. But don't worry about our players and their resolve and what they're all about.  Gray (1-0) was the key. The Rockies' Opening Day starter hadn't taken the mound since April 13 at San Francisco, where he suffered a broken bone in his left foot. He allowed two runs and seven hits. He struck out 10 and walked one.  What I saw today was a repeatable delivery that he maintained, which is great,  Black said. Gray said he tried to slow the game down.  I knew it would be a little awkward coming back into a big-league situation. I just wanted to make the game as slow as possible and make pitches.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DiamondbacksArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchGray also said he's ready to be counted on as the team's No. 1 starter.  I think so. I think I've taken another step in my career recently. And I just want to go out there and be a pitcher and make pitches and get outs. I'm going to battle.  Charlie Blackmon and Raimel Tapia hit solo homers for the Rockies (48-34). Tapia's home run was the first of his career. His 2-for-4, two-RBI night also included a double.  We think we have a major-league talent,  Black said of Tapia.  We think we have a player.  For the Diamondbacks (50-31), Robbie Ray (8-4) went six innings. He allowed four runs and five hits, striking out nine and walking five while throwing a career-high 122 pitches.  I thought he was able to catch a little wind in the fourth and fifth innings,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of Ray's long outing.  Things really started to come together for him and he gave everything he could  Ray said he was  just missing  the strike zone.  Just barely,  he said.  It was tough. I got behind in counts and paid for it.  Chris Owings hit two solo homers, running his season total to 11, for Arizona. The Diamondbacks now have lost three straight. This is the first time this season they've lost three consecutive games at home. The Rockies' eight-game losing streak started with two blowouts by the Diamondbacks last week in Denver. The Rockies made it 5-2 in the seventh on a triple by Nolan Arenado and a groundout by Mark Reynolds. In the eighth, Colorado added a sixth run when Tapia doubled and eventually scored on a wild pitch by Jorge De La Rosa. Owings hit a solo shot off Mike Dunn in the eighth to cut the lead to 6-3. Greg Holland pitched a scoreless ninth for his 26th save. Blackmon led off the game by lining a home run over the right-field fence. It was Blackmon's third leadoff homer of the season and 25th of his career. The Rockies left the bases loaded when Ray got Tapia to ground out. The Diamondbacks evened the score at 1 in the bottom of the first when Jake Lamb doubled home Gregor Blanco, who singled. The Rockies took a 3-1 lead in the third when a Tapia ground ball drove home Mark Reynolds and Ryan Hanigan singled home Trevor Story. Owings lined his 10th homer into the left-field seats, off Gray in the fourth, to cut the Rockies' lead to 3-2. Tapia hit a solo homer in the sixth off Ray to make it 4-2 Rockies.

{"content":"Cano homers twice, Mariners pummel Angels ANAHEIM, Calif. -- It took all of one swing to take the air out of Angel Stadium and remove any potential drama. Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano hit the first of his two home runs with two runners on base in the fifth inning, turning a two-run lead into a five-run advantage in what eventually became a 10-0 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Cano finished with the two homers, a single and five RBIs to help end Seattle's four-game losing streak. The Mariners had 17 hits in all, getting big games from Ben Gamel (four singles) and Kyle Seager (three singles, home run). Mike Zunino also pitched in with a home run.  It's nice we swung the bats really well tonight,  Seager said.  To get a nice big lead and be able to add on, those games are good for morale.  Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at AngelsLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchIt was more than enough for Mariners starter Ariel Miranda, who allowed two hits in seven scoreless innings. He improved to 4-0 against Los Angeles in five career starts, including a victory earlier this season. Miranda (7-4) struck out four and walked two while making 95 pitches.  My aggressiveness on the first two pitches,  Miranda, speaking through an interpreter, said when asked what was the key for him.  I was more aggressive trying to get ahead in the count and if I didn't get ahead with the first one, I was aggressive with the second one too.  Angels starter Parker Bridwell (2-1) was done in by one bad inning -- the fifth, when the Mariners scored four runs. The big blow was Cano's three-run homer. Bridwell managed to last six innings, giving up five runs, 11 hits and one walk.  Early on, Parker got some pitches in good zones and got out of a little bit of trouble and managed to keep us in the game,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  But he couldn't get the ball into good spots in the fifth.  One thing with Parker, he was pitching ahead in the count in his good games, and tonight he reversed that. He had to work back into counts a lot of those guys swung the bats well.  Cano hit his second homer in the seventh inning, a two-run shot off Angels reliever Yusmeiro Petit. Zunino's one-out home run in the third inning off Bridwell gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead before they broke the game open in the fifth. Jarrod Dyson led off the inning with a double and scored on a double by Jean Segura. After Gamel singled, Cano came up with the big hit, a three-run homer, his 15th home run of the season, that made it 5-0. Meanwhile, Miranda didn't allow a hit until Kole Calhoun led off the fourth inning with a bloop single. But Calhoun was immediately erased when Albert Pujols grounded into a double play. Andrelton Simmons led off the fifth with a double for the Angels' second hit and moved to third on a groundout but was left stranded.  We're turning the page on this one,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. NOTES: The Angels acquired INF/OF Nick Franklin from the Milwaukee Brewers in a trade for a player to be named or cash considerations. Franklin, who is expected to be activated to the roster Saturday, hit .195 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 53 games for Milwaukee this season. ... Angels RHP Brooks Pounders was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake, taking the spot of LHP Jose Alvarez, who was optioned to Salt Lake. Alvarez, who was the only lefty in the bullpen, was 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in a staff-high 40 games. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz went 1-for-5 with a double, extending his homerless streak to 21 games. His last home run came June 4, but his 14 homers trail only 2B Robinson Cano (16) for the team lead. Despite the home run drought, Cruz still ranks second in the American League with 59 RBIs. ... Mariners LF Ben Gamel went 4-for-5, closing out June with a .393 average (42-for-107), second best in the majors for the month and tops in the American League.","keywords":"United States,Albert Pujols,Ariel Miranda,Ben Gamel,Brooks Pounders,Jarrod Dyson,Jean Segura,Jose Alvarez,Kyle Seager,Mike Scioscia,Mike Zunino,Nelson Cruz,Nick Franklin,Parker Bridwell,Robinson Cano,Yusmeiro Petit,BBO,MARINERS,ANGELS,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-01 02:10:00","news_title":"Cano homers twice, Mariners pummel Angels","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED71EBTY3D"}

{"content":"White Sox's three-run ninth sinks Rangers CHICAGO -- Melky Cabrera didn't have time to bother with a video review before celebrating a walk-off hit and victory. Cabrera drove in two runs with a game-ending double just inside the first-base line as the Chicago White Sox rallied with three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the Texas Rangers 8-7 on Friday night. The White Sox's stocky left fielder bounced a 2-1 pitch from closer Matt Bush just inside the bag. The Rangers challenged if the ball was fair, but the call by first-base umpire Adrian Johnson was upheld.  I knew it was a fair ball when the umpire called it fair,  Cabrera said through an interpreter.  I was waiting for him to make that call.  With Texas leading 7-5, Bush gave up singles to Adam Engel, Willy Garcia and Alen Hanson before Cabrera's game-winning hit with one out.  We have confidence in ourselves,  Cabrera said.  We know if we do our best, we will have a very good chance to win the game, and we did.  It was Cabrera's 14th game-winning, walk-off late appearance since 2009. And manager Rick Renteria wasn't surprised Cabrera finished the job.  He's a professional hitter, who in certain situations just kind of seems to rise to the occasion,  Renteria said.  That was just another example of it.  Bush (2-4) blew his fifth save in 15 chances and the Rangers lost their third straight. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at White SoxTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch It wasn't a matter of not having it,  Bush said.  I just struggled throwing my fastball up to put a guy away.  I couldn't locate my heater up in the zone. It sucks. It's terrible. I hate it.  Chicago's Todd Frazier hit two solo homers and Jose Abreu launched one off Austin Bibens-Dirkx. The 32-year-old right-hander pitched into the sixth inning but failed to win his fourth straight decision in his fifth career major-league start. Anthony Swarzak (4-2) struck out the side in the ninth to help the White Sox win their second straight. Rougned Odor hit a two-run homer and Joey Gallo added a solo shot for Texas. Frazier hit his 14th and 15th homers, going deep twice in a game for the eighth time in his career. Abreu's home run was his 14th but the first this season at home.  When he hit it, we were talking about getting the baseball because everybody had been talking about how it was his first one at home,  Renteria said.  Just in general I thought everybody did a nice job of picking each other up and continue to play the game through nine innings.  Bibens-Dirkx went 5 2/3 innings and allowed four runs and eight hits before being replaced by Jose Leclerc. Chicago starter Mike Pelfrey lasted five innings, giving up five runs, eight hits and two walks. Shin-Soo Choo had three hits and drove in two runs with a single in a four-run fourth for the Rangers. Elvis Andrus had an RBI as Texas added two runs in the sixth. Gallo hit his team-leading 21st homer but entered with just a .192 average and an MLB-leading 107 strikeouts. White Sox DH Kevan Smith had three hits and an RBI. Yolmer Sanchez had two hits and drove in a run. The first three Texas hitters reached to load the bases, but Pelfrey wriggled out of the jam with none scoring. Choo and Andrus each singled before Pelfrey hit Nomar Mazara with a pitch. But the 6-foot-7 right-hander struck out Adrian Beltre and Odor grounded into a double play. The White Sox jumped ahead 2-0 in the bottom half on back-to-back solo shots to left field by Abreu and Frazier. It was the sixth time this season that Chicago hitters went deep consecutively. Gallo launched a drive more than 400 feet into the left-center field bleachers on the first pitch of the third to cut it to 2-1. The Rangers scored four runs in the fourth to jump ahead 5-2. Beltre walked to lead off and Odor homered to right. With one out, Jonathan Lucroy and Mike Napoli singled and advanced to second and third on Gallo's groundout. Both runners scored on Choo's single up the middle. Frazier cracked his second homer of the night on a full-count pitch to start the bottom of the fourth and cut it to 5-3. His liner landed in the first row of the left-center bleachers. Andrus' single to left scored Carlos Gomez in the sixth, then Mike Napoli came home on Cabrera's error to make it 7-3. NOTES: Slumping Chicago rookie INF Tim Anderson and rookie INF/DH Matt Davidson got the night off. Anderson entered with just one hit in his last six games (2-for-21) and Davidson was 1-for-20 with 13 strikeouts in his last five games. ... Texas manager Jeff Banister said he was concerned about his team's inability to manufacture runs and over-reliance on the home run. The Rangers entered with an American League-worst .238 team batting average.  Somewhere along the way you've got to hit some multi-point home runs,  Banister said.  Balanced offense, in my opinion, is still the best.

{"content":"MANILA (Reuters) - The United States and Philippine navies held a joint naval patrol on Saturday in dangerous southern Philippine waters, amid rising international concern about Islamist militancy and piracy in the region.      US Navy littoral combat ship USS Coronado joined a Philippine Navy frigate, BRP Alcaraz, in patrolling the Sulu Sea where numerous pirate attacks on commercial shipping have been made since 2015.     “Our at-sea operations with the Philippine Navy demonstrate our commitment to the alliance and deter piracy and illegal activities,” US Rear Admiral Don Gabrielson said in a statement issued by the US embassy in Manila.  There are international fears fighters sympathetic to Islamic State will cross maritime borders between Malaysia and Indonesia to join Muslim rebels who seized Marawi City in the southern Philippines five weeks ago. About 300 militants, 82 security forces and 44 civilians have been killed in the fighting.     The naval patrols were held at the invitation of the Philippine government, the US embassy said.    Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte does not allow joint patrols with the United States in the disputed South China Sea to avoid damaging its relations with China, which claims the sea as its own.     But he welcomes cooperation in the south due to increased militant activity. Two weeks ago, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines held joint naval patrols in southern waters.

{"content":"EditorsNote: updating with standings Mets stifle Phillies behind deGrom NEW YORK -- The New York Mets spent a lot of time before and after Friday's game talking about what they need to do to mount a long-shot playoff run. Their march would get a lot easier if right-hander Jacob deGrom could pitch every day. DeGrom won his fourth straight start Friday night, when he allowed just three hits over seven innings as the Mets edged the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 at Citi Field. The Mets (37-42) have won six of seven -- a stretch that began immediately after they were outscored 36-11 in enduring a four-game sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Dodgers -- to at least regain a pulse in the National League playoff race.  I think we have to be a little bit more optimistic after the last six days than we were coming out of Los Angeles,  Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said Friday afternoon. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MetsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchThe Mets are 9 1/2 games behind the Washington Nationals in the NL East and 9 1/2 games behind Colorado in the race for the second wild card.  Going into L.A. and getting our teeth kicked in was kind of a wakeup call,  said deGrom, who was the only Mets starter not to face the Dodgers in last week's series.  We're running out of time. I think everybody's kind of on the same page. We know we've got a good team. Just a matter of going out there and playing.  DeGrom, who allowed one fluke run, walked one and struck out 12 in improving to 7-3, might be playing himself right on to the NL All-Star team. The 29-year-old has pitched at least seven innings and allowed one run or fewer in each of the last four starts, a stretch in which he's given up three runs while striking out 31 and walking eight over 32 innings.  He's in a groove, for sure,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Overall this season, deGrom has pitched seven innings while giving up one run or less six times in 16 starts. Only five other pitchers have done that: Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw (eight such starts) and the trio of the Nationals' Max Scherzer, Kansas City's Jason Vargas and Minnesota's Ervin Santana (six such starts apiece).  That's what I want to go out there and do,  deGrom said.  That's the goal and prepare in between each start to do that. Right now, it's paying off.  DeGrom's hard work looked as if it might pay off with a no-hitter when he limited Philadelphia to just one walk in the first 4 2/3 innings before Phillies catcher Andrew Knapp was credited with a triple after Mets center fielder Curtis Granderson lost Knapp's routine fly ball in the dusk settling above Citi Field. Granderson gestured helplessly as the ball landed far behind him.  (Knapp) ran hard from the time he hit that ball in the air and that's why he got a triple out of that,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He ran hard the whole way and got himself to third base and that was nice to see.  Four pitchers after Knapp's triple, Ty Kelly singled past a drawn-in infield to score Knapp and pull the Phillies within 2-1. But deGrom and a trio of relievers combined to retire 13 of the final 15 batters they faced, with Addison Reed earning his 13th save with a perfect seven-pitch ninth inning. Granderson had an RBI single in the second for the Mets, who scored the decisive run in the fourth when Jose Reyes tripled with one out and trotted home on Travis d'Arnaud's single. Knapp walked and stole a base for the Phillies (26-52), who were trying for just their third three-game winning streak of the season. Philadelphia's top five batters Friday were 0-for-19.  Tough to lose that game,  Mackanin said.  Not one of our first five hitters got a hit.  Rookie Ben Lively (1-3) took the loss after allowing two runs on five hits and four walks while striking out two over 6 1/3 innings. NOTES: Mets 1B Lucas Duda was scratched a little less than two hours before game time due to the stomach ailment that sidelined him the previous two games. ... Mets OF Michael Conforto (left hand) missed his fourth straight game. Conforto underwent further testing Friday afternoon, and general manager Sandy Alderson said Conforto could be placed on the disabled list Saturday, when RHP Zack Wheeler is scheduled to be activated. ... The Phillies recalled OF Nick Williams from Triple-A Lehigh Valley and placed IF/OF Howie Kendrick on the 10-day disabled list. ...

{"content":"Vogt makes good impression in Brewers' 3-2 win MILWAUKEE -- It's safe to assume that the last thing Stephen Vogt was expecting Friday night was a curtain call from 28,488 fans, but after hitting two home runs to lead the first-place Milwaukee Brewers to a 3-2 victory over the Miami Marlins in his Miller Park debut, that's exactly what happened.  First curtain call of my career,  Vogt said.  It was pretty cool. You don't have too many multi-homer games in Oakland unless you are (former Milwaukee and current Oakland slugger) Khris Davis.  Vogt, claimed off waivers last weekend from Oakland, put the Brewers on the board with a solo home run in the fifth inning and gave them the lead with a two-run shot in the seventh as the Brewers set a franchise record for home runs in a month with 49. But more important, Milwaukee increased its lead over the second-place Chicago Cubs in the National League Central to two games.  I'm just excited we won,  Vogt said.  I'm so happy to be here, to be in first place, to play on a winning team to just have a chance to win every night and be pushing for the playoff run. To contribute is awesome. I would have never conjured that up. It was fun.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BrewersMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchBrewers right-hander Matt Garza went five innings and held the Marlins to two runs and six hits with one walk and three strikeouts. Edinson Volquez worked six innings for Miami and allowed one run and three hits. He walked two struck out four.  That's a dangerous club over there,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  If you get a bunch of runners out there, they can put a lot of pressure on you. He kept his walks down. I thought he used his off-speed well. He had good stuff tonight. He was good.  A scoreless game through four innings, Miami broke through in the fifth on an RBI double from JT Riddle. He made it 2-0 later the inning, scoring when Garza flubbed a sacrifice bunt by Dee Gordon and couldn't make a short toss home. Domingo Santana drew a leadoff walk to put the winning run aboard against David Phelps (2-4) in the seventh. After Hernan Perez struck out, Vogt smashed a 1-2 fastball to center, putting Milwaukee ahead.  I was trying to get a fastball up and it put it right down the middle,  Phelps said. Milwaukee's bullpen was in lockdown mode from there. Carlos Torres (4-4) pitched two scoreless innings and Jacob Barnes struck out two in the eighth to bridge the gap to closer Corey Knebel. Knebel walked leadoff batter J.T. Realmuto in the ninth and almost gave up the lead on Derek Dietrich's double to left. But Ryan Braun made a spot-on throw to Orlando Arcia, who rifled the ball to Vogt behind the plate in time to put the tag on Realmuto.  That was the biggest play of the game, obviously,  Vogt said.  Everything had to go perfect and it did. Those two guys made to two perfect throws. Arcia's throw was perfect for me to slap the tag on him real quick. It was an already perfect play.  Mattingly challenged the call, but after a 58-second review, it was confirmed and Knebel punched out two more batters to set an MLB record for consecutive games with a strikeout to start the season for a reliever with 40, as well as earn his 13th save.  Forty straight appearances with a strikeout is unbelievable,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He should be very proud of it for sure.  NOTES: The game was delayed for seven minutes in the fourth inning when 1B umpire Joe West was struck in the back of the head by a baseball thrown from the stands. West remained in the game. ... RHP Justin Nicolino was originally slated to start Saturday but was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans after the game.

{"content":"Vargas gets 12th win as Royals rout Twins KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- An Ervin Santana throwing error on a possible double play grounder turned out to be a game-changer. Jason Vargas allowed one run and two hits in seven innings as the Kansas City Royals crushed the Minnesota Twins 8-1 on Friday night. The victory moved the Royals (39-39) to .500, three games behind the American League Central-leading Cleveland Indians. Vargas (12-4) shares the major league lead in wins with Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Vargas tops the AL in victories and owns a 2.22 ERA. Eric Hosmer's three-run homer in a five-run fourth inning was the big hit and it came immediately after Santana's errant throw.  That's what you've got to do against a guy like him,  Hosmer said.  Any time a team makes a mistake like that, you've got to capitalize on it. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at RoyalsMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch That's what we did. If we don't score right there in that inning or only score one, it completely changed the entire ballgame from that point on. Especially when you got two aces on the mound like tonight, that's usually what decides the winner, is the team that capitalizes on mistakes.  Mike Moustakas blasted his team-leading 21st home run in the sixth. Jermaine Dye holds the Royals' record with 22 home runs in 2000 before the All-Star break. Alex Gordon drove in the final two Kansas City runs with sacrifice flies. Santana (10-5) allowed seven runs (five earned) and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. Santana's errant throw on a potential double-play grounder paved the way for the five-run fourth inning. Jorge Bonifacio led off the inning with a single to right field, the first Kansas City hit. Lorenzo Cain hit a comebacker, but Santana tossed the ball past second baseman Brian Dozier and into center field. Santana was visibly upset with his error and Hosmer hit his next pitch for an opposite-field, three-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole. There was a crew chief challenge to make sure it was fair, but after a one-minute and 51-second delay the call on the field was upheld. The Royals tacked on two runs before the inning ended with Alcides Escobar and Whit Merrifield singling in the other runs.  If you ask my opinion, I think the game turned on one play, and that was the comebacker,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  You have a chance to get a couple outs and nobody on base and it turned into a big rally because we didn't execute.  It's one of those throws you make from the side of the mound and your feet land maybe a little differently than on flat ground and it seemed like the ball took off on him. He was good early, couldn't stop the bleeding there. They put up a big number and we generated almost nothing off of their guy.  The Twins scored first in the third inning. Vargas walked Max Kepler and Joe Mauer. Miguel Sano's two-out single scored Kepler. The Twins threatened in the fifth after Byron Buxton walked and Dozier singled. Vargas retired Mauer on a fly ball to center and Sano on a comebacker to end the inning.

{"content":"Molina, Leake shine as Cardinals throttle Nationals ST. LOUIS -- When a sinkerball pitcher earns 17 outs via grounders, odds are he probably had a good game. Mike Leake certainly did Friday night, snapping a six-start streak without a win as he worked eight strong innings in the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-1 rout of the Washington Nationals at Busch Stadium. In upping his record to 6-6, Leake gave up five hits and a run, walking three and striking out four. He induced four double-play balls and threw just 93 pitches in his first victory since May 24 at the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Going into the game, you know you're going to get ground balls,  St. Louis shortstop Paul DeJong said.  You've got to make plays. We're trying to help out our pitcher and the double plays helped.  Although Washington (47-33) managed eight baserunners against him, Leake faced just three batters over the minimum. He also helped his cause by picking Michael Taylor off first before Bryce Harper could bat in the third inning of a scoreless game. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at CardinalsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchNationals manager Dusty Baker, who managed Leake for the first four years of his career in Cincinnati, wasn't surprised by his performance.  I hate to face a pitcher that's one game under .500 because they always pitch their best to get back to .500,  Baker said.  He's a good pitcher. I had him and he knows how to pitch.  While Leake cruised, Washington starter Tanner Roark struggled again, undone this time by an utter inability to make acquaintance with the strike zone. Roark (6-6) walked a career-high five and threw a whopping 85 pitches in three innings, giving up four hits and three runs while fanning two. Roark made it through the first two innings despite three walks, but leadoff passes to Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty in the third finally led to trouble. After Jedd Gyorko's infield hit filled the bases, Yadier Molina grounded a two-run single up the middle. Two outs later, Greg Garcia added an RBI single to left-center for a 3-0 advantage.  Falling behind every single hitter was the source of everything,  Roark said.  My fastball command, which is my bread and butter, just wasn't there tonight. Five walks is never, ever good.  So bad, in fact, that Roark was pulled before the bottom of the fourth for reliever Jacob Turner. St. Louis pounced on him for five quick runs to end any suspense before the game was official. Gyorko rifled a ground-rule double to right-center that scored Matt Carpenter. Molina drilled another two-run single through a drawn-in infield. DeJong capped the outburst with his sixth homer, a 426-foot blast to the seats in left-center.  I felt like it was a matter of time,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of his offense.  We were grinding out competitive at-bats, making (Roark) work real hard. It was one good at-bat after another.  Pham, Gyorko, Molina and Garcia each finished with two hits in St. Louis' 11-hit attack. It was the third straight win for the Cardinals (38-41), who have captured five of their last six games and remain 3 1/2 games behind first-place Milwaukee in the National League Central. Matheny has maintained as his team has struggled to find any kind of traction since mid-May that it was capable of playing crisp, clean baseball. While six games is clearly a small sample size, he's seen enough to believe St. Louis is over a 12-25 skid that left it at seven games under .500 less than a week ago.  It's great to talk about it,  he said,  but now you're seeing all the components. We hit some ruts and it put some doubt in everyone, but playing like this gives you an extra bit of confidence. It sets the tempo for what it needs to be going forward.  NOTES: St. Louis announced Friday that general manager John Mozeliak is being promoted to president of baseball operations. Michael Girsch is the new GM and vice-president. Both signed contracts through 2020. ... Cardinals LHP Zach Duke (left elbow surgery) started a rehab assignment Friday at the team's Gulf Coast League affiliate, pitching an inning and allowing a hit while fanning one. ...

{"content":"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., July 1 (Reuters) - New Jersey's government shut down on Friday at midnight when legislators failed to pass a budget before a July 1 deadline amid a standoff over a plan to take money from the state's biggest health insurance company. That measure, being pushed by Governor Chris Christie in a search for money to fund drug addiction services, was tied to a budget bill that passed the Senate on Thursday but has not gained enough support to clear the Assembly. During the shutdown, state police, prisons, child welfare services, NJ Transit and other health and safety operations will continue to function, Christie said in an executive order signed in Trenton just before midnight. But all state parks will be closed, an unwelcome prospect for residents celebrating the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday. A number of other state services, including obtaining birth and marriage certificates, will halt. The shutdown could be short-lived, however, as Christie called a special legislative session for 11 a.m. ET on Saturday to continue working on a deal. At issue is a push by the governor to force the non-profit insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to spend some of its billions in reserves on public health services or return money to subscribers. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, a Democrat, said the Horizon plan was  bad public policy  that was introduced at the last minute and should not be considered until after a budget passed.  None of this should be tied to the budget,  he said during a televised afternoon press conference.  The budget is a document that already has been vetted ... nothing should be held hostage.  The governor, however, blamed Prieto for the impasse, saying there should be a  change in transparency  at Horizon. Christie, who has the lowest approval rating of any governor in New Jersey's history, said he would strip from the budget about $150 million in school funding and other items previously agreed with Democrats unless the Assembly passed the Horizon bill. All 80 of the Assembly's seats are up for re-election in November, when New Jersey will also elect a new governor to replace Christie, who is in his eighth and final year as governor. The new governor will inherit the state's gaping public pension shortfall, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades during Christie's tenure. New Jersey's credit rating is now the second lowest in the United States, above only Illinois.

{"content":"OLYMPIA FIELDS, Illinois (Reuters) - Michelle Wie generates as much power as any woman golfer on the planet, which might explain why she was so reluctant to talk about the 11-wood she put in her bag for the first time at the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship. Wie, who ended the second round three strokes behind halfway leaders Kim Sei-young and Danielle Kang at Olympia Fields on Friday, had trouble deciding what to hit for her second shot at the final hole, after slicing her tee shot into deep rough. “I think it’ll be plenty,” she said to her caddie about the club of choice, their conversation audible to nearby spectators including her father. “I’m going to hit down on it. It’ll come out hot.” After two practice swings, Wie took an almighty slash at her ball, but it did not come out hot. It found a bunker in front of the green, leading to a closing bogey. Asked what clubs she had been torn between hitting, Wie was vague. “Just had a really bad lie. Just wanted to make sure I got it out there,” she said. Pressed on what she had hit, Wie smiled and finally spilled the beans. “An 11-wood,” she said, breaking into raucous laughter. “I love it. It’s so easy to hit. It’s easier to hit than a blade five-iron, let me tell you that.” Jun 30, 2017; Olympia Fields, IL, USA; Michelle Wie chips onto the eighteenth green during the second round of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship golf tournament at Olympia Fields Country Club - North.

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A doctor who had lost his job at a New York City hospital opened fire with an assault rifle inside the building on Friday, killing another physician and wounding six other people before taking his own life in a burst of apparent workplace-related violence, officials said. The gunman, wearing a white medical lab coat, stalked two floors of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, in the New York borough of the Bronx, and tried to set himself on fire before police searching the building found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said. One female physician was shot to death, and six other people were wounded, five seriously, including one who was shot in the leg, O'Neill said at a news conference.  Mayor Bill de Blasio characterized the shooting as an  isolated incident  that appeared to be  a workplace-related matter.  He said that it was  not an act of terrorism.    One doctor is dead, and there are several doctors who are fighting for their lives right now amongst those who are wounded,  de Blasio told reporters.  This is a horrific situation unfolding in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort.  O'Neill said the gunman was armed with an assault rifle. Neither the mayor nor police immediately identified the suspect or any of the victims. O'Neill said the gunman was a former employee of the 972-bed hospital. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, in an interview with WABC News, identified the gunman as Dr. Henry Bello and said he had been fired by the hospital. Other media reports said Bello was 45 years of age. The New York Times and the New York Daily News reported, citing unnamed sources, that Bello had resigned from the hospital rather than face termination over accusations of sexual harassment. From Nigeria to Caribbean Medical School Police officers patrol the scene after an incident in which a gunman fired shots inside the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in New York City, U.S. June 30, 2017.Brendan McdermidBello had received a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate in order to gain experience so he could be fully licensed, but that permit expired a year ago, the Times reported. It said he also had a pharmacy technician license from California. The Daily News said he had been a pharmacy tech at the hospital before he quit in 2015. A native of Nigeria, Bello earned a medical degree from Ross University on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica and later worked briefly as a pharmacy technician for Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan in 2012, according to David Wims, a lawyer who represented Bello in an unemployment insurance claim against that hospital. In a telephone interview, Wims told Reuters Bello was injured on the job at Metropolitan a few months after being hired, then went on leave and never returned. In a decision upheld by the state's appellate court division, Bello ultimately was denied unemployment benefits on grounds he quit without good cause. Wims said he remembered Bello as  an even-keeled, respectful, humble person  and knew nothing of his history at the Bronx hospital. Slideshow (21 Images)Details about the shooting were still sketchy. Authorities said the rampage unfolded shortly before 3 p.m. when the gunman went on a rampage on the 16th and 17th floors of the hospital. He and the slain physician both were found on the 17th floor, while the six other victims were found on the 16th floor, O'Neill said. The incident sent waves of panic throughout the hospital, and police swarmed the building searching for the gunman.  People were running. People were afraid,  said Jane Vachara, 50, a clerical associate on the ninth floor, who said she huddled with colleagues in a locker room for about an hour. Adding to the pandemonium was the gunman's attempt to set himself ablaze, which apparently triggered the hospital's fire alarm system and halted elevator service, hampering efforts by first responders to reach victims and evacuate the building.   One ambulance worker, Robert Maldonado, told WCBS television that he and his partner had to carry a bleeding patient down nine flights of stairs to safety, applying pressure to the man's wound on the way down. Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, located about one mile (1.6 km) north of Yankee Stadium, is the largest voluntary, non-profit health care system serving the South and Central Bronx, as well as one of the city's biggest providers of outpatient services.

{"content":"Souza caps Rays' rally in 10-inning win vs. Orioles BALTIMORE -- Steven Souza Jr. takes it as a bit of an insult when other teams intentionally walk a batter to get him to the plate. That happened Friday night and Baltimore right-hander Darren O'Day paid for it. Souza hit a three-run homer off O'Day in the top of the 10th inning as the Tampa Bay Rays rallied for a 6-4 victory over the Orioles. Corey Dickerson walked to start the 10th and Logan Morrison drew a one-out intentional walk from O'Day (1-2). Souza crushed his three-run shot to center that gave Tampa Bay (42-40) a 6-3 lead.  It's happened to me a few times this year,  Souza said.  I'm coming in there and showing, 'Hey, if you're going to let me come to the dish, I'm going to make you pay for it.  This was Souza's first extra-base hit in his last seven games, and manager Kevin Cash has been impressed with how he is approaching at-bats.  I think how much he's matured as a player,  Cash said.  He doesn't force the situation. I think he went up there with O'Day with an approach and stuck to it. He wasn't going to get anything away, kind of sold out to that and stuck with it.  Cash also liked how the Rays got help from a number of places in rallying from a 3-2 deficit in the ninth, one strike away from a loss, to tie the score and then win it. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at OriolesTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchPinch-hitter Shane Peterson started the turnaround when he walked against Baltimore closer Brad Brach with two outs -- nearly striking out -- and then went to second on a balk. Pinch-runner Peter Bourjos moved to third on a wild pitch and then scored on Adeiny Hechavarria's fourth single of the night, which forced extra innings and set up the Souza homer.  I was really just trying to see it deep and put together a good at-bat,  Peterson said.  I was just basically trying to keep the game alive at that point.  That walk clearly frustrated Brach afterward.  I can't walk a guy there,  Brach said.  That just can't happen.  Jumbo Diaz (1-3) got the win thanks to a scoreless ninth, and Alex Colome closed it in the 10th for his 21st save despite allowing a solo homer to Mark Trumbo to start the inning. The Rays out-hit the Orioles 10-5 as Baltimore left just one runner on base in the game and Tampa Bay came up with a few threats.  I don't know (about) stealing one, but we only had four hits through nine innings, five through 10,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  I think that was more of the story than anything. We had a shot there at trying to get one, but they did a good job.  The game swung back and forth in the final few innings. The score was tied at 2 when Adam Jones lined a double to right off Rays starter Jake Faria to start the seventh. Jones went to third when Souza mishandled the ball in the corner and scored on a Trumbo single. Faria allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings in his fifth major league start. Chris Tillman of Baltimore (39-40) saw his winless streak stretch to 10 starts despite a strong performance. The right-hander allowed two runs and seven hits in five-plus innings and left with the Orioles trailing 2-1. Joey Rickard (two RBIs) tied the score at 2 with a solo homer leading off the bottom of the sixth, which set up the late-inning dramatics. Ramos gave the Rays a 2-0 lead in the second with his first homer of the season, a two-run shot on a 1-2 pitch off Tillman. The catcher missed most of the first three months of the season while recovering from a torn ACL. The Orioles cut that lead in half when Rickard lined an RBI double to left-center field in the third, their first hit of the game off Faria. NOTES: The Orioles agreed to terms with their first-round pick in this year's draft, LHP D.L. Hall. MASN Sports reported that Hall got a $3 million signing bonus. ... LHP Zach Britton is set for one more rehab assignment (Monday at Triple-A Norfolk), and if all goes well, he could rejoin the Orioles on July 5. ...

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has described as  completely unfounded and false  online allegations made against it by controversial billionaire Guo Wengui, and threatened legal action, in its first public comments on the issue. Chinese-born Guo, who now lives in New York, has emerged in recent months as a political threat to the Chinese government in an acutely sensitive year, making clear that he wants to disrupt a five-yearly congress to be held this autumn.  A sprawling aviation-to-financial services group, HNA has become China's most active non-government enterprise in global markets, with deals worth more than $50 billion. HNA rebutted Guo's claims on its website, ranging from allegations of shareholdings by senior Chinese government officials and their relatives, to irregularities in global acquisitions, and improprieties over its VIP jet.  HNA Group reserves right to pursue all legal actions in due course,  it added in its website statement late on Saturday. Through Twitter posts and video blogs, Guo has unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials. He began making specific allegations against HNA in April, but the group had not previously replied publicly. The HNA Group logo is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017.Thomas White/IllustrationWithin hours of HNA's statement, Guo said in a livestreamed video that he welcomed its response, and urged the company to make good on its threat to sue.  If it's just me speaking, that's no good,  he said in the video.  Only their replies can prove the value and the truth of the matter. This is critical.  Guo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.  Guo has provided scant evidence to back up his accusations, but his standing as a former billionaire insider, and his close ties with a disgraced former senior intelligence official, have made him a center of attention in Beijing political circles. The government has launched a sustained effort to discredit Guo, making a request to Interpol in April for the issue of a global 'red notice' for his arrest. On Friday, three senior employees of Guo told a court he had instructed them to fraudulently obtain loans running into hundreds of millions of dollars.  The chairman of property developer SOHO China, Pan Shiyi, and a prominent journalist, Hu Shuli, the founder of Caixin Media, have also filed defamation suits against Guo in New York.

HNA rebutted Guo's claims on its website, ranging from allegations of shareholdings by senior Chinese government officials and their relatives, to irregularities in global acquisitions, and improprieties over its VIP jet.  HNA Group reserves right to pursue all legal actions in due course,  it added in its website statement late on Saturday. Through Twitter posts and video blogs, Guo has unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials. He began making specific allegations against HNA in April, but the group had not previously replied publicly. The HNA Group logo is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017.Thomas White/IllustrationWithin hours of HNA's statement, Guo said in a livestreamed video that he welcomed its response, and urged the company to make good on its threat to sue.  If it's just me speaking, that's no good,  he said in the video.  Only their replies can prove the value and the truth of the matter. This is critical.  Guo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.  Guo has provided scant evidence to back up his accusations, but his standing as a former billionaire insider, and his close ties with a disgraced former senior intelligence official, have made him a center of attention in Beijing political circles. The government has launched a sustained effort to discredit Guo, making a request to Interpol in April for the issue of a global 'red notice' for his arrest. On Friday, three senior employees of Guo told a court he had instructed them to fraudulently obtain loans running into hundreds of millions of dollars.  The chairman of property developer SOHO China, Pan Shiyi, and a prominent journalist, Hu Shuli, the founder of Caixin Media, have also filed defamation suits against Guo in New York.

{"content":"(The Sports Xchange) - There are coaches who will tell you that a playoff series doesn't truly start until the road team wins a game. In the case of the Stanley Cup Final, the first road win will spell the end of the series. The defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins can become the first team to repeat since Detroit in 1998 if they can crack the code of raucous Bridgestone Arena Sunday night in Game 6 against the Nashville Predators.  We're just going to try to stay in the moment regardless of whether it needs to be played,  Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said.  We're going to try to play the game that gives us the best chance to win.  That game looks a whole lot like Game 5, in which the Penguins ambushed Nashville early and often, scoring six goals in the first two periods and netting a contentious 6-0 win that gave them a 3-2 series lead. It looks nothing like Games 1 through 4, in which the Predators controlled the flow of play most of the time. While Pittsburgh created really good scoring chances in the first two periods of Game 4, it was still outshot in each of the first four games, sometimes by a lot in terms of total shots. Nashville looked nothing like that team Thursday night, instead imitating deer frozen by headlights. Goalie Pekka Rinne lasted one period, undone by poor defense in front of him and the relentless Penguins attack. During the 72-hour break between Games 2 and 3, Predators coach Peter Laviolette was asked repeatedly if he intended to bench Rinne. That line of questioning has been squashed during this 72-hour hiatus, in part because Laviolette wouldn't entertain it, and also because Rinne has simply been so dominant at home. He's 9-1 in this year's playoffs at Bridgestone Arena, ceding just 15 goals and often standing on his head with spectacular saves like the ones he made in Game 4 that led Nashville to a 4-1 victory.  He's the same every day,  Laviolette said of Rinne.  He works hard every day. His demeanor seems the same to me. We've got to do a better job in front of him. I know there's things we can do that can support our goaltender better.  One thing can be accomplished simply by playing at home. In addition to the deafening crowd that seems to act as an extra skater, wearing the gold uniforms gives the Predators the final change. That allows Laviolette to use his top defense pairings more in faceoff situations to better counter the likes of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But what if Nashville's Big Four defensively becomes a Big Three? Ryan Ellis, who left Game 5 in the second period with an undisclosed injury, didn't practice on Saturday. If he's not able to go, Roman Josi, P.K. Subban and Mattias Ekholm may have to soak up extra minutes. Regardless, the Predators will be a formidable foe on friendly ice, especially now that they're in win-or-else mode. No one knows that better than the team trying to knock them out.  We have to approach it like the team that's playing for its life tomorrow,  defenseman Ron Hainsey said.  Everybody's focus will be on getting off to a real good start because if we don't, it could be a rough night. ","keywords":"Evgeni Malkin,MATTIAS EKHOLM,Mike Sullivan,P.K.

{"content":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Former Brazil defender Roberto Carlos hit out at allegations he took illegal stimulants as  lies  on Saturday and vowed judicial action against the German TV network that made them. A documentary aired by the ARD network said the legendary full back was named in a dossier given by Brazil's anti-doping agency to the public prosecutor's office in Sao Paulo in 2015. Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations in the documentary. The former Real Madrid player called the allegations  extremely vague  and said his lawyers were taking action to refute them.

The lying accusations against me are completely against the way I think. In a career spanning more than 20 years I never tested positive for any substance that would modify my performance.  The Brazilian Football Confederation did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue.

{"content":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam property company, FLC Group, which aims to start a new airline that could take to the skies for the first time early next year, is working with Airbus to lease about seven aircraft by 2018, the company's chairman said on Saturday. FLC's board decided in May to set up the new airline, called Bamboo Airways.     The new carrier will have a fleet of  about seven  aircraft by 2018, and its first flight could take place in early 2018, said Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC Group.    By 2018, it will be about seven...and the number would be increasing in the year after. We are now working with Airbus,  Quyet told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a company road show in Singapore, adding they would be on lease.  That carrier will serve our resorts in nine provinces in Vietnam. We will connect with international flights and we will carry them to our resorts,  he said.  Vietnam now has four airlines -- Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Aviation, Jetstar Pacific Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Co.  An executive gives a presentation at a FLC Group event in Singapore June 10, 2017.Edgar SuFLC said in March it won provincial approval for a study to invest $2 billion in an entertainment complex in northern Quang Ninh province that could include resorts, hotels, a casino and golf course, among other services. FLC plans to invest about $2.1 billion on the project, Quyet said. The provincial government has already suggested a location for the resort, which includes a casino, he added.  We are working on the master plan now, and we are clearing the land,  Quyet said, adding that it covered 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres). FLC is part of a growing number of foreign and domestic investors betting on Vietnam's decision to allow citizens entry to its casinos, a lucrative market locked for years in a nation of passionate, yet clandestine gamblers on cards and soccer. From mid-March, Vietnamese have been allowed to gamble in approved casinos and under certain conditions in a three-year pilot project announced in January. The government will review whether to retain the policy after three years. There are fewer than 10 casinos in the country, all barred to Vietnamese. The change could make Vietnam an attractive destination for big gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands, Genting Bhd, Nagacorp  and Penn National Gaming, which have expressed interest.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Adam West, who earned a place in American pop culture history with his campy portrayal of the title character in the classic 1960s TV series  Batman,  has died at age 88, his family said on Saturday. West, who was so closely identified with Batman for the rest of his life that it was both a blessing and a curse for him, died on Friday evening after a short struggle with leukemia, his representative told Variety.   He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy,  his family said on the actor's Twitter page.  The live-action  Batman  show, starring West along with Burt Ward as his sidekick Robin and a collection of colorful villains, was inspired by a long-running comic book series. It ran only three seasons from 1966 to 1968 on the ABC network, but became a television phenomenon and cult classic. It also spawned a  Batman  feature film in 1966. West portrayed Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne as painfully earnest, straight-laced, clean-cut and trustworthy. The darker aspects of the Batman character - mined so successfully in later film versions - were ignored. The show's various memorable villains - Cesar Romero as the Joker, Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Julie Newmar as Catwoman - were allowed to chew the scenery. Numerous Hollywood luminaries stepped in to play Batman's demented adversaries in the show's 120 episodes.  He was bright, witty and fun to work with,  Newmar said on Saturday in a statement.  I will miss him in the physical world and savor him always in the world of imagination and creativity.        After the cancellation of the series, West found it difficult to land other acting jobs, even though he was an established film and TV actor, because he had become so linked to the Batman role. Eventually he came to accept that his identity was closely intertwined with the masked crime-fighting hero in the black cape whether he liked it or not. He often was hired to play a comically fictionalized version of himself in live-action and animated roles and became a successful voice actor. On the long-running animated series  Family Guy,  he provided the voice of the character Mayor Adam West. He played himself for years on the animated  The Fairly OddParents  and appeared on the venerable animated series  The Simpsons.  West also voiced the Caped Crusader and other characters in numerous animated incarnations of Batman. FILE PHOTO - Actor Adam West poses for photographers at a ceremony where he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles April 5, 2012.Phil McCarten'Curious Stirrings'   We had some very good writers for the original show,  West said in a 2010 interview with the Slice of SciFi website.  They saw the craziness, the comedy. You know, just as he's about to put her in (jail), Batman says to Catwoman, 'You give me curious stirrings in my utility belt.' That's funny stuff.   In protecting Gotham City from super criminals, Batman and Robin invariably would find their lives threatened in some fiendish trap, only to escape using their endless ingenuity. For example, Robin was once nearly swallowed alive by a giant clam in an episode with the Joker. Batman and Robin were nearly turned into frozen desserts - Frosty Freezies - in an episode with famed film director Otto Preminger as Mr. Freeze. Slideshow (4 Images)Like some other actors who became inseparable in the minds of fans from a character they played - Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock on  Star Trek  is another example - West long resented his association with Batman but learned to like it.  I think it was a very simple deduction. I think any intelligent person would come to the same conclusion,  he said in 2010.  And that is: if I am being turned down for other roles because of my association with Batman, then maybe what I should do is really embrace Batman. Pursue it and keep it alive, which is what I've been trying to do for 30 years.  Bob Kane, who created Batman in 1939, seemed to agree. West kept a drawing of Batman by Kane, who inscribed it:  To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation.  While struggling to land post-Batman acting roles, West turned to making personal appearances wearing the Batman cape and cowl - some rather undignified, as when he appeared on a Memphis pro wrestling program opposite wrestler Jerry  The King  Lawler. West was born as William  Billy  Anderson in Washington state in 1928. He took the name Adam West when he came to Hollywood in 1959. Pre- Batman,  he co-starred in the 1965 Three Stooges feature film  The Outlaws Is Coming  and the 1964 sci-fi film  Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  But it was his performance in a TV commercial that caught the notice of the  Batman  producers.  They'd seen a series of commercials I'd done for Nestle Quick instant milkshake in which I did a kind of spoof on the James Bond character,  West told Bizarre magazine in 2004.  They saw the commercials and thought, 'Hey, maybe this is the guy that can play the character in the way that we envision it.'

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of revelers, some waving rainbow flags symbolizing gay rights, crowded Washington streets on Saturday for the city's gay pride parade in an annual party that saw anti-corporate protesters briefly block its route. Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. Protesters who oppose the Capital Pride parade's corporate backing, which includes bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), briefly blocked the parade route and forced it to be rerouted. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter. Thousands celebrate the annual LGBTQ Capital Pride parade in Washington, June 10, 2017.James Lawler DugganThe parade in the heavily Democratic U.S. capital featured T-shirts that said  Love Trumps Hate,  an apparent reference to   President Donald Trump. The Republican has voiced support for gay rights but his administration has revoked federal guidelines that let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. Damian Jessup, 30, who traveled from Norfolk, Virginia, to march with gay Republicans, defended Trump and his support for gays.  Slideshow (5 Images)“I lost a lot of friends when I came out as Republican,  said Jessup, who was wearing a Trump T-shirt.  It’s harder to come out as Republican than to come out as gay.   The Washington parade came a day ahead of a so-called Resist March in Los Angeles against Trump, which is taking the place of the annual pride parade. In San Francisco, the SF Weekly newspaper reported the parade in that city would include a  resistance contingent  and an immigrant rights speaker. Early on Monday, the owner of the shuttered Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, is set to open its doors in remembrance of victims of a mass shooting there on June 12, 2016, that killed 49 people.

{"content":"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton produced a moment of Montreal magic on Saturday to put his Mercedes on pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix and equal Ayrton Senna's career haul of 65. The Briton's third pole in a row in Canada equalled Michael Schumacher's record of six at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, but it took a stunning lap worthy of his late Brazilian hero Senna to do it. After Ferrari had dominated the day's final practice, Hamilton moved it up a level with a lap faster than any previously recorded at the sun-bathed island circuit. Then, with Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel piling on the pressure with a time only 0.004 slower, the Briton went even faster to finish with a flourish and a lap of one minute 11.459 seconds.  It was a sexy lap. It was a great lap. I can't believe that it came together so well,  he said.  At the time while doing the lap I had no comprehension that I was going for my 65th. I had completely forgotten that. It was just about the here-and-now.  The pole, which left him three adrift of Schumacher's all-time record of 68, came 10 years on from the first of his Formula One career at the same track with McLaren in his rookie 2007 season. Vettel, a four times world champion with Red Bull who leads Hamilton by 25 points after six races, qualified second for Sunday's race. Related CoverageStroll to make Canada debut 10 places behind MassaFinland's Valtteri Bottas, who replaced retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg at Mercedes in January, qualified third  with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, the polesitter in Monaco two weeks ago, fourth. Red Bull will make up the third row with young Dutchman Max Verstappen qualifying fifth alongside Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo. Senna Helmet After qualifying, Hamilton was presented with one of Senna's race-worn helmets -- a gesture from the Brazilian driver's family that left him moved and momentarily stunned.  I'm shaken, I'm speechless,  he said, standing in front of the crowded stands with the gift.  Ayrton, I know for many of you was your favorite driver and it was the same for me. He was the one who inspired me to be where I am today. So to match him, and to receive this, is the greatest honor.  Senna, also a triple champion, died in a crash at Italy's Imola circuit in 1994.  It was a scintillating duel between Hamilton and Vettel, adding another line in what is shaping up as a season long fight.  He (Hamilton) was the better man today but I am not entirely happy,  said the German, winner of three of six races so far, compared to Hamilton's two.  Nevertheless I feel the car is very good, I was really happy this morning, I was happy this afternoon and it should be very good in the race so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  While Mercedes celebrated a return to form, the struggles continued down the paddock at McLaren as double world champion Fernando Alonso, back from his Indianapolis 500 adventure, failed to get out of the second qualifying and will start 12th. The Spaniard's Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne had an even more frustrating day and will start 16th in the 20 car field. Pressure has been mounting on McLaren's engine partner Honda to deliver but no upgrades have been ready for Montreal and the team continues to languish down the timesheets. Canadian teenager Lance Stroll disappointed the large flag-waving home crowd when he failed to make it out of the opening round of qualifying. The first Canadian to race at home in Formula One since 1997 champion Jacques Villeneuve in 2006, Stroll and his Williams team are hoping the 18-year-old can snatch his first points of the season. But he will be starting 17th and will need to produce something extra special to crack the top 10. Williams, however, have produced good performances on the island layout with a driver on the podium for the last two years. Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa could make it three after qualifying a respectable seventh.

{"content":"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Felipe Massa has started more than 250 races in Formula One while 18-year-old Williams team mate Lance Stroll has made six, and the difference was glaring during qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix on Saturday. The Brazilian, who despite almost winning the championship in 2008 had never out-qualified a team mate in 14 visits to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, put Williams in a strong points position by qualifying seventh fastest. His young Canadian team mate will make his home grand prix debut from 17th on the grid. Only 18, Stroll figures to be part of Formula One's future while 36-year-old Massa came out of retirement in January after a 16-year career that has produced 11 wins. Massa was enticed back by Williams to replace Valtteri Bottas, who was signed by Mercedes to replace retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg, and help steer Stroll through his Formula One initiation. While Stroll looked lost during Saturday qualifying, Massa oozed the confidence of a veteran making the most of his experience.  I think I am doing a good job,  said Massa.  I'm really happy with how things are going, the performance, working with the team, understanding the car, setups, the balance, it fits the way I like to drive as well.  Part of Massa's job is to tutor Stroll and at times step in and defend him as he did on Saturday.  It’s the first time he’s driving here, it is a tricky track,  offered Massa.  I am trying to help him in everything. I’m sure every day he’s getting better.  Definitely he needs to understand new things, it’s not easy. Maybe Formula One is not so easy as people think.  Coming from a country where motor racing ranks only second to soccer in terms of sporting passion Massa understands the pressure on a driver when he competes at his home grand prix. In 2006 and 2008, Massa lived up to those expectations when he won his home race in Sao Paulo. For Stroll that breakthrough is unlikely to come on Sunday. The son of one of Canada's richest men, he has yet to register a point in his debut season and each scoreless race brings more talk that he only secured his place because of a wealthy father. Stroll has tried to avoid excuses but, after another disappointing qualifying effort, was searching for a reason.  I've never actually been here before and in qualifying one I was 7/10ths off,  offered Stroll.  OK, it sounds like a lot but it is a little bit in every corner and I have never been here.  It's just tricky, the track is not so easy and today we just missed it a little bit.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Former world number one Maria Sharapova will miss the grasscourt season, including this month's Wimbledon qualifying tournament, after failing to recover from a left-thigh injury she suffered during last month's Italian Open.  After an additional scan, the muscle tear that I sustained in Rome will unfortunately not allow me to compete in the grass court tournaments I was scheduled to play,  Sharapova, who is on a comeback trail after serving a 15-month doping ban, said on her official Facebook page.   Sharapova opted not to apply for a wildcard into the main  Wimbledon draw after her request for an invite into Roland Garros, where she is a twice former champion, was snubbed by French Open officials.  The Russian's low ranking meant she was only guaranteed a place in the Wimbledon qualifying event if she wanted to secure a place in the July 3-16 grasscourt major.  However, the 2004 Wimbledon champion was granted a wildcard for the grasscourt warm-up tournament in Birmingham, England, which she will also miss.   I want to thank the LTA for their amazing support on my return and providing me with a Birmingham wildcard, a tournament which I hope many of you will be able to attend,  added the 178th-ranked Sharapova.   I look forward to meeting you there next year. I will continue to work on my recovery and my next scheduled tournament is in Stanford.  The Stanford tournament begins at the end of July. The five-times grand slam winner, who received wildcards to play in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome after being left without a ranking when her doping ban ended, retired injured in her second round match at the Italian Open. She was wearing a bandage on her thigh at the time. Missing the whole grasscourt season means the 30-year-old Russian will not be ranked high enough for direct entry into the U.S. Open, where officials will have to decide whether to court controversy by offering a wildcard.

Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said a deal must allow its staff from all over the world to enter Britain easily, ensure that parts are exempt from trade tariffs and ensure certain regulatory standards are maintained.  Otherwise, he said, Britain would risk losing Airbus production in the future.  For new productions, it's very easy to have a new plant somewhere in the world. We would have plenty of offers to do that,  Bregier said, according to the newspaper.  We want to stay in the UK — provided the conditions to work in an integrated organization are met.  May might be forced to reassess her Brexit priorities after being weakened by the election. She has previously said she wants Britain to withdraw from Europe's custom union as well as its single market. She has also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, implying she could accept tariffs on imports and exports. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday that a  hard Brexit  where trade tariffs between the UK and European Union were imposed could potentially impact the competitiveness of the firm's activities in Britain. Airbus employs over 10,000 people across two plants in Britain, according to the company's website.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Artemis Racing skipper Nathan Outteridge plunged overboard during an America's Cup challenger final race on Saturday, allowing Emirates Team New Zealand to get ahead and go 2-1 up in the first-to-five contest. Outteridge, who is an Olympic gold medallist in the physically demanding 49er skiff, slipped and shot off the back of his  flying  high-tech catamaran as it went through a high-speed manoeuvre on Bermuda's Great Sound. The two crews, who are going head-to-head in their quest to take on America's Cup holders Oracle Team USA, fought three fascinating duels in their catamarans. New Zealand showed the same slick consistency they have done throughout the challenger series, keeping their 50-foot (15 metre) foiling catamaran above the water for much of the time. But after making a crucial error in the first race and allowing New Zealand to get past them, Artemis Racing sailed a near perfect race in their second encounter to level the series. Artemis Racing managed to stay on their foils for the whole of the second race, while New Zealand kept their hulls flying out of the water for 99.9 percent of the time.  Outteridge had outsmarted his long-standing rival Peter Burling at the start and the crew of six elite sailors managed to fend off New Zealand's repeated attempts to pass them. But in the last race, when they also made the better start, the loss of Outteridge overboard threw the crew and they were unable to get back up to speed and conceded defeat. Burling said such mishaps were  part of it , adding:  I felt like even if he (Outteridge) didn't fall off we would have got that gate (course marker) off him . Outteridge was left stranded in the water, from where he was later picked up by a support boat. The next races are due to take place on Sunday.  I think he was a bit upset with what happened to be honest,  Paul Goodison, a member of the Artemis Racing team, said on BT Sport television after the race, adding that the crew had won three starts and were confident of beating New Zealand. The winner of the series will challenge Oracle Team USA in the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Match next week.

{"content":"Dozier, strong relief pitching help Twins top Giants SAN FRANCISCO -- For someone who had played just four previous games in his career at AT&T; Park, Minnesota Twins second baseman Brian Dozier sure demonstrated a knowledge of the 18-year-old ballpark Saturday afternoon. Then perhaps even more surprisingly, he demonstrated an ability to take advantage of the knowledge. The diminutive Dozier watched as the wind blew his high fly ball over the left-field fence in the fifth inning, a two-run homer that broke a tie and sent the Twins to a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants in the second game of their interleague series. Right-handers Tyler Duffey, Matt Belisle and Brandon Kintzler protected a one-run lead with 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief as the American League Central-leading Twins improved to 6-3 on their 10-game Western swing that ends Sunday.  I like the question,  Dozier responded when asked to explain why the Twins, who became baseball's fourth 20-game winner on the road this season, were playing so well away from home.  The question is usually: Why can't you win at home?  We've got to start winning at home. But if we keep winning on the road, I'll take it.  Brandon Belt homered for the Giants, who lost for the seventh time in their last nine home games.  We really played a good game,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  We have a hard time here at home. Wish I could put my finger on it. Right now, it's a challenge for us.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at GiantsMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchKennys Vargas belted the second-longest home run of the 2017 season, a 471-footer off Giants right-hander Jeff Samardzija, to offset Belt's first-inning homer and draw the Twins even at 1-1 in the fourth. Chris Gimenez then led off the fifth with a single and, with two outs, Dozier lifted a high fly that, given the way Giants left fielder Austin Slater seemed to be tracking it, appeared destined to die on the warning track. But the ball carried into the second row of the bleachers for Dozier's 10th homer of the season, giving the Twins a lead they never relinquished.  Look at the flags,  Dozier observed.  The flags at the top, they blow out. The lower flags blow in. It swirls.  You've got to get it high. The ball flies here during the day.  The homer was Dozier's third in his last 19 interleague games, a stretch during which he has hit .310 (26-for-84) and driven in 16 runs.  I like interleague play,  he said.  There's a lot more switching.  Once his team got the lead, Twins manager Paul Molitor switched pitchers three times, with all three moves working to perfection. Buster Posey's infield out plated Eduardo Nunez in the fifth to draw the Giants within 3-2, but San Francisco had only one hit the rest of the way against Twins starter Jose Berrios and three relievers. Duffey came on after Austin Slater's second of two hits, a single, put the potential tying run aboard with one out in the sixth. Duffey got pinch-hitter Kelby Tomlinson to ground into a double play to end the sixth, then retired the Giants in order in the seventh. Belisle needed just nine pitches to set down the middle of San Francisco's lineup in the eighth before Kintzler worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 17th save.  I have to credit my teammates today,  Berrios said.  I didn't pitch that well.  Berrios (5-1) improved his road record to 4-0, allowing two runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out eight, giving him 39 strikeouts in 38 innings this season. In winning their third in a row, the Twins managed just five hits off Samardzija and two Giants relievers. Samardzija (2-8) allowed all three Twins runs and four hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked one, just his second walk since May 1.  He's throwing the ball great,  Bochy said of Samardzija.  Occasionally, you're going to give up three runs, maybe four, but you have to pick these pitchers up sometimes. I know this is more of a pitchers' park, but still that shouldn't happen.  Slater and Belt had two hits apiece for the Giants, who outhit the Twins 6-5. NOTES: The Twins improved 193-174 all time in interleague play, the ninth-most wins in the majors since the concept was introduced in 1997. ... The Giants have lost 12 of their last 16 interleague games. ... Giants 1B Brandon Belt's home run was a  Splash Hit  into the San Francisco Bay beyond the right field wall, the 73rd for a Giant since AT&T; Park opened in 2000. Belt has seven of those blasts, tying him with 3B Pablo Sandoval for second among Giants. LF Barry Bonds is the leader with 35. ... The Twins are expected to promote LHP Nik Turley, a former Giants farmhand, from Triple-A Rochester to start the series finale Sunday. LHP Randy Rosario was informed after the game that he had been sent to Double-A Chattanooga to create a roster spot.","keywords":"Austin Slater,Barry Bonds,Brandon Belt,Brandon Kintzler,Brian Dozier,Bruce Bochy,Chris Gimenez,Eduardo Nunez,Jeff Samardzija,Jose Berrios,Matt Belisle,Pablo Sandoval,Paul Molitor,Randy Rosario,Tyler Duffey,BBO,TWINS,GIANTS,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-10 19:26:00","news_title":"Dozier, strong relief pitching help Twins top Giants","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-giants-writethru-idUSMTZED6BCTYSBU"}
{"content":"RIYADH (Reuters) - Gulf states traded public barbs on Saturday, showing little sign of resolving the region's deepest rift in years, five days after Arab nations severed diplomatic, trade and transport ties with the tiny Gulf kingdom of Qatar. Foreign leaders expressed growing concern over the dispute, which pits Qatar against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt. With backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, they accuse Qatar of supporting their regional arch-rival Iran as well as Islamist militants. Kuwait has led a regional effort to mediate, but the four states intensified the pressure on Friday by placing dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar on terrorism blacklists. [nL8N1J56SD] A senior UAE official followed on Saturday by calling Qatar  duplicitous , alleging in a series of tweets that its funding of militants had sown chaos and violence throughout the region.  Qatar has been riding (the) tiger of extremism & terrorism. Cost to region & world too high,  tweeted Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs.  Diplomacy only way forward. Process can only work following clear indication that Qatar will stop support & finance of extremism & terrorism.   Clear and Transparent  Qatar's foreign minister fired back that there was  no clarity  in such accusations, speaking in an interview with RT Arabic in Moscow after emerging from talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. [nL8N1J708I] Related CoverageQatar, accused of supporting terrorism, hires ex-U.S. attorney generalQatar says no expulsions of nationals from countries that cut tiesTurkey's Erdogan calls for Qatar row to be resolved by end of Ramadan Qatar is accused of having a hidden relationship with Iran, but its relations with Iran are clear, transparent and time-tested,  said Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, noting that the UAE does more trade with Iran than Qatar does. He denied that Qatar supported Egypt's outlawed Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip. He dismissed as  fantasy  a Saudi media report that he had met in Baghdad with the head of Iran's Quds Force, controlled by Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards. He said Qatar remained committed to a Kuwaiti-led mediation effort, but that he had yet to receive a clear list of demands. As conciliation efforts in the Gulf appeared to stall, leaders in Russia, Turkey, Germany and the United States expressed increasing concern. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017.Jonathan ErnstAfter German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the situation  very unsettling  on Friday, her foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, cautioned on Saturday that it could lead to war. [nL1N1J7049][nB4N1FT00I] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Sheikh al-Thani of Moscow's concern and called for talks.  And Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan - who has pledged food and troops to Qatar in the face of a blockade from its neighbours - hosted Bahrain's foreign minister and urged that the dispute be resolved by the end of the holy month of Ramadan. [nL8N1J70F5] Mixed Messages However, mixed messages from U.S. officials appeared to complicate the diplomacy, as Gulf media cited selectively from divergent statements to bolster their positions.  Saudi Arabia and Bahrain issued statements welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump's demand the previous day for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, while ignoring a U.S. State Department call for them to ease pressure. Saudi Arabia said it was committed to  decisive and swift action to cut off all funding sources for terrorism  in a statement carried by the state news agency SPA, while Bahrain hailed U.S. efforts to ensure  international solidarity  on the issue. The United Arab Emirates praised Trump's  leadership in challenging Qatar's troubling support for extremism  in a separate statement released on Friday. [nL1N1J61RY] Trump had accused Qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism on Friday, even as the Pentagon and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a blockade imposed by Arab states and others. [nL8N1J61K3] A separate SPA report on Saturday acknowledged Tillerson's call for Qatar to curtail support for terrorism, without mentioning that he had also said the crisis was hurting ordinary Qataris, impairing business and harming the U.S. fight against the Islamic State militant group. Saudi Arabia said its action followed the conclusions of last month's Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, where Trump delivered a speech about Islamist extremism. Trump said he had helped to plan the move against Qatar, although a senior administration official told Reuters this week that Washington had had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis during the visit that they would sever ties with Qatar. On Saturday, Niger announced it had recalled its ambassador to Qatar in solidarity with Arab countries.

{"content":"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - U.S. special forces have joined the battle to crush Islamist militants holed up in a southern Philippines town, officials said on Saturday, as government forces struggled to make headway and 13 marines were killed in intense urban fighting. The Philippines military said the United States was providing technical assistance to end the siege of Marawi City by fighters allied to Islamic State, which is now in its third week, but it had no boots on the ground.  They are not fighting. They are just providing technical support,  military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera told a news conference in Marawi City. The Pentagon, which has no permanent presence in the Philippines but for years has kept 50 to 100 special forces troops in the south of the country on rotational exercises, confirmed it was helping the Philippine military in Marawi.  It said in a statement it was providing Philippine forces with security assistance and training in the areas of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It said it had an additional 300 to 500 troops in the country to support regular training and activities, without giving further details.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official said support included aerial surveillance and targeting, electronic eavesdropping, communications assistance and training. A U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance plane was seen flying over the town on Friday, according to media reports.  There is no direct U.S. participation in combat, which is prohibited by Philippine law, although our forces involved in training the Philippine military are authorized to defend themselves,  the U.S. official said.  The cooperation between the longtime allies is significant because Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power a year ago, has taken a hostile stance towards Washington and has vowed to eject U.S. military trainers and advisers from his country. The seizure of Marawi City on May 23 has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear that Islamic State - facing setbacks in Syria and Iraq - is establishing a stronghold on the Philippine island of Mindanao that could threaten the whole region. About 40 foreigners have fought alongside the Philippine militants in Marawi City, most of them from Indonesia and Malaysia, though some came from the Middle East. The Philippines military suffered its biggest one-day loss on Friday since 10 troops were killed in a friendly-fire incident on June 1. Herrera said 13 marines conducting clearing operations died after an  intense  house-to-house firefight during which they encountered improvised explosive devices and were attacked by rocket-propelled grenades. A U.S. P3 Orion surveillance aircraft is seen flying over the town of Marawi city, as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who has taken over large parts of the city, Philippines June 9, 2017.Romeo RanocoThe deaths took to 58 the number of security forces killed, with 20 civilians and more than a hundred rebel fighters also killed in the Marawi fighting. Reports of Maute Brothers Killed At least 200 militants are holed up in a corner of the town. An estimated 500 to 1,000 civilians are trapped there, some being held as human shields, while others are hiding in their homes with no access to running water, electricity or food. Slideshow (5 Images)The military said it was making headway in the town but was proceeding carefully so as not to destroy mosques where some of the militants had taken up positions.   We give premium to the mosques, because this is very symbolic to our Muslim brothers,  Herrera said. The Philippines is majority Christian, but Mindanao has a significant population of Muslims and Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. One of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer amid the throng of insurgents, separatists and bandits on Mindanao. Herrera said the military was  validating  reports that the two Maute brothers who founded the group had been killed.  We are still awaiting confirmation,  he said.  We are still validating those reports but there are strong indications.  Maute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia  emir .     Military officials believe Hapilon is still in the town. The military has said it is aiming to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines' independence day.

What the government should do is enforce it.       Maduro, 54, has called a July 30 election to choose lawmakers who will work on the new charter, calling it a way to restore peace after two months of often violent anti-government unrest that has killed 67 people and injured thousands.     Opposition parties say they will not take part in the vote, which could dissolve the current, opposition-dominated parliament. The proposal has run into rare criticism from within the government's own ranks.     Critics say the plan is designed purely to keep Maduro in power, with rules skewed in the government's favor. They want to bring forward the next presidential vote due at the end of 2018.       Hunger, scarcity and out-of-control violence is not going to be solved with a new constitution,  said Oscar Arnal, an academic at a rally on Saturday in Caracas, where security forces used tear gas and water cannons to clear protesters who blocked a central highway, throwing fireworks and Molotov cocktails.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) could move production of new aircraft models out of Britain if the European plane-maker's  non-negotiable  demands over the free movement of people and trade tariffs are not delivered in upcoming Brexit talks, the Sunday Times reported.     Britain is due to begin negotiations with the rest of the European Union about the terms of its departure in nine days time, despite Prime Minister Theresa May being weakened by losing her majority in Thursday's election. Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said a deal must allow its staff from all over the world to enter Britain easily, ensure that parts are exempt from trade tariffs and ensure certain regulatory standards are maintained.  Otherwise, he said, Britain would risk losing Airbus production in the future.  For new productions, it's very easy to have a new plant somewhere in the world. We would have plenty of offers to do that,  Bregier said, according to the newspaper.  We want to stay in the UK — provided the conditions to work in an integrated organization are met.  May might be forced to reassess her Brexit priorities after being weakened by the election. She has previously said she wants Britain to withdraw from Europe's custom union as well as its single market. She has also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, implying she could accept tariffs on imports and exports. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday that a  hard Brexit  where trade tariffs between the UK and European Union were imposed could potentially impact the competitiveness of the firm's activities in Britain.

Chirinos hit a three-run homer with two outs in the top of the 11th inning on a 2-2 pitch from Shawn Kelley as the Texas Rangers beat the Washington Nationals 6-3. The veteran, who backs up All-Star Jonathan Lucroy, hit a game-tying homer in the eighth inning Wednesday against the New York Mets two days after he turned 33.  It was an amazing win for us. It was really good,  Chirinos said.  I stayed short and put the ball in play. Thank God it went out of the ballpark. I was trying to put a good swing on it.  Chirinos now has seven homers in just 76 at-bats and that production is not lost on teammate Delino DeShields, a center fielder from Maryland who had two hits for the second day in a row.  Robby is probably one of the most prepared guys I have ever been around. He continues to believe in himself,  DeShields said. The loss exposed more bullpen problems for the first-place Nationals, who learned after the game that closer Koda Glover has been experiencing some back issues. Glover gave up three hits and two runs in the ninth as the Rangers tied the game and forced extra innings. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at NationalsTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch He said his back was really locked up, we didn't know it,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said.  He's frustrated and we're frustrated because we can't keep him healthy and 100 percent right now and we don't know why.  In addition, Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, leading the league with a .365 batting average, did not play for the second time in three days. Baker said his back locked up after he dove for a ball in Los Angeles during a recent road trip.  It's one of those things where if you continue to play and it gets worse, something bad could happen. If you give it a day or two you can kind of just stop it right there,  Zimmerman said.  Even if I don't play tomorrow, I can't see me not playing on Monday.  The losing pitcher was Kelley (3-2) while Keone Kela (3-1) got the win as he went two scoreless innings. The Nationals (38-23) are 17-11 at home while Texas (29-32) is 11-18 on the road. Washington had a chance to win in the last of the ninth after pinch-hitter Stephen Drew led off with a double. Pinch-runner Wilmer Difo went to third on a groundout but was tagged out in a rundown for the third out after speedy Trea Turner tried to bunt for a base hit with two outs.  That's a tough read, but if you're going to go you've got to go, especially against a left-hander,  Baker said of Difo. Shin-Soo Choo led off the Texas ninth with a homer to trim the deficit to 3-2 off Glover. Elvis Andrus singled, Adrian Beltre walked and Nomar Mazara had a double to score Andrus and tie the game at 3.  We battled the whole game,  Mazara said.  We never put our heads down.  Chirinos then flew out to right fielder Bryce Harper and his throw to home appeared late to catch a sliding pinch-runner Pete Kozma. But the Nationals challenged the call and Kozma was ruled out as the game remained tied at 3. Washington lefty Oliver Perez took over for Glover and retired Rougned Odor for the final out of the ninth. Adam Lind (two hits) had a two-run homer in the sixth to give the Nationals a 3-1 lead. Washington trailed 1-0 before Anthony Rendon had a sacrifice fly to score Harper, who led off with a double and went to third on a single by Daniel Murphy in the sixth. It was the fifth homer in 73 at-bats for Lind, who got the start at first base in place of Zimmerman. Washington starter Gio Gonzalez allowed just one run and three hits and struck out nine in six innings for the Nationals. The Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the fourth as Andrus drove in a run on a groundout. Andrus extended his league-best hitting streak to 14 games with a single in the first. Martin Perez gave up seven hits and two runs in five-plus innings for Texas. Andrus also had two hits for Texas. Murphy, Michael A. Taylor and Ryan Raburn each had two hits for the Nationals.  This is the beginning of a tough road trip. This is a real test to see what we are about,  DeShields said. NOTES: Texas 3B Adrian Beltre (1-for-3 with a walk) was in the starting lineup for the Rangers after missing the previous two games. He landed awkwardly on first base while running out a ground ball Tuesday. ... Rangers 3B coach Tony Beasley grew up in central Virginia, played in college at Liberty University and is a former coach for the Nationals. ... Washington pitching coach Mike Maddux held the same job for the Rangers from 2009 to 2015. ... The Nationals will pick No. 25 and Texas No. 26 in the first round of the Major League First-Year Player Draft on Monday. Darren Baker, son of Nationals manager Dusty Baker, is eligible as a standout prep senior from California. The younger Baker has committed to play college ball at California.","keywords":"Adam Lind,Adrian Beltre,Anthony Rendon,Bryce Harper,Daniel Murphy,Darren Baker,Delino DeShields,Dusty Baker,Elvis Andrus,Joey Gallo,Jonathan Lucroy,Martin Perez,Michael A.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed Syrian forces have advanced into opposite sides of Islamic State's so-called Syrian capital of Raqqa, the forces and a war monitor said on Saturday. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by a U.S.-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa on Tuesday after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The U.S.-led coalition estimates that Raqqa, which Islamic State seized from Syrian rebels in 2014 during their lightning advance in Syria and Iraq, is defended by 3,000 to 4,000 jihadists. It has been a hub both for Islamic State's military leaders and its bureaucrats, and has been used to plot attacks in countries around the world. The SDF said it had seized al-Mishlab district in the far east of Raqqa on Friday and al-Sabahia district in the west. The war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the SDF had taken Mishlab and more than half of Sabahia. The forces are now advancing into al-Romania district in northwest Raqqa, the SDF and the Observatory said. Islamic State had turned back an earlier SDF assault on a military base on the north side, the Observatory said. Islamic State still has a long sweep of territory along Syria's Euphrates valley and wide stretches of desert, despite recent losses to the SDF, the Syrian army and rebel groups. A Syrian Democratic Forces fighter uses a tablet as he sits inside a room in the al-Mishlab district at Raqqa's southeastern outskirts.Rodi SaidFormer residents in touch with relatives in the beleaguered city said at least 50 people, mostly civilians, were killed in escalating U.S.-led strikes in the last 24 hours on residential areas inside the city.  More than 10 people were killed and dozens injured on Saturday when jets believed to belong to the U.S.-led coalition hit the city's main Nour Street in the centre of the commercial area, they said.  The other strike that killed at least 14 people was in the western neighbourhood of Jazra, where jets targeted an internet cafe, according to Muhab Nasser, an exile from Raqqa in touch with relatives and friends.  Slideshow (2 Images)Amaq, a news agency affiliated to Islamic State, released images of what is said were white phosphorus munitions lighting the city of Raqqa that were dropped by the U.S.-led coalition. The agency said 33 people were killed and 25 injured in a series of raids overnight. Videos posted by Raqqa activists and personal accounts coming out of the city also cited witnesses saying the city was hit for the second consecutive night with incendiary bombs. The U.S.-led coalition does not deny using incendiary bombs and says casualties are unavoidable even as it tries to minimise the impact of its military campaign on civilians.   To the west of Raqqa, the Syrian army and its allies have advanced into Islamic State territory and on Friday reached SDF lines near the town of Tabqa, 40km (25 miles) from the city.  The Syrian government has described the SDF's war against Islamic State as  legitimate  and said its military priorities are further east, suggesting it does not plan to confront the group now.

{"content":"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said its security forces on Saturday killed the mastermind of a twin attack on Tehran that left 17 people dead this week, as security was tightened around the country to prevent other possible plots. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings and gun attacks on parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on Wednesday.   The mastermind and main commander of terrorist attacks on the parliament and Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini was killed today by the security forces,  intelligence minister Mahmoud Alavi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. Alavi said that in the last month the intelligence ministry had identified and crushed  a terrorist team  almost every day but had not publicized it to avoiding spreading fear among the public. Iranian authorities have also arrested seven people it suspects of helping militants involved in attacks, a judiciary official said on Saturday. Ahmad Fazelian, a provincial judiciary official, said the seven, suspected of  providing support for the terrorist team ,  were detained in Fardis, about 50 km (31 miles) west of Tehran, the judiciary's online news agency Mizan reported.

Russia said at the time that the U.S. action would hamper efforts to find a political solution to the conflict and had violated the sovereignty of Syria, one of Russia's closest Middle East allies.  Lavrov expressed his categorical disagreement with the U.S. strikes on pro-government forces and called on him to take concrete measures to prevent similar incidents in future,  the ministry said.

{"content":"HARRISBURG, Pa./SEATTLE (Reuters) - Protesters held rallies across the United States on Saturday to denounce sharia law, the Islamic legal and moral code that organizers say poses a threat to American freedoms, but critics believe anti-Muslim hatred is behind the condemnation.  ACT for America, a self-described grassroots organization focusing on national security, staged rallies in New York, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Seattle, as well as many smaller cities. Hundreds of people pledged on social media to attend an event that ACT billed as  March against Sharia.  On the steps of the Pennsylvania state capitol in  Harrisburg, barricades and a heavy police presence, including officers mounted on horses, separated about 60 anti-sharia demonstrators from an equal number of counter-protesters. Many of the latter were dressed in black masks and hoods and chanting  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA.   The atmosphere was tense but the protest went off with no violence and only one arrest, police said.  More than a dozen men belonging to the anti-government Oath Keepers were on hand, invited by ACT to provide security. Most of them carried handguns. Chris Achey, 47, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, said he did not hate Muslims but believes that much of Islam is incompatible with Western culture.  The Constitution is the law of the land,  he said.  We have to be careful with who we let in the country.  On its website, ACT described sharia, which covers many aspects of Muslim life including religious obligations and financial dealings, as incompatible with human rights. It said sharia justifies the oppression of women and homosexuality, and advocates female genital mutilation. But critics say the organization vilifies Muslims and has repeatedly equated Islam with extremism. In their view, the rallies are part of a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by President Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslims entering the country during his election campaign. Molly Freiburg, 33, of Philadelphia, was one of the counter-protesters but not part of the larger group clad in black. Anti-sharia protesters scuffle with counter demonstrators and members of the Minnesota State Patrol at the state capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. June 10, 2017.Adam Bettcher America is not in danger from sharia law,  she said.  This manifestation at the Capitol is actually a way to make our Muslim neighbors feel uncomfortable.  A representative for ACT for America could not be reached for comment. In Seattle, about 75 anti-sharia protesters were outnumbered by counter-protesters at a rally that was moved from Portland, Oregon. Tensions are running high in Portland after a man yelling religious and racial slurs at two teenage girls on a commuter train fatally stabbed two men who tried to stop him.     Talbot Sleater, a 62-year-old construction foreman, said that the Seattle protest was the first of the kind that he had attended. A Briton who moved to the United States, he said he had decided to go after recent attacks in his home country. Slideshow (13 Images) People are being run over in the street with trucks and little kids are being blown up,  Sleater said, referring to recent attacks in London and Manchester.  I don't want that to happen here.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country's largest Muslim advocacy group, urged Americans to participate in one of several local educational events being organized in  a peaceful challenge to Saturday's hate rallies.   It also warned Muslims to take extra precautions against potential violence over the weekend. Anti-Muslim incidents rose 57 percent last year, including a 44 percent jump in anti-Islamic hate crimes, CAIR said in a report released in early May. Oath Keepers said on its website that it was  answering the call to defend free speech against those who would use terrorist violence or the threat of violence to shut it down.  The Southern Poverty Law Center says Oath Keepers is  one of the largest radical antigovernment groups in the United States,  organized around a  set of baseless conspiracy theories.  Refuse Fascism, a coalition of activists advocating confrontational tactics to oppose what it calls the Trump  regime,  said it would show up at the rallies  to counter the xenophobic hatred and lies, defy intimidation and drown it out.”  Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Frank McGurty in New York; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Mary Milliken and Chizu Nomiyama","keywords":"United States,United States,Chris Achey,Donald J.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - Maiden grand slam finals are meant to be suffocating experiences but Jelena Ostapenko laid waste to that theory as she blasted a barrage of winners past Simona Halep to win the French Open in audacious fashion on Saturday. In only her 18th match in one of the four majors, the 20-year-old Latvian fought back from a set and 3-0 down to blaze past the experienced Romanian 4-6 6-4 6-3 and become her country's first grand slam champion. Not only that but she is the first unseeded woman to win the Suzanne Lenglen trophy since 1933 and she emulated the great Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten by claiming her first title of any kind on the hallowed Parisian claycourts. Kuerten's 1997 victory came on the day Ostapenko was born. Ostapenko had promised to stick to her uncomplicated routine of attack-attack-attack before the final and was true to her word as she walloped 54 clean winners -- and 54 unforced errors. It was claycourt tennis, but not as we know it. Third seed Halep buckled under the strain of fending off the missiles being launched off Ostapenko's lime green racket. Yet for much of the contest, hanging into rallies by her fingernails, it seemed Halep's steady approach would see her become only the second Romanian woman to win a grand slam title after her manager Virginia Ruzici's 1978 Roland Garros win. It was not to be though. To make it a doubly difficult day for the 25-year-old, the defeat meant she also missed out on becoming world number one. Related CoverageOstapenko first talked of winning French Open at 10, says motherFactbox: French open champion Jelena OstapenkoFactbox: List of French Open women's singles champions I felt like a spectator out there at times,  Halep, who had points to lead 4-0 in the second set and was also 3-1 ahead in the decider, said after her second runner-up finish here.   She only has one game, either I can't touch it or it flies one meter out.  Ostapenko, who had the Parisian crowd roaring her on, reeled off the last five games to claim the title and become the youngest first-time female grand slam champion since Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova won the 2004 U.S. Open. Fittingly she thumped a backhand winner past Halep to seal victory, before tossing her distinctive green headband into the crowd with a look of disbelief. There was disbelief too, amongst those who had predicted Ostapenko would not be able to reproduce the kind of tennis that has lit up Roland Garros over the past fortnight. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 10, 2017   Romania’s Simona Halep lifts the runners up trophy after losing the final against Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko    Reuters / Benoit TessierSeven-times French Open champion Chris Evert was happy to stand corrected.  We didn't have the big names here this year but ... I have to say a star is born,  Evert, working as pundit for broadcaster Eurosport said. Ostapenko, who turned 20 on Thursday when she beat Swiss Timea Bacsinszky, will rocket to 12th in the rankings.  I mean I can't believe I'm champion at 20,  Ostapenko, the first woman to win the title from a set down since Jennifer Capriati in 2001, said on court. Slideshow (10 Images) I knew that Gustavo Kuerten won his first Roland Garros the day I was born, I have no words.  There were a couple of games when everything went my way and I was ready to fight for every point.  In baking sunshine Ostapenko began the match by breaking Halep's serve with three clean winners and ended it, two hours later with two scintillating backhands. What came in between was rollercoaster ride. Halep, with cheers of 'Simona' ringing out from her fans slowly roasting in the upper tiers of Philippe Chatrier Court, settled into a rhythm and broke three times to take the opener as Ostapenko's error count soared to 23. Ostapenko seemed to be unraveling in the second set as a series of shots either stung the net or flew long, allowing Halep to move 3-0 ahead. The Romanian then had break points to make it 4-0 but Ostapenko held firm to massive cheers. Back on the attack Ostapenko surged 4-3 ahead only for more errors to allow Halep to break back for 4-4.

{"content":"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan coastguards recovered the bodies of eight migrants from an inflatable boat found east of Tripoli on Saturday, with dozens of other migrants feared missing, a spokesman said.  In general this type of boat carries 100 to 110 people, so we do not know what has happened to the others,  said Issa al-Zaroog, a coastguard spokesman in the town of Garabulli. It was not clear how the migrants, whose bodies were spotted by fishermen, had died, coastguard officials said. Earlier, Tripoli coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem said one Bangladeshi migrant had been killed and two wounded in crossfire when coastguards from Zawiya, just west of Tripoli, had clashed on Friday with smugglers escorting migrant boats out to sea. Qassem said two rubber boats and a wooden vessel carrying some 570 migrants had been intercepted near Sabratha, west of Tripoli, triggering the clashes, and that coastguards had destroyed a boat and a jet-ski used by smugglers, arresting three of them. But afterwards a further five rubber migrant boats got away after smugglers had fired at the coastguard from the shore and from boats, Qassem said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said separately that 380 migrants in three rubber boats had been intercepted off Zawiya and brought back to Libya on Friday, and that another 438 were intercepted on Saturday.    Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea, with the number making the crossing rising sharply since 2014. So far this year more than 61,000 migrants have arrived in Italy after crossing the central Mediterranean, according to the IOM. Most are packed onto ill-equipped vessels by Libyan smugglers, and are rescued by European ships once they reach international waters.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that the digital world needs regulations like those that exist for financial markets in the G20 and for trade under the World Trade Organization. Global policymakers are facing uncharted territory as emerging technologies open new frontiers for regulation with the inter-networking of smart devices and trends in the automation of factories, dubbed Industry 4.0 by German politicians.   We still have no international rules,  Merkel said alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto during a visit to Mexico City, stressing that there were important security concerns without common standards.  Otherwise some provider could emerge ... that's an island, and from which things could be done, relevant to security, that could destroy an entire system. On this question of the rules-based handling of it, we're still right at the start.  Germany wants to use its presidency of the Group of 20 major economies to develop a concrete plan on digital policy at a summit in July. Merkel pointed to an agreement by G20 nations to fight cyber attacks on the global banking system. Germany has said it wants to establish a common global plan to promote fast internet for all and agree on common technical standards at the G20 meeting in Hamburg next month. Europe and the United States needed to work together on ensuring sensible rules because standards had been very erratically set so far, Merkel said.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that putting up walls will not solve problems caused by immigration, challenging one of U.S. President Donald Trump's core principles, during her visit to Mexico. Trump's election pledge to build a massive wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drug traffickers has sparked anger throughout Mexico, plunging U.S.-Mexican relations to their lowest point in years. Speaking in Mexico City, Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany behind the Iron Curtain, said that history showed that only when empires have got on well with their neighbors have migration pressures been resolved successfully.  Obviously the main reason for people leaving must be addressed on site first, which means putting up walls and cutting oneself off will not solve the problem,  said Merkel, who has come under political pressure at home for opening German borders to more than one million refugees since 2015.  It's an issue you can study well in the history of China with the (Great) Wall of China, you can study it in the history of the Roman Empire. Essentially, only when great empires have managed to forge sensible relationships with their neighbors and to manage migration has it been a success,  she added.  I don't think that by simply improving the border facilities you can solve the problem,  she told a panel discussion alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The key was to improve living standards and opportunities in afflicted areas, said Merkel, who did not mention Trump. Trump has backed away from a promise to make Mexico pay for the wall and has had to pare back his ambitions in seeking funds to build the barrier from the U.S. Congress, where Democrats and even some Republicans have criticized the plan. In another counterpoint to Trump, Merkel and Pena Nieto together affirmed their commitment to free trade during the German leader's visit to Latin America's No. 2 economy. Pena Nieto said Mexico will ensure that foreign investment in Mexico remains protected in talks sought by Trump to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has attacked Germany and Mexico for their trade surpluses with the United States and has vowed to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it in favor of the United States. Germany has made major investments in both Mexico and the United States, and Merkel said it was important not to forget the benefits that international trade had brought.  Through (international supply chains), wealth for a lot more people has been generated, and these value chains should not be destroyed again unnecessarily,  Merkel said.

{"content":"RIYADH (Reuters) - Gulf states traded public barbs on Saturday, showing little sign of resolving the region's deepest rift in years, five days after Arab nations severed diplomatic, trade and transport ties with the tiny Gulf kingdom of Qatar. Foreign leaders expressed growing concern over the dispute, which pits Qatar against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt. With backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, they accuse Qatar of supporting their regional arch-rival Iran as well as Islamist militants. Kuwait has led a regional effort to mediate, but the four states intensified the pressure on Friday by placing dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar on terrorism blacklists. [nL8N1J56SD] A senior UAE official followed on Saturday by calling Qatar  duplicitous , alleging in a series of tweets that its funding of militants had sown chaos and violence throughout the region.  Qatar has been riding (the) tiger of extremism & terrorism. Cost to region & world too high,  tweeted Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs.  Diplomacy only way forward. Process can only work following clear indication that Qatar will stop support & finance of extremism & terrorism.   Clear and Transparent  Qatar's foreign minister fired back that there was  no clarity  in such accusations, speaking in an interview with RT Arabic in Moscow after emerging from talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

He denied that Qatar supported Egypt's outlawed Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip. He dismissed as  fantasy  a Saudi media report that he had met in Baghdad with the head of Iran's Quds Force, controlled by Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards. He said Qatar remained committed to a Kuwaiti-led mediation effort, but that he had yet to receive a clear list of demands. As conciliation efforts in the Gulf appeared to stall, leaders in Russia, Turkey, Germany and the United States expressed increasing concern.

[nL1N1J7049][nB4N1FT00I] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Sheikh al-Thani of Moscow's concern and called for talks.  And Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan - who has pledged food and troops to Qatar in the face of a blockade from its neighbours - hosted Bahrain's foreign minister and urged that the dispute be resolved by the end of the holy month of Ramadan. [nL8N1J70F5] Mixed Messages However, mixed messages from U.S. officials appeared to complicate the diplomacy, as Gulf media cited selectively from divergent statements to bolster their positions.  Saudi Arabia and Bahrain issued statements welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump's demand the previous day for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, while ignoring a U.S. State Department call for them to ease pressure. Saudi Arabia said it was committed to  decisive and swift action to cut off all funding sources for terrorism  in a statement carried by the state news agency SPA, while Bahrain hailed U.S. efforts to ensure  international solidarity  on the issue. The United Arab Emirates praised Trump's  leadership in challenging Qatar's troubling support for extremism  in a separate statement released on Friday. [nL1N1J61RY] Trump had accused Qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism on Friday, even as the Pentagon and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a blockade imposed by Arab states and others. [nL8N1J61K3] A separate SPA report on Saturday acknowledged Tillerson's call for Qatar to curtail support for terrorism, without mentioning that he had also said the crisis was hurting ordinary Qataris, impairing business and harming the U.S. fight against the Islamic State militant group. Saudi Arabia said its action followed the conclusions of last month's Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, where Trump delivered a speech about Islamist extremism. Trump said he had helped to plan the move against Qatar, although a senior administration official told Reuters this week that Washington had had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis during the visit that they would sever ties with Qatar.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who became a reality television star with a show called  The Apprentice,  will spend a lot of time next week promoting a plan to expand apprenticeships to help companies find more skilled workers to fill jobs, the White House said. It would be the second consecutive week in which the White House will make a push to show Trump is moving ahead on his top domestic priority - jobs - in spite of investigations into whether he had anything to do with possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump has refuted those allegations, which have overshadowed his efforts to boost economic growth. Last week was branded  infrastructure week  with a series of events dealing with fixing the nation's decrepit roads and bridges, another plank in Trump's jobs platform. But a congressional hearing on the Russia imbroglio featuring James Comey - the FBI director Trump fired - sucked up all the attention in Washington. Next week will be  workforce development week  where the White House highlights plans to combat the skills gap. U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April with government data showing employers struggling to find workers with the right skills. Trump's plan has been in the works for months, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, adviser Reed Cordish, and Trump's secretaries of labor, education and commerce. The White House was mum on the precise details of Trump's plan to expand apprenticeships ahead of his unveiling it in a speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.     A real estate developer who is familiar with the use of U.S. President Donald Trump reacts to a reporter's question during a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017.apprenticeship programs in the building trades, Trump has praised Germany's apprenticeship system as a model.     Ivanka Trump discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House in March, and toured a Siemens training center in Berlin in April. Trump will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to visit a training program at Waukesha County Technical College with Republican Governor Scott Walker, a former rival in the race to become the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump will hold a roundtable on the issue with 15 CEOs at the White House. The president will then meet with eight governors on Thursday to discuss the topic at the White House. The White House declined to say which CEOs and governors would be there. One thing that likely will not be in Trump's plan: a surge in spending. The White House expects the private sector to take the lead.  A senior White House official said the federal government had allocated $16.7 billion to 43 job training programs in 13 agencies in fiscal 2017.  It's not a money question.

{"content":"TBILISI, June 10 (Reuters) - Russian energy firm InterRAO has begun arbitration proceedings in Stockholm against Georgia over electricity tariffs, Georgia's deputy energy minister said.  We have now received a notification from the arbitration court and (are) ready to defend our position there,  Mariam Valishvili told Reuters. InterRAO confirmed that it had started judicial proceedings.  InterRAO Group confirms that its two Dutch subsidiaries have filed two lawsuits against the Georgian government with the International Court of Arbitration,  the company's press department said. InterRAO wants to raise its electricity tariffs as well as seek compensation for losses stemming from Georgia's currency devaluation, Valishvili said. InterRAO did not specify how much it was seeking in compensation but a source close to the company told Reuters that it was $125 million as of May 1. The company bought two hydro-power plants in Georgia in 2011. The Khrami-1 and Khrami-2- plants have a capacity of 227 megawatts. InterRAO also owns a 75.11 percent stake in electricity distribution company Telasi, which serves the capital Tbilisi. It holds its assets in Georgia through its Dutch subsidiaries. Valishvili said that the government had offered to go to Georgia's state regulatory commission to find a solution over InterRAO's tariffs for electricity from its two plants.  Correction of these tariffs may be done, if the commission makes such a decision,  Valishvili said. She said that a lawsuit on Telasi was more complicated.  InterRAO did not make any investment in Telasi and even got bigger dividends than expected. Why should we pay compensation?  she said.  Our position is strong and I'm confident that we can prove it in court.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than two dozen U.S. lawmakers have urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reject the proposed sale of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK) to China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd (1333.HK) to protect U.S. security interests. In a June 9 letter to Mnuchin shared with Reuters, the 27 lawmakers said it would be a  strategic misstep  to allow the $2.33 billion sale to go ahead.  It is critical that CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) exercise extreme caution when a foreign investment transaction includes the transfer of military proficiencies and sensitive technology to China,  the lawmakers wrote. They added:  It would be a serious strategic misstep to permit a company like Zhongwang Holdings Ltd to take control of a U.S. aluminum firm like Aleris.   The lawmakers said Aleris was involved in the production and testing of specialized alloys used by the defense industry, and the company's research and technology were critical to U.S. economic and national security interests.  Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, often maintain relationships with China's military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,  they wrote. Additionally, Zhongwang was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce for allegedly evading U.S. import duties, and was being probed by U.S. agencies over allegations of smuggling, conspiracy and wire fraud, they said.

{"content":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Federal Court urged a thorough investigation into reports that the country's secret security service spied on Justice Edson Fachin, in the latest clash involving President Michel Temer's embattled administration. Court president Carmen Lúcia said in a statement on Saturday that, if proved accurate, such reports show an inadmissible meddling into the court and an attack against democratic liberties in Latin America's biggest country.  Magazine Veja reported late on Friday that the agency known as Abin might have been used to spy on Fachin - the top court justice in charge of a massive corruption probe that has ensnared Temer.  Temer's office denied the Veja report, saying the Abin  acts in accordance with the purpose for which it has been created .  If the report proves accurate, Lúcia said in the statement,  punishment of the alleged espionage should take into account the grave  legal, political and institutional consequences of such an act.   Common in dictatorships, these practices ... are serious and, when carried out against a judge, are completely unacceptable in a democracy,  Lúcia said in the statement.  It has to be probed and repudiated, and any responsible parties properly punished.  Her remarks add to tension between the executive and judiciary branches of power, which gained intensity in the wake of Fachin's decision to validate a plea deal involving Temer in a corruption probe. Prosecutors allege that Temer worked to obstruct justice and condoned efforts to pay for the silence of a potential witness.

{"content":"JYVASKYLA, Finland (Reuters) - Finland's eurosceptic Finns party picked an anti-immigration hardliner as its leader on Saturday in a move that the prime minister said might lead to a break-up of the ruling coalition. At a Finns party congress, 56 percent of those voting backed  European Parliament member Jussi Halla-aho, who wants Finland to leave the European Union. Halla-aho, who was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said he will push the three-party coalition to tighten immigration policies, and that he will not stay in the government at any price.  We must be more aggressive in raising the topics that distinguish us from other parties ... it is important to push our priorities forward more vigorously within the government program,  Halla-aho told reporters after his election. Prime Minister Juha Sipila, citing differences in core values, said that there was a risk the centre-right government could break up due to Halla-aho's nomination.  Of course (there is a risk of break-up). This is a tough spot for the government,  Sipila, from the Centre Party, told daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The third coalition partner, the pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) also said it might not want to cooperate.  This requires serious contemplation. The Finns party is not the same party anymore,  Finance Minister Petteri Orpo told Verkkouutiset, an online news site. As snap elections are very rare in the Nordic country, a break-up of the coalition would likely mean that Sipila would try to form a new one. That could derail healthcare and local government reforms central to Sipila's plan to balance public finances. Sipila is due to meet Halla-aho and Orpo on Monday. FILE PHOTO - Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila listens to media after government's open session for members of public took place during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Finnish independence in Porvoo, Finland May 4, 2017.Ints KalninsThe party congress also replaced all three deputy leaders with hardline anti-immigration politicians Laura Huhtasaari, Teuvo Hakkarainen and Juho Eerola. Hakkarainen earlier this year was fined for a Facebook post calling for a Muslim-free Finland, which a district court said amounted to agitation against an ethnic group.     Right-Wing Populism Slideshow (6 Images)Formerly the True Finns, the party is known for having complicated EU bailout talks during the euro zone crisis. But after becoming the second-biggest party in parliament in 2015, it joined the coalition government and accepted compromises, angering core voters. Support for the Finns party has plunged from 17.7 percent in a 2015 election to about 9 percent in a poll this month. Mari K Niemi, a researcher at University of Turku, said the party, which had sought to represent underprivileged people from rural areas, was becoming a more radical right-wing populist party.  Young, sometimes educated people with an anti-immigration focus have become a more significant power within the party,  she said, comparing the party's new profile to the far-right Sweden Democrats and France's National Front. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation and problems including the decline of Nokia's former phone business. The government has sought to boost growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws.  If the coalition continues, it gets more and more difficult for the parties to agree on anything. And if the government broke up, a new coalition would surely change the current fiscal policy program,  said Nordea analyst Jan Von Gerich. Outgoing Finns party leader and co-founder Timo Soini - a moderate populist who mostly focused on criticising the EU - stepped down after 20 years. It was unclear whether he would stay on as foreign minister.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - Few other people saw it coming but Jelena Ostapenko's mother was not surprised that her daughter burst into the limelight to claim the French Open title in spectacular fashion on Saturday. The unseeded Ostapenko, 20, downed Romanian third seed Simona Halep 4-6 6-4 6-3 in the final, hitting a staggering 54 winners and taking her tournament tally to 299. Those numbers are counter-balanced by her unforced errors -- 54 on Saturday and 271 in total -- but they were not enough to stop the energy-charged Ostapenko from bulldozing her way to the title, firing faster forehands on average than men's world number one Andy Murray. Asked when she realized her daughter had so much power, Jelena Jakovleva said:  The day she was born.  She had the same energy when she was little, it was very difficult,  Jakovleva, who coaches her daughter, told a group of reporters at Roland Garros.  She danced, swam, played tennis, she played football because she had so much energy.  She's fearless, she fights for every point.  Ostapenko was 10 when she first mentioned winning the French Open one day, Jakovleva said.  She was on an excursion with her father at Roland Garros and she said maybe one time I will become a champion here.

Jakovleva stayed home in Latvia during the first week of this year's French Open but even after she arrived in Paris she could not watch her daughter's matches from the stands.  I was nervous,  she said.  And Jelena has more focus if I'm not there.  At the Australian Open, Ostapenko lost her nerve in the third round when serving for the match at 5-2 in the decider against Karolina Pliskova, eventually losing 4-6 6-0 10-8.  At the Australian Open she played very well but lost when 5-2 up. We worked on that and changed a few things and she now is psychologically stronger,  Jakovleva explained. Ostapenko, who will rise to world number 12 from 47 following Saturday's win, also worked a lot on her forehand, which was then her weakest shot.  Her forehand was so-so. So she worked hard on it.  Halep realized just how hard her opponent had worked on that on Saturday.  She can take the racket out of your hands,  Halep's coach  Darren Cahill said.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday denied he tried to interfere with an FBI investigation, effectively accusing James Comey, the FBI's former director, of lying under oath to Congress. Comey delivered scathing remarks about the president on Thursday at a congressional hearing and testified that Trump had asked him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia.  Trump said Comey's testimony also vindicated him from allegations that he colluded with Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true,  Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Asked by a reporter if he had told Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Flynn, Trump said,  I didn't say that.  The reporter then asked,  So he lied about that?   Well, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that,  Trump replied.  And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today, but I did not say that,  he said.

I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that?  Trump said. Comey's testimony was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years. The issue of the Trump election campaign's relationship with Russia has dogged Trump's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and alleged Russian meddling.

On Friday, the leaders of the House of Representatives intelligence committee's investigation said they had asked Comey for his notes and memos about his discussions with Trump, and asked the White House to produce any recordings or memos of conversations between Trump and Comey. Trump declined to answer questions from reporters about whether recordings existed.  I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future,  he said. Trump’s offer to testify under oath would pit his word against Comey’s before federal investigators. If either Trump’s testimony or memos written by Comey about his conversations with the president turn out to be untrue, either man could be charged with lying to federal investigators. A U.S. president is given a wide array of immunities from criminal prosecutions. The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted, and the area is the subject of legal debate. A president can be charged after leaving office. Trump wrote earlier on Friday on Twitter that the former FBI head had vindicated him by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had not been personally under investigation in the Russia probe. With a single tweet, Trump also castigated Comey as  a leaker  for giving an account of his conversation with the president to a law professor who shared it with a news outlet.  Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication ... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!  Trump tweeted.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should consider imposing a  quiet period  immediately before the federal election in September, similar to a media policy in place in France, election director Dieter Sarreither said, amid concerns about possible meddling by Russia.  We should discuss it and examine whether such steps are necessary,  Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Saturday. France has a 24-hour ban on media reports that could affect a French election before polls open.  The measure helped to prevent more widespread reporting of a massive hack that released emails, documents and financing information just before campaigning ended ahead of the May election. The German government last month warned political parties to step up their defenses against hacking after the leak of emails  which belonged to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron before he was elected French president. The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency in May accused Russian rivals of gathering large amounts of political data in cyber attacks that the Kremlin might decide to put to use ahead of Germany's September election. Russia denies any meddling in U.S. or European elections. Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag that he had created a task force to examine the risks of a cyber attack on the German election, and the BSI federal cyber agency was continually testing the election network.  He said the testing had shown that certain elements of the system's information technology - which were two to three years old - required updates, but gave no further details. He said a major test of the election system and infrastructure was planned for the Saturday before the Sept. 24 election. German votes are cast on paper, with results tabulated by hand and eventually entered into a computer system.

{"content":"INF Taylor Featherston was traded Friday to Tampa Bay for cash considerations. Featherston, who was batting .270 with three homers and 20 RBI for the Phillies' Triple-A team at Lehigh Valley, was called up to the Rays and will serve as a backup on their injury-depleted roster. Featherston has batted .156 in 180 major league at-bats the last two years with the Los Angeles Angels and Philadelphia. RF Steve Souza Jr. was a double short of a cycle on Friday but went 3-for-4 with a 453-foot home run and three RBIs and two runs scored. It is the fifth time this season that Souza Jr. has had a three-hit game. He has six home runs in his past 14 games. RHP Alex Cobb improved his record to 5-5 after giving up one run and four hits in six innings on Friday. He struck out five and threw 96 pitches (65 strikes).  We could have kept him in longer,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  But the situation of the game gave us the opportunity to use other guys.  DH Corey Dickerson went 1-for-5 with a three-run homer in the fifth inning on Friday that traveled 429 feet. Dickerson is second on the team with 14 home runs and tied for fourth with 29 RBIs. C Jesus Sucre went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and two runs scored on Friday. Sucre moved his season average up to .254.  Jesus was a little frustrated in his last start because he hit the ball on the screws and didn't get the results,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  But he has been solid for us in situations with runners on base.  OF Kevin Kiermaier was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday with a right hip fracture. Kiermaier, a two-time Gold Glove winner, will need 6-8 weeks before he can resume baseball activities. Kiermaier is hitting .258 with seven home runs this season. 1B Rickie Weeks was placed on the 10-day DL retroactive to June 7 with a right shoulder impingement. Weeks is hitting .216 in 37 games.  Rickie is old school so he isn't going to complain unless its broken,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  But we knew something wasn't right with him.

RHP Greg Holland posted his MLB-leading 23rd save in as many chances on Friday in a 5-3 win over Chicago, but he made it into a nail-biter. After striking out Kyle Schwarber to start the ninth, Holland walked Ian Happ, Kris Bryant and and Anthony Rizzo to load the bases. He escaped the jam by getting Ben Zobrist to pop out and striking out Jason Heyward.  I didn't have command early in the inning,  Holland said.

LHP Matt Moore struggled through another troublesome fourth inning in Friday's loss to the Minnesota Twins. Moore surrendered a bases-clearing double to counterpart RHP Ervin Santana in a three-run Twins fourth that completed the game's scoring. The three earned runs raised Moore's fourth-inning ERA to 9.49 this season. RHP Sam Dyson was added to the Giants' 25-man roster Friday and was available during the club's 4-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins. He saw no action in the game. Dyson was acquired from the Texas Rangers on Tuesday for a player to be named. INF/OF Aaron Hill logged his 1,500th career hit with a third-inning triple in Friday's loss to the Minnesota Twins. The triple was the first of the season in 23 games for the first-year Giant. More than half of Hill's 1,500 hits (881) came in seven seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in his career. RHP Jeff Samardzija will look to beat the Minnesota Twins for the fifth time in their last six meetings when he pitches the middle game of a three-game interleague series Saturday. Samardzija has a 4-1 record and 5.21 ERA in six career starts against the Twins, but those marks are 4-0 with a 3.67 ERA in his last five head-to-heads.

The 28-year-old was greeted with a single by Rockies reliever Chris Rusin, then gave up by a two-run homer to Charlie Blackmon and took the loss. LHP and long-relief specialist Mike Montgomery made his first start of the season and went four innings, allowing two runs -- on Ryan Hanigan's homer -- and striking out five in a no-decison.  I wasn't able to those quick outs,  Montgomery said.  I knew that I had to battle. The pitch count (73) got up a little bit, but you have to give their team credit for that.  INF Addison Russell rejoined the Cubs on Friday after the team told him to take off Thursday's game against the Rockies in the wake of a domestic violence allegation on social media. Russell was available off the bench and manager Joe Maddon hopes to get Russell, who has struggled at the plate, back into the lineup soon.  We'll just treat him normally and get him back on the field,  Maddon said. Russell was accused of  mental and physical  abuse against his wife, Melisa, by someone claiming to be a family friend -- with the Instagram handle @carlierreed -- in a post on a now-removed account. RHP Kyle Hendricks, placed on the DL on Thursday with tendinitis in his pitching hand, missed his scheduled start Friday. He hopes to rejoin the rotation next week in Pittsburgh.

Wong homered Thursday in a rehab game at Class A Peoria. In 37 games before going on the DL late last month, Wong was batting .278 with a homer and 16 RBIs, but he has also struggled defensively and made critical errors on the bases. RHP Michael Wacha finally lasted past the fifth inning in a start for the first time since May 19 and was rewarded with his first win since April 19. Wacha allowed five hits and two runs in six innings, giving up two walks and striking out two. While he attracted just eight swings and misses in 87 pitches, a low number for a pitcher with strikeout stuff, he did retire seven of the last eight batters he faced. RHP Carlos Martinez takes the ball Saturday for the middle game of a three-game set with Philadelphia. Martinez unraveled in the seventh inning of a 4-2 loss Monday night in Cincinnati, allowing all four runs after cruising through six shutout innings and taking a 2-0 lead to the seventh. He's 2-0 with a 3.21 ERA in five career outings, two of them starts, against the Phillies. C Yadier Molina (lower back stiffness) was scratched from the lineup less than 90 minutes before first pitch and replaced by Eric Fryer on Friday night. Molina played Thursday in Cincinnati after getting a maintenance day Wednesday, going 2-for-4. It was just the eighth time in 59 games this year that Molina wasn't able to answer the bell. His status for Saturday wasn't known. INF Jhonny Peralta was designated for assignment on Friday. Peralta has been relegated to backup duty with shortstop Aledmys Diaz and third baseman Jedd Gyorko firmly in control of their starting positions on the left side of the infield.

He was battling,  said manager Dusty Baker. 3B Anthony Rendon, after getting Thursday off, started and was at his normal spot in the No. 6 hole in the order. Some local pundits have called for Rendon to bat second while Jayson Werth is on the disabled list.

Rendon was 1-for-3 against Texas and is hitting .292. RHP Joe Blanton came out of his minor league rehab stint feeling good, manager Dusty Baker said Friday. Blanton pitched a scoreless inning Thursday for Double-A Harrisburg of the Eastern League. Baker said Blanton will make another appearance for Harrisburg at some point and then plan to pitch back-to-back games in the minors.  Joe said he felt good. As long as he feels good we feel good,  Baker said. Will Blanton be used at the back end of the bullpen when he comes back?  It depends on him,  Baker said.

{"content":"(Re-casts after Serie A announces new tender) ROME, June 10 (Reuters) - Italy's Serie A soccer league said on Saturday it was launching a new tender for television rights to transmit matches for the seasons from 2018-2021 after private broadcaster Mediaset made no bid in the original tender.  We don't believe the offers received represent the real value of Italian soccer,  the League's president Carlo Tavecchio told reporters after a meeting of club representatives in Milan.

Earlier on Saturday, the deadline for bids in the original tender, Mediaset said it had presented no offer for the first time ever, leaving Sky as the only major participant. Earlier this month Mediaset lodged a complaint with Italy's antitrust watchdog and communications regulator to try to change the conditions for the tender, which it said penalised it unfairly.  We reiterate that the terms for presenting offers are totally unacceptable,  it said in a statement on Saturday. Tavecchio said the new tender would close in November or December of this year. Mediaset stressed that its decision not to bid for the three seasons from 2018-19 would have no impact on the upcoming 2017-2018 season, for which it has already bought the rights to transmit Serie A and UEFA Champions League matches.

{"content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday called for the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump violated the constitution by accepting foreign payments at his hotels. The lawsuit, filed in January, said Trump violates the Constitution's  emoluments  clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons. In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case - an ethics non-profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker - do not have legal standing to sue.  The government also said payments to Trump's hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president.  Plaintiffs' broad-brush claims effectively assert that the Constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses,  the department said in its court filing.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should consider imposing a  quiet period  immediately before the federal election in September, similar to a media policy in place in France, election director Dieter Sarreither said, amid concerns about possible meddling by Russia.  We should discuss it and examine whether such steps are necessary,  Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Saturday. France has a 24-hour ban on media reports that could affect a French election before polls open.  The measure helped to prevent more widespread reporting of a massive hack that released emails, documents and financing information just before campaigning ended ahead of the May election. The German government last month warned political parties to step up their defenses against hacking after the leak of emails  which belonged to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron before he was elected French president. The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency in May accused Russian rivals of gathering large amounts of political data in cyber attacks that the Kremlin might decide to put to use ahead of Germany's September election. Russia denies any meddling in U.S. or European elections. Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag that he had created a task force to examine the risks of a cyber attack on the German election, and the BSI federal cyber agency was continually testing the election network.  He said the testing had shown that certain elements of the system's information technology - which were two to three years old - required updates, but gave no further details. He said a major test of the election system and infrastructure was planned for the Saturday before the Sept. 24 election.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Adam West, who earned a place in American pop culture history with his campy portrayal of the title character in the classic 1960s TV series  Batman,  has died at age 88, his family said on Saturday. West, who was so closely identified with Batman for the rest of his life that it was both a blessing and a curse for him, died on Friday evening after a short struggle with leukemia, his representative told Variety.   He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy,  his family said on the actor's Twitter page.  The live-action  Batman  show, starring West along with Burt Ward as his sidekick Robin and a collection of colorful villains, was inspired by a long-running comic book series. It ran only three seasons from 1966 to 1968 on the ABC network, but became a television phenomenon and cult classic. It also spawned a  Batman  feature film in 1966. West portrayed Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne as painfully earnest, straight-laced, clean-cut and trustworthy. The darker aspects of the Batman character - mined so successfully in later film versions - were ignored. The show's various memorable villains - Cesar Romero as the Joker, Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Julie Newmar as Catwoman - were allowed to chew the scenery. Numerous Hollywood luminaries stepped in to play Batman's demented adversaries in the show's 120 episodes.  He was bright, witty and fun to work with,  Newmar said on Saturday in a statement.  I will miss him in the physical world and savor him always in the world of imagination and creativity.        After the cancellation of the series, West found it difficult to land other acting jobs, even though he was an established film and TV actor, because he had become so linked to the Batman role. Eventually he came to accept that his identity was closely intertwined with the masked crime-fighting hero in the black cape whether he liked it or not. He often was hired to play a comically fictionalized version of himself in live-action and animated roles and became a successful voice actor. On the long-running animated series  Family Guy,  he provided the voice of the character Mayor Adam West. He played himself for years on the animated  The Fairly OddParents  and appeared on the venerable animated series  The Simpsons.  West also voiced the Caped Crusader and other characters in numerous animated incarnations of Batman. FILE PHOTO - Actor Adam West poses for photographers at a ceremony where he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles April 5, 2012.Phil McCarten'Curious Stirrings'   We had some very good writers for the original show,  West said in a 2010 interview with the Slice of SciFi website.  They saw the craziness, the comedy. You know, just as he's about to put her in (jail), Batman says to Catwoman, 'You give me curious stirrings in my utility belt.' That's funny stuff.   In protecting Gotham City from super criminals, Batman and Robin invariably would find their lives threatened in some fiendish trap, only to escape using their endless ingenuity. For example, Robin was once nearly swallowed alive by a giant clam in an episode with the Joker. Batman and Robin were nearly turned into frozen desserts - Frosty Freezies - in an episode with famed film director Otto Preminger as Mr. Freeze. Slideshow (4 Images)Like some other actors who became inseparable in the minds of fans from a character they played - Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock on  Star Trek  is another example - West long resented his association with Batman but learned to like it.  I think it was a very simple deduction. I think any intelligent person would come to the same conclusion,  he said in 2010.  And that is: if I am being turned down for other roles because of my association with Batman, then maybe what I should do is really embrace Batman. Pursue it and keep it alive, which is what I've been trying to do for 30 years.  Bob Kane, who created Batman in 1939, seemed to agree. West kept a drawing of Batman by Kane, who inscribed it:  To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation.  While struggling to land post-Batman acting roles, West turned to making personal appearances wearing the Batman cape and cowl - some rather undignified, as when he appeared on a Memphis pro wrestling program opposite wrestler Jerry  The King  Lawler. West was born as William  Billy  Anderson in Washington state in 1928. He took the name Adam West when he came to Hollywood in 1959. Pre- Batman,  he co-starred in the 1965 Three Stooges feature film  The Outlaws Is Coming  and the 1964 sci-fi film  Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  But it was his performance in a TV commercial that caught the notice of the  Batman  producers.  They'd seen a series of commercials I'd done for Nestle Quick instant milkshake in which I did a kind of spoof on the James Bond character,  West told Bizarre magazine in 2004.  They saw the commercials and thought, 'Hey, maybe this is the guy that can play the character in the way that we envision it.'

{"content":"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania's government signed a $154 million contract on Saturday with the state-run China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to expand the main port in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. Tanzania is seeking financing for infrastructure projects as part of its plans to transform the country into a regional transport and trade hub. Under the contract funded by a World Bank loan, CHEC, a subsidiary of the state-run China Communications Construction Co Ltd, will build a roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) terminal and deepen and strengthen seven berths at Dar es Salaam port. Tanzania hopes expansion of the port will increase container throughput to 28 million tonnes a year by 2020 from around 20 million tonnes currently.  Deepening and strengthening of the berths will allow big container ships to dock in Dar es Salaam. All these efforts are being done in order to increase competitiveness of the port,  works, transport and communications minister Makame Mbarawa said at the signing of the contract. East Africa's second-biggest economy wants to profit from its long coastline and upgrade its rickety railways and roads to serve the growing economies in the land-locked heart of Africa. Big gas finds in Tanzania and oil discoveries in Kenya and Uganda have turned East Africa into an exploration hotspot for oil firms, but transport infrastructure in those countries has suffered from decades of under-investment. Tanzania said in January it will receive a $305 million loan from the World Bank to expand its main port, where congestion and inefficiencies are hampering service delivery. The port, whose main rival is the bigger but also congested port of Mombasa in Kenya, acts as a trade gateway for landlocked African states such as Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Burundi and Uganda, as well as the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Bank said in a 2014 report that inefficiencies at  Dar es Salaam port were costing Tanzania and its neighbors up to $2.6 billion a year.  Chinese President Xi Jinping announced plans to plow $60 billion into African development projects at a summit in Johannesburg in 2015, saying it would boost agriculture, build roads, ports and railways and cancel some debt.

{"content":"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Bahrain's Foreign Minister that the dispute between Qatar and other Arab states should be resolved by the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday. Erdogan on Friday vowed to keep supporting Qatar after his rapid approval of legislation on deploying Turkish troops there, as the Gulf state faces isolation by fellow Arab states. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran - allegations Qatar says are baseless. Several countries followed suit. In a joint news conference with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, Cavusoglu said Turkey would continue its efforts to resolve the dispute through dialogue.  Our president has also stressed the need to resolve this upsetting issue before the end of Ramadan, as it is against our religion, beliefs, and traditions, especially during the month of Ramadan,  Cavusoglu said. Sheikh Khaled, in comments translated from Arabic to Turkish, said he had told Erdogan about the actions of Qatar which led to the dispute, and added that there should be a guarantee that Qatar will not continue its current actions. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan meets with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa in Istanbul, Turkey June 10, 2017. Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSCavusoglu also said Turkey's military base in Qatar, where there are currently around 90 Turkish soldiers based, was aimed at contributing to the security of the entire Gulf region and was not aimed at a specific Gulf state. Sheikh Khaled welcomed Erdogan's comments during their meeting about the military base being for the whole region rather than one specific Gulf state.  Turkish mass-circulation newspaper Hurriyet reported on Friday that after an initial deployment of Turkish troops at a base in Doha, Turkish warplanes and ships will also be sent. It said a Turkish delegation would go to Qatar in the coming days to assess the situation at the base. Hurriyet said there were plans to send some 200 to 250 soldiers within two months in the initial stage, but the bill did not specify numbers or a timetable.  Erdogan also approved another accord between Turkey and Qatar on military training cooperation late on Thursday. Both bills were drawn up before the dispute erupted. Turkey has also pledged to provide food and water supplies to Qatar. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

After my talks this week, I know how serious the situation is, but I believe there are also good chances to make progress.

{"content":"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania's government signed a $154 million contract on Saturday with the state-run China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to expand the main port in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. Tanzania is seeking financing for infrastructure projects as part of its plans to transform the country into a regional transport and trade hub. Under the contract funded by a World Bank loan, CHEC, a subsidiary of the state-run China Communications Construction Co Ltd, will build a roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) terminal and deepen and strengthen seven berths at Dar es Salaam port. Tanzania hopes expansion of the port will increase container throughput to 28 million tonnes a year by 2020 from around 20 million tonnes currently.  Deepening and strengthening of the berths will allow big container ships to dock in Dar es Salaam. All these efforts are being done in order to increase competitiveness of the port,  works, transport and communications minister Makame Mbarawa said at the signing of the contract. East Africa's second-biggest economy wants to profit from its long coastline and upgrade its rickety railways and roads to serve the growing economies in the land-locked heart of Africa. Big gas finds in Tanzania and oil discoveries in Kenya and Uganda have turned East Africa into an exploration hotspot for oil firms, but transport infrastructure in those countries has suffered from decades of under-investment. Tanzania said in January it will receive a $305 million loan from the World Bank to expand its main port, where congestion and inefficiencies are hampering service delivery. The port, whose main rival is the bigger but also congested port of Mombasa in Kenya, acts as a trade gateway for landlocked African states such as Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Burundi and Uganda, as well as the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Bank said in a 2014 report that inefficiencies at  Dar es Salaam port were costing Tanzania and its neighbors up to $2.6 billion a year.  Chinese President Xi Jinping announced plans to plow $60 billion into African development projects at a summit in Johannesburg in 2015, saying it would boost agriculture, build roads, ports and railways and cancel some debt.

{"content":"(Refiles to remove extraneous word 'hold' from headline) ANKARA, June 10 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Bahrain's Foreign Minister that the dispute between Qatar and other Arab states should be resolved by the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday. Erdogan on Friday vowed to keep supporting Qatar after his rapid approval of legislation on deploying Turkish troops there, as the Gulf state faces isolation by fellow Arab states. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran - allegations Qatar says are baseless. Several countries followed suit. In a joint news conference with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, Cavusoglu said Turkey would continue its efforts to resolve the dispute through dialogue.  Our president has also stressed the need to resolve this upsetting issue before the end of Ramadan, as it is against our religion, beliefs, and traditions, especially during the month of Ramadan,  Cavusoglu said. Sheikh Khaled, in comments translated from Arabic to Turkish, said he had told Erdogan about the actions of Qatar which led to the dispute, and added that there should be a guarantee that Qatar will not continue its current actions. Cavusoglu also said Turkey's military base in Qatar, where there are currently around 90 Turkish soldiers based, was aimed at contributing to the security of the entire Gulf region and was not aimed at a specific Gulf state. Sheikh Khaled welcomed Erdogan's comments during their meeting about the military base being for the whole region rather than one specific Gulf state. Turkish mass-circulation newspaper Hurriyet reported on Friday that after an initial deployment of Turkish troops at a base in Doha, Turkish warplanes and ships will also be sent. It said a Turkish delegation would go to Qatar in the coming days to assess the situation at the base. Hurriyet said there were plans to send some 200 to 250 soldiers within two months in the initial stage, but the bill did not specify numbers or a timetable. Erdogan also approved another accord between Turkey and Qatar on military training cooperation late on Thursday. Both bills were drawn up before the dispute erupted. Turkey has also pledged to provide food and water supplies to Qatar. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbours. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

{"content":"HARRISBURG, Pa., June 10 (Reuters) - About two dozen rallies were planned across the United States on Saturday to denounce sharia law, the Islamic legal and moral code that organizers say poses a threat to American freedoms but critics believe is camouflage for anti-Muslims hatred. ACT for America, a self-described grassroots organization focusing on national security issues, has scheduled protests in New York, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Seattle, as well as many smaller cities. Hundreds of people pledged on social media to attend. At a rally on the steps of the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg, the atmosphere was tense. Barricades and a heavy police presence, including officers mounted on horses, separated about 60 anti-sharia demonstrators from an equal number of counter-protesters, most of them in black face masks and hoods. Nearly dozen men carrying sidearms belonging to the anti-government Oath Keepers were on hand, invited by ACT to provide security. On its website, ACT described sharia, which covers many aspects of Muslim life including religious obligations and financial dealings, as incompatible with human rights. It said sharia justifies the oppression of women and homosexuality, and advocate female genital mutilation. But critics say the organization vilifies Muslims and has repeatedly equated Islam with extremism. In their view, the rallies are part of a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by President Donald Trump, who called for an outright ban on Muslims entering the country during his election campaign. A representative for ACT for America could not be reached for comment. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country's largest Muslim advocacy group, urged Americans to participate in one of several local educational events being organized in  a peaceful challenge to Saturday's hate rallies.  It also warned Muslims to take extra precautions against potential violence over the weekend. Oath Keepers said on its website that it was  answering the call to defend free speech against those who would use terrorist violence or the threat of violence to shut it down.  It describes itself as a  nonpartisan association of current and former military, police, and first responders  sworn to defend the U.S. Constitution. The Southern Poverty Law Center says it is the  one of the largest radical antigovernment group in the United States,  organized around a  set of baseless conspiracy theories.  Refuse Fascism, a coalition of activists advocating confrontational tactics to oppose what it calls the Trump  regime,  said it would show up at the rallies  to counter the xenophobic hatred and lies, defy intimidation and drown it out.” It said anti-sharia organizers were actually  against all Muslims  and were creating a climate in which extremists felt emboldened to carry out attacks on Muslims.

{"content":"(Reuters) - An anonymous fan of Warren Buffett agreed to pay $2,679,001 at an online charity auction to have lunch with the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The winning bid came in the closing seconds of the five-day eBay auction, which drew 41 bids before ending on Friday night. It was lower than the record $3,456,789 bid in similar auctions in 2012 and 2016. Money will go to Glide, a San Francisco charity that provides food, health care and other services to the homeless, the impoverished, and people struggling with substance abuse. The successful bidder and up to seven friends will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. All topics are fair game apart from where Buffett will invest next. Buffett has held 18 annual auctions for Glide, raising about $26.3 million. He became involved with Glide after his first wife, Susan, became a volunteer, prior to her death in 2004.  We are very delighted and proud that Mr. Buffett has for years made sure that he participates,  the Rev. Cecil Williams, 87, co-founder of Glide and pastor since 1963 of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said after the auction ended. Contributions have a  tremendous impact  on people who find themselves  really unable to come to grips with the issue of poverty in urban America,  Williams said. Glide uses its $18 million annual budget to provide more than 750,000 free meals, emergency shelter for 8,500 people, 2,600 HIV and Hepatitis C tests, and day care and after school programs for nearly 450 children. Buffett, 86, is the world's fourth-richest person, worth $76.2 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is donating virtually all of his fortune to charity. Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager Ted Weschler, who paid a combined $5.25 million to win two auctions. He later became one of Buffett's investing deputies, and along with fellow deputy Todd Combs is likely to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after Buffett departs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, industrial, railroad, retail and other sectors. Buffett owns about 18 percent of the $419 billion company. The lunches that fetched $3,456,789 remain the most expensive items sold on eBay where all proceeds went to charity. Bidding moved online in 2003.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY/BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to bolster support among G20 members for tackling climate change ahead of a summit in Hamburg next month, while trying to avoid giving the impression she is rallying an anti-U.S. alliance, German government sources say. Merkel is ready for dissent at the meeting, however, after U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from a global climate change agreement, they said. Merkel told an audience in Argentina on Friday that as host of the G20, she would have to be up front about differences if all 20 highly industrialized countries failed to see eye to eye on climate and other issues, as the final communique requires unanimous consent.  There will be issues where not everyone gets what we want,  Merkel said, a clear nod to Trump's move to pull out of the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change days after refusing to endorse it at summits in Europe. At the same time, Merkel, a strong advocate of the Paris accord, must stay true to her views at home, where she is seeking a fourth term in office in September national elections and where Trump remains deeply unpopular. During visits to Argentina and Mexico, Merkel highlighted her shared views with the leaders of both countries on climate change, trade and other issues.  Germany is looking for allies on issues that are important to us,  Merkel said after a meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Saturday that her staff have drawn up a 13-page paper for the July G20 summit that includes specific references to the 2015 Paris agreement - setting up a potential showdown with Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested striking out the references to enable Trump to sign the communique, the magazine reported. Government sources say Merkel needs Trump's support to make the G20 summit a success, however, and his willingness to compromise could wane if he perceives her as his enemy. Indeed, she told students in Buenos Aires that it was vital to maintain dialogue even with those who hold different views.  Because if I talk with someone, I can no longer simply say he is stupid,  she said. Complicating the issue further for Merkel, however, her foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel of junior coalition partners the Social Democrats, wants as many G20 countries as possible to underscore their continued support for the Paris deal at the July summit.  The G20 cannot result in a silent unity against the climate agreement,  he told the magazine. A recent poll by Infratest dimap showed that only 21 percent of German voters viewed the United States as a reliable partner, a drop of eight percentage points from April that put it on the same level as Russia and far below China on 36 percent.

{"content":"BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party is seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers in exchange for supporting British Prime Minister Theresa May, a source close to the party said on Saturday.  May's Conservatives failed to secure an absolute majority in a parliamentary election on Thursday and need the DUP's 10 seats to be sure of being able to form a government. A senior Conservative lawmaker was in Belfast on Saturday for talks with the DUP, a spokeswoman for May's office said. The DUP has refused to give details in public of what concessions it might seek, and did not respond to a request for comment.  The source said the DUP was likely to seek a role in Brexit negotiations but was likely to steer clear of social issues such as abortion and gay rights, where it disagrees with Conservative Party positions.  It was also likely to seek to include Northern Ireland in the  Military Covenant , which ensures that veterans of the British armed forces receive priority medical treatment in the remainder of the United Kingdom. Such a move would be strongly opposed by the Irish nationalists of Sinn Fein who share power in Belfast under a 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of violence between nationalists and pro-British loyalists. It may also ask for measures to protect British soldiers accused of historical crimes related to the conflict, in which 3,600 people were killed. Concessions on such issues would seriously damage efforts by the DUP to secure a deal with Sinn Fein to restore Northern Ireland's devolved government, which collapsed in January. Failure in the talks could lead to a return to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, and fuel tensions that have in the recent past led to street violence and attacks by dissident nationalists.  Sinn Fein says former nationalist guerrillas and military personnel must be treated equally, and has accused the DUP of attempting to give immunity to former British soldiers accused of torture.  The DUP's demands are likely to be similar to a list it published before the 2015 general election, where the Conservatives ultimately secured a majority and did not need DUP support. That list included a demand for a cut in Northern Ireland's corporation tax rate to help it attract foreign investment.  It also asked for  constitutional stability for Northern Ireland , an apparent reference to efforts by Irish nationalists to seek a referendum on splitting from the United Kingdom and joining the Irish Republic.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he backs the NATO charter's demand that all members be prepared to defend each other, weeks after jarring allies by not restating U.S. support for the agreement. At a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Trump said he supports the NATO charter's Article 5, the requirement that each member of the alliance defend each other if they come under attack. Slideshow (3 Images)During a visit to NATO headquarters last month in Brussels, Trump had pointedly not mentioned U.S. support for the critical portion of the NATO charter. He used his speech there to demand that members pay more for the alliance's defense. A senior White House official later had said the United States does in fact support Article 5 simply by agreeing to the terms of the charter. But having not mentioned it himself, Trump sowed some doubts among allies and the ensuing controversy prompted Vice President Mike Pence to later express explicit U.S. support for the charter. Senior aides to Trump had tried to get a statement of explicit support for Article 5 in the president's NATO speech but it was not included, a senior administration official said.  I'm committing the United States to Article 5 and certainly we are there to protect and that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force,  Trump said.  But yes, absolutely I'd be committed to Article 5,  he said.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Development Minister Gerd Mueller, citing hunger crises in eastern Africa, said the United Nations should create a permanent 10 billion euro ($11.19 billion) crisis fund, with contributions to be based on a country's financial strength.  The catastrophe is already upon us,  Mueller said in an interview with the German newspaper Passauer Neue Presse,  published on Saturday. He pointed to dire conditions in countries such as Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Mueller said the United Nations estimated the financial needs in eastern Africa alone amounted to $4 billion to $5 billion. Creating a fund that would be continually restocked would make it easier to respond to recurring humanitarian crises, he said.    We need to accomplish this as a world community,  he said.  Ethiopia, for example, will run out of emergency food aid for 7.8 million people hit by severe drought by the end of this month, the Ethiopian government and humanitarian groups have said. The United Nations said in March that more than 20 million people risk dying from starvation because of drought and conflict in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria, while more than 100 million face acute malnutrition worldwide. Famine was declared in some areas of South Sudan in February - the first official famine in six years. Mueller spoke ahead of a conference in Berlin on Monday that Germany is hosting to call more attention to Africa during its presidency of the Group of 20 industrialized countries. Five countries - Ivory Coast, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia - have already signed up for enhanced partnership agreements with G20 countries under a new  Compact with Africa  program. It focuses on finding private investors in areas such as  energy production, agriculture and tourism. Ghana and Ethiopia have expressed interest in such partnerships, according to German officials. Germany - which has taken in more than a million migrants over the last two years - is pressing for industrialized countries to work to avert another massive refugee crisis, given growing economic and climate-related challenges in Africa.

{"content":"DUBAI (Reuters) - A move by four Arab states to blacklist dozens of figures with alleged links to Qatar could squeeze liquidity at Qatari banks which get a significant amount of their funding from the region. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said.  All types of deposits at banks in Qatar totaled 753 billion riyals at the end of March, according to central bank data. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNBK.QA) (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank (QISB.QA), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB.QA), Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan (MARK.QA) and Doha Bank (DOBK.QA) -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. Vehicles stop at a red light in front of the main branch of UAE Central Bank in Abu Dhabi, January 29, 2013.Ben JobThe move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbors, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.  It is especially challenging as they're not very liquid as their loan to deposit ratios are already above 100 percent,  Ghosh said. In recent years several have also expanded outside Qatar’s small domestic market to grow their business, with QNB holding a presence in several countries including Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria and UAE either directly or via affiliates. UAE banks would find it relatively easy to comply with the rules as many had invested in improving their compliance systems in recent years and already complied with sanctions against a range of other entities and individuals, another banker said.

It also asked for  constitutional stability for Northern Ireland , an apparent reference to efforts by Irish nationalists to seek a referendum on splitting from the United Kingdom and joining the Irish Republic.

{"content":"(Reuters) - An anonymous fan of Warren Buffett agreed to pay $2,679,001 at an online charity auction to have lunch with the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The winning bid came in the closing seconds of the five-day eBay auction, which drew 41 bids before ending on Friday night. It was lower than the record $3,456,789 bid in similar auctions in 2012 and 2016. Money will go to Glide, a San Francisco charity that provides food, health care and other services to the homeless, the impoverished, and people struggling with substance abuse. The successful bidder and up to seven friends will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. All topics are fair game apart from where Buffett will invest next. Buffett has held 18 annual auctions for Glide, raising about $26.3 million. He became involved with Glide after his first wife, Susan, became a volunteer, prior to her death in 2004.  We are very delighted and proud that Mr. Buffett has for years made sure that he participates,  the Rev. Cecil Williams, 87, co-founder of Glide and pastor since 1963 of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said after the auction ended. Contributions have a  tremendous impact  on people who find themselves  really unable to come to grips with the issue of poverty in urban America,  Williams said. Glide uses its $18 million annual budget to provide more than 750,000 free meals, emergency shelter for 8,500 people, 2,600 HIV and Hepatitis C tests, and day care and after school programs for nearly 450 children. Buffett, 86, is the world's fourth-richest person, worth $76.2 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is donating virtually all of his fortune to charity. Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager Ted Weschler, who paid a combined $5.25 million to win two auctions. He later became one of Buffett's investing deputies, and along with fellow deputy Todd Combs is likely to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after Buffett departs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, industrial, railroad, retail and other sectors. Buffett owns about 18 percent of the $419 billion company. The lunches that fetched $3,456,789 remain the most expensive items sold on eBay where all proceeds went to charity. Bidding moved online in 2003.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - London will not be cowed by militants who have killed 35 people in three separate attacks in Britain, but police will ask for more resources to tackle the threat from marauding assailants, London police chief Cressida Dick told Reuters on Saturday. Three Islamist militants rammed a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge last Saturday before going on the rampage through the bustling Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people. Three French people, two Australians, one Canadian, a Spanish man and a Briton were killed in the attack, and almost 50 wounded. Police shot the attackers dead just eight minutes after the first call from the public.  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dick said she understood that people were concerned about security after the attacks in London and Manchester, but that the British capital would not be intimidated.  London is a safe city and we will do everything we can in our power to keep you safe,  she said in an interview at London police headquarters, just a few steps away from Westminster Bridge, where an attacker killed five people on March 22.  We won't let them win and London will carry on,  she said, adding that security services had foiled five plots since then. Dick, an Oxford University graduate, was appointed London's first female police chief and Britain's top officer in February, taking charge of a force of 43,000 officers and staff with a budget of more than 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion). Baptism of Fire She officially started the job less than three weeks after Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, and then stabbed a policeman to death in the grounds of parliament. Then, eight weeks later, three Islamists staged a carbon-copy attack on London Bridge. The spate of recent attacks - the deadliest in Britain since four British Islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people on the London transport system in July 2005 - thrust security and policing to the fore of the campaign for last Thursday's election. Prime Minister Theresa May, a former interior minister, came under particular scrutiny for cuts to the police. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick speaks during at interview with Reuters at New Scotland Yard, Westminster, Britain June 10, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneAsked if the Metropolitan Police needed more resources, Dick said:  We will want more resources to help us and I am sure the same will be being said in the intelligence agencies.  Obviously we will be reviewing, for example, the number of armed officers we have and how they work, and a whole host of other things that are likely, from my point of view, to take more resources, and I will be asking for them.  After the London Bridge attack, May said Britain was under threat from a new breed of crude copycat militants who did not spend months planning and may not have been radicalised online.  We Will Step Up a Gear  Slideshow (8 Images) We are highly effective at preventing attacks in this country and we will step up a gear and do our level best to stop any further attacks,  Dick said, urging those hiring out vehicles to be vigilant.  But, as you point out, highly volatile people who are intent on doing something absolutely terrible and who are quite happy - maybe even pleased - to kill themselves and to use low-tech methods - these are difficult things to defend against.  On the day of the London Bridge attack, the three men had initially tried to hire a 7.5 tonne (8.3 ton) truck, the head of London police's counter-terrorism unit said on Friday. Dick, who left the police to work in the Foreign Office in 2015 before taking up her new role, said the militant threat was largely domestic.  The majority of them have a domestic focus, if I can put it that way, a domestic center of gravity,  she said.  However, there are international connections and links in many of them.  Although the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the London Bridge attack, police have said there was no evidence that the perpetrators - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane, who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad. Dick said it was common for Islamic State to make claims about attacks that it had not been directly involved in.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The three Islamists who killed eight people after driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then attacking nearby revelers had initially tried to hire a 7.5 tonne (8.3 ton) truck, the head of the UK capital's counter-terrorism unit said on Friday. Commander Dean Haydon also revealed that the men had a stockpile of petrol bombs in the back of their van and carried out their deadly attack with pink ceramic knives. Officers also discovered a Koran in their safe house, opened at a page on martyrdom. The discoveries, especially of the plan to hire a truck, suggested more could have been killed.  Getting hold of a 7.5 tonne lorry - the effects could have been even worse,  Haydon told reporters.  Although Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, Haydon said there was no evidence the attackers - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad.  We're not looking for a wider network,  said Haydon, head of London's Counter Terrorism Command, adding that officers were still trying to piece together how the three men had met.  How did they know each other? They are a diverse bunch,  he said.  Haydon provided unusually extensive details of last Saturday's attack, the deadliest in London since suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's transport network in 2005. Ringleader On Saturday morning, Butt, who Haydon said was believed to be the ringleader, tried to rent a 7.5 tonne truck but did not provided payment details.  Related CoverageLondon will not be cowed by militants, police chief saysBritish police arrest 27-year-old man in London Bridge attack probeIt was not clear why he could not pay, or if he lacked the necessary license to drive such a vehicle. But his attempt echoed last July's attack in Nice, France, when a 19-tonne truck was driven into crowds, killing 86 people. Shortly before 1700 GMT, Butt received a text message confirming his hire of a Renault van instead. At about 1730 GMT, the men drove to pick up the van before heading to Zaghba's home in east London. At 1838 GMT they left and two hours later the van reached London Bridge which they drove along twice before targeting pedestrians on the sidewalk on their third run. Three people on the bridge were struck and killed by the van, believed to have been driven by Butt, before the men abandoned the vehicle and began to attack people in bars and restaurants in the nearby bustling Borough Market area. The men were armed with identical 12-inch (30cm) pink ceramic knives, strapped to their wrists with leather bound around the handle. They were also wearing fake suicide belts - plastic water bottles wrapped in duct tape. People look at floral tributes near London Bridge, London, Britain, June 8, 2017.Marko DjuricaEight minutes after police were alerted, armed officers arrived at the scene and fired 46 rounds, killing all three men. Their victims were three French nationals, two Australians, a Canadian, a Spaniard and a Briton. In the attackers' van detectives found 13 wine bottles, filled with lighter fuel with rags wrapped round them to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs. There were also two blow torches which Haydon thought could have been used to light the homemade bombs as part of a possible secondary attack.  They were still fairly close to the van. There is a possibility that they could have come back,  Haydon said. There were also office chairs, a suitcase and two bags of gravel which Haydon said might have been to add weight or to act as a cover story for their activities to friends and family.   He said Redouane's home, an apartment in Barking, east London, was the men's safe house where they put their plot together and prepared the attack.  There they found an English-language copy of the Koran which had been left open on a page describing martyrdom, along with other items linked to their attack. Haydon said since last Saturday they had taken 262 statements from people from 19 different countries and numerous international inquiries were ongoing relating to the attackers and the victims. Criticism British police and security services were criticized after it emerged that they had known about Butt, who featured in a TV documentary entitled  Jihadis Next Door , in which he joined a group unfurling an Islamic State (IS) flag in a park.   Haydon acknowledged that Butt had links to al Muhajiroun, a banned group headed by cleric Anjem Choudary. He was jailed last year for encouraging support of IS, which has been linked to numerous militant plots in Britain and abroad. Butt was also arrested for fraud last October but was about to be told by prosecutors he would face no further action.  We will be looking at intelligence and our processes, and asking ourselves the question: 'Could we have prevented such an attack?',  Haydon said.  There is nothing that I'm seeing at the moment that suggested that we got that wrong.  Police have installed security barriers running alongside the sidewalks at eight bridges across the River Thames, and Haydon said similar protection was being considered at other locations. Police were also reviewing security at  iconic sites , crowded places and major events, and refreshing advice to theaters, bars, shopping centers and sports venues.

{"content":"SAO PAULO, June 10 (Reuters) - A Brazilian court ruling clearing the sale of a minority stake that creditors of OAS SA have in a local infrastructure company have boosted chances of striking a deal with bidder Mubadala Development Co PJSC , two people with knowledge of the situation said on Saturday. The Superior Justice Tribunal, Brazil's top appeals court, rejected on Friday claims by some OAS creditors that the sale of a 24.4 percent stake in Invepar SA be stopped. The decision allowed creditors to convene an assembly on June 22 to decide how to take ownership of the stake, the sources said. According to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deal, the court's decision will speed up talks between the creditors and Mubadala. Under preliminary terms of the deal, Mubadala proposed to inject fresh capital into Invepar to kick-start projects and cut debt, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in February. A sale, which could be announced at some point during the third quarter, would trigger a reworking of the shareholder accord between OAS and the three Brazilian pension funds that own a combined 75.6 percent of Invepar, the sources said. The Reuters report in February said Mubadala would pump fresh capital into Invepar to rework that accord, diluting the stakes that Previ Caixa de Previdência do Banco do Brasil SA , Petros Fundação Petrobras SA and Funcef Fundação have in Invepar. OAS declined to comment. Efforts to reach a Mubadala spokesman in Abu Dhabi after working hours were unsuccessful. Some of the OAS creditors that won the right to the Invepar stake declined to comment. Formally known as Investimentos & Participacoes em Infraestrutura SA, Invepar operates toll road, airport and urban mobility licenses, including São Paulo's GRU international airport and the MetrôRio and VLT Carioca urban transport projects in Rio de Janeiro. A new partner would help Invepar cut debt and jumpstart investments that snagged amid Brazil's harshest recession ever, surging borrowing costs and the involvement of OAS in the nation's worst corruption scandal. The creditor group wants to sell the stake for a value  north of  2.2 billion reais ($668 million), the sources said.

{"content":"(Adds total deposits at banks in Qatar) By Tom Arnold and Saeed Azhar DUBAI, June 10 (Reuters) - A move by four Arab states to blacklist dozens of figures with alleged links to Qatar could squeeze liquidity at Qatari banks which get a significant amount of their funding from the region. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said. All types of deposits at banks in Qatar totalled 753 billion riyals at the end of March, according to central bank data. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. The move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbours, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.

{"content":"WARDER, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia will run out of emergency food aid for 7.8 million people hit by severe drought by the end of this month, the government and humanitarian groups said. Successive failed rains blamed by meteorologists on fluctuations in ocean temperatures known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have created a series of severe back-to-back droughts in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region.  In Ethiopia, the number of people now critically short of food is expected to rise by at least two million by next month, according to figures compiled by the government and its humanitarian partners.  Donors, international aid groups and the government say existing food aid for the current 7.8 million will run out as funds are critically short this year with Ethiopia receiving slightly more than half of the $930 million to meet requirements until July.  We are in a dire situation,  John Aylieff, the World Food Programme's representative in Ethiopia, said on Friday during a field trip to Warder in southeast Ethiopia, one of Ethiopia's hardest-hit areas.  We've got food running out nationally at the end of June. That means the 7.8 million people who are in need of humanitarian food assistance in Ethiopia will see that distribution cut abruptly at the end of June,  he added. Treeless Plains Humanitarian groups fear donor fatigue is weighing on efforts to meet requirements.   Famine in northeast Nigeria, together with South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, constitute the worst humanitarian crisis the world has faced since 1945, the U.N. said in March.  There is donor fatigue because there are a lot of crises,  said Ahmed Al Meraikhi, the U.N. Secretary-General's humanitarian envoy. Addis Ababa allocated $272 million extra in 2015 and a further $109 million last year from its own coffers to deal with the drought. However the government said it faced difficulties in sustaining similar targets this year.  Last year, we spent a lot of money to confront this type of drought. It is very challenging,  said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia's National Disaster Risk Management Commission. Across the Horn of Africa, close to 17 million people need humanitarian aid due to drought, including 2.6 million in Kenya and 3.2 million in Somalia, according to the U.N. In the treeless plains littered with makeshift plastic homes in Ethiopia's Warder, bordering Somalia, displaced and destitute pastoralists said their entire herds had been decimated.

{"content":"LONDON/BELFAST (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May secured a deal on Saturday to prop up her minority government but looked increasingly isolated after a botched election gamble plunged Britain into crisis days before the start of talks on leaving the European Union. Her Conservatives struck an outline deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support on key legislation. It was a humiliating outcome after an election that May had intended to strengthen her ahead of the Brexit push. Instead, voters stripped the Conservatives of their parliamentary majority. As May struggled to contain the fallout, her two closest aides resigned.  Newspapers said foreign minister Boris Johnson and other leading party members were weighing leadership challenges. But Johnson said he backed May. May called the early election in April, when opinion polls suggested she was set for a sweeping win. May's aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill quit on Saturday following sustained criticism within the party of the campaign.  Gavin Barwell was named new chief of staff. The Conservative lawmaker who lost his seat on Thursday and has experience working as a party enforcer in parliament. The change was unlikely to significantly quell unrest within the party. Most of May's cabinet members have kept quiet on the issue of her future, adding to speculation that her days as prime minister are numbered. A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times newspaper found 48 percent of people felt May should quit while 38 percent thought she should stay. More Complicated The DUP, whose 10 seats in the new parliament give May just enough support to pass legislation, agreed in principle to a  confidence and supply  arrangement, Downing Street said. That means it will support a Conservative minority government on key votes in parliament without a formal coalition deal. Related CoverageNorthern Ireland's DUP says still to reach agreement on supporting UK PM May's governmentA source close to the DUP said the party was seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers in exchange for supporting May. Still the deal with the DUP risks upsetting the political balance in Northern Ireland. It aligns London more closely with the pro-British side in the divided province, where a power-sharing government with Irish nationalists is suspended. The Observer newspaper said the DUP arrangement fell short of a full coalition agreement because of concerns among some Conservative lawmakers about the socially conservative DUP's positions on gay rights, abortion and climate change. The turmoil engulfing May has increased the chance that Britain will fall out of the EU in 2019 without a deal. Previously, she said she wanted to take Britain out of the EU's single market and customs union in order to cut immigration.     Her party is deeply divided over what it wants from Brexit. The election result means businesses still have no idea what trading rules they can expect in the coming years.   EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said it may now be possible to discuss closer ties between Britain and the EU than May had initially planned, given her election flop.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May addresses the country after Britain's election at Downing Street in London, Britain June 9, 2017.Stefan Wermuth For instance, if London were to stay in the customs union, then it would not have to renegotiate all trade agreements,  he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.  The pound on Friday fell 1.7 percent against the U.S. dollar and 1.4 percent against the euro. After confirming on Friday that her top five ministers, including finance minister Philip Hammond, would keep their jobs, May must name the rest of her team, who will take on one of the most demanding jobs in recent British political history.  May has said Brexit talks will begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day as the formal reopening of parliament. She confirmed this to German leader Angela Merkel in a phone call on Saturday.  She also reiterated that she would seek a reciprocal agreement early in the talks on rights of EU and British citizens, Downing Street said.      Elmar Brok, a German conservative and the European Parliament's top Brexit expert, told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper that the two-year talks would now be more complicated.  Slideshow (5 Images) May won't be able to make any compromises because she lacks a broad parliamentary majority,  he said.  She's Staying - for Now   Britain's largely pro-Conservative press questioned whether May could remain in power.  The Sun newspaper said senior members of the party had vowed to get rid of May, but would wait at least six months because they feared a leadership contest could propel the Labour party into power under Jeremy Corbyn, who supports renationalization of key industries and higher taxes for business and top earners. Survation, the opinion polling firm that came closest to predicting correctly the election's outcome, said a new poll it conducted for the Mail on Sunday newspaper showed support for Labour now 6 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.     She's staying, for now,  one Conservative Party source told Reuters. Former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson, asked about her future, said:  Let's see how it pans out.  May had repeatedly ruled out the need for a new election before changing her mind. Labour stunned even its own supporters by taking enough seats from the Conservatives to deny them a majority. The Times newspaper's front page declared that Britain was  effectively leaderless  and the country  all but ungovernable .  The Conservatives have not yet broken the British system of democracy, but through their hubris and incompetence they have managed to make a mockery of it,  it said in an editorial.  If May is to honor the wish of the 52 percent of voters who opted last year to take Britain out of the EU, she must find a way to bridge the differences within her party. Its eurosceptic wing has long been a thorn in the side of Conservative prime ministers. On the other hand, pro-Europe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she wanted to be involved in  looking again  at Britain's aims for Brexit. Davidson was one of the few Conservative success stories in the election as the Scottish wing of the party won 13 seats.  She has said she favors retaining the greatest possible level of access to Europe's single market. Davidson also said she had received reassurances from May that the party's deal with the DUP would not involve a rollback of gay rights.

{"content":"ROME (Reuters) - Italy will not hold elections until the natural end of the legislature in spring next year, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (PD), said on Saturday. Renzi said he saw little hope of reforming the electoral system after a deal between the four largest parties broke down this week, meaning Italy will probably vote with a system considered inefficient and unlikely to produce a majority. In an interview with daily Corriere della Sera, Renzi denied that he wanted to go to the polls this autumn, as was widely believed, and when asked when he expected the election he replied:  in 2018, at the end of the legislature.  Italy's two largest parties, the PD and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, have blamed each other since a deal on switching to a new proportional representation electoral system based on the German model collapsed on Thursday.  It was our duty to try (for an accord) but now the game is over,  Renzi said.  We have a horizon of nearly a year until the elections, so let's work for Italy.  He said the election, which must be held by May 2018, could be held using the current system which involves different voting rules for the two houses of parliament, and which President Sergio Mattarella had asked the parties to reform. In a separate interview in the same newspaper, 5-Star deputy Luigi Di Maio, widely expected to be the movement's candidate for prime minister, also said he believed the election would be fought in 2018 using the current system.  There are no longer the conditions in this parliament to  reform the electoral law,  he said. Despite the standoff, the main parties voted in the Chamber of Deputies last week to resume negotiations over electoral reform in a parliamentary committee. The PD and 5-Star are Italy's most popular parties, each commanding around 30 percent of voter support, according to opinion polls.

{"content":"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities jailed the local chairman of Amnesty International pending trial over charges of  membership of a terrorist organisation , as part a crackdown following last July's failed coup attempt, the rights group said. Taner Kilic, along with 22 other lawyers in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir, was detained on Tuesday for suspected links to the network of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for last year's failed coup.  The Turkish prosecution's decision to charge Taner Kilic ... with 'membership of a terrorist organisation' is a mockery of justice, and highlights the devastating impact of the Turkish authorities' crackdown following the failed coup attempt in July last year,  Amnesty said in a statement on Friday. It said he was being charged with using ByLock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers, but Amnesty said he had denied using the app in his testimony. Salil Shetty, head of Amnesty International, said the charges were without merit and not an indication of a criminal act, while the arrests were a disregard of human rights and an attempt to silence all those who defend them.  The charges ... show just how arbitrary, just how sweeping, the Turkish government's frenzied pursuit of its perceived enemies and critics has become,  Shetty said. He demanded his  immediate release with all charges against him dropped. Amnesty also said eight of the 22 lawyers had been remanded in custody, six remained in detention and seven were awaiting court rulings. Only one had been released, it said. Since the July coup attempt, authorities have arrested 50,000 people and sacked or suspended 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups, including Gulen's network which Ankara deems a terrorist organisation. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. The scope of the purges, which have also seen more than 130 media outlets shut down and some 150 journalists jailed, has unnerved rights groups and Turkey's Western allies, who say  President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and purge opponents. Turkish authorities were not immediately available for comment, but officials have said the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt, in which 240 people were killed on July 15.

{"content":"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will not reinstate a controversial ban on ergot, state-grain buyer GASC told Reuters on Saturday, despite a court ruling which could allow a return to the common grain fungus being barred entirely from wheat cargoes. Traders said the previous zero tolerance requirement, which an Egyptian agricultural department said was to protect human and plant health, is impossible to fulfill and makes doing business with Egypt too risky. But an Egyptian court said this week it was planning to overturn a food inspection system launched this year by the world's largest wheat buyer which was intended to address this issue and streamline trade after a nearly year-long row. The new inspection system sidelined a body called agriculture quarantine which last year applied a zero tolerance rule on ergot in wheat cargoes and led traders to boycott the state's tenders en masse, briefly cutting off the import-dependent country from global grain markets. Lawyers on the case told Reuters that the ruling, scheduled to be issued on June 13, would restore the agriculture quarantine's authorities, which could allow them to again ban the fungus entirely from wheat cargoes. But in its first comments since news of the pending court ruling, GASC Vice Chairman Ahmed Youssef said the court ruling would not mean a return to the zero tolerance rule.  The court ruling is procedural and administrative and has nothing to do with specifications,  he told Reuters.  GASC is sticking to the Egyptian specifications of 2010,  said Youssef, referring to a regulation that permits up to 0.05 percent ergot in wheat imports.  We have taken this view after consultations with the Agriculture Ministry,  said Youssef, suggesting that the quarantine, which falls under the Agriculture Ministry, may not be permitted to reinstate the ban even if it regains its previous powers. The new system was imposed by a decree in November that named the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), which is part of the trade ministry, as the body responsible for inspecting the imports.  GASC, which is holding a wheat purchase tender on Saturday, is permitting up to 0.05 percent ergot, a common international standard, in its tender books.

He demanded his  immediate release with all charges against him dropped. Amnesty also said eight of the 22 lawyers had been remanded in custody, six remained in detention and seven were awaiting court rulings. Only one had been released, it said. Since the July coup attempt, authorities have arrested 50,000 people and sacked or suspended 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups, including Gulen's network which Ankara deems a terrorist organisation. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. The scope of the purges, which have also seen more than 130 media outlets shut down and some 150 journalists jailed, has unnerved rights groups and Turkey's Western allies, who say  President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and purge opponents. Turkish authorities were not immediately available for comment, but officials have said the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt, in which 240 people were killed on July 15.

{"content":"LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - The following are comments by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick about how police are dealing with the threat to the United Kingdom. Dick spoke in an interview with Reuters. Following are the highlights: Q. Is London safe?  I know people will be concerned about what's happened in the UK over the past 12 weeks including the two ghastly attacks in London, but London is a wonderful international city and we attract visitors from all over the world all the time and we love it because it is so diverse. London is open. People are going about their business.  London is a safe city and we will do everything we can in our power to keep you safe.  We won't let them win and London will carry on.  Q. How can the police and security services defend against what Prime Minister Theresa May has called a new breed of crude copycat militants?  This threat that we now face is a global phenomenon and in this respect London is similar to other cities in the Western world. Sadly we have seen such attacks elsewhere. We need to continue to learn and adapt as a nation and indeed as a police service.  But some of the things that we have always done are very important in this situation. We have excellent relationships with our communities and we need people to give us information more than they ever have done.  We have a fantastic relationship with the intelligence agencies and a great ability to analyse intelligence. We need to do that ever more and ever better.  We need people to be really alert. As an example in this particular attack, we know that the attackers hired a vehicle that very day. So we need, for example, people who are hiring vans and lorries out to just think about who these people are and if you have any concerns at all to contact us on the anti-terrorist hotline.  Q. In the London Bridge attack, armed police shot dead the three attackers just eight minutes after the first phone call from the public. How prepared are the police?  Ever since the appalling attacks in Mumbai there have been other similar, what we would call, marauding terrorist attacks, we have tried to build up our capability, skill and understanding of how to tackle them.  At any one time we have a large number of highly trained specialist firearms officers who are very mobile and strategically placed. They are able to respond exceptionally quickly and with great professionalism and efficiency and as you saw there with great courage.  Q. Can we expect more such attacks and how is it possible to defend against such crude attacks?  We have been doing everything we can to find out who was behind these attacks. We believe that those three people planned and executed the attack. We are still investigating to find out whether anyone else knew about it or supported it in any way.  We are highly effective at preventing attacks in this country and we will step up a gear and do our level best to stop any further attacks. But as you point out, highly volatile people who are intent on doing something absolutely terrible and who are quite happy - maybe even pleased - to kill themselves and to use a low tech methods - these are difficult things to defend against.  Q. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on London Bridge, so is this a domestic or international threat?  My observation is that in relation to the threat that we have been facing most recently and the attacks that have been successful and those that have been unsuccessful, the majority of them have a domestic focus if I can put it that way, a domestic centre of gravity. However there are international connections and links in many of them. On the Islamic State claim:  This is quite common. On occasion Daesh [Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State] and other organisations will claim responsibility when long and careful investigations by intelligence agencies here and overseas and a sober assessment would subsequently say actually 'not at all'. But it may be that some individuals who were not directed, not trained by an overseas organisation have of course been inspired by them.  Q. Does the Metropolitan Police need more resources?  I agree with the Prime Minister [Theresa May] when she said that we do need to review across the board how we are tackling terrorism, in terms of our powers, in terms of how we are working with our communities and what is happening in our communities, in terms of the internet, in terms of our equipment, in terms of our computers and so forth.  I am quite confident that we will be reviewing our resources and I am expecting to have conversations with colleagues across the police service about what we think we need to face this changing and emerging threat. And we will of course be talking to government.  I am quite sure that I will be saying that I can lead a police service which in the future can make even further savings as we have all had to do but that we will want more resources to help us and I am sure the same will be being said in the intelligence agencies.  I am not going to put a quantum on it. I think it would be ridiculous to just pluck a figure out of the air or to say I need more of this or that. But obviously we will be reviewing, for example the number of armed officers we have and how they work, and a whole host of other things that is likely, from my point of view, to take more resources and I will be asking for them.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is due to make a recommendation to the White House on Saturday on whether to rescind or resize Utah's Bears Ears monument, setting the tone for the administration's broader study of which lands protected by past presidents should be reopened to development. The 1.35 million-acre monument, created by former president Barack Obama at the end of his term and named after its iconic twin buttes, is the first of 27 national monuments that will be evaluated by the Department of the Interior after President Donald Trump ordered the review in April. The deadline for Zinke's recommendation on Bears Ears is June 10, though an Interior Department official did not say when the recommendation would be made public. Related CoverageFactbox: Review of U.S. national monuments could unlock new energy reservesTrump had argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate national monuments under the U.S. Antiquities Act of 1906, and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. Conservation groups, meanwhile, have called Trump's effort to alter existing national monuments illegal and irresponsible, and have vowed to challenge him in court. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke waits to take the stage with President Donald Trump for his on infrastructure improvements, at the Department of Transportation in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017.Jonathan Ernst Whatever comes out of these recommendations will give us an insight into how this administration takes its responsibilities to protect public lands and uphold conservation mandates,  said Nada Culver, senior counsel of the Wilderness Society, an environmental advocacy group.     Heated Debate The view from Comb Ridge is pictured in Utah’s Bears Ears area of the Four Corners Region, Utah, U.S. December 18, 2016. Picture taken December 18, 2016.Annie KnoxThe review taps into a heated national debate over Washington's role in America's wildest spaces: environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives, and industry groups say the lands should be generating money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. Bears Ears was created after years of lobbying by a coalition of five tribes, who say the area is sacred. Republicans, like Senator Orin Hatch of Utah, have argued, however, that Obama's designation of the Bears Ears monument had weakened education funding in the state through its School and Institutional Trust Lands system - which delivers revenues from land development to schools. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke's review list do - making the Bears Ears decision important symbolically to industry groups.  Who is to say that, in the future, a president couldn’t just put a whole basin under monument designation,  said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, representing oil and gas companies.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) plans to raise its offer for Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) prized semiconductor unit to $18 billion or more, a person familiar with the matter said, in a last-ditch effort to clinch a deal both companies consider vital. The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund. The group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen or more by Thursday, when the struggling Japanese conglomerate is due to choose a preferred bidder for its Toshiba Memory Corp unit, the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, the person told Reuters on Saturday. Toshiba has been favoring a rival bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. A spokesman for Western Digital had no comment. Toshiba could not immediately be reached for comment. Toshiba had set a 2 trillion yen threshold for the sale as it rushes to find a buyer to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. The offer by Western Digital, a long-time partner of the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate's lucrative chips division, comes as uncertainty about the make-up of the groups bidding for Toshiba's crown jewel has increased. Western Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan. At Loggerheads But the two companies have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind cherry blossoms at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 11, 2017.Toru HanaiWestern Digital argues that the sale cannot proceed without its consent but the U.S. firm will drop its claim if Toshiba agrees to the new offer, the source said on Saturday. Toshiba is concerned an acquisition by Western Digital would run into antitrust objections from China and elsewhere as the U.S. firm is the world's third-largest NAND producer behind South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Toshiba. To counter those concerns, the Western Digital portion of the consortium's new offer will be in the form of a debt purchase whereas the U.S. firm had previously been looking for an equity stake in Toshiba Memory, the source said. The Japan-Western Digital consortium initially offered 1.6 trillion yen, sources have said. CEO Steve Milligan then raised the offer to close to 2 trillion yen on Friday in a meeting with Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa, the source said on Saturday. But Toshiba expressed dissatisfaction with Friday's bid.  Our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. That set the stage for the latest offer of 2 trillion yen, or more. In Friday's meeting, Toshiba's Tsunakawa asked if Western Digital  could further increase the price , the source said, adding that the U.S. firm would modify its proposal,  to align with their thinking .  Western Digital's new offer will also include a commitment to $25 billion dollars in capital spending for the joint venture's Yokkaichi facility, including building two fabrication plants, the source said. It will also pledge $39 billion for research and development and money to boost the local economy, while expanding the workforce there by five percent a year for two years, he said.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind cherry blossoms at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 11, 2017.Toru HanaiWestern Digital argues that the sale cannot proceed without its consent but the U.S. firm will drop its claim if Toshiba agrees to the new offer, the source said on Saturday. Toshiba is concerned an acquisition by Western Digital would run into antitrust objections from China and elsewhere as the U.S. firm is the world's third-largest NAND producer behind South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Toshiba. To counter those concerns, the Western Digital portion of the consortium's new offer will be in the form of a debt purchase whereas the U.S. firm had previously been looking for an equity stake in Toshiba Memory, the source said. The Japan-Western Digital consortium initially offered 1.6 trillion yen, sources have said. CEO Steve Milligan then raised the offer to close to 2 trillion yen on Friday in a meeting with Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa, the source said on Saturday. But Toshiba expressed dissatisfaction with Friday's bid.  Our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. That set the stage for the latest offer of 2 trillion yen, or more. In Friday's meeting, Toshiba's Tsunakawa asked if Western Digital  could further increase the price , the source said, adding that the U.S. firm would modify its proposal,  to align with their thinking .  Western Digital's new offer will also include a commitment to $25 billion dollars in capital spending for the joint venture's Yokkaichi facility, including building two fabrication plants, the source said. It will also pledge $39 billion for research and development and money to boost the local economy, while expanding the workforce there by five percent a year for two years, he said.

{"content":"MASERU (Reuters) - Lesotho's former deputy prime minister Mothetjoa Metsing has called for a national unity government, saying a broader coalition deal would ensure stability after last week's election failed to produce an outright winner. Lesotho, which has been on a political knife-edge since an attempted coup in 2014, held elections last week, the third in five years, after Pakalitha Mosisili, with whom Metsing had been in a coalition government, lost a no-confidence vote as prime minister in March.  Mosisili admitted defeat on Friday to his opponent Thomas Thabane, whose All Basotho Convention (ABC) emerged as the winner of 48 parliamentary seats but short of the 61 needed to form a government.      There is no need for the removal of the existing government in office as we all agree that in order for Lesotho to be stable there is a need for a government of national unity,  Metsing told a news conference late on Friday. Thabane has said his ABC party would form a coalition government with three other parties: Alliance Democrats, Basotho National Party and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho. The outcome reverses the result of an election two years ago, when Mosisili ousted Thabane by teaming up with Metsing and other smaller parties. Lesotho, a nation of two million people, has been hit by several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966 and its last two elections failed to produce a winner with a clear majority.  Thabane, who governed from 2012 until 2015, and other opposition leaders, fled the country to South Africa in 2015 after an assassination attempt. Apart from textile exports and regional customs receipts, Lesotho's other big earner is water, piped to South Africa.

{"content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and France are working out specific proposals for a European Union defense fund ahead of a bilateral ministerial meeting on July 13, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview published on Saturday. Joint work on drones, military transports and combined efforts to stabilize the African Sahel region were projects that could be funded by the new plan, she told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain.  Germany and France want to become the motor of a European defense union and implement the defense fund in a smart way,  von der Leyen said.  The Brexit referendum and the U.S. election opened our eyes. Europeans must take more responsibility for our own security,  she said. Von der Leyen said the finance ministers of both countries were working to develop mechanisms, while the defense ministers were working to identify various projects. Europe-wide training of military officers could also be paid for by the fund, von der Leyen said. Increased cooperation in Africa could help reduce trafficking in arms and people, while helping combat terrorism, she said. The European Commission this week threw its support behind Franco-German plans to integrate Europe's militaries and defense industries. Spurred by Britain's decision to leave the European Union and pressure from the United States, Brussels has seized on deeper military ties proposed last year by France and Germany to show the bloc can still provide security in the face of Islamist militant attacks and a resurgent Russia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday underscored the need to rebuild the German military or Bundeswehr after decades of spending cuts, and to increase the attractiveness of military careers in areas such as cybersecurity. Merkel, speaking in a video podcast, said European defense cooperation would be closely coordinated with the NATO alliance, noting that Europe had a keen interest in stabilizing Africa, a source of refugees heading to Europe.  As Europeans, we want a coordinated approach there,  she said. The European Commission this week said it would create a fund with at least 1.5 billion euros a year to enable governments to join forces on development and procurement of new weapons, including drones, cyber warfare systems and other hi-tech gear. The plan must still be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.  EU leaders will consider an array of proposals on defense cooperation at a summit in Brussels on June 22-23.

The Rangers pounded out 13 hits in a 5-2 win to begin the series Friday night, just their fourth victory in the last 15 games. Jonathan Lucroy extended his hitting streak to four games with a home run and two singles while driving in three runs for Texas, which played another game without third baseman Adrian Beltre. The hobbled veteran has missed two straight games with an ankle injury and it appears as if the club wants to give Beltre another day to test the injury before deciding if he needs to be placed on the disabled list. The National League East-leading Nationals committed three errors and left eight runners on base in Friday's loss, falling to 17-10 at home.

He served up three home runs in that start after giving up a total of three over his previous eight appearances. The 26-year-old, who will be pitching in his 100th career game (94th start), has never faced Washington but is 5-5 with a 4.32 ERA in 15 interleague starts. Gonzalez has won back-to-back starts after limiting the Los Angeles Dodgers to two runs on four hits over six innings Monday on the road. The former first-round pick has a 1.69 ERA in six home starts, although he has had to work around 19 walks in 37 1/3 innings.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - It has been a breeze for Rafa Nadal so far at this year's French Open -- but a storm is brewing. Even by the Spaniard's ridiculously high standards at a tournament where he has won 78 of his 80 matches since bounding into town like a runaway bull in 2005, the way he has reached a 10th final has been astonishing. The 31-year-old has not conceded a set and dropped only 29 games in six rounds -- two more than Bjorn Borg's 1978 record when he destroyed Guillermo Vilas in the final. Yet standing in the way of the Mallorcan from becoming the first player in the professional era to win the same grand slam title 10 times is a highly-destructive Swiss; not 18-times major winner Roger Federer but the barrel-chested Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka was at his belligerent best against world number one Andy Murray in a semi-final classic, striking 87 winners in a five-set duel that would have graced any final. Late bloomer Wawrinka, 32, has won each of the three grand slam finals he has contested and possesses the kind of baseline firepower Nadal is yet to face so far in the past fortnight. Described as 'scary' by three-times former grand slam champion Mats Wilander, Wawrinka will not be taking a backwards step when play commences on Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday when the temperatures are expected to soar into the 80s. Should Wawrinka repeat his scintillating 2015 victory over Novak Djokovic he would become the oldest man to lift La Coupe des Mousquetaires since 34-year-old Andres Gimeno in 1972. The last grand slam clash between the pair came at Melbourne Park in 2014 when Wawrinka beat a hobbling Nadal to claim his first grand slam title.

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsIt was a breakthrough moment for the Swiss, but even then there was a sense he still felt like an imposter at the top table of men's tennis. Three years on and there is little doubt Wawrinka truly believes he belongs alongside the best and that when the stakes are highest, he brings it all to court.  Mentally I've become a different player,  Wawrinka, who has won three of his last six matches against Nadal having lost the first 12, told reporters.  Slideshow (4 Images) When I arrive in a big match, it's like closing, switching off everything in my body except my brain which I put in winning mode.  Rafa's track record on clay is amazing. He's the best player we have ever had. So, of course I can lose but I'm extremely confident about what I do. I know that mentally when I'm there, it's difficult to beat me.  Nadal, who tops the match-wins list this year with a 42-6 record, including a 23-1 stretch on clay, knows the threat. But with La Decima within touching distance and the chance to claim a 15th grand slam title after a three-year hiatus, it will take Wawrinka at his fiery best to stop him.  It's true that when he hits hard, he hits really hard,  Nadal said.  Stopping him can be difficult. I do not want him to play his game, which means I need to make sure I don't let him be in that position where he can hit hard.  I will have to do everything I can to keep him from playing aggressively. If I can play long balls, if I can hit hard, if I can do that, well, I think I will be able to control him.  Whoever wins goes second in the ATP rankings list on Monday -- a three-year high for Nadal and a career high for Wawrinka.

{"content":"LUSAKA (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) may grant Zambia up to $1.3 billion in a three-year credit facility to help plug a budget deficit of around 7 percent, the lender's mission chief said on Saturday. A decision will be made by the IMF board in August, Tsidi Tsikata told a joint news conference with the Zambian finance ministry, which pledged to halve the deficit to around 4 percent of gross national product by 2019. Africa's second-biggest copper producer has suffered from the steep commodity price drop of recent years. Last March, Zambia began talks with the IMF about a potential loan package after agreeing that its budget deficit was not sustainable.

{"content":"(Corrects name of former Orange CEO in seventh paragraph) * Richard to make his case to the board for a new term in autumn-source * Board to meet in February 2018 to decide on Richard's bid-source * Renewal of Richard's mandate depends on decision by French state By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic PARIS, June 9 (Reuters) - Orange's Stephane Richard has told the company's board that he will be a candidate for a third term as chief executive from 2018, two sources close to the group told Reuters. The French state owns a controlling 23 percent stake in the telecom operator and remains kingmaker at the former monopoly. Richard's bid will likely be reviewed by those at the top of France's administration, now under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron. Richard has led France's biggest telecom operator since 2010 and his current four-year mandate is set to formally expire in May 2018.  He told the board in March that he wanted to apply for a third term,  one of the sources said. Richard will present his case for a new mandate to the board in the autumn and the board is set to make its final decision in February of next year, one of the sources said. He succeeded former CEO Didier Lombard during a tense period at the company between unions and top management, as the group faced a wave of employee suicides in 2008-2009 following an internal reorganisation. Richard is credited with having restored confidence within the group between employees and executives and improving the company's financial results after the arrival in 2012 of Iliad's low-cost brand Free, which has triggered a protracted war in the mobile business. But he failed to reshape the telecoms market in France by cutting the number of telecoms operators from four to three through the acquisition of rival Bouygues Telecom last year. Under his leadership, Orange has notably expanded its telecoms activities overseas in Africa and decided to launch a new online banking service. The group is still looking at ways to better compete with rival Altice by deepening its commercial ties with Vivendi's pay-TV Canal Plus. Separately, Richard may face a trial over allegations of fraud alongside French businessman Bernard Tapie. The Tapie case concerns payments the entrepreneur received in 2008 from the French government while Richard was chief of staff to Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister.

{"content":"June 10 (Reuters) - An estimated $435 million Powerball jackpot is up for grabs on Saturday evening after 19 straight drawings failed to produce a winner and pushed the grand prize in the multi-state U.S. lottery to its highest level in months. The last Powerball drawing to produce a jackpot winner was on April 1, said California Lottery spokesman Mike Bond. California is one of 44 states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, that participate in Powerball.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected to visit Miami as early as next Friday to announce a new Cuba policy that could tighten rules on trade and travel, rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama’s opening to the island, according to a U.S. official and people familiar with the matter. Trump’s aides are nearing completion of a review of relations with Cuba and are expected to send recommendations to his national security team and then to the president in coming days, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Plans are in the works for Trump to roll out his new approach on June 16 in a speech in Miami, where he is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise and justify it, at least in part, on human rights grounds, the sources said. But they cautioned that a delay in the announcement is still possible if it takes longer for Trump to make a final decision. While specific changes have not yet been finalized, the sources say Trump is likely to unveil a partial rather than complete rollback of Obama’s actions, which included restoration of relations and reopening of embassies after a diplomatic breakthrough in 2014 with America’s former Cold War foe. Among the options under consideration are banning U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban enterprises tied to the military – which controls a large part of the communist-ruled island’s economy – and tightening rules on Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. With the Cuba review approaching its final stages, both sides of the issue have recently stepped up lobbying to sway Trump’s decision. In the letter sent to Trump on Friday, seven of his fellow Republicans warned that rescinding Obama’s policies would “incentivize Cuba to once again become dependent on countries like Russia and China.” Senior officials at the National Security Council met on Friday to begin finalizing a list of recommendations, the sources said. Trump's changes are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored two years ago after more than five decades of hostility, administration officials say. But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go, especially given that rapprochement with Cuba has created opportunities for American companies. Internal Debate The National Capitol Building and the Gran Teatro de la Habana Alicia Alonso on the Paseo del Prado boulevard are seen from the rooftop of the Hotel Gran Manzana, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerSome aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. The U.S. airline and travel industries have made clear they do not want to see reinstatement of Cuba restrictions.  Imposing new regulations on travel to and trade with Cuba would be bad politics, bad policy, and bad for U.S. business,” said James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washingon-based lobbying group. Vintage cars drive past a renovated Belle Epoque shopping mall, now housing the Gran Hotel Manzana in the top floors and luxury stores on the ground floor, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerBut Trump has come under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, to roll back Obama’s rapprochement. Rubio, a member of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, is seen by Trump’s aides as an important figure to cultivate at a time when the members of his administration are under investigation over contacts with Russian officials. Rubio and other Obama critics have argued that he gave away too much to Cuban President Raul Castro for too little in return, especially on human rights. Trump’s aides are considering ways to make future engagement moves contingent on the Cuban government’s improvement on human rights and political freedoms, U.S. officials say. Such an emphasis would contrast sharply with Trump’s approach in other parts of the world where he has insisted the United States would stop lecturing other countries on the issue. “Trump - friend of Putin, Sissi, Salman, Duterte, Erdogan - will cite human rights to justify hurting the Cuban people,” tweeted Ben Rhodes, Obama’s former deputy national security adviser and an architect of his Cuba détente policy. Trump threatened shortly after his election in November to “terminate” Obama’s approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something it is unlikely to do. Obama implemented his normalization measures through executive actions, and Trump has the power to undo much of it.

{"content":"(Adds detail, context, analyst quote) By Tom Arnold and Saeed Azhar DUBAI, June 10 (Reuters) - A move by four Arab states to blacklist dozens of figures with alleged links to Qatar could squeeze liquidity at Qatari banks which get a significant amount of their funding from the region. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. The move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbours, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.  It is especially challenging as they're not very liquid as their loan to deposit ratios are already above 100 percent,  Ghosh said. In recent years several have also expanded outside Qatar’s small domestic market to grow their business, with QNB holding a presence in several countries including Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria and UAE either directly or via affiliates. UAE banks would find it relatively easy to comply with the rules as many had invested in improving their compliance systems in recent years and already complied with sanctions against a range of other entities and individuals, another banker said.

{"content":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Protesters wearing shark costumes with the fins cut off surrounded a famous restaurant beside the Hong Kong harbor on Saturday, to demand it halt sales of shark fins, especially from threatened species, such as the whale shark. Demonstrators shouted and waved placards as they approached the Chinese territory's Maxims Palace, half-owned by a unit of conglomerate Jardine Matheson Group and filled with people eating dim sum, but police kept them out.  Stop selling,  chanted the group of about 70 adults and children, some of them holding placards that read,  Maxims, stop selling endangered shark fin 'upon request.'   Jardines, which operates in industries from luxury hotels to mining and transport, controls Dairy Farm International Holdings, which has a 50 percent stake in Maxims. In an email to Reuters, Maxims said it had cut the volume of shark fins sold in its restaurants by more than half in the past 6 years, and only sold products from the blue shark species.  Protest organizer WildAid, a conservation group, released an online clip showing Maxims arranging shark fins from whale or basking sharks for a banquet of 200 people. Reuters could not independently verify the clip. The comments in the clip were untrue, Maxims said in its emailed statement, adding that it did not offer fin products from endangered species.  Activists' efforts have helped achieve a nearly 40 percent cut in shark fins entering the former British colony over the past 5 years, but illegal supply has boomed recently. Environmental protection activists protest outside a Chinese restaurant against providing sharks fin soup in Hong Kong, China June 10, 2017.Bobby YipGovernment seizures of fins exceeded 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) this year, official data show.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday she assumed Britain would stick to its plan for leaving the European Union after the country's election upset, and that she wanted to work quickly on talks over Brexit. British voters failed to deliver a widely expected parliamentary majority for the Conservative party in Thursday's general election, dealing a major blow to Prime Minister Theresa May just days ahead of difficult Brexit talks with the EU. Speaking during a visit to Mexico City, Merkel said Germany was ready for the Brexit talks, which May said would begin on June 19 as scheduled - although she now risks more opposition to her EU departure plans from inside and outside her party.  I assume that Britain, from what I heard from the Prime Minister today, wants to stick to its negotiating plan,  Merkel told a news conference alongside President Enrique Pena Nieto.  We want to negotiate quickly, we want to stick to the time plan, and so at this point I don't think there is anything to suggest these negotiations cannot start as was agreed.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks next to Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto (not pictured) during a news conference at National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico June 9, 2017.Henry RomeroMay, who had called a snap election confident her Conservative Party would increase its majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit talks, on Friday said she would lead a minority government backed by a small Northern Irish party.  British politicians differ widely on what they want from the Brexit negotiating process, seeing it as a way to shift Britain either to the right or left. Some parliamentarians in both the Conservative and Labour parties want to remain in the EU. EU leaders expressed concern that May's loss of her majority would raise the risk of negotiations failing, resulting in a legal limbo for people and business. Merkel said Britain was part of Europe regardless of Brexit, and that she wanted the country to remain a good partner.  Britain is a member of NATO, so we have a lot of shared challenges to deal with, and that's the spirit we want to carry out these negotiations in. But obviously while also asserting the interests of the 27 member states that will make up the European Union in future,  she added.

{"content":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Protesters wearing shark costumes with the fins cut off surrounded a famous restaurant beside the Hong Kong harbor on Saturday, to demand it halt sales of shark fins, especially from threatened species, such as the whale shark. Demonstrators shouted and waved placards as they approached the Chinese territory's Maxims Palace, half-owned by a unit of conglomerate Jardine Matheson Group and filled with people eating dim sum, but police kept them out.  Stop selling,  chanted the group of about 70 adults and children, some of them holding placards that read,  Maxims, stop selling endangered shark fin 'upon request.'   Jardines, which operates in industries from luxury hotels to mining and transport, controls Dairy Farm International Holdings, which has a 50 percent stake in Maxims. In an email to Reuters, Maxims said it had cut the volume of shark fins sold in its restaurants by more than half in the past 6 years, and only sold products from the blue shark species.  Protest organizer WildAid, a conservation group, released an online clip showing Maxims arranging shark fins from whale or basking sharks for a banquet of 200 people. Reuters could not independently verify the clip. The comments in the clip were untrue, Maxims said in its emailed statement, adding that it did not offer fin products from endangered species.  Activists' efforts have helped achieve a nearly 40 percent cut in shark fins entering the former British colony over the past 5 years, but illegal supply has boomed recently.

{"content":"RIYADH, June 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Bahrain welcomed on Saturday U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, but did not respond to a U.S. Department of State call for them to ease pressure on the Gulf state. After severing ties with Qatar on Monday, Saudi Arabia said it was committed to  decisive and swift action to cut off all funding sources for terrorism  in a statement carried by state news agency SPA, attributed to  an official source . And in a separate statement issued on Friday, the United Arab Emirates praised Trump's  leadership in challenging Qatar's troubling support for extremism . Trump accused Qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism on Friday, even as the Pentagon and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a blockade imposed by Arab states and others. A separate SPA report on Saturday acknowledged Tillerson's call for Qatar to curtail support for terrorism, but did not mention his remarks that the crisis was hurting ordinary Qataris, impairing business dealings and harming the U.S. fight against the Islamic State militant group. Saudi Arabia said its action followed the conclusions of last month's Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, where Trump delivered a speech about Islamic extremism. Trump said he helped plan the move against Qatar, although a senior administration official told Reuters earlier this week that the U.S. had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis during the visit that they would sever ties with Qatar.

Falih also said the decision by Saudi Arabia and some of its allies to cut ties with Qatar this week would not affect the oil pact.  I don't expect the diplomatic and political issues that have surfaced with Qatar to have any impact whatsoever on the oil production agreement,  he told reporters in Kazakhstan.

{"content":"MANILA/MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - U.S. forces are providing the Philippines with technical assistance to end a siege of the southern town of Marawi by militants allied to Islamic State but it has no boots on the ground, the Philippines military said on Saturday. The seizure of Marawi by hundreds of fighters who have sworn allegiance to Islamic State, including dozens from neighboring countries and the Middle East, has fueled concern that the ultra-radical group is gaining a foothold in Southeast Asia.  Earlier a U.S. embassy spokesperson in Manila told Reuters  that, at the request of the Philippines government, special operations forces were helping liberate the town, part of which has been occupied by hundreds of militants since May 23. Related CoveragePhilippine military says 13 soldiers killed in Friday's battle with militantsPhilippines says 'strong indications' Maute militant brothers deadIn Marawi, military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera confirmed the U.S. assistance, telling a news conference:  They are not fighting. They are just providing technical support.   A U.S. P3 Orion surveillance plane was seen flying over the town on Friday, according to local media reports. FILE PHOTO: A joint group of police and military forces on positions while conducting a house to house search as part of clearing operations in different sections of Marawi city.StringerUntil now there had been no confirmation that the Philippines had sought U.S. support in the battle for Marawi City on the island of Mindanao, which is in its third week. The assistance comes after months of strain between the two long-time allies that was stoked by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility toward Washington and his pledges to throw U.S. troops out of the country. Smoke billowing from a burning building is seen as government troops continue their assault on insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi City.Romeo RanocoWashington deployed special forces soldiers to Mindanao in 2002 to train and advise Philippine units fighting Abu Sayyaf militants in a program that once involved 1,200 Americans. It was discontinued in 2015 but a small presence remained for logistics and technical support. The United States and the Philippines have been allies for decades. Their relationship provided Washington with a strategic foothold in Asia, and offered Manila a shield against China's assertiveness in the region. But Duterte has openly scorned the alliance, seeing it as an  obstacle to a rapprochement with China, and has repeatedly lambasted Washington for treating his country as a lackey.

{"content":"Turner returns to help lead Dodgers past Reds LOS ANGELES -- Justin Turner's return was just how he would have scripted it. Turner homered in his first at-bat off the disabled list and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Cincinnati Reds 7-2 on Friday night at Dodger Stadium. Turner, who missed 19 games with a right hamstring strain, went 1-for-3 with two RBIs and was hit by a pitch. Enrique Hernandez also homered for the Dodgers (37-25), who improved to 2-2 on their six-game homestand.  That's a good way come back if I had to draw it up,  said Turner, who has hit safely in his last six games and is batting .524 with a homer and four RBIs during that stretch.  That's the most ideal way to do it.  Joey Votto cranked his 17th home run of the season in the ninth inning for the Reds (29-31), who had their four-game winning streak snapped. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DodgersCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchDodgers left-hander Rich Hill (3-2) limited the Reds to a run and two hits with five strikeouts and three walks in five innings. In his last three starts, Hill is 2-0 with a 2.57 ERA.  Austin (Barnes) did a tremendous job just in between innings after the third inning,  Hill said of his battery mate.  We had a little bit of a lull, but we got back on track in the fourth and fifth innings, and they were very good. You could see the contrast.  Kenta Maeda worked the final four innings for his first major league save. Maeda yielded a run and three hits, fanned five and walked none in his first appearance out of the bullpen. The Reds lost starter Amir Garrett in the second inning. Barnes hit a line drive back to the mound that hit the palm of the pitching hand of Garrett, who was trying to catch the ball over his head. The rookie left-hander went down for several minutes. Garrett attempted several practice pitches but was unable to continue. Reliever Jake Buchanan replaced him. Garrett, who said he was forced to leave because he had no feeling in the hand, was diagnosed with a hand contusion. X-rays were negative, and Garrett said he should be able to make his next start.  I didn't really have time to react (and) I was in an awkward position,  said Garrett (3-5), who gave up two runs, two hits with a walk and a strikeout in one-plus innings.  Hit me in my hand, but X-rays came back and were negative. We're good to go. It's a little tight now, a little bruised, but it's nothing a little ice can't fix.  Reds manager Bryan Price said,  It was a scary moment. I think he was going up to catch the ball with his glove and brought his left hand up as well and the ball ended up hitting in his left hand. Fortunately, it was right in the palm.  Turner drilled a 2-1 Garrett pitch over the left-field wall for a 2-0 Los Angeles edge with one out in the first inning. It was Turner's second home run this season. Jose Peraza's RBI single in the second scored Eugenio Suarez and pulled the Reds within 2-1. But the Dodgers touched Buchanan for two runs in the third and two in the fourth. With the bases loaded, Barnes dribbled an infield run-scoring single that plated Corey Seager. Buchanan made a wild throw to first on the play, allowing Logan Forsythe to score for a 4-1 advantage in the third.  They did a lot of good things,  Price said of the Dodgers.  With Hill, he snapped off some good breaking balls and located some good fastballs. He had a good mix going and the only guy who could figure him out was Peraza.  Then Maeda comes in and all of sudden he looks like he's back on top of his game, he's throwing 92, 94 with a power slider and spot on with his location. We weren't able to do anything until the ninth when Joey hit the homer and we got the two other base hits.  NOTES: Dodgers 3B Justin Turner (right hamstring strain) was activated from the 10-day disabled list. The club optioned OF Brett Eibner to Triple-A Oklahoma City. The Dodgers also reinstated LHP Luis Avilan from the disabled list and placed RHP Sergio Romo (left ankle sprain) on the DL. ...

{"content":"Brewers win slugfest against Diamondbacks PHOENIX -- Jonathan Villar saved the game with a huge defensive play in the eighth inning, but was understandably nowhere to be found in the Milwaukee Brewers' clubhouse at Chase Field after Friday night's 8-6 win over the host Arizona Diamondbacks. Villar had already left, injured on the play and suffering from back spasms that required X-rays. Despite the injury, which appeared serious as Villar had to be helped onto a cart and taken off the field, the Brewers got an uplifting win over a hot team. Jesus Aguilar and Nick Franklin delivered run-scoring pinch hits for Milwaukee. The hits, part of an offense that produced 14 total on the night, gave the National League Central Division-leading Brewers their third win in four games and third straight over the Diamondbacks, who had won nine straight at home and were a major league-best 24-8 at Chase Field this season. Villar had two hits and an RBI before leaving the game. With Milwaukee up 8-6 in the eighth, he laid out in the hole at second base to snare a hard bouncer from Chris Herrmann, got to his feet and somehow threw out Herrmann at first base for the first out of the inning. Brandon Drury, who led off the inning with a double, had to be held at third base, and the Diamondbacks never scored in the inning. Villar stayed on the ground for some time while being checked by trainers, and had trouble standing, walking to and sitting on the cart. Brewers manager Craig Counsell reported the back spasms. Then he talked about the importance of the play.  It was outstanding. Hopefully it's just kind of one of those things that once it loosens up it gets pretty good,  Counsell said. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at DiamondbacksMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchOrlando Arcia went 3-for-3 with an RBI, Manny Pina had three hits, two RBIs and scored twice and Hernan Perez hit a solo home run for Milwaukee (33-29). Starter Zach Davies (7-3) earned the win by lasting five innings and allowing three earned runs on four hits with four strikeouts and two walks.  I was proud of myself after that first inning for being able to go after guys and being able to get ahead a little,  Davies said.  Some pitches started working for me there.  Diamondbacks reliever T.J. McFarland (3-1) gave up Aguilar's double in the sixth -- Brett Phillips scored and Arcia came home on an outfield fielding error -- and took the loss. He worked 1 1/3 innings and allowed three earned runs on five hits. Aguilar said he was looking for a high pitch with the infield in. He yanked his big hit into an open area along the left field line.  Unfortunately we couldn't close the gap offensively. They jumped out to that 8-4 lead and I think we ran out of gas,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.  They did a good job offensively. They kept pressuring us, we made some mistakes defensively. ... The Brewers came out and hit the ball well. Unfortunately we couldn't keep pace.  Arcia's sacrifice fly and Franklin's two-out single off reliever Tom Wilhelmsen gave the Brewers an 8-4 lead in the seventh. Those runs were charged to McFarland. The Diamondbacks (37-26) came back with two runs in the bottom of the inning and threatened for more. Gregor Blanco tripled and scored on David Peralta's single, and Brewers reliever Jacob Barnes walked two to load the bases around Chris Owings' sacrifice fly. But Barnes escaped further damage by inducing a weak grounder back to the mound from Nick Ahmed. Jared Hughes, Carlos Torres and Corey Knebel also pitched scoreless relief for the Brewers. Knebel earned a four-out save, his eighth save of the season.  He's putting together quite a remarkable season,  Counsell said of Knebel.  He had to go through the middle of their lineup, too.  Milwaukee scored three runs in the first inning off Arizona starter Randall Delgado, all on a pair of two-out hits. Pina doubled down the left-field line to drive in Domingo Santana and Perez, and Villar blooped a double near the same spot to score Pina. The Diamondbacks got right back into the game with one mighty swing in the bottom of the first. Jake Lamb's home run landed in the patio area that juts out over right-center field, 413 feet from home plate. Lamb has 16 home runs and raised his major league-leading RBI total to 56. Perez put the Brewers in front again 4-3 with his eighth home run, a solo shot with two outs in the top of the fifth.  Everybody's doing a great job right now and that's why we're winning games,  Perez said.  In my mind I was just hoping nothing really bad happened to him (Villar).  Delgado made it through five innings, allowing four runs on seven hits with five strikeouts and two walks. The Diamondbacks took him off the hook for a loss in the bottom of the fifth thanks to a two-out run-scoring single from Paul Goldschmidt, who drove in Peralta after he doubled off Davies. Goldschmidt, who entered the game a .391 career hitter against Milwaukee, has reached base safely in 36 straight home games, one shy of tying Stephen Drew's club record. NOTES: The Brewers played without 3B Travis Shaw, who was placed on the family medical emergency list and is away from the team. Shaw's wife gave birth to the couple's daughter earlier in the week. ... Milwaukee called up OF Brett Phillips from Triple-A Colorado Springs in time for Friday's game, and Phillips started in center field. ...

{"content":"Padres halt five-game slide with 6-3 win over Royals SAN DIEGO -- Matt Szczur said he was thinking of Jhoulys Chacin in the bottom of the seventh at Petco Park on Friday night as he was preparing to pinch-hit for the San Diego Padres' starting pitcher.  Chacin pitched a great game,  said Szczur.  I wanted to pick him up.  Szczur led off the bottom of the seventh with a pinch-hit home run off left-handed reliever Matt Strahm (1-3) to break a tie and lead the Padres to a 6-3 win over the Kansas City Royals in an interleague game.  That was pretty cool,  said Szczur.  That picked up him, it picked the team up, it picked me up. I've been grinding lately.  Szczur was hitless in his last 15 at-bats when he drove a 2-and-1 fastball from Strahm 385 feet into the left field stands for his second homer as a Padre. The outfielder was at it again in the ninth, doubling in the middle of a three-run rally against former Padres reliever Chris Young that expanded the lead to 6-2. But nothing comes easy for San Diego these days. The Royals loaded the bases with no one out in the ninth and scored one run on a sacrifice fly before closer Brandon Maurer got Alcides Escobar to ground into a game-ending double play. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at PadresKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchSzczur's heroics helped the Padres snap a five-game Padres' losing streak and made a winner of right-hander Chacin (5-5). Chacin allowed only three hits and two walks with six strikeouts over seven innings, although one of the hits was a two-run, game-tying homer by catcher Salvador Perez in the fifth. Chacin took a no-hitter into the fifth when Eric Hosmer opened with a single followed by Perez's 12th homer.  My slider was good today,  said Chacin, who further widened his home-road splits.  I could see the slider was working in the first inning. I wanted to go deep into the game tonight. On Perez, I was trying to go in on him and he's a good hitter.  Chacin is 3-1 at Petco Park this season with a 1.58 earned-run average in six starts. He is 2-4 on the road with a 10.27 ERA in seven starts.  It was his really good slider tonight,  said Royals manager Ned Yost of Chacin. The Padres scored single runs in each the first and second but squandered opportunities for more -- and it came back to bite them. Jose Pirela opened the game with single, but was immediately erased on a double play. Wil Myers, Hunter Renfroe and Austin Hedges followed with consecutive sharp singles off left-handed starter Eric Skoglund to give the Padres a 1-0 lead. Cory Spangenberg opened the second with a single, but was picked off first. Erick Aybar and Chacin followed with back-to-back doubles to make it 2-1. After Skoglund walked Pirela and Yangervis Solarte, he was removed from the game in favor of left-handed reliever Scott Alexander, whose second pitch with the bases loaded bounced away from Perez. But the catcher recovered and caught Chacin off third. Myers then struck out. Nine of the 11 Padres facing Skoglund reached base and the seven hits included a pair of doubles. But there was a double play in the four-hit first and two runners were caught off base in the second.  My pitches were in the middle and they were able to square some balls up and that was about it,  said Skoglund.  I wasn't getting ahead and that's the bread-and-butter right there.   They were just on him,  Yost said of Skoglund.  They were just having good swings on him. Mostly it was pitch location. They were kind of diving out on him and getting good pitches to hit.  Chacin allowed only a walk through the first four innings thanks to a couple defensive gems by Aybar at short. But Hosmer grounded a single to right past the dive of second baseman Solarte to open the fifth and Perez drove Chacin's next pitch 394 feet into the second deck in left for the game-tying homer. The Padres were leading 3-2 when they added three runs in the eighth against Young. Aybar singled with two out and advanced to third on Szczur's double to left-center. Pinch-hitter Franchy Cordero followed with a two-run double and scored when Solarte's fly to right fell between Kansas City second baseman Whit Merrifield and right fielder Jorge Bonifacio for a single.  Szczur and Cordero coming through as pinch-hitters was huge for us,  said Padres manager Andy Green. The Royals loaded the bases on three straight singles by Lorenzo Cain, Hosmer and Perez with none out in the ninth, but scored only one run on Mike Moustakas' sacrifice fly just ahead of the game-ending double play. NOTES: The Padres optioned struggling 3B Ryan Schimpf to Triple-A El Paso and recalled RHP Jose Valdez from the Chihuahuas. Schimpf led the Padres with 14 homers but was hitting .158 with a .284 on-base percentage and 70 strikeouts in 165 at-bats. He was hitless in his last 10 at-bats with eight strikeouts. Valdez pitched three scoreless innings in his one appearance with the Padres earlier this season. ... Salvador Perez's two-run homer in the fifth inning was the 94th of his career, setting a record for Royals catchers. ... Friday night was the first of five straight interleague games for the Royals at National League West teams. They play two at San Francisco next Tuesday and Wednesday.","keywords":"Andy Green,Austin Hedges,Brandon Maurer,Chris Young,Cory Spangenberg,Eric Hosmer,Eric Skoglund,Erick Aybar,Jhoulys Chacin,Jorge Bonifacio,Jose Pirela,Jose Valdez,Lorenzo Cain,Matt Strahm,Matt Szczur,Mike Moustakas,Ned Yost,Ryan Schimpf,Salvador Perez,Scott Alexander,Whit Merrifield,Yangervis Solarte,BBO,ROYALS,PADRES,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-06-10 02:41:00","news_title":"Padres halt five-game slide with 6-3 win over Royals","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED6ABGFKIK"}

{"content":"Cloyd wins in return as Mariners edge Blue Jays SEATTLE -- Tyler Cloyd waited nearly four years for this moment. Making his first appearance in the major leagues since Sept. 29, 2013, the 30-year-old right-hander pitched one inning of relief to get the victory as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 on Friday night at Safeco Field. Jarrod Dyson scored one run, drove in what proved to be the winner and made a key defensive play for the Mariners (31-31), who reached .500 for the third time this season. Reliever Nick Vincent struck out the side after allowing a leadoff single in the eighth inning and Edwin Diaz pitched the ninth for his 10th save for Seattle, which has won 10 of its past 12 games. Jose Bautista hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays (29-32), who dropped to 1-3 on their six-game trip. Toronto has scored three runs or fewer in five of its past six games. Cloyd (1-0) pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012-13, going 4-9 in 19 games, including 17 starts. After spending the 2015 season in Korea, he returned to the United States in 2016 but injured his arm while pitching for the New York Yankees' Triple-A affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and underwent Tommy John surgery. Cloyd was pitching in the independent Atlantic League when the Mariners purchased his contract on May 12 and assigned him to Triple-A Tacoma. He was called up June 2 but didn't see any action until Friday, when he relieved starter Sam Gaviglio in the seventh inning. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at MarinersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch I've been a little antsy,  Cloyd said.  I knew I had to be ready. The ballgame on the line and those guys are good hitters.  Cloyd struck out Ezequiel Carrera to start the inning and got Ryan Goins to ground out to short. With two outs, Kevin Pillar singled down the right-field line. Josh Donaldson then doubled into left center as Dyson made a diving attempt but the ball glanced off his glove. Dyson smothered the ball with his bare hand and got it back in quickly to shortstop Taylor Motter, who made a strong throw to the plate. Catcher Mike Zunino applied the tag on Pillar to end the inning.  Unbelievable play,  Cloyd said.  Dice did a great job knocking it down and Motter threw a strike to Z.  That seemed to spark the Mariners, who took the lead with two runs in the bottom of the seventh. Robinson Cano led off with a double off the center-field wall against Toronto starter Joe Biagini (1-5). After a one-out walk to Kyle Seager, Danny Valencia grounded a run-scoring single into left field to make it 2-2.  Valencia's ball just found a hole,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  I thought (Biagini) was great, really against one of the top lineups top to bottom you can find in the American League.  A walk to Zunino loaded the bases and Dyson lined an RBI single to center. Valencia was thrown out at the plate trying to score a second run on the hit. Seattle added an insurance run in the eighth on Seager's two-out RBI single off reliever Aaron Loup.  The best thing about this team, there's no hitting the panic button,  Motter said. After getting out of a bases-loaded jam in the first, Gaviglio allowed an unearned in the second. Russell Martin led off with a walk, advanced to second on a passed ball and moved to third when Carrera lined a single off the glove of Valencia at first base. Goins then grounded to first and Valencia stumbled as he attempted to start a double play. Valencia was able to recover and get the out at second, but Martin scored on the play. Gaviglio induced Pillar to ground into an inning-ending double play. With one out in the top of the third, Bautista hit a 413-foot homer down the left-field line to make it 2-0. It was Bautista's 11th home run of the season. The Mariners got a run back in the bottom of the inning as Dyson singled to right field with one out, stole second and moved to third on a wild pitch. Ben Gamel drove Dyson home with a two-out single. Gaviglio went six innings, tying his career high. He allowed two runs (one earned) and six hits. He walked three and struck out five.  Gaviglio was on the edge a little early but kept it in check and gave us a chance to win,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.

Kyrie Irving scored a game-high 40 points and LeBron James chipped in with 31 as the defending champions pulled to within 3-1 and forced the best-of-seven series back to Oakland.  We finally settled in, man, it was about damn time, for all of us just to really see what playing well as a group looks like against a great team like the Warriors,  said Irving.  We understand who they have on their team and what they're about and how established they are, but I think that in those three losses we lost track of who we were at the time.

The Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Warriors 137-116 in Game 4 of the Finals on Friday night to avoid elimination. Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 40 points and LeBron James broke all kinds of records as he posted a triple-double. The loss ended the Warriors' bid for a perfect 16-0 run through the playoffs, which had never been done. Golden State leads 3-1 in the series as it shifts back to Oakland, Calif., for Game 5 on Monday night.  The magnitude of the games, especially the last game, it hit me in a very deep place,  said Irving, who made 15 of 27 shots from the floor and drained seven 3-pointers -- tied for second most in a Finals game.  Glad that we got the monkey off our back in terms of just getting one win in this series in terms of going against this great team.  Golden State whiffed at its chance to pop champagne in Cleveland's visiting locker room for the second time in three seasons -- something the Warriors openly discussed as a goal: celebrating at The Q.  I didn't hear it, but some of the other guys heard it and told me that that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker rooms, and I think it came from Draymond (Green), which is OK, that's Dray anyway,  James said.  So I just told guys, I didn't stress anything besides just live in the moment. Live in the moment.  The Cavs set Finals records with 86 points in the first half, 49 in the first quarter, and 3-pointers in a game (24). James finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double, passing Magic Johnson for first place in Finals history. Related CoveragePreview: Warriors at CavaliersKevin Love added 23 points for Cleveland and J.R. Smith finished with 15 points. Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 35 points. Green added 16 points and 14 rebounds and Stephen Curry was 4 of 13 for 14 points.  Just one of those games,  Curry said.  Not going to overreact to one.  The Cavs became the first team in NBA history to recover from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals last season. No team has come back from 3-0 in the playoffs.  Believeland is not going to give up and we're going to keep fighting,  Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said.  We're going to keep scrapping.  The Warriors still have ample chances to win their second title in three seasons over the Cavs, something they failed to do last season.  Different team, man, different team,  Curry said.  Obviously, we haven't felt this feeling walking off the court with a loss in a while, but we have done a good job bouncing back and being resilient all year.  The third quarter was easily the most chaotic of the Finals. It started with 6:18 left in the quarter when Green appeared to pick up his second technical. Instead of an automatic ejection, however, Green stayed in the game because officials insisted the first technical given to him -- with 1:55 left in the first quarter -- was actually assessed to Warriors coach Steve Kerr. And with 1:10 left in the quarter, Zaza Pachulia and Kyle Korver were tied up on a loose ball. In the scrum, Pachulia appeared to kick Iman Shumpert -- who was standing over him -- once and punch him twice. Instead of an ejection for Pachulia, however, he and Shumpert were slapped with technicals. The quarter closed with a 3-ball from Curry with 12 seconds to go, answered by one from James with 2.7 seconds remaining. The Cavs led 115-96. Cleveland led 86-68 at halftime and were up by as many as 22. The 86 points were the most in a half in NBA Finals history. A Durant 3-pointer at the buzzer brought the Warriors a little closer. Irving was up to 28 points and James had already registered 22 points, six rebounds and eight assists. The Cavs made 13 3-pointers. The Cavaliers set a Finals record with 49 points in the first quarter and led by 16 when it was over. James had two foul shots with 2.9 seconds left and missed one, otherwise Cleveland would've hung 50 on the Warriors. Four players -- Green, Klay Thompson, Curry and Andre Iguodala -- were whistled for two fouls in the first quarter. The Cavs took 22 free throws in the quarter but only made 14. They were 17-of-26 from the line at halftime.  That was pretty much the factor (the fouls) in that first quarter,  Curry said.  The aggressor usually gets the whistle and they were the aggressor.  NOTES: LeBron James said his mother, Gloria, did not want him to return to Cleveland and play for the Cavaliers in 2014, according to cleveland.com. James made the disclosure in a production for his online platform for athletes, Uninterrupted, in which he, Warriors star F Draymond Green, rapper 2 Chainz, and James' inner circle sat around at a barbershop during All-Star weekend in New Orleans. James said his mom didn't want him to leave the Miami Heat for the Cavs because of the letter Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert wrote to fans the night James bolted for the Heat in 2010. ... James passed Michael Jordan for third place in NBA Finals scoring history with his first basket and for first in free throws in the Finals. Jordan scored 1,176 points and connected on 1,463 free throws in six Finals. ... When the Warriors received 31 points from Kevin Durant and 30 from Klay Thompson in Game 3, it was the first time a team had two players score 30 points in consecutive Finals games since Elgin Baylor and Jerry West did it with the Los Angeles Lakers in Games 6 and 7 of the 1962 Finals.","keywords":"Andre Iguodala,Dan Gilbert,Draymond Green,Elgin Baylor,Gloria,Iman Shumpert,J.R.

The detentions of a factory owner and two managers followed an inspection in Linhai city, in the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, that revealed the dumping of unprocessed waste water by a plant making auto repair tools, Xinhua said. It cited an unnamed city official as saying the water, used for metal polishing and surface treatment, showed excessive levels of zinc, bronze and nickel, with the zinc content at more than 180 times the limit.   The three suspects face charges of polluting the environment, and could be jailed for up to seven years if convicted, the agency added.  Worried by the social and political impact of pollution, China has vowed to crack down on lawbreaking companies and the local governments that protect them.

{"content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Post Holdings (6178.T) plans to slow the pace of future acquisitions, shifting away from its earlier aggressive investment strategy as it smarts from losses over its purchase of Australian logistics company Toll Holdings, the Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.  Japan Post President Masatsugu Nagato said the company must be more careful about how much it pays for and how it manages its acquisitions, according to the Japanese newspaper. The company announced in April a $3.6 billion writedown at the Australian firm just two years after the $4.9 billion takeover. The writedown, which led to Japan Post's first annual loss in more than a decade, marks the latest in a string of high-profile failures of foreign takeovers by Japanese companies including Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (2503.T), and has raised questions about Japan's corporate governance reforms.  Right now, good deals are not out there,  the Japanese newspaper quoted Nagato as saying in an interview.  We had said we should go after M&As; as opportunities arise, but we should tone that down.      Nagato told the Nikkei he would cut spending at Toll and tighten its operations, conceding that its problems at the Australian company were the result of lax management and Japan Post's failure to foresee that slowing commodity prices would drag on Australia's resource-dependent economy. Despite the failures at Toll, he said Japan Post would have to acquire more businesses in the future as it needed to look beyond postal services to increase revenue.  The Toll acquisition has raised questions over due diligence procedures at Japan Post, which is 80 percent owned by the Japanese government, and its plan to integrate Toll's sprawling business into a global conglomerate spanning postal delivery, banking and insurance.  The government is preparing a second offering of shares in Japan Post as it seeks to privatize the postal service.

{"content":"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The Cleveland Cavaliers, left for dead in the NBA Finals, finally showed a pulse by trouncing the Golden State Warriors in a physical clash on Friday that could shift the tone of the series and spark a record-setting comeback. The Cavaliers dropped the first three games of the NBA's best-of-seven championship but rather than watch the Warriors celebrate on their home court for the second time in three years, came out with their most physical effort yet.  You get down 3-0 and you're fighting and you're trying to get a win, you do whatever it takes,  Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue told reporters after his team's 137-116 win.  I thought we really brought a physicality to the game. We had a purpose and we cut down some of our mistakes we have been making those first three games and were able to play well.  The Cavaliers, who last year made an unprecedented rally from a 3-1 Finals deficit to beat the Warriors, were physical right from the opening tip in what was easily the most emotionally-charged game of the series.

{"content":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday backed Mexico to press for a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Donald Trump, thanking its government for keeping German interests in mind during the talks. Germany and Mexico have pursued policies tailored toward exporting manufactured goods, and both ran trade surpluses of more than $60 billion with the United States last year. Many of the biggest names in German manufacturing have factories in both Mexico and the United States, including carmakers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. However, tension over trade has surfaced under U.S. President Trump and his  America First  policy. Claiming that their gains have come at the expense of U.S. manufacturers, Trump has repeatedly attacked Germany and Mexico over their trade surpluses. And he has vowed to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it in favor of the United States. Speaking on a visit to Mexico just a few weeks after her foreign minister visited the country and backed its pro-NAFTA stance, Merkel said she was pleased the deal's signatories, the United States, Mexico and Canada, were talking about an update.

And I'd like to offer thanks that the interests of German companies are also being taken into consideration.

Slideshow (4 Images)Formal talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico to start renegotiating the accord that took effect in 1994 are expected to begin from around mid-August. Merkel also welcomed the fact that sectors like energy could be included in the NAFTA revamp, after Mexico opened up its oil and gas market to private investment at the end of 2013, ending a longstanding state monopoly on production and exploration. Still, unruly parts of Mexico where organized crime holds sway have rattled some investors, and gang violence has recently been on the increase again. Merkel said Mexico faces big challenges from organized crime, adding that Germany was willing and able to help in that fight. She said Europe, like Mexico, was also suffering from problems linked to violence like terrorism. Merkel also said she hoped for a speedy conclusion this year to talks between Mexico and the EU to update a free trade accord.

{"content":"Maybin's career night powers Angels past Astros HOUSTON -- With Cameron Maybin back from the disabled list and back atop the batting order, the Los Angeles Angels found the spark they required to provide right-hander Matt Shoemaker the cushion he needed to keep rolling. Maybin played the role of offensive linchpin and Shoemaker capitalized on early run support with a midgame groove as the Los Angeles Angels claimed a 9-4 victory over the Houston Astros on Friday night at Minute Maid Park. Maybin went 3-for-4 with a walk, four runs and a career-high four steals. He was the catalyst for an offense that featured two-hit games from Kole Calhoun, Yunel Escobar, Andrelton Simmons and Martin Maldonado. Calhoun had three RBIs and one of six walks for the Angels (32-32), four by Astros starter Brad Peacock (3-1). Related CoveragePreview: Angels at AstrosLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch I just really enjoy just creating some havoc out there, putting some pressure on the guys,  Maybin said.  I've always been pretty good at getting bags and tonight they just didn't do a great job of holding me and I got some really good jumps out there. Just trying to put some pressure on those guys, get into scoring position for guys like Kole, A.P. (Albert Pujols), and they did a great job of driving me in tonight.  Again, I've got to be that spark right now. That's what I enjoy doing, getting things started, leading the way, and we've got to keep the momentum.  Shoemaker (6-3), who has won five of six starts, passed his biggest test in the third inning. After surrendering two runs in the second and a leadoff double to Josh Reddick in the third, Shoemaker retired the heart of the Houston order -- Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Carlos Beltran -- in succession to ignite a stretch of 13 consecutive outs as the Angels extended their lead from two runs to 8-2.  That was important at the time and it's obviously important for us to keep the lead,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He was able to get Altuve, Correa and Beltran without that run scoring.  Marwin Gonzalez ended that stretch of dominance with a single one batter before Alex Bregman cranked his seventh home run with one out in the seventh. But it was too little too late for the Astros (43-19), who had their streak of games with at least five runs scored snapped at 12. Peacock labored from the start, issuing three one-out walks after Maybin opened the game with an infield single. Maybin scored when Luis Valbuena drew a bases-loaded walk, the lone run in the first despite Peacock tossing 29 pitches.  They put together some good at-bats and I paid for it, but I just wasn't getting ahead,  Peacock said.  The fastball just didn't feel very good tonight, and they were hitting it and getting on.  It was more of the same for Peacock in the second and third innings. He surrendered a two-run single to Calhoun in the second that scored Danny Espinosa and Maybin. After Escobar stroked a leadoff double in the third, Valbuena brought him home with a single to right field one batter later. After the Houston bullpen struggled with a heavy workload during the recently-completed 10-game road trip, Peacock provided only three innings in his start, allowing four runs, seven hits and four walks on 76 pitches.  It was not our night on the mound,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  It felt like they had someone on base virtually every inning, and they put a lot of pressure on us. We didn't execute the pitches we needed to and they had traffic on the bases all night. There was never really a comfortable inning.  NOTES: Astros RHP Charlie Morton played catch for the first time since landing on the 10-day disabled list with a right lat strain on May 25. Morton tossed between 80-90 feet, the start of a long road to recovery. ...

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rough few months for most U.S. bank stocks has been particularly unkind to regional banks, and that’s not likely to change soon as hopes dim for higher long-term interest rates and timely policy relief from Washington. While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P; 600 index .SPSMCBKS of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P; 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks .SPXBK is unchanged. The full S&P; 500 .SPX, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals.  I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through,  said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks.  Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. Waiting for Clarity   Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts.         Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well,  said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P; Bank Exchange Traded Fund (KBE.P) and SPDR S&P; Regional Banking ETF (KRE.P) increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector.  Short interest in the S&P; bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble  winning congressional support for legislative changes to  regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report.         If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals,  said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

{"content":"Wacha quiets Phillies as Cardinals snap skid ST. LOUIS -- As Michael Wacha chased Freddy Galvis' potential game-tying hit with two outs and a runner at third in the top of the ninth inning Friday night, the St. Louis Cardinals left fielder thought about one thing.  I have to make this catch because I don't want to go into extra innings,  he said.  We have an early game tomorrow. I don't want us to stay late and come here early.  Pham's diving snag of Galvis' liner capped one of the more tumultuous days in recent franchise history and ended a seven-game losing streak, giving St. Louis a 3-2 decision over the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. Hours after executing six personnel changes on the playing roster and coaching staff, the Cardinals (27-32) won for only the sixth time in 23 games. They did so with the one formula that usually ensures success no matter who's on a roster - pitching. Michael Wacha (3-3) won for the first time in seven starts with six solid innings and three relievers each worked a scoreless inning. None of that would have mattered had Pham not used his speed, as well as help from newly-promoted third base coach Mike Shildt. Just before Galvis poked a 1-2 pitch from closer Seung Hwan Oh down the left field line, Shildt, who is also in charge of positioning outfielders, moved Pham closer to the line. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at CardinalsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchMoments later, Pham made the game-saving play and music played in the St. Louis clubhouse for the first time since June 1, when it last won a game.  It feels good to have the music blaring in here after a win,  Wacha said.  It's been a while.  Wacha did his part to start the postgame concert. After allowing two two-out runs in the third on Tommy Joseph's RBI single and Aaron Altherr's triple off the right field wall, Wacha cruised through the last three innings, allowing just one hit and mowing down seven of the last eight men. He gave up five hits and two runs in his longest outing since May 19, walking two and fanning two.  I felt like I had pretty good command of mostly everything,  Wacha said.  The one inning, I got in trouble with a couple of two-out hits. Overall, my stuff felt really good.  The Cardinals got those runs back in their half of the third off Jeremy Hellickson. Stephen Piscotty's sacrifice fly to the wall in center scored Matt Carpenter and Jedd Gyorko's RBI single up the middle plated Dexter Fowler to tie it. In the fifth, Aledmys Diaz homered for the first time since May 1, belting a bad 1-2 offering over the wall in left-center field. It was his sixth homer of the year and provided the difference. Hellickson (5-4) allowed 10 hits and three runs in six innings, walking one and whiffing five.  Hellickson dodged bullets all night,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  He gave up a lot of hits but beared down when he had to. He pitched well enough to win and he pitched well enough to lose. We just couldn't score.  Given that the St. Louis bullpen had coughed up 11 runs in its previous 8 1/3 innings, Hellickson might have expected to get a win upon his departure. Instead, Matt Bowman struck out the side in the seventh. Trevor Rosenthal pitched around a leadoff hit in the eighth. Oh tightroped through the ninth, overcoming Altherr's bloop double and stranding him at third. It was Oh's 14th save in 16 chances. But if saves were given to fielders for defensive plays, Pham would have definitely logged one.  We have an early game tomorrow. I don't want us to stay late and come here early,  Pham said.

{"content":"Ninth-inning run lifts Braves past Mets ATLANTA -- Pinch-hitter Rio Ruiz had the first game-ending hit of his career Friday night, scoring another rookie for the Atlanta Braves' third walk-off victory of the season. Dansby Swanson hustled an apparent single up the middle into a double with one out in the ninth inning and Ruiz singled to the opposite field on reliever Josh Edgin's first pitch to give the Braves a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets.  I'm not surprised with anything from him,  Ruiz said of Swanson.  He will always take the extra base if he has the opportunity. He saw it and was aggressive and he's usually not wrong. He started that whole thing and put me in position to drive him in.  Swanson, who had smashed a two-run double in the sixth inning, used his speed, instincts and aggressiveness to do in the Mets in the ninth as center fielder Curtis Granderson, who doesn't have a strong arm, was slow getting to the ball.  As we're always saying, 'Just make them stop you.' I kept going and didn't really hesitate,  Swanson said.  I felt that was the right thing to do and it worked out. Any way to get in scoring position.   He is a kid who comes out of the box thinking two,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said of his shortstop.  That's a baseball player. That's why we love that kid the way we do, because he never stops playing the game.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at BravesNew York Mets - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchGranderson and Travis d'Arnaud hit homers, but the Mets couldn't get a victory for starter Matt Harvey. Braves starter Julio Teheran wasn't rewarded, either. Jim Johnson, who pitched the top of the ninth for the Braves, got the victory to go to 4-1 and Fernando Salas, who gave up the one-out hit by Swanson, took his second loss.  It seems like every day it's something that happens that has kept us from getting going, from an injury or whatever it might be,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  We can't seem to put it together right now.  Jason Motte gave up the tying homer in the seventh inning by d'Arnaud, who connected on a 1-1 pitch and sent a drive to left field for seventh blast of the season. Teheran, who has an 8-4 career record against the Mets, allowed four hits and a run in six innings, walking three and striking out three before being lifted for a pinch hitter. Harvey was pulled with a 1-0 lead after throwing 102 pitches in five innings in his first scoreless outing of the season and the Braves pounced on reliever Paul Sewald in the sixth. Matt Kemp, who had three hits, led off with a double and Danny Santana was intentionally walked after Sewald threw three balls. Swanson pulled a 3-2 pitch to left field for a double, driving in both runners. Harvey, who gave up six runs each time in consecutive losses to the Braves earlier this season, allowed four hits, walked two and struck out three.  I thought it was a step forward for Matt,  Collins said. Teheran retired the first six batters before Granderson led off the third inning by picking on a 2-0 pitch and smashing his sixth homer over the center-field fence. The blast was the 15th allowed by Teheran, and it gave the Mets at least one homer in 12 straight road games and 23 of their past 25 away from New York. The Braves left six runners on base in the first four innings against Harvey, including the bases loaded in the second.  It's definitely a step in the right direction for where I want to be in terms of keeping runs off the board,  Harvey said.  Obviously ... you'd like to be able to go deeper in the game. That's the thing that's frustrating to me, especially with the doubleheader coming up tomorrow.

{"content":"Streaky Bradley Jr. helps Red Sox rally past Tigers BOSTON -- It's no secret that when the streaky Jackie Bradley Jr. is in the middle of one of his good stretches, he makes the Boston Red Sox far more dangerous. The center fielder is enjoying one of those streaks now.  He's on about a three-week run here where the hard hits have been more frequent, the batting average has been better, the extra-base hits are there,  Boston manager John Farrell said after Bradley ripped a long two-out, two-run homer to cap a three-run eighth-inning rally and lift his team to a 5-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in the opener of a three-game series Friday night. Bradley, hitting just .231 for the season, drove in a run with a fourth-inning single and then hit his fourth homer in his last 13 games to win it. He drove in his 11th, 12th and 13th RBIs in his last 10 games and has batted .333 over that span. His moonshot capped a night that saw the Red Sox, stymied to the tune of one run in the last two games against the Yankees in New York, rally from three runs down to pull out the win. After Mitch Moreland, who homered and doubled earlier, tied the game with an RBI single, Bradley hit a 1-1 pitch from Alex Wilson (1-3) over the visitors' bullpen in right field for his eighth homer. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at Red SoxDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch That's one of the longer home runs I've seen hit in this ballpark,  said Farrell.  You think ... that's halfway to the red seat (in the bleachers reached by Ted Williams), which almost seems like it's a myth how far the red seat is.  A beautiful swing. Well hit. Timely, no doubt.  Moreland, who has 10 extra-base hits in his last 10 games, made a big stretch to save Pablo Sandoval from an error and end the top of the fourth, led off the bottom with his homer, starting the comeback.  It's important, it's very important,  said Bradley.  We had just lost two on the road so we definitely wanted to start things off right back at home. This was a big win. Hopefully we can get some momentum and keep it going.  Said Wilson:  I just didn't get a ball where it needed to go and he took care of it.  The big inning started when right fielder J.D. Martinez failed to catch up to a Xander Bogaerts pop fly in short right ( we caught a break,  said Farrell) before Bogaerts took second on Wilson's wild pickoff throw. Brian Johnson, summoned from the minors for the third time and third start, struggled through 4 1/3 innings (105 pitches) but kept the Red Sox alive before the bullpen threw 4 2/3 scoreless innings.  That was the key,  said Farrell. Matt Barnes (4-2) pitched the top of the eighth and got the win and Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth for the 18th save of his dominant season. He had two strikeouts, ending the game with Miguel Cabrera's fourth K in five at-bats in the game. The win was the Red Sox' fourth in 29 games when trailing after seven innings. They had scored just three runs in their previous 25 innings before erupting in the eighth. Bradley's homer was his second hit of the game to go with two strikeouts. Asked about the .231 batting average being a bit misleading, Farrell said,  The percentage of hard contact is indicative of a better average. If you're saying he's a .230 hitter, it's one of the harder .230 averages you might see.  The Tigers, who have lost three of their last four, got six solid innings from Jordan Zimmerman, who turned in his second straight quality start. He was hit on the leg by a 111 mph liner off the bat of Bogaerts in the first inning but stayed in, manager Brad Ausmus saying,  It's tough to shake him off the mound. Unless his leg's severed, he's not coming out.  Nicholas Castellanos and Mikey Mahtook homered and Martinez and Jose Iglesias both had three hits for the Tigers (29-31).  We kind of split the game,  said Ausmus.  The first half went to us. The second half went to them. And their second half was better than our first.  NOTES: Boston manager John Farrell met with LHP David Price concerning Price's outburst at the media in New York Wednesday night. ... Tigers 3B Nicholas Castellanos made his 12th error of the season, high among all 3Bs and three more than he made in 108 games last season. ...

{"content":"Encarnacion powers Indians past White Sox CLEVELAND -- This was the Edwin Encarnacion the Cleveland Indians have been waiting to see. Encarnacion had three hits, including a two-out, two-run, go-ahead home run in the fifth inning to lift the Cleveland Indians to a 7-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night at Progressive Field.  That was nice for him and nice for us,  said Cleveland manager Terry Francona of Encarnacion's home run.  To see him up there in that situation, doing what we brought him here to do.  Corey Kluber (5-2), in his second start since coming off the disabled list, pitched six innings, giving up three runs and seven hits with eight strikeouts and two walks. Andrew Miller pitched two scoreless innings, striking out four, and closer Cody Allen, in a non-save situation, pitched the ninth. Miguel Gonzalez (4-7) gave up four runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings to take the loss, Chicago's third in a row. Jose Abreu was removed from the game in the seventh inning after getting hit on the left leg by a pitch from Miller. Abreu has a bruised leg, and will be evaluated further on Saturday.  He got hit pretty good, but he thinks he'll be fine,  Chicago manager Rick Renteria said.  It was mostly muscle that got hit. Just below the left knee.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at IndiansChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchLeading 4-3, the Indians scored three insurance runs in the eighth inning against reliever Jake Petricka. Lonnie Chisenhall had an RBI double and Yan Gomes added a two-run single. It was a much-needed win for the Indians, who returned home after losing four of five games on a trip to Kansas City and Colorado.  It's no secret we haven't played the way we want to,  Kluber said.  Maybe we can use tonight as the starting point for us playing better. It's not a bad thing to be reminded that when we play the right way, we get rewarded.  Cleveland took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on an RBI single by Michael Brantley. Kluber sailed through the first two innings but lost it a bit in the third when he gave up four singles and a walk to the first five batters, which the White Sox cashed in for two runs. Adam Engel led off with a single and Kluber struck out Leury Garcia for the first out. Engel then stole second and scored the tying run on a single by Melky Cabrera. Abreu walked and Avisail Garcia followed with a single to center. Cabrera attempted to score from second on the play, but center fielder Bradley Zimmer's throw home was in time to retire Cabrera for the second out.  I got to it quick and tried to get rid of it as quick as I could,  Zimmer said.  Fortunately, I had enough on it to get it there.  Todd Frazier lined a single to center, scoring Abreu and giving Chicago a 2-1 lead. Kluber then righted his ship. He retired Omar Narvaez to end the inning, then struck out the side in order in the fourth inning.  My fastball command wasn't great, but really, they only hit one ball hard. Couple of bloops. Some grounders. I just tried to keep the team in it,  Kluber said. The Indians tied it with a run in the bottom of the fourth. With one out, Encarnacion reached on an infield single. Gonzalez retired Jose Ramirez on a flyout for the second out. But Chisenhall's double off the left field wall moved Encarnacion to third base. Gomes drew a walk to load the bases and Zimmer also walked, forcing in Encarnacion with the tying run.  That was a huge run for us at the time,  Francona said of Zimmer's bases-loaded walk. A sacrifice fly by Abreu in the fifth inning gave the White Sox a 3-2 lead. The Indians took the lead in the bottom of the fifth when Carlos Santana walked and Encarnacion blasted a long home run over the center field wall, his 11th homer of the year, giving Cleveland a 4-3 lead. Ramirez followed with a double and Gonzalez was then removed from the game.  He had a lot of traffic in the one inning, then left a pitch up to Encarnacion (on the home run),  Renteria said of Gonzalez.  He was trying to go away and he missed.

{"content":"Rays slug five home runs in rout of Athletics ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Over the next two months, the Tampa Bay Rays will look to Mallex Smith to replace injured center fielder Kevin Kiermaier. So far, the Rays look to be in pretty good hands. Smith hit a home run, reached base three times and scored three runs as the Rays routed the Oakland Athletics 13-4 on Friday night at Tropicana Field. Tampa Bay (32-31) also had home runs from Steven Souza Jr., Tim Beckham, Logan Morrison and Corey Dickerson while starter Alex Cobb (5-5) gave up one run over six innings.  The team has been playing good,  Smith said.  They are still in the race. The division is very tight so I just wanted to come in here and play my game and stay within myself.  Souza went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and was a double short of a cycle. Jesus Sucre also had three hits and two RBIs. Related CoverageTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch We've talked about the bats coming to life and they certainly did,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Everybody seemed to play a pretty big role. We had a lot of good swings. All the guys really contributed.  We can be a pretty dynamic offense with (Smith) performing that way. I know he's not going to hit a home run every night and get on base every time, but just the way he approached his at bats was pretty impressive so that's great to see.  Athletics starter Andrew Triggs (5-6) lost his fourth consecutive start. Stephen Vogt homered for Oakland (26-34) while Khris Davis and Adam Rosales each had RBI hits. The Rays, who hit four home runs Thursday against the Chicago White Sox, continued using the long ball Friday to get to Triggs early and often. Souza gave the Rays a 3-0 lead with a three-run shot in the first inning. Tampa Bay added runs in the second and third innings to make it 5-0. Sucre had an RBI double in the second while Colby Rasmus knocked an RBI single in the third. That was more than enough for Cobb, who threw 96 pitches and struck out five.  I was able to get in a fastball on both sides of the plate,  Cobb said.  I showed that early and then expanded out of the zone a little bit with some off-speed pitches.  Smith, called up from Triple-A Durham on Friday afternoon, hit his first home run of the season -- a two-run blast to right field in the fourth. Morrison made it 8-0 with a solo homer to right later in the inning. Triggs gave up eight runs on nine hits in 3 2/3 innings. He threw 88 pitches, 54 for strikes.  Everything was up (in the zone),  Triggs said.  I could pinpoint only a handful of pitches where I was really happy with the execution. It really needs to be the flip where you can only think of a handful where you really missed. Walking a leadoff guy, two walks, leads to a three-run home run. That can't happen.  Athletics reliever Zach Neal didn't fare any better as the Rays tagged him for five runs in the fifth. Beckham hit a solo shot to straight-away center, his 10th of the season. Dickerson added a three-run homer in the inning while Sucre had his second RBI hit of the game to make it 13-0.  We've had some really bad stretches and this is probably the worst game, at least from the start, we've had this year,  Athletics manager Bob Melvin said.  Our road record is not that great.

{"content":"Hicks steals Judge's thunder as Yankees rout Orioles NEW YORK -- Things are going so well for Aaron Hicks that he hit a ball into the  Judge's Chambers  -- the section in right field named for the New York Yankees' other outfielder named Aaron who hits homers. The Yankees are also benefitting from a run of solid starting pitching after the best outing of Jordan Montgomery's brief career. Hicks homered twice and Montgomery pitched a career-high seven innings as New York pulled away for an 8-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night. Hicks was batting .205 with two homers and 12 RBIs through New York's first 58 games last year after joining the team in a trade from the Minnesota Twins. After connecting off Dylan Bundy and Edwin Jackson in his third career multi-homer game, Hicks is up to .318 with 10 homers and a career-high 34 RBIs while getting touted by general manager Brian Cashman as a possible All-Star.  It feels really good to be able get off to a hot start and I want to keep it going,  Hicks said.  Especially since last season I got myself in a hole and this year I've started out hot, so it feels good.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi added:  He continues to shine and he's been really helpful.  Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at YankeesBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHicks, who is handling center field duties while Jacoby Ellsbury recovers from a concussion, hit the tiebreaking homer to lead off the sixth. He gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead by sending a 2-1 pitch approximately 406 feet into the section that was created on May 22 in anticipation of homers by Aaron Judge.  That's cool. I got a kick out of it,  Hicks said before laughing when a reporter told him  at least it was a guy named Aaron . Hicks turned in his second multi-homer game of the season. It was the 10th by a Yankee this season, matching their entire total from last season. Montgomery (4-4) won his second straight start after laboring through 4 1/3 innings at Baltimore on May 29. He retired 17 of the final 18 hitters, set a career high with eight strikeouts and threw 94 pitches.  We're giving him smaller bits and pieces, it's kind of what you do with young players,  Girardi said.  We want to see him clear hurdles and he continues to clear them and we really like what he's doing.  Montgomery allowed a two-run homer to Jonathan Schoop in the second inning but little else. In the first time through the lineup, the Orioles were 4-for-8 with a walk and the rest of his outing they were 1-for-17. It also continued a run of strong starting pitching after Masahiro Tanaka allowed three homers Tuesday. Since then, the Yankees have allowed three runs in the last 29 inning,s and since May 31, opponents are 0-for-42 with runners in scoring position. Besides the big night by Hicks and Montgomery's longest outing, others contributed as the Yankees (35-23) tied a season high by going 12 games over .500 for the second time. Starlin Castro hit a solo homer and Chase Headley lifted a sacrifice fly to the warning track in right in the second. After Hicks hit his ninth and 10th homers, Matt Holliday added an RBI double and Austin Romine drove in the final two runs with a base hit. Bundy (6-5) opposed Montgomery for the second time in three starts and allowed three runs and six hits in six innings. He lost for the fourth time in his last five starts despite allowing three earned runs or less for the 12th time.  It's a tough lineup over there, obviously, so you've just got to make quality pitches from the get-go,  Bundy said.  And I didn't really do that in the second inning, or in the sixth, against Hicks.  The Orioles lost for the 12th time in their last 18 games and did not get a hit after Ruben Tejada's second hit of the game. They were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position and in the biggest at-bat of the game, Adam Jones struck out with Tejada at third for the final out of the fifth when the game was still tied.  I'm always going to give some credit to their pitcher,  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.  The young man's having a good year and throwing the ball well. We're just not making many adjustments to pitching patterns that we know are there.

{"content":"Stanton, Moore flex muscles as Marlins maul Pirates PITTSBURGH -- Giancarlo Stanton had a little fun during the Miami Marlins' batting practice. He took aim at the batter's eye in center field at PNC Park and tried to hit a ball over it. He couldn't do it then --  I couldn't get the right pitch,  he said -- but he nearly did later in the evening. Stanton hit a 449-foot homer in the third inning that bounced off the camera platform on top of the batter's eye and back onto the field. It was one of 18 hits the Marlins pounded out Friday night in a 12-7 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Didn't get out of the stadium, man. Hopped back in,  Stanton said with a laugh. He was 2-for-4 with three RBIs. Miami (27-33) got two homers from Tyler Moore, who had four RBIs, and improved to 11-4 in its past 15 games. The Marlins won the first two games of a four-game weekend series by a combined 19-8.  Just a lot of good things offensively tonight,  Miami manager Don Mattingly said.  Everybody making a contribution.  Pittsburgh (26-35) lost its fourth straight to drop to a season-low nine games below .500. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at PiratesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchThe Pirates, who had 13 hits, clawed back from a five-run deficit to come within 7-4. Miami, however, tacked on three more in the sixth, Moore's second homer in the seventh and another run in the eighth for a 12-4 lead. That rendered Pittsburgh's single run in the eighth and another two in the ninth relatively meaningless.  We needed a big hit to stay in the boat race because they kept adding on multiple-run innings,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  It's hard to keep up. We had a chance. We would have had to be really, really effective on offense to continue to run with them.  Pittsburgh right-hander Tyler Glasnow's struggles continued. Glasnow (2-6) gave up seven runs (six earned) and 10 hits in four innings with one strikeout and no walks before he was lifted for a pinch-hitter. Two of the hits were homers.  I just think I'm leaving it in the (strike) zone too much,  Glasnow said.  I guess the difference is I would much rather not walk guys and be in the strike zone. But my two-seam was coming back into the middle. To lefties, it's not really getting in there. To righties, the same.  Miami starter Vance Worley, a former Pirate, wasn't a ton better. He gave up four runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings with two strikeouts and no walks. Dustin McGowan (4-0) followed Worley with 1 1/3 hitless, scoreless innings for the win. Pittsburgh took a short-lived 1-0 lead in the first when David Freese doubled and scored on Josh Harrison's double. Miami took a 2-1 lead in the second on Moore's sacrifice fly RBI and Worley's RBI infield single. Stanton led off the Marlins' third with his 16th homer, the one that nearly cleared the batter's eye, for a 3-1 lead.  He's a strong guy,  Pittsburgh catcher Jacob Stallings said.  He likes it out over the plate, for sure. Maybe he was sitting on it. That was a pretty impressive piece of hitting.  With two outs that inning, Moore hit a two-run shot to left to make it 5-1. Freese's bloop RBI single in the third brought the Pirates within 5-2, but Stanton picked up a groundout RBI in the fourth for a 6-2 Miami edge, and Dee Gordon scored right after when he stole third and scored on catcher Jacob Stallings' throwing error to make it 7-2. The Pirates scored twice in the fourth to cut it to 7-4. Adam Frazier drove in one with a groundout and Jose Osuna scored on a wild pitch. Even with some late runs, Pittsburgh never got closer.  The guys kept basically swinging the bats all night,  Mattingly said.  It's one of the things you like. They were coming. They score early and they kept scoring.  Felt like it was going to be one of those games we were going to have to go out and keep trying to put runs on the board and not be satisfied with the number of runs we were getting.

{"content":"Arrieta stymies former team as Cubs rout Orioles BALTIMORE -- Jake Arrieta certainly enjoyed coming back to Baltimore. The Orioles did not have quite as much fun. Arrieta threw 6 2/3 strong innings in his return to Baltimore and Jason Heyward added a three-run triple as the Chicago Cubs hit three homers in a 10-3 rout of the Orioles on Saturday night. The Orioles (42-48) traded Arrieta to the Cubs in 2013 and the right-hander developed into one of the game's best pitchers after going 20-25 with a 5.46 ERA in Baltimore. He's now 63-28 as a Cub, including two no-hitters and a Cy Young Award (2015), and Saturday's game was the first time the right-hander has pitched at Camden Yards since the trade. However, Arrieta said he loved his time with the Orioles.  You know, I wouldn't trade the years I was here for anything,  Arrieta said.  It was an enjoyable experience. I learned a lot, and I'm able to be the player I am today because of what I went through while I was in the organization.  Arrieta showed Baltimore his new form, allowing just two runs and four hits. He struggled a bit at first, walking three in the first two innings before setting down 14 of the next 15 hitters. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at OriolesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchThe Cubs took the lead while Arrieta was doing that, and the combination proved too much for the Orioles to overcome.  We really swung the bats well, and Jake pitched really good tonight and that was a large part of tonight's game,  Chicago manager Joe Maddon said.  The fact that he kept them in check while we opened up our lead, that's a nice formula.  Chicago (45-45) also gave Arrieta (9-7) plenty of offensive support. Albert Almora and Addison Russell each hit solo homers, and Heyward's triple was the big hit in a four-run fifth inning that gave the Cubs a 7-0 lead. Six of those seven runs came after there were two outs.  That's really frustrating to be that close to getting out of an inning unscathed,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  With Arrieta out there, you feel like runs are going to be at a premium. You're trying to keep it close and see if you can do some damage.  Anthony Rizzo added a solo homer in the eighth -- the team's eighth home run in the first two games -- as the Cubs finished with 16 hits. Kris Bryant, Willson Contreras and Javier Baez each banged out three hits and led the way as Chicago never went down in order. Baltimore starter Wade Miley's struggles continued. Miley (4-8) allowed seven runs and nine hits -- with four walks and two homers -- in 4 2/3 innings. Caleb Joseph drove in two of Baltimore's runs with a homer and an RBI single. Arrieta needed 27 pitches to get through the first inning but escaped without damage as the Orioles stranded two. The Cubs then went back to their power to take command early. Almora started the third with a first-pitch homer, and Russell added a long solo homer with two outs in the fourth. Miley walked the next two hitters before Almora added an RBI single to center that put the Cubs up 3-0. In the fifth, Heyward ended Miley's night with the three-run triple to center. Baez greeted right-hander Miguel Castro with an RBI single to cap the four-run inning that gave the Cubs the 7-0 lead.  I definitely feel better about my delivery, but you've got to keep working and fine-tune things,  Miley said.  I've just got to get back in the bullpen and continue to work.  Joseph put the Orioles on the board with a solo homer in the fifth. NOTES: RHP Mike Wright (shoulder bursitis) and RHP Stefan Crichton (shoulder strain) will each have rehab assignments starting Monday, according to Orioles manager Buck Showalter. ... The skipper also said the minor leagues could be an option for struggling RHP Kevin Gausman, but the team really isn't ready to make a move like that. ... RHP John Lackey (plantar fasciitis in right foot) threw well before the game. Cubs manager Joe Maddon said that if everything stays fine, he will be activated and pitch Tuesday. ...

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's campaign paid $50,000 to the law office now representing Donald Trump Jr. a little more than a week before news surfaced of an unreported meeting with a Russian attorney that has prompted new accusations of collusion. The payment to the Law Offices of Alan S. Futerfas, dated June 27, was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. It was described as covering  legal consulting  fees.  Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York City during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his father's rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The payment was made to Futerfas' firm days before the story about the meeting broke, which caused a scramble inside the White House and Trump Tower to contain it.  The disclosures do not say who Futerfas was hired to represent. Spokesmen for Trump's re-election campaign and Futerfas did not respond to requests for comment.  Futerfas was revealed as Trump Jr.'s lawyer on Monday after a New York Times report detailed meetings between the president's eldest son and the Russian lawyer. Futerfas has not said when he was hired.      Separately, the campaign also paid more than $538,000 to Jones Day, the law firm that represented Trump's campaign during the election. The campaign also paid $89,561 for  legal consulting  to The Trump Corporation, which is owned by the president. The payment was dated June 30th. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion. The Federal Election Commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate. Trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser, Marc Kasowitz, as outside counsel. His campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to Kasowitz. The White House confirmed in a statement on Saturday that veteran Washington attorney Ty Cobb will serve as special counsel, and sources familiar with the hiring said Cobb would handle the White House's response to the Russia-related investigations. Cobb, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue.  In the second quarter of 2017, Trump's re-election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million, according to Saturday's disclosures. Much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of  small dollar  donations, classed as donations of less than $250. Trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small-dollar donors as proof of his widespread support. Trump filed for re-election the day after taking office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office.

{"content":"Rangers defeat Royals 1-0 on Choo's RBI single in ninth KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Cole Hamels is used to a ton of run support in his Texas Rangers starts this season. The Rangers had scored 29 runs in his first three starts since coming off the disabled list. They had averaged 9.29 runs per nine innings in his eight starts. But one run was sufficient Saturday night. Shin-Soo Choo's opposite-field single with one out in the ninth inning scored pinch runner Joey Gallo and gave the Rangers a 1-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Hamels, who got a no-decision, and Danny Duffy matched up in a pitcher's duel.  We were both having really short innings so we were kind of building off that and getting through the game, and all of a sudden, you look up and it is the eighth inning, it is the ninth inning,  Hamels said.  Duffy is a tremendous pitcher. He was making good pitches, getting good outs, and it was up to me to go out and match him. It was kind of nice to be able to do that.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at RoyalsTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchJonathan Lucroy led off the ninth with a single and Gallo ran for him. Delino DeShields' sacrifice bunt advanced Gallo to second. Choo, who was mired in a 4-for-33 skid, singled to left on Duffy's next pitch, getting Gallo home.  Obviously the run scored on those 130-foot hits, but there could have been so many more base runners,  Duffy said.  I didn't look back at the two singles in the ninth, but obviously it was pretty weakly hit so I'm guessing that I executed pretty well. On paper those beat us, but our team kept us in the game.  Duffy (5-6) permitted one run on five hits over 8 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked none. The only batter to reach base off Duffy after Mike Napoli's leadoff triple in the second was Carlos Gomez twice until the run in the ninth. Gomez singled in the fifth, but Duffy picked him off. Gomez had a one-out fly ball single to right in the eighth, but was soon erased when Rougned Odor grounded into a double play. The Rangers asked for a crew chief review on Napoli's triple that landed high off the right-field fence. After an 88-second review, the call stood.  I knew the ball hit the rail. We wanted to make sure it didn't ricochet off a fan, which would have been a home run,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  We didn't want to leave a run off the board at that point.  Hamels was just as good as Duffy. He worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth. The next hit off Hamels was Lorenzo Cain's two-out single in the sixth. Hamels was removed after Whit Merrifield's two-out double in the eighth on his 99th pitch. Jose Leclerc replaced Hamels and struck out Jorge Bonifacio to end the inning. Hamels extended his scoreless-inning streak to 21 innings, the longest active streak in the American League. Hamels allowed four hits, one walk and five strikeouts over 7 1/3 innings. Leclerc (2-2) picked up the victory.  Both pitchers were at their top of their game. Both pitchers were throwing the ball extremely well,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  Two jam shots. Lucroy hit the ball that kind of dunked into right field and then the bunt. Choo's ball that he fisted on a changeup and dumped into left.  After Leclerc walked Lorenzo Cain on four pitches to lead off the ninth, Alex Claudio replaced him. Claudio fell behind in the count 3-0 to Eric Hosmer before striking him out and got Salvador Perez to ground into a game-ending double play.  This really stinks because Duff pitched so well,  said Hosmer, who went 0-for-4 to end his 16-game hitting streak.  And we just couldn't get a run for him.  The Royals (44-45) have lost five straight while the Rangers (45-45) have won five of their last six games. The Rangers have won 12 straight over the Royals dating to last season. NOTES: Royals RHP Nathan Karns will undergo thoracic outlet syndrome season-ending surgery Wednesday. Manager Ned Yost is optimistic Karns will be ready to go in spring training. ... Rangers RHP Keone Kela threw off the mound Saturday for the first time since going on the disabled list. He went on the disabled list July 3 with shoulder stiffness. ...

{"content":"Yankees prevail in 16-inning marathon against Red Sox BOSTON -- Didi Gregorius was not going to allow the Boston Red Sox to have back-to-back walk-off wins on consecutive nights. Gregorius ripped a go-ahead RBI single to highlight a three-run 16th inning for the New York Yankees in a 4-1 victory over the rival Boston Red Sox in a five-hour, 50-minute game on Saturday at Fenway Park.  It's a good feeling,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of watching Gregorius' timely hit.  Our guys were really good at tacking on.  New York (46-42) bounced back after star closer Aroldis Chapman issued a walk-off walk to Andrew Benintendi in Friday's 5-4 series-opening loss after entering the ninth with a 4-3 lead. On Saturday, Jacoby Ellsbury doubled off Red Sox reliever Doug Fister (0-3) to open the Yankees' 16th. Chase Headley's bloop single to center field put runners on first and third to set up Gregorius' single to center. Austin Romine followed with another RBI single and Gary Sanchez added a sacrifice fly after a Ronald Torreyes sacrifice bunt and Fister's intentional walk to Brett Gardner. Matt Holliday clubbed a game-tying solo homer in the ninth, his 16th of the season, off closer Craig Kimbrel for New York, which had lost 19 of its last 26 games coming in and pulled within 3 1/2 games of American League East-leading Boston (51-40).  It's a huge win for this team with the way some of the things had gone,  Girardi said. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at Red SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchYankees starter Luis Severino permitted one run, four hits and two walks with six strikeouts in seven innings. Ben Heller (1-0) struck out three and pitched the final two innings for the victory. Boston starter Chris Sale, the American League starter in the All-Star Game on Tuesday, matched a season high with 13 strikeouts in 7 2/3 scoreless innings. Sale became the first Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Martinez in 2003 with multiple 10-plus strikeout games against the Yankees in a season.  He's been outstanding,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  On a day where I thought he pitched under control, he had real good power early on but then he pitched comfortably throughout the rest of the ballgame.  The left-hander allowed three hits and two walks before being relieved by Kimbrel, who proceeded to blow his second save since July 3 and his first at Fenway. Kimbrel had converted a Fenway-record 30 consecutive saves. Mitch Moreland drove in the lone run for Boston, which suffered only its second loss in nine extra-inning games this season. Holliday took Kimbrel deep to lead off the inning, sending a 1-1 pitch approximately 443 feet over the Green Monster in left.  Just trying to stay on the fastball and put a good swing on the fastball and caught it luckily,  Holliday said. Said Kimbrel:  He put a good swing on it, hit it a long ways. That's usually what happens when I give them (home runs) up.  Dellin Betances tossed a scoreless ninth to push the game to extras. A strange sequence highlighted the Yankees' 11th as Ellsbury sent a grounder to first with Holliday on first. Moreland fielded the ball on a bounce and fired to second for the first out, but Holliday turned around and slid back into first just as Ellsbury reached. Moreland didn't see shortstop Xander Bogaerts' throw to first as Holliday blocked his view as the ball struck Ellsbury as he hit the bag, leading to an umpires review for a rules check. The original call that Ellsbury was safe was upheld after a nearly five-minute review. Farrell told the umpires that the Red Sox would play the rest of the game under protest.  I just assumed that (Moreland) touched the base,  Holliday said.  He didn't, so that's kind of what happened.  Red Sox reliever Blaine Boyer was removed from the game in the 13th inning with right elbow tightness. Bogaerts' infield single with one out in the third loaded the bases for Moreland, who drove a ball to center for a sacrifice fly. NOTES: New York and Boston entered the game having split their last 82 meetings (41-41) since 2013, going 20-20 at Fenway Park and 21-21 at Yankee Stadium. ... Yankees 2B Starlin Castro was activated from the 10-day disabled list and returned to the starting lineup. Castro had not played since June 27, missing 13 games with a strained right hamstring.

{"content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Sunday called for China to lift curbs on the widow of Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died of liver cancer in custody last week. Liu Xiaobo, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms in China. His wife, Liu Xia, was at the hospital as his health deteriorated over the past couple of weeks, but has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.  We call upon the Chinese government to lift any travel restrictions on his wife and to release her from house detention,  Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. On Saturday, Zhang Qingyang, a Chinese official in the northeastern city of Shenyang, said Liu's widow was  currently free , adding that, as a Chinese citizen, her rights would be protected, but he did not reveal her whereabouts.     The comments are likely to irk China, which has lodged  stern representations  with Western countries that made remarks about Liu Xiaobo, and add fuel to its testy relationship with Australia. Australia depends on China as its largest trading partner, but Beijing is suspicious of Canberra's close military relationship with Washington. Suspicion of China has been growing in Australia of late, fed by concerns that Beijing is using its growing influence to shift public opinion on sensitive policy issues and stifle criticism.

{"content":"SHENYANG, China (Reuters) - Deceased Chinese Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo's ashes were scattered at sea on Saturday, Liu's brother said, in a move described by a family friend as an effort to erase any memory of him. Liu, 61, died of multiple organ failure on Thursday in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer, having been given medical parole but not freed. He had been jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His widow, Liu Xia, has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She has never been formally charged with any crime. Speaking at a government-arranged news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother Liu Xiaoguang offered thanks several times to the Communist Party for its thoughtful care considering the dissident's  special situation .  Why has Liu Xia not come here? Her health is very weak at the moment,  Liu Xiaoguang said, sitting in between an English-language interpreter and a Shenyang government official.  So she can't come here. It's very regretful.  After speaking for about 20 minutes, Liu was escorted out by two unidentified women, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, and did not answer questions from journalists who surrounded him. The government then showed reporters images of the ashes being scattered from a boat. City government information official Zhang Qingyang said Liu Xia and Liu Xiaoguang had decided upon the scattering of ashes at sea. Related CoverageAustralia urges China to release dissident Liu Xiaobo's widowBut close friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the motivation behind the sea burial was so that there was  nothing to remember him by on Chinese soil  and so that supporters could not create a shrine to pay tribute to him.   We know that Liu Xiaobo's home is Beijing, his spiritual home is here, his love was also found here,  he said. Hu said it was well-known among Liu's friends that his elder brother did not agree with his political views and that it was a cynical move for him to be presented to the media as representing Liu Xia and the family.   The extent to what the authorities are capable of always exceeds our imagination, they always have something worse than imagined planned,  Hu said of the news conference.  Crude, Cruel and Callous  A protester holds a defaced Chinese national flag with words  fascist kills Liu Xiaobo , as he mourns the death of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 15, 2017.Bobby YipNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Director, tweeted that the news conference was  one of the most crude, cruel and callous political show(s) I have ever witnessed . Government official Zhang, speaking earlier, said Liu's widow was  currently free , adding that as a Chinese citizen, her rights would be protected under the law.      But she just lost her spouse. She is extremely sad. In the period after dealing with the death of Liu Xiaobo, she won't take anymore outside disturbances. This is the wish of the family members. It's natural.  Zhang did not say where Liu Xia currently was. A government statement said Mozart's Requiem was played during the funeral, a work of music Mozart left unfinished on his death bed. Slideshow (8 Images)Liu family lawyer Mo Shaoping told Reuters he did not know whether the cremation was in accordance with family wishes, however, as they had been unreachable.  They are likely still to be under the watch and control of authorities,  Mo said.  They can't be contacted.  In funeral photographs handed out by the government, Liu Xia and other family members stand around the coffin containing Liu's body, surrounded by white flowers that signify mourning in China. During the past couple of weeks, Liu Xia had been at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and urged authorities to grant freedom of movement to his wife and the rest of his family. Several thousand people in Hong Kong held an evening vigil for Liu, holding up candles and white roses in a largely silent march to China's main representative office. Some carried banners calling Liu a  people's hero  and demanding Liu Xia be truly freed.  Even though he is dead, his fight and beliefs will never be forgotten,  said a 62-year-old marcher surnamed Wu.  We have to do something to commemorate him.   China has repeatedly attacked foreign governments for their concern about Liu and calls to allow Liu Xia to leave the country if she wishes, and foreign reporters in Shenyang have been closely monitored by plainclothes security. Efforts are being made to secure permission from Chinese authorities for Liu Xia and her brother Liu Hui to leave, a Western diplomat said on Friday. The last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance was Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in Berlin in Nazi Germany in 1938.

{"content":"Tigers run away from Blue Jays for 11-1 win DETROIT -- Before Saturday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus admitted that he had sought to emphasize a point with his pitching staff. Stop trying to get strikeouts and start focusing on getting outs. Evidently, the message resonated with Michael Fulmer. Fulmer delivered a masterful performance, getting ahead of hitters and checking the Blue Jays on two hits over eight innings in the Tigers' 11-1 rout at Comerica Park. Fulmer posted his fourth straight win to improve to 10-6 for Detroit (40-49).  It is a lot easier on the defense when you aren't making them stand around for 20 minutes every half-inning,  Ausmus said.  He got outs quickly and that has an effect on the entire team.  The game doesn't get stagnant when he's on the mound.  Opposition hitters do, though. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at TigersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch He just looked like he was attacking,  Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said of Fulmer.  Just being aggressive, getting strike one as quickly as possible.  He had good life on the fastball, good movement and a good slider to go with it. He was mixing in some change-ups, too. But I think the key for him was making quality pitches early and just staying aggressive.  Fulmer agreed that the words to the pitching staff from the team's skipper were sound advice, and a formula he prefers to follow when he's on the mound.  I'm worried about getting outs, and strikeouts mean more pitches,  Fulmer said.  There are times when you want to try to strike a guy out, but I'm happy with a weak grounder to short.  It's the third time in his last four starts that Fulmer has worked eight innings, but this one felt extra special to him.  I felt like I needed a start like this, where I was able to miss a lot of barrels and get a lot of weak contact,  Fulmer said.  I'm not a huge strikeout pitcher at this point, but I trust my defense to make plays for me.  The Tigers took advantage of the long ball and the wildness of Toronto starter Francisco Liriano to pile up the runs and quickly gain an advantage. Liriano didn't retire a batter after walking the bases loaded in the third and left the game, suffering from neck stiffness. He allowed five earned runs and three hits to drop to 5-5.  His neck tightened up,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  Muscle spasms. He didn't last long. You could tell it started to affect him. We've seen bouts of wildness with him on occasion, but he really lost it.  Nicholas Castellanos, the second batter Liriano faced, drove a 1-0 offering into the right-field seats to open the scoring for Detroit. The solo shot was the 11th home run of the year for Castellanos.  I was just happy to put a good swing on a ball and get us off to a quick start,  Castellanos said.  When you get that early lead, it puts more pressure on the pitcher.  Detroit kept the pressure building, doubling its advantage in the second inning. Jose Iglesias looped a two-out single into shallow right field, scoring Mikie Mahtook. After chasing Liriano, J.D. Martinez welcomed reliever Mike Bolsinger by stroking his first pitch into left field for a two-run single. Mahtook's sacrifice fly brought home Miguel Cabrera to give the Tigers a 5-0 lead over the Blue Jays (42-48). The Tigers continued to pile up the runs. Iglesias scored on a fielder's choice and Cabrera clouted a two-run homer, his 12th of the year, during a three-run Detroit sixth. Martinez hit his 15th homer of the season, a three-run shot in the eighth inning. The Blue Jays shattered Fulmer's shutout bid in the fourth when Jose Bautista, who had drawn a leadoff walk, scored on a groundout by Josh Donaldson but after giving Fulmer such a decisive advantage so quickly, Gibbons knew his team was in for a long night.  He gets a lead like that, the good ones, they're not going to let you get back in,  Gibbons said.  When you fall out of it so quick, that's what happens.  NOTES: Tigers LHP Daniel Norris, on the disabled list with a groin strain, will throw another bullpen session Sunday before it is determined whether he will be activated to start Tuesday at Kansas City. ... Detroit 2B Ian Kinsler returned to his usual leadoff spot in the batting order after missing Friday's game because of illness. ... The Tigers held a closed-door meeting before the game, but the players and manager Brad Ausmus declined to talk about what was discussed during the session. ... The Blue Jays are 5-3 in their last eight games but have been outscored 57-36 in that stretch. ... The Los Angeles Angels (.593) are the only American League team to own a greater winning percentage in July the past four seasons than the Blue Jays, who are 48-38 (.558) during the month since 2014. ...

{"content":"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A late goal from Matt Miazga helped the United States to a 3-0 win over Nicaragua in the Gold Cup on Saturday and ensured the hosts top spot in Group B on goal difference. After Panama beat Martinique 3-0 in the earlier Group B game, the U.S. knew they needed to win by three clear goals to avoid a quarter-final match up against Costa Rica, one of the tournament favorites.   Clearly a good result for us,  said U.S. coach Bruce Arena.  It's a game where we wasted some opportunities and made things hard on ourselves,  he added of his side missing two penalties. The hosts took the lead after 36 minutes when Joe Corona's deflected strike got him on the international scoresheet for the first time in four years. The Americans' second goal also came thanks to a deflection when Kelyn Rowe's shot outfoxed keeper Justo Lorente at his near post.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Patrick Rodgers moved closer to his first PGA Tour victory, and a place in the British Open, when he retained a two-stroke lead after the third round at the John Deere Classic in Illinois on Saturday. The former world number one amateur was not at his very best, but a three-under-par 68 left him with the same advantage at the end of the day as when he started. Rodgers posted a 16-under 197 score at TPC Deere Run in Silvis, while fellow Americans Daniel Berger (63) and Scott Stallings (64) rocketed into second place on 14 under. Sixteen players are lurking within five strokes of Rodgers, who will continue to play with an attacking mindset. “This is a nice course to play with the lead because you have to keep the pedal down all day,” Rodgers told CBS television after his eight-foot par putt at the last sneaked in. “Sixteeen-under's not going to win tomorrow so I need to go out and make a lot of birdies. It was nice to have that mindset today. You’re not really holding on, you’re still trying to be aggressive and make birdies.” The winner on Sunday will earn a spot in next week’s British Open.

Nearly 3,000 people who were forced to flee their homes near Cachuma Lake and the community of Goleta remained under evacuation orders as fire officials said another evening of Sundowners could drive the flames toward populated areas.  The fire continues burning in an area above the community of Goleta and crews continue to build containment and contingency lines to hold the fire in check,  Cal Fire said on the Inciweb fire-tracking website.  The east and west flanks of the fire continue to burn towards established containment lines.  More than 1,600 firefighters were working the blaze, assisted by water-dropping planes and helicopters. Highway 154 was shut down in both directions and the Los Padres National Park was closed to the public. Evacuation shelters were opened at a high school in Goleta. The conflagration, which had blackened 17,364 acres along California's scenic central coast as of Saturday afternoon, was being fed by brush and vegetation that had not burned since 1955, according to fire officials.

Large, old oak trees are continuing to burn well after the fire has past, leaving hazardous snags along highways and firelines.  The Whittier Fire is among more than 50 large, active wildfires burning across the U.S. West as forecasters warned that hot, dry conditions could persist, creating tinderbox conditions.

Flames have charred more than twice as much land in California so far in 2017 compared with a year earlier, according to Cal Fire. Still, firefighters have made significant gains against the so-called Wall Fire, which had damaged or destroyed 44 homes in Butte County and more than 60 other structures, calling it mostly contained as of Saturday.  The Alamo Fire, which charred some 29,000 acres and destroyed at least one home in San Luis Obispo County, was said to be 92 percent contained as of Saturday morning.

{"content":"BEIJING (Reuters) - One of China's most prominent rights activists was released by the authorities on Saturday after serving a four-year sentence that prompted international criticism, with his lawyer saying he hoped he would be allowed to live as a free man. Xu Zhiyong, whose  New Citizens' Movement  advocated working within the system to press for change, was detained in 2013 and subsequently convicted of  gathering a crowd to disturb public order . One of the group's main demands had been for officials to publicly disclose their assets, a demand taken against the backdrop of the ruling Communist Party's own efforts to crackdown on deep-seat corruption under President Xi Jinping. Xu's lawyer, Zhang Qingfang, told Reuters he had brought Xu up to speed with  events on the outside , including the death of fellow activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Liu Xiaobo. He said Xu was  upset  upon hearing the news. Zhang said Xu, who was released from his jail on Beijing's outskirts on Saturday morning, was in good physical condition and had few immediate plans beyond spending time with family.  At the height of Xu's activism, he attracted hundreds of supporters who participated in activities related to the movement, having first gained prominence in 2003 for helping victims of tainted baby formula and migrant workers without access to healthcare and education.  It prompted a crackdown from the Communist Party, which swiftly crushes any perceived challenge to its rule.   The idea of the New Citizens Movement is not to overthrow, but to establish,  he wrote in a 2010 essay.  It's not one social class displacing another social class, but allowing righteousness to take its place in China.  Xu refused to defend himself in his 2014 trial, and remained silent as a way to protest what Zhang said was a controlled legal process where a guilty outcome was a foregone conclusion.     As international rights groups and foreign governments call for Chinese authorities to guarantee freedom for Liu Xiaobo's widow, Liu Xia, Xu's supporters have also expressed concern whether he will remain under close watch or effective house arrest. Some said on social media they were barred by security guards and plain-clothed officers from entering Xu's apartment compound on Saturday.  Other high-profile and politically sensitive prisoners released from jail, including rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and journalist Gao Yu, remain closely watched by Chinese authorities.  I hope he will be completely free,  Zhang said. Xu taught law at a Beijing university and ran in a local election. He became prominent over a drive to abolish  custody and repatriation  powers, a form of arbitrary detention used by local governments to sweep homeless people off the streets.

{"content":"BEDMINSTER, New Jersey (Reuters) - Major championship golf can be a long, difficult grind and on Friday at Trump National the fates aligned against many players. A two-hour thunderstorm delay on Thursday forced 39 players to return to Trump National very early on Friday to finish their opening round before beginning the second. An advisory to players from the U.S. Golf Association to leave early for the course because of possible extra security for the expected arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump made for even earlier wake-up calls. To top it off, there was pouring rain all morning, and some more in the afternoon.  It's been a really long day. Been here since about 5:15,  moaned Marina Alex, who managed a 70 for a three-under 141 total as the top American on the leaderboard.   They texted us last night about security, more time coming into the golf course. I was so tired last night, I was 'oh, my gosh, another 20 minutes tomorrow morning.'  Angela Stanford, another early starter on Friday, was actually disappointed at not running into intensified security.  I secretly want to be a Secret Service agent,” she said after shooting 72 for two-under 142. “So I'm kind of hoping to see one at some point. They are hard to find. But it's pretty cool. You have Secret Service at your major golf tournament.  They told us to be ready for heightened security. I think they forgot to tell the security, because we rolled right in here this morning. So I was like waiting for them to pull me out of my car and ... nothing.  That's 20 minutes of sleep I could have used.  Trump finally arrived late afternoon, after flying back from France, where he attended the country’s Bastille Day celebrations in Paris.

{"content":"BEDMINSTER, New Jersey (Reuters) - Shanshan Feng snapped a run of 23 consecutive pars with a birdie at the 18th to reclaim the lead over a wave of South Korean challengers heading into Sunday's final round of the U.S. Women's Open at Trump National. China's Feng broke a three-way tie with a three-foot birdie putt after missing chances from 10 feet and twice from 12 feet in the closing holes, posting a one-under 71 for a total of nine-under-par 207 at Trump National Golf Club. Amy Yang and 17-year-old amateur Choi Hye-jin were tied one stroke back, with long-hitting fellow Korean Park Sung-hyun two further shots away. Another three South Koreans, world number one Ryu So-yeon (71), Lee Mi-rim (67) and Lee Jeong-eun (73), were another stroke back at five-under. Former champion Cristie Kerr shot 70 to stand as the leading American player at four under par, a total she shared with Spain's Carlota Ciganda (72). Feng, trying to complete a wire-to-wire victory, was frustrated by her putting until the par-five last.  Putting didn't really work today,  said Feng, winner of seven LPGA Tour events including the 2012 LPGA Championship.  I just couldn't get the line and the speed together. And then I was like, 'let's go to Plan B.'  Plan B ... I try to hit the ball closer to the holes so I don't need to worry about making the putts. And 16 and 17 I hit great shots into the green but I guess they weren't close enough so I still missed them.  Then on 18th I was like, 'let's hit them little more closer' and I hit it to three feet and finally I made a putt. That birdie made my day.  Feng was caught late in the round by Yang and Choi.

Yang, 27, said all her near misses at the championship would not get her down.   I'll keep trying. I'm playing good, and I'm hitting the ball solid and making some putts.

The 23-year-old Park, a seven-time winner on the Korean LPGA Tour last year, was three shots back after tearing up the closing nine with six birdies for a 67 and a six-under total. Park was in contention last year at the Women's Open at CordeValle but finished third.  I don't have any regrets,  she said through an interpreter.

{"content":"SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials interviewing refugees held in an Australian-run offshore detention center left the facility abruptly, three detainees told Reuters on Saturday, throwing further doubt over a plan to resettle many of the detainees in America.  U.S. officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.   U.S. (officials) were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday,  one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.  In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.  Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen. The USCIS said on Saturday that the program would continue but offered no details.   We do not discuss the exact dates of USCIS' circuit rides to adjudicate refugees' applications. However, we are planning return trips,  the agency said in a statement.    It is not uncommon for the dates of tentatively planned refugee circuit ride trips worldwide to change due to a wide variety of factors.  The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the U.S. officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States that President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a  dumb deal . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Sunday the deal was progressing as expected, reiterating the government had assurances from the Trump administration. “The quota will roll over again on October 1 as I said, and I expect that the United States will adhere to this agreement, as the president promised,” she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia's pledge to close a second detention center on Papua New Guinea's Manus island on Oct 31. Only 70 refugees, less than 10 percent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed U.S. processing. FILE PHOTO: Protesters from the Refugee Action Coalition hold placards during a demonstration outside the offices of the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection in Sydney, Australia, April 29, 2016.David Gray/File PhotoBishop said she did not believe it was the case only 10 percent of refugees had been processed.  The U.S. deal looks more and more doubtful,  Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said.  The U.S. deal was never the solution the Australian government pretended it to be.  Former U.S. President Barack Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks. In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years. The swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close both Manus and Nauru, which are expensive to run and have been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees. The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until Oct. 1. Exemptions could be made for those who have a  credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,  following a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court last month reviving elements of Trump's travel ban while it considers the legality of the order. Given the risky boat journey the refugees in Manus and Nauru undertook to reach Australia, it is unlikely many of them have strong family ties to the United States, experts said. The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by U.S. officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Australia's hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Trump's resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year. Trump's concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities have since help mend connections between the two countries.  Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Flooding north of Chicago could worsen on Saturday as rivers keep rising after a deluge earlier this week that damaged thousands of homes and sent water cascading into streets and basements, officials said. Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday issued a disaster proclamation for Lake, McHenry and Kane counties and pledged the support of the state government to people whose properties were damaged or destroyed. Thousands of homes were affected by flooding after storms dumped more than 7 inches (18 cm) of rain in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Patti Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The full extent of damage was still unknown, but houses had their basements inundated and some structures may have suffered worse, Thompson said. No injuries or deaths have been reported.  Until the water goes down, it's hard to get a firm number,  Thompson said by phone.  We still have a few more days when we're going to see levels rising in some of these areas.  In Lake County alone, which includes Chicago's affluent suburb of Highland Park, an official said at a news conference Friday that 2,100 structures were submerged and 5,800 structures could ultimately be flooded.   Muddy water lapped against homes and covered roadways in the communities of Round Lake Beach, Des Plaines and Lincolnshire, and residents walked through water that reached their ankles or higher, in photos published by the Chicago Tribune.  A man checks a flooded area in Gurnee, Illinois, U.S. July 15, 2017.Kamil KrzaczynskiSome rivers were at record high levels, officials said.

Even so, officials fear water flowing downstream from Wisconsin could exacerbate flooding in areas north of Chicago. The water level in the Fox River in Algonquin, a small community about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Chicago, was at nearly 12 feet (3.7 meters), which is above the flood stage, said meteorologist Charles Mott of the National Weather Service. The Fox River was expected to peak on Monday evening at 12.9 feet (3.9 meters), Mott said. Severe weather was also expected in other parts of the country on Saturday.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Roughly four out of every ten British businesses say Brexit has hurt their plans for investment, a report from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed on Sunday. Some 42 percent of businesses said Brexit had affected investment decisions and of that, 98 percent said the impact had been negative, according to the CBI survey of 357 companies. The other 58 percent said last year's vote to leave the European Union had not affected investment plans.  It is reassuring that the majority of businesses that responded to our survey do not feel that Brexit has changed these vital spending plans,  said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist.  But we must have our eyes wide open: an overwhelming number of those that did report an impact said it was negative.  Businesses reporting a Brexit effect on their investment plans cited general uncertainty over Britain's future relationship with the EU as their top worry.  The pound's fall against the dollar was seen as the only silver lining to last year's vote to leave the European Union. Other business surveys have pointed to weakness in investment plans, which are likely to disappoint some Bank of England policymakers who think investment and exports will compensate for a consumer slowdown. This week a British Chambers of Commerce survey showed investment intentions in the dominant services sector slipping, following a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers that showed much the same.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Honolulu fire officials on Saturday were hoping to determine the cause of a blaze that tore through three upper floors of a 36-story residential tower in Hawaii's capital, killing at least three people. The conflagration, which broke out on Friday afternoon and took firefighters about four hours to extinguish, sent debris raining down from the Marco Polo tower onto an oceanfront tourist district, forcing the closure of a major road and sending thick, black smoke billowing over the city.   It also highlighted the absence of sprinkler systems in some older buildings. These became mandatory in Honolulu high-rises in 1974. The Marco Polo, which has 586 units, opened three years earlier.  Without a doubt if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin,  Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves told reporters. It took more than 100 firefighters to control the blaze.    The blaze erupted a month to the day after the tragedy at  Grenfell Tower, the London high-rise where at least 80 people died in a fire in an older building also unequipped with sprinklers.  Investigators believe the Marco Polo fire broke out on the 26th floor of the building, Honolulu Fire Department spokesman David Jenkins said, adding that investigators hoped to begin nailing down the cause quickly.

The blaze, which destroyed a dozen condominium units and forced the closure of three floors, erupted high above the reach of fire engine  ladders, he said. Firefighters have since gone through rubble-filled condominiums several times to look for any victims beyond the three people confirmed killed, Jenkins said.

Several fire-damaged floors remained closed.  Medics treated a dozen people at the site of the fire and five were transported to hospitals in serious condition, Jenkins said. One of those, a firefighter, has since been released after receiving treatment for heat exhaustion. The victims who died included a mother and her adult son, according to local media. Jenkins declined to identify them.  Witnesses described harrowing moments after the fire broke out on Friday afternoon.  I looked down.

{"content":"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, appearing fully recovered from dehydration suffered while helping to build a home for charity in Canada, was released from an overnight hospital stay on Friday and addressed the project's closing ceremony. Carter, 92, collapsed while working on Thursday at the Winnipeg construction site for Habitat for Humanity, which promotes affordable home ownership, and was taken to St. Boniface General Hospital for medical treatment and tests. By Friday morning, Carter was smiling as he returned to the building site to help kick off the project's last day. Hours later, he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 89, attended closing ceremonies at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Manitoba's capital, receiving a rousing ovation from the crowd. Dressed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and light-weight jacket, a relaxed, fit-looking Carter climbed a short flight of steps to the stage to salute Habitat's members for their contributions.  I look upon all the volunteers, in a very sincere way, as human rights heroes, and I thank you for it,  he said, and joked that his  bringing attention to this Habitat project was completely unintentional.  The former first lady told the crowd her husband received a clean bill of health after an extensive battery of tests during his brief hospitalization, including from one test designed to detect heart damage.

I knew he had a good heart.  Thursday's health scare generated an outpouring of support for Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House from January 1977 to January 1981 and has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in U.S. history. A high point of his presidency was Carter's role in brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords that ushered in peace between Israel and Egypt.  But having left office profoundly unpopular, he is widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work. Carter disclosed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with a form of skin cancer called melanoma that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. But months later, Carter told the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he teaches Sunday school in his home town of Plains, Georgia, that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. Carter was in Canada for a project to build 150 new homes for needy families, celebrating the country's 150th independence anniversary.

{"content":" (Note: This story contains language that may offend some readers.) PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said his defense chief has no choice but to agree with what he says, a weekly newspaper reported on Sunday, after his top general criticized spending cuts to this year's budget.  If something opposes the military chief of staff and the president, the military chief of staff goes,  Macron, who as president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, told Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD).  Macron said on Thursday that he would not tolerate public dissent from the military after General Pierre de Villiers reportedly told a parliament committee he would not let the government  fuck with  him on spending cuts. De Villiers still has Macron's  full trust,  the president told JDD, provided the top general  knows the chain of command and how it works.   No one deserves to be blindly followed,  De Villiers wrote in a message posted on his Facebook page on Friday.  De Villiers' last Facebook post is an open letter addressed to new military recruits that makes no mention of Macron. But it was perceived by French media as targeting the president's earlier comments. De Villiers and Macron are scheduled to meet next Friday afternoon, according to the president's official agenda. The French government trimmed the 2017 defense budget to ensure France meets its commitment to bring its budget deficit below the European Union cap of 3 percent of national income in 2017. De Villiers, whose mandate as the military chief of staff was extended by a year on Wednesday by the new defense minister, criticized at a parliamentary committee hearing on the same day the 850-million-euro ($975 million) cut in this year's budget.

{"content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has affirmed the dismissal of an administrative case against a former Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) trader after two commissioners split on whether the evidence proved he engaged in insider trading.     The ruling on Thursday came in an appeal by the SEC's enforcement division of an administrative law judge's 2015 ruling dismissing the case against Joseph Ruggieri, who was accused of trading on tips supplied by a Wells Fargo analyst. It marked a rare loss for the SEC's enforcement division in a case pursued through an in-house administrative proceeding. Critics call such fast-tracked proceedings unfair to defendants, some of whom have challenged the system in court. Silvia Serpe, a lawyer for Ruggieri at the law firm Serpe Ryan, said in a statement on Saturday that his attorneys told the SEC's enforcement division three years ago it was  way off the mark charging Mr. Ruggieri.   Now, for the second time on their home turf, the Commission has agreed with us,  she said. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC alleged that Ruggieri, a healthcare stock trader at Wells Fargo in New York, in 2010 and 2011 traded on tips about six ratings changes made by Gregory Bolan, the analyst, for companies that included Athenahealth Inc (ATHN.O) and Bruker Corp (BRKR.O).  Following a trial, Patil ruled that the enforcement division had established Ruggieri traded on information Bolan supplied four times, which allowed Wells Fargo to earn $75,000. But Patil ruled that the enforcement division failed to prove Bolan received anything in exchange for the information as required by a 2014 federal appeals court ruling, which last December was partly supplanted by a U.S. Supreme Court decision. In Thursday's ruling, the two commissioners deciding the case deadlocked on a different issue, of whether Ruggieri had indeed placed his trades while aware of non-public information. SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein said she believed the enforcement division met its burden in proving Ruggieri had done just that. SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar disagreed, saying that the division had not met its burden of establishing that Bolan tipped Ruggieri. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who was sworn in in May after the enforcement division's appeal was already pending, did not participate in the decision. Bolan, who was charged with Ruggieri in 2014, agreed to settle the case for $75,000 without admitting or denying the allegations.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Garbine Muguruza clinched a maiden Wimbledon title on Saturday with a stunning demolition of Venus Williams, whose dreams of a fairytale victory at the age of 37 were blown apart in a devastating second set.     Like many a brutal demise, the end was messy and at times uncomfortable to watch as the Spaniard cut loose after tense early exchanges, winning nine straight games to crush the demoralized American 7-5 6-0. It was Muguruza's second grand slam title to add to last year's French Open and was indisputably deserved after she absorbed everything her opponent could throw at her before taking control and inflicting a punishing triple break in the final set.  She was robbed of the picture-perfect conclusion and forced to wait as Hawk-eye was called on to confirm that a mis-hit forehand from Venus had landed out before her emotional celebrations could begin.  It was the 23-year-old's second Wimbledon final, having lost to Venus's sister Serena on the same stage in 2015, and her legs gave way as she fell to the ground after the decision was relayed on Centre Court's giant scoreboards.  “Two years ago I lost in the final to Serena and she told me one day I was going to maybe win and hey, two years after here I am,  she said courtside.  I played very well since the first game, and I kept the level, which is very hard because, you're nervous... I was just very composed,  she added later.  Related CoverageTwo's company as magnificent Muguruza finds winning formulaList of Wimbledon women's singles championsFactbox: Wimbledon champion Garbine MuguruzaFor Venus, who seemed to lack any sort of fight as the final blows were landed, it was a stinging reminder of her advancing years.  The five-times champion had last triumphed at the All England Club in 2008. She was looking to become the oldest woman to win a grand slam in the professional era and the most senior to triumph on Wimbledon's lawns since 1908.  Having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an illness that causes fatigue and joint pain, in 2011 and seen her ranking plummet to 103, her renaissance this year is still hugely impressive.  Yet her capitulation ensured a second grand slam final defeat of 2017, after she was also downed by her sister at the Australian Open.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 15, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza poses with the trophy as she celebrates winning the final against Venus Williams of the U.S.Matthew Childs She played top tennis, so I have to give her credit for just playing a better match,  Venus said.   Meek Surrender While it ended in a meek surrender, the first women's final played under the Centre Court roof had begun as a tense duel between two of the game's most powerful hitters, with a high-quality first set gradually building toward a captivating conclusion.  It included several tests of nerve for Muguruza, who showed an almost iron will not to give an inch even as Venus upped the aggression levels with ferocious intent.  Slideshow (22 Images)Muguruza saved three break points, which included two tension-filled set points in the 10th game, the first of which saw the Spaniard emerge with a clenched fist from an epic 19-shot rally. It was then her turn to go on the offensive. She crafted her third break point of the set when Venus netted a forehand and took her chance when the American sent a second forehand long after another lengthy exchange. There were few clues in those opening games as to what was about to follow as having wrapped up the first set, Muguruza put her foot to the floor with astonishing brutality.  She broke on three straight occasions in the second set as Venus seemed to hit a mental and physical wall. When the five-times winner could barely get her racket to a vicious forehand, it gave the Spaniard three match points, but in keeping with a messy second set, she needed two Hawk-eye challenges to put the beleaguered American out of her misery.  As the scoreboard showed the ball had bounced out at 40-30, she dropped her racket and fell to the ground, before covering her face in celebration. After being handed the famous Rosewater Dish, Muguruza was asked if she had a message for her coach Sam Sumyk, who is absent as his wife is expecting a baby. She held the gleaming plate aloft and said:  Here it is.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - France should define a clear roadmap to fulfill its pledge to cut the share of nuclear power in its electricity generation to 50 percent by 2025, French ecology minister said in an interview in the Sunday edition of regional daily Ouest-France. A 2015 law requires France to reduce in eight years the share of atomic power generation to 50 percent from over 75 percent currently, and include more renewable wind and solar generation. Hulot said in a radio interview on Monday that for France to meet that target, it might have to shut down up to 17 of its 58 nuclear reactors operated by state-controlled utility EDF. His comments drew questions from observers on how nuclear-dependent France, a net power exporter in Europe, could possibly shut down 17 reactors and continue to guarantee adequate power supply. Hulot clarified in the Ouest-France interview that he did not say 17 reactors must close, but that if the 2015 law were respected, the reactors would have to close. Newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron has maintained the target of cutting French nuclear production by 2025.  We have to define realistic and possible scenarios, otherwise it will be brutal,  Hulot told Ouest-France. Hulot, an environmental campaigner who was appointed ecology minister by Macron, said that since the 2015 law was passed, little had been done and there was no clear strategy on how France would meet the 50 percent target.  I want to engage in planned course of action, especially on a social and economic level,  Hulot said.  Nuclear power plants can not be closed without taking into account the reality of jobs. We must model scenarios and build a roadmap.  The closure of the nuclear plants is a hot-button issue in France with trade unions and some political parties saying the plan would cripple the French nuclear sector. Hulot also said that EDF would have to accelerate its development into renewable energies.  The French authorities could stimulate the development of these energies by implementing tax incentives, easing regulatory processes and cutting the length of potential litigations, he said.

{"content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York meat processor is recalling more than 7 million pounds of hot dogs and sausages mostly under the Sabrett brand name after consumers complained about finding small pieces of bone in some of the products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Saturday. In one case, someone who ate one of the hot dogs suffered a  minor oral injury,  the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement.  That was the only reported incidence of injury or illness connected with the products, produced by Marathon Enterprises Inc.'s meat-processing plant in New York's Bronx borough.  The franks were sold nationwide to retailers and institutions, mostly under the Sabrett brand name, the USDA said.  As a fourth-generation, family-owned company, Sabrett takes its responsibility to provide safe foods very seriously with a robust internal food safety program,  Marathon said in a statement posted on its website.  Sabrett deeply regrets any concern or inconvenience this has caused its loyal customers.  Sabrett hot dogs have been a fixture of the New York City area for decades, sold by street-corner vendors from pushcarts adorned with blue and yellow umbrellas.  The issue came to the attention of the USDA last week when consumers reported finding small pieces of bone and cartilage in the meat, the USDA and the company said.  The meat in question was produced between March 17 and July 4, with a sell-by date ranging from June 19 to October 6, 2017.

{"content":"PARIS (Reuters) - France should define a clear roadmap to fulfill its pledge to cut the share of nuclear power in its electricity generation to 50 percent by 2025, French ecology minister said in an interview in the Sunday edition of regional daily Ouest-France. A 2015 law requires France to reduce in eight years the share of atomic power generation to 50 percent from over 75 percent currently, and include more renewable wind and solar generation. Hulot said in a radio interview on Monday that for France to meet that target, it might have to shut down up to 17 of its 58 nuclear reactors operated by state-controlled utility EDF. His comments drew questions from observers on how nuclear-dependent France, a net power exporter in Europe, could possibly shut down 17 reactors and continue to guarantee adequate power supply. Hulot clarified in the Ouest-France interview that he did not say 17 reactors must close, but that if the 2015 law were respected, the reactors would have to close. Newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron has maintained the target of cutting French nuclear production by 2025.  We have to define realistic and possible scenarios, otherwise it will be brutal,  Hulot told Ouest-France. Hulot, an environmental campaigner who was appointed ecology minister by Macron, said that since the 2015 law was passed, little had been done and there was no clear strategy on how France would meet the 50 percent target.  I want to engage in planned course of action, especially on a social and economic level,  Hulot said.  Nuclear power plants can not be closed without taking into account the reality of jobs. We must model scenarios and build a roadmap.  The closure of the nuclear plants is a hot-button issue in France with trade unions and some political parties saying the plan would cripple the French nuclear sector. Hulot also said that EDF would have to accelerate its development into renewable energies.  The French authorities could stimulate the development of these energies by implementing tax incentives, easing regulatory processes and cutting the length of potential litigations, he said.

On Friday, three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen on the outskirts of the compound, holy to Muslims and Jews, and were then killed by security forces. It was one of the most serious attacks in the area in years. [L8N1K50JP] Israeli authorities then shut the compound down citing security concerns, just hours before Muslim Friday prayers.

{"content":"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Turks rallied to mark the anniversary of last year's failed coup on Saturday, in an outpouring of mass support for President Tayyip Erdogan that lay bare the divisions of a society riven by widespread purges. A sea of rapturous, flag-waving crowds gathered in Istanbul to listen as a defiant Erdogan promised to punish his enemies and praised the unarmed civilians who last year stood up to the rogue soldiers and their tanks.  They showed no mercy when they pointed their guns at my people,  Erdogan said.  What did my people have? They had their flags - just as they do today - and something much more important: They had their faith.  Some 250 people were killed and parliament was bombed before the coup was put down. The show of popular defiance has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics.  But along with a groundswell of nationalism, the coup's greatest legacy has been a far-reaching crackdown that has deepened the divide between Western-facing, secular Turks and the pious millions who back Erdogan's Islamist-rooted politics. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the putsch. On Friday, the government said it had dismissed 7,000 more police, civil servants and academics for suspected links to the Muslim cleric it blames for the attempted coup.  Nobody who betrays this nation can remain unpunished,  Erdogan said, promising again to restore the death penalty if parliament votes to bring it back - a move that would all but end Turkey's bid to join the European Union.  Critics, including rights groups and some Western governments, say that Erdogan is using the state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, pro-Kurdish politicians and journalists.  The two co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) are in jail - as are local members of rights group Amnesty International and nearly 160 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Justice Destroyed' At a parliamentary ceremony in Ankara on Saturday, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) decried what he said was the erosion of democracy following the coup.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the attempted coup at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey July 16, 2017. Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,  said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in a reference to an April referendum that Erdogan narrowly won, giving him sweeping executive powers.  In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalization, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.  Kilicdaroglu this month finished a 25-day, 425 km (265 mile)  justice march  from Ankara to Istanbul, to protest the detention of a CHP lawmaker. The march, although largely ignored by the pro-government media, culminated in a massive rally in Istanbul against the crackdown. The U.S. State Department lauded Turks for defending their democracy, but cautioned about the need to preserve basic freedoms. Slideshow (26 Images) More voices, not fewer, are necessary in challenging times,  it said in a statement. Thousands March In Istanbul, hundreds of thousands gathered to listen to Erdogan near the bridge spanning the Bosphorus - the spot where last year civilians confronted the tanks and troops who had halted traffic between the city's European and Asian sides. Roads near the bridge - since renamed  July 15 Martyrs' Bridge  - were so crowded that some people opted to come by ferry. Some in the crowd carried posters of those who died. Erdogan was also due to speak at parliament in the early hours on Sunday, to observe the precise minute that the putschists bombed the national assembly building. In the run-up to the anniversary, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from the coup attempt, with some channels showing almost constant footage of young men and headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks. One man, 20-year-old Ismet Dogan, said he and his friends took to the streets, heeding the call from Erdogan to defy the soldiers. He was shot in both legs, he told broadcaster TRT Haber.  My friends and I said, 'We have one nation, if we are to die, let's do it like men',  he said.  Everyone who was there with me had come there to die. Nobody was afraid of death.

{"content":"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday named rising political star Chen Miner as Communist Party boss in southwestern Chongqing, cementing his reputation as a favorite of President Xi Jinping ahead of a leadership reshuffle at a key party congress in the autumn.  The elevation of Chen, a trusted confidant of Xi, is a sign the president is flexing his political muscles as he maneuvers to line up a new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of political power in China. Chen previously worked under Xi in Zhejiang province, where Xi was then provincial party leader, and has since ridden the coat-tails of his former boss, climbing rapidly through the party ranks. Foreign diplomats who have met Chen say he talks  openly about his closeness to Xi. Chen, who moves to Chongqing from the poor southwestern province of Guizhou, takes over from Sun Zhengcai, the official news agency Xinhua said, without saying where Sun would go next or including wording to suggest he would get another position. Chongqing television's main evening news showed Chen giving a speech to senior city officials, telling them he would not let down the party's trust in giving him such an important job. His predecessor Sun did not appear to be present in the meeting. Chongqing is perhaps best known for its association with its disgraced former party boss Bo Xilai, once himself a contender for top leadership before being jailed for life in 2013 in a dramatic corruption scandal. Chen said officials must  resolutely eliminate the malign influence  of the Bo case, Chongqing television reported. Sun had been seen as another potential candidate for elevation at the autumn congress, but his star has waned. Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats say Sun has been out of favor after the party's anti-corruption watchdog this year criticized Chongqing authorities for not doing enough to root out Bo's influence. Chen was made Guizhou deputy party secretary in 2012, but was promoted to governor less than a year later and within roughly a month of Xi becoming president, before moving up again to his role as Guizhou party boss in 2015. Sources with ties to the leadership had said Chen could jump straight into the Standing Committee with Xi's support potentially easing out contenders from rival factions, though Chen is still considered a dark horse candidate. The switch from Guizhou to the more high-profile Chongqing role signals that Chen is virtually assured of a Politburo spot. But the change so close to the 19th Party Congress may mean he has to wait longer for further promotion, as it would be unusual to move the holder of such an important post within months. For decades, Guizhou was one of China's most backward provinces, but in recent years the central government has poured in billions of yuan, with a focus on poverty alleviation and big data. Xinhua said Guizhou governor Sun Zhigang, who is not related to Sun Zhengcai, had taken over as the province's party chief.

{"content":"DOHA (Reuters) - France called on Saturday for a swift lifting of sanctions that target Qatari nationals in an effort to ease a month-long rift between the Gulf country and several of its neighbors. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran. Doha denies the accusations.   France calls for the lifting, as soon as possible, of the measures that affect the populations in particular, bi-national families that have been separated or students,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in Doha, after he met his counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. Le Drian was speaking alongside Sheikh Mohammed, hours after his arrival in Doha.  He is the latest Western official to visit the area since the crisis began.  Later in the day he flew to Jeddah, where he repeated his concerns about the effects of the standoff in a televised press appearance with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. Jubeir said any resolution of the worst Gulf crisis in years should come from within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.   We hope to resolve this crisis within the Gulf house, and we hope that wisdom prevails for our brothers in Qatar in order to respond to the demands of the international community - not just of the four countries,  he said. He reiterated that Qatar should not support terrorist groups and their financing or host their members and should end incitement through the media. Qatar has repeatedly denied such accusations and rejected demands to close down the Al Jazeera network as initially requested by the boycotting states. Le Drian, who will visit the UAE and Gulf mediator Kuwait on Sunday, follows in the steps of other world powers in the region, including the United States, whose Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to find a solution to the impasse this week. Officials from Britain and Germany also visited the region with the aim of easing the conflict, for which Kuwait has acted as mediator between the fending Gulf countries. In a joint statement issued after Tillerson and Sheikh Mohammed signed an agreement on Tuesday aimed at combating the financing of terrorism, the four Arab states leading the boycott on Qatar said the sanctions would remain in place.  They also reinstated 13 wide-ranging demands they had earlier submitted to Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, as a condition for removing sanctions.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court has asked the State of Hawaii to respond by Tuesday at noon to President Donald Trump's motion to block a judge's ruling that prevented his travel ban from being applied to grandparents of U.S. citizens and refugees already being processed by resettlement agencies, the court's public  information office said on Saturday.  In a court filing on Friday, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trump's March 6 executive order, which he says is needed to prevent terrorism attacks, began when the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which had been blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. Trump banned travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and refugees for 120 days.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army backed by heavy Russian air strikes seized a string of oil wells in southwest Raqqa province on Saturday, as retreating Islamic State militants battle to defend their remaining territory in the country. State-owned Ikhbariyah television quoted a military source as saying the army had taken control of Wahab, al Fahd, Dbaysan, al-Qseer, Abu al Qatat and Abu Qatash oil fields and several other villages in the desert area that lies in the southwest of Raqqa province.  The seized oil fields lie south of the town of Rasafa and its oil wells, which the army took last month from the militants in their first major territorial gains inside the province. The army and Iranian-backed militias have in the last few months been advancing east of Aleppo city and seizing swathes of territory west of the Euphrates River that militants have pulled out of to defend their de facto capital of Raqqa, where they are now battling U.S.-backed troops inside the city. The latest gains tighten the army's grip on a bulge of territory stretching from eastern Hama province to eastern Homs and the edge of Raqqa and Deir Zor provinces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said.

{"content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army backed by heavy Russian air strikes seized a string of oil wells in southwest Raqqa province on Saturday, as retreating Islamic State militants battle to defend their remaining territory in the country. State-owned Ikhbariyah television quoted a military source as saying the army had taken control of Wahab, al Fahd, Dbaysan, al-Qseer, Abu al Qatat and Abu Qatash oil fields and several other villages in the desert area that lies in the southwest of Raqqa province.  The seized oil fields lie south of the town of Rasafa and its oil wells, which the army took last month from the militants in their first major territorial gains inside the province. The army and Iranian-backed militias have in the last few months been advancing east of Aleppo city and seizing swathes of territory west of the Euphrates River that militants have pulled out of to defend their de facto capital of Raqqa, where they are now battling U.S.-backed troops inside the city. The latest gains tighten the army's grip on a bulge of territory stretching from eastern Hama province to eastern Homs and the edge of Raqqa and Deir Zor provinces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - It was a tale of two coaches and two sisters for Garbine Muguruza on Saturday as the Spaniard found the formula to steer her way through a barrage of high-intensity tennis and claim her first Wimbledon crown. The moment of truth came in the 10th game when her opponent Venus Williams, 37 but playing with the energy of a teenager, threatened to cut loose after a captivating half hour of play. The Venezuela-born 23-year-old faced two set points on her own serve but held her nerve to win them both, before reeling off the next nine games against the seven-times grand slam champion, a player she idolized in her youth.  I was so excited to go out there and win, especially over somebody like a role model,  Muguruza told reporters following the 7-5 6-0 victory that brought her her second major title. With that comes the distinction of becoming the first player to beat both Venus and sister Serena in grand slam finals. That triumph over the younger Williams came at last year's French Open, which was followed by a dip in form that has transitioned from a gradual to a spectacular reversal over the past fortnight.   (It) is very hard to find a recipe to feel good fitness-wise, tennis-(wise), mentally. I think in this tournament I put everything together, which is very hard,  Muguruza said. One obvious new factor at the All England Club has been the addition to her entourage of Conchita Martinez in the absence of regular coach Sam Sumyk, whose wife is expecting a baby. The new champion met Martinez - who beat a 37-year-old Martina Navratilova in 1994 to become Spain's only previous Wimbledon women's singles winner - as she paraded with her trophy through the corridors beneath Centre Court. The pair embraced like family before being joined for a patriotic photo-op by Madrid-born four-times men's slam champion Manuel Santana, who lifted the Wimbledon crown in 1966.  Obviously, I like Conchita to be in my team because I have a great relation with her,  Muguruza said.  We were very excited ... - the coincidence of her (beating) Navratilova, me (beating) Venus.. was, like, awesome.  Did that mean winning the title without Sumyk had given Muguruza extra confidence?   No, definitely not... I was talking with him every day... We've done a very good job before.. I guess (him and Martinez) is a combination.  And the underlying message for her regular coach was laced with humor. Asked at courtside if she had anything to say to him, she held the trophy aloft and said:  Here it is.

{"content":"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Benghazi's international airport officially reopened for commercial flights amid a heavy security presence on Saturday after a three-year closure due to fighting in the city. The first outward bound flights from Benina Airport were to the capital, Tripoli, to Amman, Jordan, and to the south-eastern Libyan city of Kufra. Flights are also scheduled to and from Tunis, Istanbul, Alexandria, and the western Libyan city of Zintan.  Slideshow (8 Images)The flights are operated by two state-owned companies, Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.  Benina is just east of Benghazi, Libya's second city, where fighting escalated in the summer of 2014 when forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents. Earlier this month, Haftar declared victory in the campaign as his forces battled rivals in their last downtown holdouts.  Travelers and airport staff expressed relief at no longer having to travel to Labraq airport, a four-hour drive east of Benghazi, which had replaced Benina as the main airport for the eastern part of the country.  In recent months, some official and cargo flights had already been flying from Benina. There is also a military airport at Benina, which continued operating throughout the conflict as Haftar's forces targeted their rivals with air strikes.  Tripoli's international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014, and flights have since operated out of the smaller Mitiga airport near the center of the capital.

{"content":"(Reuters) - A lobbyist who was once a Soviet counter-intelligence officer participated last year in a meeting with senior aides to U.S. President Donald Trump, including his eldest son, and a Russian lawyer, NBC News reported on Friday, adding to allegations of possible connections between Moscow and the November election. NBC News, which did not identify the Russian-American lobbyist, said some U.S. officials suspected him of still having ties to Russian intelligence, something he denied to the network.  The Associated Press said the lobbyist, whom it identified as Rinat Akhmetshin, confirmed that he had attended the June 2016 meeting in New York's Trump Tower. A source familiar with the participants of the meeting confirmed to Reuters that Akhmetshin was in the room. The meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trump's election campaign and Russia, a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort were also at the meeting, which the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to attend because he believed he could get damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. did not mention Akhmetshin's presence when he released a series of emails about the meeting earlier this week.  Deeply Disturbing     Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the report about Akhmetshin  if accurate, adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.  Akhmetshin was not available for comment on Friday. There was no answer at the door of his house in Washington. The White House had no immediate comment about the NBC News report of a Russian-American lobbyist at the meeting. Kushner's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Manafort's spokesman Jason Maloni said Manafort had no comment on the meeting. A former Trump campaign adviser, Michael Caputo, told reporters after he testified to the House Intelligence Committee in closed session on Friday that he had no contact with Russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign  talking with Russians.      Accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated the Republican president's first months in office. Russia denies the allegations, and Trump says there was no collusion. The agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online. To help the White House deal with Russia-related investigations, Trump is hiring veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cobb's role is separate from Trump's outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz.  Akhmetshin has been accused in federal and state courts in the United States of engaging in hacking conspiracies, although the allegations were later withdrawn, according to court records.  In 2015, lawyers for the Russian mining company International Mineral Resources claimed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia that Akhmetshin helped organize the hack, theft and dissemination of private documents. That case was dropped. The same company filed a lawsuit against Akhmetshin in the New York Supreme Court but withdrew it last year.  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley described Akhmetshin in a letter to the Justice Department in March as  a former member of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU)  who was working to overturn the 2012  Magnitsky Act  of Congress, which blacklists Russians for human rights abuses. The Kremlin has often complained about the act.     Congressional records show that Akhmetshin lobbied Congress last year for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that says it is working to lift laws that prevent U.S. residents from adopting Russian children. Those laws were put in place by Moscow in response to the Magnitsky Act. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his son's meeting last year until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said:  In fact, maybe (the meeting) was mentioned at some point,  adding that he was not told it was about Clinton.    Trump Jr.'s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, said he had talked with a person who came to the meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump aides.        He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question,  Futerfas told NBC News. It was not immediately clear if the person he referred to was Akhmetshin. The lawyer said Trump Jr. knew nothing about the man's background at the time of the meeting. The Russian lawyer in the meeting, Veselnitskaya, has said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a U.S.-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor general’s office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said.

{"content":"SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton took pole position for his home British Grand Prix for the third year in a row on Saturday with a sensational lap that left him one step away from Michael Schumacher's Formula One record.  Hamilton's championship-leading Ferrari rival Sebastian Vettel, who has a 20-point advantage after nine of 20 races, qualified third on a drying track after steady drizzle throughout the morning. The Mercedes driver was half a second quicker than Ferrari's second-placed Kimi Raikkonen and his time of one minute 26.600 seconds was so outrageously quick there were gasps before the crowd erupted.  I always try to leave the best to last,  the Briton told  retired champion Jenson Button in post-qualifying interviews on the grid.  I needed to make sure I got that lap in. I didn't do in the last race (in Austria) so I really made sure I saved it this weekend.  Vettel recognized Hamilton had been out of reach.  I think he owned the pole position today,  said the German.  Hamilton still faced a nervous wait while stewards investigated an incident involving Frenchman Romain Grosjean, who complained he had been blocked by the Mercedes driver.

I was impeded today. Maybe if it was another driver there would have been something,  he fumed. The Briton's mastery lit up an overcast afternoon and the pole was the 67th of his career and sixth of the season, giving him every chance of equaling Schumacher's record 68 before the August break.

That promoted Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, who has suffered five retirements in the last seven races, to the second row. Renault's Nico Hulkenberg and his former Force India team mate Sergio Perez filled the third row. There was good news for beleaguered McLaren, who raised a cheer when Fernando Alonso made the most of improving conditions to set the fastest time in the first phase of qualifying, with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne qualifying ninth. That was the first time he had outqualified Alonso, who has a 30-place grid penalty, and will move up a place thanks to Bottas's drop.  It was nice to hear people cheering.

{"content":"SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff spoke out staunchly in defense of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, rejecting media criticism of his star driver as insulting, wrong and unfair. The Austrian indicated also that Hamilton could do as he pleases so long as he delivers on the track. Speaking to reporters after the triple world champion took pole position at the British Grand Prix for the third year in a row, the Austrian slammed 'rubbish stories' questioning Hamilton's relations with the team. The Briton was given a rough ride by the media earlier in the week for missing a promotional F1 event in London, one that Ferrari title rival Sebastian Vettel and all the other drivers attended. Some coverage has pointed at trouble in the team,  highlighting Wolff's decision to attend a birthday party for Vettel after the German drove into Hamilton's car in Azerbaijan. Wolff said the driver -- who is 20 points behind Vettel after nine races -- had discussed everything with him and acted with full permission.  We had a chat at the beginning of the week whether it was good or not good to go to the event,  he said.  After five years together I think the most important is that he feels at ease because that is how he extracts performance on race weekends.

He took a decision for his championship and the way he's been treated in certain media is wrong,  said Wolff.  And not fair.

{"content":"RODEZ, France (Reuters) - Fabio Aru looks tired and Team Sky should try and finish him off in Sunday's 15th stage of the Tour de France after the Italian surrendered the yellow jersey to Chris Froome on Saturday, three-times champion Greg LeMond said. Astana rider Aru was far from the front of the peloton when they reached the bottom of the final climb, a 600-metre effort at an average gradient of 9.6 per cent, and lost a massive 24 seconds to Froome. Froome now leads Aru by 19 seconds and third-placed Romain Bardet of France by 23.  It looked like Aru was suffering he had no team mate around him,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily chat with Reuters.  It looks like he is tired and the team is not doing good either.  Aru was way back coming into the last 2km, I couldn't believe he wasn't up front. He lost quite a bit of time for nothing.  Aru, however, could be happy that he does not have the pressure of wearing the leader's jersey.  The pressure is off now that he does not have the yellow jersey. The yellow jersey does something to you. It's a lot of requests,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. The yellow jersey holder has an obligation to go through a mixed zone and to hold a news conference after the stage, the whole process usually taking at least an hour. Aru, however, remains a formidable opponent with next week's Alpine stages suited to his climbing abilities. But Sunday's 189.5-km effort through the Massif Central will be hard to control and team work should be crucial. With key team mates Jakob Fuglsang and Dario Cataldo out of the race injured, Aru is more exposed than Froome or Bardet.

It was weird at first,  he said.  I tried to make it feel like it was any other game. But then being there in the outfield (before the game), stretching and running, I'm looking up, it was pretty awesome.  It was his seventh consecutive quality start since making his major league debut June 7.

Nobody is more challenged than him because he's living it,  manager Clint Hurdle said of Frazier.  His first multi-hit game since sometime in the middle of June. That's a long time for a guy who for a couple of weeks looks like he invented the game.

That move is being made to allow Jameson Taillon to start Saturday rather than going more than a week between starts. RHP Jameson Taillon will start Saturday against St. Louis. Originally, RHP Chad Kuhl was slated to start Saturday and Taillon not scheduled to pitch until the Milwaukee series that starts Monday. Taillon was a late scratch Sunday, Pittsburgh's final game before the All-Star break, because of what he described as food poisoning. The switch means Taillon won't have to go nearly two weeks between starts. 1B Josh Bell got his first career walk-off hit, a three-run homer in the ninth.  It's unlike any other experience. Like walking on a cloud, kind of like my first weekend up here. It was cool,  Bell said of his 17th homer. Bell, who was 2-for-3 with two walks and four RBIs, continued to impress manager Clint Hurdle.  He did a lot of good things at the plate,  Hurdle said.  We've talked about him being dangerous. We've talked about him learning at the plate as the season goes on, taking his at bat. As soon as he hit it he knew it was out. Fun to watch him grow. He's growing up right in front of our eyes.  3B David Freese made his 800th career appearance at third. He has become the regular at third this season in Jung Ho Kang's absence. Freese was 1-for-3 with a double and a walk. He had a relatively quiet night at third, with one putout and two assists.

Manager Bud Black said LeMahieu is still not 100 percent as he battles a groin injury he suffered earlier in the month but that he is getting better and should be fully recovered in a matter of days. Despite the injury, LeMahieu has played in the Rockies' last five games, a stretch interrupted by the All-Star Break. LeMahieu is batting .307 with four homers and 41 RBIs in 87 games this season.

The outing came less than two months after Bettis completed his chemotherapy treatments for a recurrence of testicular cancer, which he was first treated for last November before learning it had spread in March. Bettis will likely need at least a couple more rehab outings before he becomes an option for the Rockies' rotation. He went 14-8 with a 4.79 ERA in 32 starts last season. RHP Jon Gray endured one of the worst starts of his career Friday night, when he took the loss after allowing eight runs on nine hits and three walks while striking out one over two-plus innings as the Rockies fell to the Mets, 14-2. It was the second-shortest stint in 44 major league starts for Gray, who was chased after allowing all six batters he faced to reach base in the third. He lasted 1 2/3 innings against the Mets at Coors Field on Aug. 21, 2015. Gray also allowed at least eight runs for the third time and gave up at least nine hits for the fifth time.

{"content":"RHP Dylan Floro was optioned to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs to make room for newly-acquired LHP Jose Quintana. Floro posted a 6.52 ERA in three relief appearances with Chicago. LHP Mike Montgomery hasn't gotten much run support since becoming a starter in early June. He finally got runs Friday night -- eight in the first three innings versus Baltimore -- but couldn't last long enough to gain a victory. Montgomery gave up four runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings, finding himself in trouble several times in the last three innings. LHP Jose Quintana, acquired in a blockbuster trade with the White Sox Thursday, will start the series finale in Baltimore on Sunday. Quintana, who will wear No. 62, met with manager Joe Maddon and talked with his new teammates Friday and was all smiles when asked what it felt like to be a Cub now.  I'm really happy,  he said.  I think it was the best situation for me.  C Willson Contreras had been hot at the plate in the days before the All-Star break, and he kept on going when the second half started Friday night versus the Orioles. Contreras belted a three-run homer in the first inning off RHP Kevin Gausman. The catcher now has hit in eight of his last nine games. SS Addison Russell spends much of his time getting on base so the bigger bats of the Cubs' lineup can drive him in. But on Friday, batting ninth, he came through with the big hit, lining a tie-breaking solo homer to left off RHP Brad Brach that gave Chicago a 9-8 victory over the Orioles.  I'm just looking for a ball in the zone,  Russell said.  The biggest thing for me is just making sure I see the pitch, track it, and put a good swing on it.  RHP Eddie Butler will move to the bullpen thanks to the trade for LHP Jose Quintana, according to manager Joe Maddon. Butler was 4-3 with a 3.88 ERA in 12 games,  (11 starts) but now Quintana needs a spot. DH Kyle Schwarber is trying to find his way back at the plate. He hit better on the homestand before the All-Star break and then added a homer in the first inning in the win over Baltimore Friday night. He now is 5-for-14 during a current four-game hitting streak.  The first half's a wash for me,  he said.  There's no paying attention to the numbers or anything like that. It's just going out there and getting bat to competing.  LF Ben Zobrist might be finding his hitting stroke once again. He went 2-for-5 last Saturday after coming off the disabled list (left wrist inflammation) that day and then went 2-for-4 with a two-run homer and a walk in Friday's victory over Baltimore. RF Jason Heyward has not shown some power in a while. But that problem ended Friday night in Baltimore when he blasted a two-run homer to right in the third inning. His ball reached Eutaw Street over the stands in right, and that was Heyward's first homer since June 13 and his seventh this season -- which equals his total from last year.","keywords":"Addison Russell,Ben Zobrist,Brad Brach,Dylan Floro,Eddie Butler,Jason Heyward,Joe Maddon,Kevin Gausman,Kyle Schwarber,Mike Montgomery,BBO,CUBS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 13:01:00","news_title":"Chicago Cubs - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7F55XP5L"}
{"content":"OF Jose Martinez was recalled from Triple-A Memphis. He entered the game for a brief appearance with one out in the ninth after Stephen Piscotty left because of a right groin strain. Martinez did not get into a game with Memphis during a short demotion. In 50 games with St. Louis before he was sent down, he hit .280 with a .464 slugging percentage. OF Randal Grichuk (back strain) was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to July 10. It's not clear if his problem is related to lower-back issues he had earlier. Grichuk had been struggling, hitting .176 with 18 strikeouts -- albeit with four homers -- over his past 51 at-bats. RHP Mike Leake got a no-decision. He gave up two runs and seven hits over five innings, with five walks and three strikeouts. It was a decent rebound from his previous start, when he gave up a season-high eight runs. In the fifth, he walked the bases loaded and gave up the tying run, but got out of it by striking out Francisco Cervelli.  I thought he was pretty good. He pitched out of trouble,  manager Mike Matheny said.  Quite a few walks. It would have been nice to get a couple calls in the (fifth) inning.  3B Jedd Gyorko hit his 14th homer, a 408-foot, two-run, two-out shot to center, in the first. He said Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole  left a pitch out over. I put a good swing on it.  Gyorko was 0-for-3 the rest of the night. In the fourth, he and C Yadier Molina executed a pickoff at third to catch the Pirates' Gregory Polanco off-guard. That helped preserve a 2-1 St. Louis lead.  We try to save (that play) for big moments if we can,  Gyorko said.  Getting that out there and getting (starter Mike) Leake out of that inning was big.  RF Stephen Piscotty left the game after racing to catch a shallow fly to right by Josh Harrison for the first out of the ninth. He pulled up and grabbed at his right thigh.  His right groin, a strain,  manager Mike Matheny said.  He felt it grab. He wanted to jog around and see if it was going to be OK, but for it to grab like it did, it was probably not a good idea to leave him in the game at that point because anything he was going to have to do at that point was going to have to be at full speed.  Piscotty's status for Saturday is unclear.","keywords":"Francisco Cervelli,Gerrit Cole,Gregory Polanco,Jose Martinez,Josh Harrison,Mike Leake,Mike Matheny,Randal Grichuk,Stephen Piscotty,Yadier Molina,BBO,CARDINALS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 13:01:00","news_title":"St. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7F55XP5K"}

{"content":"RHP Seth Lugo will make his first start in 11 days on Saturday night, when he takes the mound for the Mets in the middle game of a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field. Lugo took the loss on July 4, when he allowed six runs on 10 hits and two walks while striking out three over five innings as the Mets fell to the Washington Nationals, 11-4. The runs and hits were both season highs while the innings pitched were a season low in a start for Lugo. He made one final pre-All-Star Break appearance on Sunday, when Lugo allowed one run over three innings of relief as the Mets fell to the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-0. Lugo gave up two runs over three innings of relief in his lone career outing against the Rockies last July 30. LF Yoenis Cespedes snapped out of a slump Friday night, when he went 4-for-6 with an RBI in the Mets' 14-2 win over the Rockies. Cespedes entered Friday just 5-for-40 in his last 10 games but singled in the first, doubled and scored in the third, singled later in the third and beat out a run-scoring infield single in the eighth. The four-hit game was the third of the season for Cespedes and his first since June 17. Cespedes is batting .280 with nine homers and 20 RBIs in 43 games this season. RHP Jeurys Familia (blood clot in right shoulder) began throwing at the Mets' spring training complex in Florida on Thursday. Familia is recovering quicker than expected from the surgery he underwent May 12  the same day he was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to May 11  but is still unlikely to return to the Mets before August. He is 1-1 with a 3.86 ERA and three saves in 11 games this season. 2B Neil Walker (torn left hamstring) has begun to run with more intensity at the Mets' spring training complex in Florida. Walker, who was injured trying to leg out an infield hit on June 14 and was placed on the 10-day disabled list the next day, is likely at least a week away from beginning a rehab assignment. He is batting .270 with nine homers and 33 RBIs in 60 games this season. LHP Josh Smoker (left shoulder strain) continued his rehab assignment with Single-A St. Lucie Friday night, when he allowed one run in one inning. It was the third appearance at St. Lucie for Smoker, who has allowed two runs over four innings. Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said earlier Friday that Smoker is scheduled to throw again Saturday and should be activated no later than early next week.

Coming up to the ballpark and being able to see your name in the lineup, it makes you feel good. I feel 100 percent body-wise. The thumb feels great. I'm ready to get out there.

Hopefully we'll get settled and these groupings will work and get some offense. And Mike's obviously a big part of that.  RHP JC Ramirez will start Saturday against the Rays. He began the season in the bullpen but is now the club's leader in wins at 8-7 with a 4.46 ERA. He's coming off one of his better starts of the season, shutting out the Texas Rangers on two hits over six innings last Sunday. Part of the reason for his success in that game was his decision to re-incorporate the four-seam fastball into his repertoire. He had all but abandoned it this season before the Texas game. Ramirez is 1-0 with a 2.08 ERA in three career games (one start) vs. Tampa Bay. RHP Mike Morin was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday to make room on the roster for LHP Jose Alvarez.

LHP Jose Alvarez was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. Alvarez was leading the American League in appearances with 40 when he was optioned to Salt Lake on June 30. In three games with the Bees, he allowed one earned run in five innings. He's the Angels' only left-hander in the bullpen. RHP Ricky Nolasco gave up only one run and two hits over seven innings Friday against Tampa Bay, but came away with a no-decision.

He had his fourth straight quality start and has gone 3-1 with four earned runs in 27 innings during that span. Gray has been the subject of trade rumors for weeks, and less than hour before first pitch Gray heard about a Tweet out of Chicago that he had been scratched from his scheduled start against Cleveland. Gray, as well as family members and friends who text messaged him, naturally wondered if he had been traded.  It's hard,  Gray said.  You get 50 text messages 45 minutes before the game and that's when you just try to put your phone away and go to a place where you can block everything out and get ready for the game.

Bassitt went 0-2 with a 6.11 ERA in five starts last season before going on the disabled list then undergoing surgery on May 6, 2016. Bassitt was shut down from his rehab assignment once this year but is back on track. If he returns to the A's this season, it will likely be as a reliever. OF Rajai Davis went 2-for-3, scored two runs and hit his third home run of the season, a solo shot in the fifth inning of a 5-0 victory against the Cleveland Indians on Friday night at the Oakland Coliseum. Davis, who played for the Indians last season when they won the American League title but lost to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, wasn't going to be in the starting lineup, but rookie OF Jaycob Brugman became ill, and Davis filled in.

Overall, he's batting .302 (16-for-53) with three doubles, two home runs and three RBIs. 2B Jason Kipnis (strained right hamstring), who was placed on the 10-day disabled list Sunday, is expected to miss at least two weeks. Kipnis, who began the season on the DL with a strained rotator cuff in his right shoulder, is batting .232 with 26 RBIs and eight homers. He was injured July 8 against Detroit. RHP Danny Salazar (right shoulder soreness) will make a rehab start Sunday for Triple-A Columbus.  We just got done talking to him,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said before Friday's game against Oakland.  I think even listening to him talk, he's in a good place. I think the idea behind this from the beginning was solid, to create a base and the hard work creates confidence. So we told him to go out Sunday and get after it from the first pitch. And then we'll reconvene again after that and see what's next for him.  Salazar has been on the disabled list since June 4. He's 3-5 with a 5.40 ERA in 12 appearances, including 10 starts, for Cleveland. OF Tyler Naquin was recalled from Triple-A Columbus on Friday and started in right field against Oakland. Naquin went 0-for-3 in a 5-0 loss. Naquin took the roster spot of OF Lonnie Chisenhall (strained right calf), who was placed on the 10-day disabled list and is expected to miss at least two weeks. Naquin made Cleveland's Opening Day roster but was optioned to Columbus on April 13 when Chisenhall was activated after a stint on the DL for a sprained right shoulder. RHP Miguel Almonte was recalled from Triple-A Omaha. This is Almonte's fourth time up this season and the second time this month. He worked a scoreless eighth inning on July 1 in his last big league appearance. Almonte is 1-0 with a 1.33 ERA in 17 games, including seven starts, this year in the minors. RHP Austin Adams was recalled Friday for his first appearance on a major league roster.  I'm just so blessed, man,  Adams said.  I've been in the minor leagues for six or seven years now -- been up and down, and the inner struggles of 'Am I good enough to do this?' And then finally understanding, 'Hey, I can do this. I'm good enough to do this.' It's an awesome feeling. Absolutely.  RHP Carlos Carrasco ( 10-4) allowed five runs and six hits, including two home runs, as his five-game winning streak ended Friday night in a 5-0 loss to Oakland. He struck out 10, walked two and lost for the first time since June 3 at Kansas City.  He gave up, you know, the solos,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Carrasco.  I think on a normal night, or a night when we're swinging a little bit, it looks like a lot more competitive game, but that's kind of the way Oakland has been. They can hit the ball out of the ballpark. Even in this spacious place they hit the ball out of the ballpark, and that's what they do.  OF Austin Jackson (strained left quad), who has been on the disabled list since June 27, has been running the bases and appears close to being ready for a rehab assignment, Cleveland manager Terry Francona said Friday.  He'll do that again tomorrow,  Francona said.  He's getting much closer to playing.That's the last step to get him back in games.  OF Lonnie Chisenhall (strained right calf) was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday, and he's expected to miss more than two weeks. Chisenhall, who was injured during Cleveland's game on Sunday against Detroit, entered the All-Star break with a team-high 51 RBIs. He's batting .305 with 12 home runs.This marks Chisenhall's third stint on the DL this season. His first stint was for a sprained right shoulder and his second for a concussion.","keywords":"Austin Adams,Austin Jackson,Carlos Carrasco,Danny Salazar,Erik Gonzalez,Jason Kipnis,Lonnie Chisenhall,Miguel Almonte,Terry Francona,Tyler Naquin,BBO,INDIANS,PLAYERWATCH,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 13:01:00","news_title":"Cleveland Indians - PlayerWatch","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-indians-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7F55XP59"}

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Venus Williams ran out of steam in her Wimbledon final defeat by Spain's Garbine Muguruza on Saturday, losing the second set 6-0, but she graciously refused to blame her loss on tiredness. After producing, as she has done throughout the tournament, clean-hitting and focused tennis, Williams failed to convert two set points at 5-4 and dramatically lost the next nine games as her hopes of a sixth Wimbledon singles title evaporated. The manner of her defeat inevitably led to speculation that the 37-year-old may have had a physical problem that stopped her from competing with the effectiveness she had shown in earlier rounds. In 2011, Williams was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain but asked, at the post-match news conference whether that was a factor in her loss, she deflected the question, clearly not wishing to take away credit from her Spanish opponent.  She played really well. I mean, she played top tennis, so I have to give her credit for just playing a better match,  Williams said.  I've had a great two weeks. I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer,  she added. Later the American was asked how to explain the huge difference in the levels of her play in the first and second sets.  There's errors and you can't make them. You can't make them. I went for some big shots and they didn't land. Probably have to make less errors,  she said.

I think she played amazing. She played amazing.  Williams offered little in the way of comment or explanation for her defeat in her short answers but did say her run to the final, which included a semi-final win over Britain's Johanna Konta, had taken a lot of effort. Slideshow (2 Images) Every tournament is different. Every tournament's different. This is most certainly a very different tournament,  she said.  It took a lot of effort and what-have-you to get right here today. So this is where I want to be every single major,  she said. Williams had arrived at Wimbledon under something of a cloud following her involvement in a fatal car accident. After winning her first-round match against Belgian Elise Mertens in straight sets, she broke down in tears in her news conference saying the incident had been  devastating . Last week Florida police said Williams was acting lawfully when she drove her sports utility vehicle into an intersection before a fatal crash with another car on June 9. Jerome Barson, 78, who was a passenger in a sedan that collided with the vehicle Williams was driving, was fatally injured. His family filed a wrongful death suit against Williams.

{"content":"BAMAKO (Reuters) - Thousands of Malians took to the streets on Saturday to protest against a planned referendum on constitutional changes that would give extra powers to President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, create new regions and recognize the Tuareg's ethnic homeland. Mali's government has delayed the vote, which was originally planned for last week, but still plans to go ahead with it this year. Activists are unsettled by provisions that would enable the president to nominate a quarter of the Senate and remove the prime minister at will. Malians have become increasingly disillusioned with Keita's government, as insecurity has worsened significantly over the past year and is spreading beyond the desert north to the south and center, including the capital Bamako.  We don't need a revised constitution. We need the state to liberate the north and center of Mali and to take account of people's aspirations,  protester and local councillor Sonore Sidibe said at the march, where protesters held up placards saying 'no' to the constitution, and some brandished red cards and called for the president to resign. Presidential elections are scheduled for late 2018, although Keita has not said whether or not he will run. The constitutional changes concerning new regions are supposed to happen as part of a 2015 peace deal aiming to end the separatist Tuareg movement. It will also recognize their claims to a degree of autonomy by officially labeling the northern desert regions by their Tuareg name, 'Azawad'.  Some Malians are angered about concessions to the rebels, whose 2012 uprising enabled allied jihadists to take over parts of the north and use them as a launch pad for regional attacks. French forces intervened and scattered the Islamists and Tuareg rebels the following year.  This constitution is heading towards federalism,  said demonstrator Moussa Ouattara.  That's a victory to the separatists who want an Islamic Republic of Azawad . The peace deal has so far failed to quell unrest in the north, where rival pro and anti-government factions are locked in a violent power struggle.

{"content":"SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - Formula One champions Mercedes rebuffed Romain Grosjean on Saturday after the fuming Frenchman said Lewis Hamilton should have been punished for impeding him in British Grand Prix qualifying.   There are some that moan all the time,  Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told reporters.  If Romain Grosjean comes out and starts asking for penalties for other drivers, he'd rather look at his track record. He should be happy he's driving in Formula One,  added the Austrian. Grosjean has a chequered record in Formula One, famously dubbed a 'first lap nutcase' by now-retired Australian Mark Webber in an accident-filled 2012 season that led to him serving a one-race suspension. His speed and talents have since come to the fore and he is now a leading light in the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA). Triple world champion Hamilton qualified on pole position for his home grand prix by more than half a second in a stellar display of dominance. He had some anxious moments after the chequered flag, however, as stewards investigated the Haas driver's complaints. They decided after examining video evidence to take no further action, ruling that while Grosjean  may potentially have been affected  by Hamilton's presence at turn 16, he was not impeded. Grosjean was surprised by the wording and by the stewards making their decision without listening to his side of the story. He added that he had been handed a five-place grid penalty in China for slowing insufficiently when yellow warning flags were being waved but on Saturday had lost position with no penalty to anyone else.  If losing three and a half to four tenths is not being impeded, I am very surprised at what is,  Grosjean told reporters.  I think it opens room for a mess in qualifying and the rules are pretty clear.  I know that there is a world title going on at the front, but we are in a position where we fight as hard as the boys at the front and I was impeded today. Maybe if it was another driver there would have been something,  he added.  It does feel as though there are two types of decision.  Asked whether he felt Hamilton was benefiting from home race advantage, Grosjean refused to rise to the bait.  I am just saying that I have seen drivers impeding other drivers and get a penalty. Today, I was impeded. It was clear on the data, and nothing happened,  he said. Hamilton said immediately after qualifying that he had yet to see the replays, but apologized if he had done anything wrong.

{"content":"KYAR GAUNG TAUNG, Myanmar, 2017 - Rohingya Muslim women lined up to tell reporters of missing husbands, mothers and sons on Saturday as international media were escorted for the first time to a village in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state affected by violence since October.  My son is not a terrorist. He was arrested while doing farm work,  said one young mother, Sarbeda. She had bustled her way -- an infant in her arms -- through several other women telling reporters their husbands had been arrested on false grounds. In November, Myanmar's army swept through villages where stateless Rohingya Muslims live in the area of Maungdaw. Some 75,000 people fled across the nearby border to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations. U.N. investigators who interviewed refugees said allegations of gang rape, torture, arson and killings by security forces in the operation were likely crimes against humanity. Myanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied most of the claims, and is blocking entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission tasked with looking into the allegations. The government has also kept independent journalists and human rights monitors out of the area for the past nine months. This week, the Ministry of Information escorted more than a dozen foreign and local journalists representing international media, including Reuters, to the area  under a guard of officers from the paramilitary Border Guard Police Brutal Tactics The reporters spent nearly two days in Buthidaung, a township in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, where they were taken to sites of alleged militant activity. They were taken to Kyar Gaung Taung, one of three settlements requested by the journalists. Officials cited time constraints for the limited access. Reuters had previously gathered accounts from residents by phone and from former residents who have fled to Bangladesh, of brutal counterinsurgency tactics unleashed in Kyar Gaung Taung and several nearby villages in mid-November. Sarbeda, whose teenage son was arrested for suspected links to a militant group, speaks to reporters in Kyar Gaung Taung village, northern Rakhine state, Myanmar July 14, 2017. Picture taken July 14, 2017.Simon LewisWhen a group of journalists insisted on speaking to villagers away from security forces, allegations of abuses by troops emerged almost immediately. Kyar Gaung Taung resident Sarbeda, 30, had been able to visit her son, Nawsee Mullah, 14, at a police camp where he is being held separately from adult detainees. She was not sure if he had a lawyer, she said. Reuters reported in March that 13 boys under the age of 18 were detained during security operations. They were included in a list of 423 people charged under the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act, which outlaws joining or aiding rebel groups. At least 32 people from Kyar Gaung Taung village had been arrested and 10 killed, said a village schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He estimated that half the village's 6,000 residents had fled during the clearance operation. Slideshow (5 Images)Burned to Death Another villager, Lalmuti, 23, pointed to a small pile of ashes where she said she found her father's remains. She described how he was bound and thrown into a house and burned to death. Her mother was later arrested when authorities deemed her complaint about the killings to be fabricated. She is serving a six-month jail sentence, Lalmuti and two other villagers said. Reporters were not given a chance to put these allegations to authorities, and Reuters was unable to reach officials to confirm the details of the cases by phone. In a press briefing on Friday, Brigadier General Thura San Lwin, commander of Myanmar's Border Guard Police, said some villagers had made what he said were erroneous claims and were subsequently charged and jailed for lying to the authorities.  The media said we torched houses and that there were rape cases -- they give wrong information,  Thura San Lwin told reporters. He also disputed the U.N.'s estimates for the number of people who fled, claiming local records showed that only 22,000 people were missing in the conflict. Myanmar officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe - a former lieutenant general in the army - and a commission headed for former U.N. chief Kofi Annan - which is not mandated to investigate human rights abuses - are the appropriate ways to address problems in Rakhine State.

{"content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump turned up the heat on Friday on fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill dismantling the Obamacare law, but with their retooled healthcare plan drawing fire within the party even one more defection would doom it. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation, unveiled on Thursday, and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the 50  yes  votes needed for passage. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition, but two Republican senators already have declared opposition.  After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,  Trump, who made gutting Obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year, wrote on Twitter from Paris, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations. The top U.S. doctors' group, the American Medical Association, on Friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare. Hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill.  The revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed Medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage,  AMA President Dr. David Barbe said, referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. A major test for McConnell's legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in 22 million Americans losing  insurance over the next decade. Related CoverageU.S. health insurers want Cruz proposal dropped from Senate billA day after that CBO analysis was issued, McConnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party, including moderates and hard-line conservatives. While the bill's prospects may look precarious, the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a vote in March in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on May 4. Pence Seeks Support Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks with reporters about the Senate health care bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 12, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinVice President Mike Pence sought to shore up support among the nation's governors at a meeting in Rhode Island, but a key Republican governor, Ohio's John Kasich, came out strongly against the revised bill, saying its Medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market. Kasich's opposition could put pressure on Rob Portman, a  Republican senator from Ohio, who has not yet taken a position on the bill. If the current Senate legislation collapses, some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of Obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) (C) departs after a Senate Republican caucus meeting about an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017.Jonathan Ernst There are changes that need to be made to the law,  Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC, citing  a bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue.  Moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul already oppose the revised Senate bill. Other Republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal, including Portman, Mike Lee, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Cory Gardner, Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy floated an alternative plan. The new version was crafted to satisfy the Republican Party's various elements, including moderates worried about Americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard-line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance. A provision championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap, bare-bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under Obamacare. But two major health insurance groups, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on McConnell to drop the Cruz proposal, saying it would undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions, raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market. The bill retained certain Obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated, a step moderates could embrace. But it kept the core of the earlier bill, including ending the expansion of Medicaid that was instrumental in enabling Obamacare to expand coverage to 20 million people, and restructuring that social safety-net program. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week, Senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on Tuesday or Wednesday, a move that requires a majority vote.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - European Union leaders are willing to change the bloc's rules for the freedom of movement of workers, opening an opportunity for Britain to avoid a damaging  hard Brexit , former prime minister Tony Blair said on Saturday. The election of French President Emmanuel Macron had put reform of the EU on the table, meaning Britain and the EU could meet  halfway  to strike a deal that would keep Britain inside the world's largest trading area, Blair said.  The European leaders, certainly from my discussions, are willing to consider changes to accommodate Britain, including around freedom of movement,  the former Labour prime minister said in an article published by his Institute for Global Change.  The opposition to free movement of people, once you break it down, is much more nuanced. The French and Germans share some of the British worries, notably around immigration, and would compromise on freedom of movement.  Blair's comments are at odds with the EU's negotiating stance, which stresses there can be no  cherry picking  from the benefits of membership of the EU's single market without accepting freedom of movement for EU workers. In a separate interview, Blair said he thought it was possible that Britain could stay in the EU because public opinion was moving against Brexit.  I think it's absolutely necessary that it doesn't happen because I think every day is bringing us fresh evidence that it's doing us damage economically,  Blair said, in a preview of Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday program. The pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign said Blair's comments showed how out of touch he is with voters. Reopen the Debate? Many Western EU leaders are indeed concerned to limit free movement only to workers - as specified in the EU treaty. Germany has won a series of EU court cases denying benefits and residence rights to immigrants who were not working.  There is little appetite in the bloc for reopening a negotiation with Britain that it already had before the Brexit referendum - partly because many in the EU see Britain's problems with EU immigration as partly of its own making. Under Blair's government, citizens of Poland and other ex-communist states were allowed to settle immediately in Britain, despite a years-long transition period allowed under EU rules.  When former prime minister David Cameron made cutting EU immigration the focus of a deal he demanded before holding the referendum last year, other European governments argued London could do more within existing EU rules to limit arrivals.  They nonetheless agreed to a special deal for Cameron to give Britain special rights to curb EU immigration, but that deal was rendered moot by the Brexit vote.  In his article on Saturday, Blair lamented that both Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party had set their minds on leaving the single market, without exploring the alternatives.  Given what is at stake, and what, daily, we are discovering about the costs of Brexit, how can it be right deliberately to take off the table the option of compromise between Britain and Europe so that Britain stays within a reformed Europe?  he said. Blair praised the current leader of the Labour Party, left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, for mobilizing young voters in last month's general election in which May lost her majority in parliament. But Britain under a Corbyn-led government could  hit the canvas, flat on our back  if it adopted hard-left economics, Blair said.  In response, Corbyn told BBC News that the economy would do well under a Labour-led government that focused on raising investment. Blair was prime minister for 10 years until 2007. He wanted to take Britain into the euro zone and believed Britain should lead the way in the EU rather than withdraw from it.

{"content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Saturday barring athletes and coaches found guilty of doping from receiving Kremlin grants. The degree, published on Saturday on the Kremlin's website, comes as Russia steps up its fight against doping in a bid to have the suspensions against its national anti-doping agency RUSADA, its athletics federation and its Paralympic Committee lifted.  The payment of Kremlin grants will cease the month after anti-doping authorities find an athlete, coach or sports specialist guilty of involvement in the use of performance- enhancing drugs, Putin’s decree said.  They will remain ineligible for Kremlin grants  two years following the year in which the sanctions against them expire,  according to the decree.  The decree also stressed that the measures apply to Olympic and Paralympic champions, as well as to champions of the Deaflympics.  Earlier this week the Russian government approved a plan aimed at curbing doping through education programs and the creation of a new anti-doping laboratory, among other measures. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suspended RUSADA in 2015 in the aftermath of a report that found evidence of state-sponsored doping and accused it of violating anti-doping regulations.  Russian authorities deny there was a state-backed doping program, but have pledged to follow international recommendations to have RUSADA reinstated. WADA last month allowed RUSADA to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts, but said much remained to be done for the agency to retrieve its accreditation.

{"content":"* More than 240 people died on night of July 15 * Since failed coup, 150,000 sacked or suspended * More than 50,000 jailed, including opposition figures * Ordinary Turks defied rogue soldiers By Tuvan Gumrukcu ANKARA, July 15 (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan and members of the opposition came together on Saturday to mark the anniversary of last year's failed coup, in a moment of ceremonial unity all but overshadowed by the sweeping purges that have shaken society since. The gathering in parliament was one of the first in a string of events planned through the weekend to commemorate the night of July 15, when thousands of unarmed civilians took to the streets to defy rogue soldiers who commandeered tanks and warplanes and bombed parliament in an attempt to seize power. More than 240 people died before the coup was put down, a show of popular defiance that has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics. But along with a groundswell of nationalism, the coup's greatest legacy has been the far-reaching crackdown. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the putsch. On Friday, the government said it had dismissed another 7,000 police, civil servants and academics for suspected links to the Muslim cleric it blames for the putsch.  Our people did not leave sovereignty to their enemies and took hold of democracy to the death,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said, as Erdogan and members of opposition parties looked on.  These monsters will surely receive the heaviest punishment they can within the law.  Critics, including rights groups and some Western governments, say that Erdogan is using the state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, pro-Kurdish politicians and journalists. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) was represented by its deputy chairman as the party's two co-leaders are in jail - as are local members of rights group Amnesty International and nearly 160 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Justice Destroyed' At the parliamentary ceremony, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) decried what he said was the erosion of democracy following the coup.  This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,  said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in a reference to an April referendum that Erdogan narrowly won, giving him sweeping executive powers.  In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalisation, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.  Kilicdaroglu this month finished a 25-day, 425 km (265 mile)  justice march  from Ankara to Istanbul, to protest the detention of a CHP lawmaker. The march, although largely ignored by the pro-government media, culminated in a massive rally in Istanbul against the crackdown. In the run-up to the anniversary of July 15, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from last year's coup, with some channels showing almost constant footage of young men and even headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks in Istanbul. One man, 20-year-old Ismet Dogan, said he and his friends took to the streets of Istanbul the night of the coup after they heard the call from Erdogan to defy the soldiers. He was shot in both legs by soldiers, he told the website of broadcaster TRT Haber.  My friends and I said, 'We have one nation, if we are to die, let's do it like men',  he said.  Everyone who was there with me had come there to die. Nobody was afraid of death.

Adil Faris Mayat's arrest underscores continuing harassment of journalists in South Sudan where a four-year civil war pitting Kiir's military against the opposition led by his former deputy, Riek Machar, is spreading and growing deadlier.  Government officials were unavailable for comment. Calls to the information minister, his deputy and the president’s spokesman were unanswered. In 2015, five journalists were killed in the country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

The speech, on July 9, was marking South Sudan's 6th Independence Anniversary.  According to his wife, Mayat decided against broadcasting the speech live  to avoid any technical difficulties (which) might appear during the live broadcast.  That decision, she said, was considered by the authorities  as an insurrection, conspiracy . South Sudan, which won independence in 2011, plunged into civil conflict in December 2013 after a long-running political feud between Kiir and Machar, who are from rival ethnic groups.

{"content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany is considering  effective measures  to cut pollution from diesel engines, the transport ministry said on Saturday, reacting to a media report saying planned goals were unambitious. German magazine Der Spiegel reported that, after pressure from the auto industry, Berlin was planning to allow car makers to shut off emission control technology once outside temperatures fall below 10 degrees. Germany's annual average temperature was 9.4 degrees in 2016. The transport ministry said in an emailed statement that no decisions had been taken though discussions were continuing.  The reporting by Spiegel is wrong,  it added. Germany is working on a national plan to cut pollution from diesel engines and set up a new organization to test vehicles to try to restore consumer confidence after Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal. The moves come as the German government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce emissions or see some cities ban diesel cars themselves. Last month, the transport ministry and the environment ministry announced the creation of a  national diesel forum  to work with the auto industry and regional governments to cut emissions, with the first meeting set for Aug. 2. The German auto industry hopes a plan under discussion with the government to reduce pollution from older diesel cars will avert planned bans in German cities that are deterring consumers from buying diesel cars. Government sources have told Reuters that software updates to reduce emissions could cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros, but HSBC analysts said hardware might be needed that could mean costs of up to 10 billion euros. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the Volkswagen scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for increased respiratory disease. European governments had in the past promoted diesel cars as part of efforts to fight climate change as they produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, although environmental groups have cast doubt over how much less they produce and have focused instead on the levels of toxic nitrogen oxides they emit.

The first outward bound flights from Benina Airport were to the capital, Tripoli, to Amman, Jordan, and to the south-eastern Libyan city of Kufra. Flights are also scheduled to and from Tunis, Istanbul, Alexandria, and the western Libyan city of Zintan.  Slideshow (8 Images)The flights are operated by two state-owned companies, Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.  Benina is just east of Benghazi, Libya's second city, where fighting escalated in the summer of 2014 when forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents. Earlier this month, Haftar declared victory in the campaign as his forces battled rivals in their last downtown holdouts.  Travelers and airport staff expressed relief at no longer having to travel to Labraq airport, a four-hour drive east of Benghazi, which had replaced Benina as the main airport for the eastern part of the country.  In recent months, some official and cargo flights had already been flying from Benina. There is also a military airport at Benina, which continued operating throughout the conflict as Haftar's forces targeted their rivals with air strikes.  Tripoli's international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014, and flights have since operated out of the smaller Mitiga airport near the center of the capital.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Already one of the greatest sportsmen of his era, Roger Federer will become the most successful man in Wimbledon history if he can beat Croatian Marin Cilic on Sunday's final and claim an unprecedented eighth men's singles title. The Swiss, level with Britain's William Renshaw and American Pete Sampras on seven titles, is rejuvenated after taking a six-month break last year and enters the final as the clear favorite having not dropped a set in the tournament.  Add in the fact he has been almost unstoppable this season, winning four of the six events he had entered - including an 18th grand slam title at the Australian Open in January - many pundits and rivals believe Federer is playing some of his best tennis this year. While Cilic will be contesting his first final at the All England Club, this will be a record 11th appearance for Federer and, less than a month short of his 36th birthday, he is the oldest Wimbledon finalist since Ken Rosewall finished runner-up in 1974 aged 39.  Should he triumph, Federer will become the oldest winner of the Challenge Cup since tennis turned professional in 1968.  It makes me really happy, making history here at Wimbledon. It's a big deal. I love this tournament,  Federer said after another vintage performance dealt with Czech Tomas Berdych in the semi-final.

Eleven finals here, all these records, it's great. But it doesn't give me the title quite yet. That's why I came here this year. I'm so close now, so I have just got to stay focused.

In seven meetings with the tall Croat, Federer has lost just once - in the semi-final of the 2014 U.S. Open when Cilic went on to win the title. In last year's Wimbledon quarter-final, Federer needed five sets and saved three match points to get past Cilic and that should give the Croatian some hope.  I was one point away from winning a match over here against him. Definitely I believe in my own abilities to get through and to win it,  the 28-year-old said after beating American Sam Querrey in the semis.  But I still know that it's a big mountain to climb.

{"content":"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Flames ripped through three floors of a Honolulu tower block, killing three people including a mother and her adult son on Friday, officials and media said.  The blaze at the 36-story Marco Polo condominium complex sent thick black smoke pouring over the city, a month to the day after a deadly high-rise fire in London. Firefighters sprayed water onto the flames from nearby balconies and brought them under control at about 6.30 p.m. local time (0430 GMT Saturday), fours hours after the fire began, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told reporters.  I looked down I could see the billowing smoke coming up,  resident Ron Chiarottino said.  I heard three women's voices screaming, pleading, moaning, 'Please help me, please' continuous screaming for five or ten minutes, and then I didn't hear anymore.   The Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper said a mother and her adult son were among the three people who perished on the 26th floor, where the fire started.

{"content":"HURGHADA, Egypt/BERLIN (Reuters) - German officials said on Saturday they had been left  dismayed and furious  by the stabbing of two German women at an Egyptian beach resort, calling it a deliberate attack on foreign tourists. An Egyptian man stabbed the two German tourists to death and wounded at least four others on Friday at a popular seaside vacation spot on the Red Sea, officials and witnesses said. The knifeman killed the two German women and wounded two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel in Hurghada, then swam to a neighboring beach to attack at least two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before being caught by staff and arrested, officials and security sources said. It was the first major attack on foreign tourists since a similar assault on the same resort more than a year ago, and comes as Egypt struggles to revive a tourism industry hurt by security threats and years of political upheaval.  We now have the sad certainty that two German women were killed in the attack in Hurghada,  a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.  According to what we know, the act was a deliberate attack on foreign tourists - a particularly devious and criminal act that leaves us sad, dismayed and furious,  she added. Sources close to the investigation told Reuters the attacker was taken to Cairo for questioning by prosecutors after officers from Egypt's domestic security agency conducted an initial inquiry.  The suspect, from a village in the southern Kafr al-Sheikh province, arrived in Hurghada at 5 a.m. on Friday in a public bus and waited until shops opened before buying a knife, the sources said.

Greater Scrutiny Police questioned the shop owner who sold the attacker the knife but later released him. The knife was found in the water by divers, a source in the Sunny Days El Palacio resort said.

Zahabia hotel's beach was sealed off and placed under the control of security forces. Authorities ramped up security measures in Hurghada and are applying greater scrutiny with regards to letting Egyptians enter hotels. A security official at the El Palacio hotel told Reuters two of the injured were Czech and two Armenian, but other officials said one of the women was Russian. They were being treated at a local hospital. The Czech Foreign Ministry tweeted that one Czech woman had sustained a minor leg injury. The attacker's motive was still under investigation, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt is fighting Islamist insurgents in the Sinai Peninsula, where they mainly target security forces, but militants have also attacked tourist targets in the past, as well as Coptic Christians and churches.

{"content":"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked military bases in Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan and the northern city of Korhogo in the early hours of  Saturday, but were repulsed, a senior military official said. Three military sources blamed demobilized former rebel fighters - forces caught up in years of instability in Francophone West Africa's most important economy - though no group claimed responsibility.  There was an attack overnight at Abobo (north Abidjan), but there were no deaths. In Korhogo, three of the assailants were killed,  Colonel Zakaria Kone, commander of the Abobo camp, told Reuters by telephone.  The situation is now calm.  He added that a police station in Abobo was also attacked, saying he did not know who had done it or for what motive.  The three military sources in the northern city of Bouake, which sent reinforcements to Korhogo, said the attackers were demobilized fighters from former rebels who controlled the north of the country during Ivory Coast's crisis from 2002 to 2011. During that period, northern rebels hostile to then president Laurent Gbagbo seized half the country. An election meant to end the crisis instead triggered a short civil war when Gbagbo refused to concede to President Alassane Ouattara. Sporadic unrest since then has revealed just how precarious security still is in Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, six years since the war killed thousands of people. Security has been particularly tense since soldiers made up mostly of former rebels that had backed Ouattara during the crisis mutinied in January. The 8,400 troops involved demanded bonuses they claimed they were owed and were partly paid in order to put it to rest.  But they mutinied again in May, and were paid the remainder of what they had demanded in a deal that risks both angering other factions in the military and encouraging other former rebel fighters to take up arms. About a week after the mutiny ended, three demobilized ex-rebel fighters were killed in Ivory Coast's second-biggest city of Bouake, as they clashed with police attempting to end a separate protest over bonus payments. President Ouattara's grip on the military and other former rebel fighters is tenuous and many fear that power struggles around a 2020 election to replace him could easily erupt into more violence and instability.

{"content":"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N.-led Syria talks have a chance of making progress because demands for the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad have receded, Russia's ambassador in Geneva, Alexei Borodavkin, told reporters on Saturday. The seventh round of talks, which ended on Friday, had produced positive results, especially a  correction  in the approach of the main opposition delegation, the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee, he said.   The essence of this correction is that during this round the opposition never once demanded the immediate resignation of President Bashar al-Assad and the legitimate Syrian government.  The HNC and its backers in Western and Gulf capitals had realized that peace needed to come first, and then political reforms could be negotiated, he said.  Assad must go  was long the mantra of the HNC and its international backers, a call flatly rejected by Russia, which is widely seen as holding the balance of power in Syria because of its military involvement and alliance with Assad. But over the past year the opposition suffered military defeats at the hands of forces loyal to Assad, and neither U.S. President Donald Trump nor French President Emmanuel Macron is calling for his immediate ouster. Assad's negotiators at the U.N. talks have avoided discussion of any kind of political transition, preferring to focus on the fight against terrorism. They have not yet had to negotiate directly with the opposition because there is no unified delegation to meet them, since the HNC and two other groups, known as the Cairo and Moscow platforms, all claim to represent the opposition.  In the seven rounds so far, U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura has met each side separately, a laboriously choreographed negotiation that has succeeded only in deciding what to discuss: a new constitution, reformed governance, fresh elections and fighting terrorism. The three opposition delegations' leaders have been meeting to try to find common ground, raising hopes of direct talks at the next round in September. Borodavkin said the success of such a unified delegation would depend on its willingness to compromise with Assad's team.  If they will be ready to make deals with the government delegation, that is one thing. If they again slide into... ultimatums and preconditions that are not realistic, then this will not fly. This will lead the negotiations, be it direct or indirect, into a deadlock.  He also called for wider opposition representation, citing the Kurds as a striking example, since they were Syrian citizens with their own political and military influence. But he said it was up to de Mistura to decide how and when to incorporate them in the peace process.

{"content":"SHANGHAI, July 15 (Reuters) - China's central bank will take on a beefed up role managing systemic risk in the country's financial markets, state broadcaster China Central Television said on Saturday, citing President Xi Jinping. Speaking at the National Financial Work Conference, Xi said China would set up a financial stability committee under the State Council, boost the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) role managing financial risks and create more cohesive regulation.  We will strengthen the PBOC's role in macro-prudential management and in averting systemic risk,  Xi said, adding the country would increase the accountability of regulators and the supervision over regulatory bodies. Ahead of the closed-door event, economists had widely expected the meeting to focus on how the central bank could better coordinate with the country's three main financial regulators to manage risk in the financial system. China's financial regulators are gathered in Beijing in a once-in-five-years huddle to discuss how better to tackle weakness in the financial system. The most recent meeting in 2012 yielded no significant policy change. The main regulators include the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. Ahead of a leadership reshuffle in the autumn, Beijing has zeroed in on the stability of the economy and financial system, cracking down on risky behaviour by insurers and lenders, as well as targeting high levels of corporate debt. Investors have long supported the idea of a unified body to oversee the regulators that oversee the different parts of China's financial system, though there is little sign that a super-merger of the regulators is imminent. In 2015, a poorly coordinated response to a stock market crash in China drew scrutiny on the government's response. Premier Li Keqiang openly criticised the financial regulators as not responding sufficiently. In March this year, the new CBRC chief Guo Shuqing said the banking regulator was collaborating with other regulators to create a framework to close loopholes in rules for cross-market financial products.

{"content":"SHENYANG, China (Reuters) - Deceased Chinese Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo's ashes were scattered at sea on Saturday, Liu's brother said, in a move described by a family friend as an effort to erase any memory of him. Liu, 61, died of multiple organ failure on Thursday in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer, having been given medical parole but not freed. He had been jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His widow, Liu Xia, has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She has never been formally charged with any crime. Speaking at a government-arranged news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother Liu Xiaoguang offered thanks several times to the Communist Party for its thoughtful care considering the dissident's  special situation .  Why has Liu Xia not come here? Her health is very weak at the moment,  Liu Xiaoguang said, sitting in between an English-language interpreter and a Shenyang government official.  So she can't come here. It's very regretful.  After speaking for about 20 minutes, Liu was escorted out by two unidentified women, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, and did not answer questions from journalists who surrounded him. The government then showed reporters images of the ashes being scattered from a boat. City government information official Zhang Qingyang said Liu Xia and Liu Xiaoguang had decided upon the scattering of ashes at sea. Related CoverageAustralia urges China to release dissident Liu Xiaobo's widowBut close friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the motivation behind the sea burial was so that there was  nothing to remember him by on Chinese soil  and so that supporters could not create a shrine to pay tribute to him.   We know that Liu Xiaobo's home is Beijing, his spiritual home is here, his love was also found here,  he said. Hu said it was well-known among Liu's friends that his elder brother did not agree with his political views and that it was a cynical move for him to be presented to the media as representing Liu Xia and the family.   The extent to what the authorities are capable of always exceeds our imagination, they always have something worse than imagined planned,  Hu said of the news conference.  Crude, Cruel and Callous  A protester holds a defaced Chinese national flag with words  fascist kills Liu Xiaobo , as he mourns the death of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 15, 2017.Bobby YipNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Director, tweeted that the news conference was  one of the most crude, cruel and callous political show(s) I have ever witnessed . Government official Zhang, speaking earlier, said Liu's widow was  currently free , adding that as a Chinese citizen, her rights would be protected under the law.      But she just lost her spouse. She is extremely sad. In the period after dealing with the death of Liu Xiaobo, she won't take anymore outside disturbances. This is the wish of the family members. It's natural.  Zhang did not say where Liu Xia currently was. A government statement said Mozart's Requiem was played during the funeral, a work of music Mozart left unfinished on his death bed. Slideshow (8 Images)Liu family lawyer Mo Shaoping told Reuters he did not know whether the cremation was in accordance with family wishes, however, as they had been unreachable.  They are likely still to be under the watch and control of authorities,  Mo said.  They can't be contacted.  In funeral photographs handed out by the government, Liu Xia and other family members stand around the coffin containing Liu's body, surrounded by white flowers that signify mourning in China. During the past couple of weeks, Liu Xia had been at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and urged authorities to grant freedom of movement to his wife and the rest of his family. Several thousand people in Hong Kong held an evening vigil for Liu, holding up candles and white roses in a largely silent march to China's main representative office. Some carried banners calling Liu a  people's hero  and demanding Liu Xia be truly freed.  Even though he is dead, his fight and beliefs will never be forgotten,  said a 62-year-old marcher surnamed Wu.  We have to do something to commemorate him.   China has repeatedly attacked foreign governments for their concern about Liu and calls to allow Liu Xia to leave the country if she wishes, and foreign reporters in Shenyang have been closely monitored by plainclothes security. Efforts are being made to secure permission from Chinese authorities for Liu Xia and her brother Liu Hui to leave, a Western diplomat said on Friday. The last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance was Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in Berlin in Nazi Germany in 1938.

Mugabe had gone to Singapore on July 7 for a medical check, his third such trip this year and was accompanied by his wife. State television ZBC quoted Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba saying that the veteran leader's wife  suffered some soft tissue bruising on the right ankle as a result of a freak car incident at the Harare International Airport soon after arrival  from Singapore.   The accident occurred as the First Family was about to leave the airport for the residence,  ZBC reported on its website, without giving details of what happened. Grace Mugabe was taken to a local hospital where she was treated for the bruises and discharged. The report did not say whether Grace was traveling in the same car with Mugabe although the two usually use the same presidential limousine when traveling together. Charamba could not be reached for comment when contacted by Reuters.  At the time of her discharge, she complained of pain from the hurt ankle,  ZBC said, adding that Mugabe, his daughter and son-in-law, accompanied Grace to the hospital.

{"content":"ZINGST, Germany (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel told voters on Saturday that Britain's decision to leave the European Union and France's election of President Emmanuel Macron had changed her view on the bloc, adding it was worth fighting for a stronger Europe. Merkel's comments, made in a speech in the Baltic Sea resort town of Zingst two months before a federal election, underline her personal determination to deepen European integration if she is re-elected for a fourth term. Calling European Union membership one of Germany's biggest strengths, Merkel said last year's Brexit decision and elections in France and the Netherlands, in which pro-European parties defeated populist candidates, had changed her perspective.  For many people, including myself, something changed when we saw the Britons want to leave, when we were worried about the outcome of the elections in France and the Netherlands,  Merkel told voters, some of whom wore straw hats with black-red-and-gold hatbands, the colors of the German flag. The center-right chancellor admitted that the EU was far from perfect and that Brussels sometimes was too bureaucratic. German Chancellor Angela Merkel holds a news conference to present the outcome of the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany July 8, 2017.Wolfgang Rattay But we have realized in the past few months that Europe is more than just bureaucracy and economic regulation, that Europe and living together in the European Union have something to do with war and peace, that the decades of peace after World War Two would have been completely unthinkable without the European Union,  Merkel said to applause. Many people in the past had taken the EU and its advantages for granted -- such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom to travel, said Merkel who grew up in communist East Germany.  You don't have all this in many parts of the world. And that's why it is worth fighting for this Europe,  Merkel said.  That's why one of our election placards is saying: If Europe is stronger, then Germany will be stronger. This is directly related.  Merkel has said she is open to proposals of strengthening the single currency through the creation of a euro zone finance minister who would oversee a pooled budget for investments and transfers intended to help member states cushion downturns.

{"content":"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Green party lawmaker Peter Pilz has filed a complaint with Vienna prosecutors against Daimler (DAIGn.DE), alleging deception and serious fraud linked to business deals that accompanied the country's 2003 purchase of Eurofighter jets. Vienna prosecutors are already conducting a fraud investigation into the Eurofighter consortium and Airbus (AIR.PA), then called EADS, of which Daimler was the parent company when the $2 billion fighter jet order was agreed 14 years ago. Daimler on Saturday rejected the new charges. Airbus and the consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), have also denied the accusations. Pilz, who has campaigned for years over the side deals, now wants prosecutors also to open a probe into Daimler.  As a result of years of research, we filed legal charges against Daimler,  said Pilz, confirming an earlier report by German weekly Der Spiegel. The complaint, seen by Reuters, was jointly filed with another Green lawmaker.

{"content":"SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton was fastest in final practice for a home British Grand Prix that he is aiming to win for the fourth year in a row on Sunday. The Mercedes driver, who looks a favorite for pole position later on Saturday, lapped the cold, wet and windswept Silverstone circuit with a best time of one minute 28.063 seconds. That was significantly faster than Friday's best of 1:28.496 and the quickest yet at the former World War Two airfield. Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel was second fastest, a mere 0.032 slower than the Briton, with Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas third on the timesheets and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth. Renault's Nico Hulkenberg was a promising fifth. F1 - Formula One - British Grand Prix 2017 - Silverstone, Britain - July 15, 2017   Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in actionAndrew BoyersBottas will collect a five-place grid penalty after qualifying, due to an unscheduled gearbox change, as will Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo for the same reason. McLaren's Fernando Alonso, meanwhile, collected a massive 30-place drop for various engine penalties, ensuring the Spaniard starts at the back -- a familiar experience for the double champion this season.  The penalties look like turning qualifying into a straight battle between Hamilton and the Ferraris in a session likely to be overcast but with a decreasing likelihood of rain after steady morning drizzle. A pole for three-times world champion Hamilton would put him just one away from Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 68 and come as a timely boost after two races off the podium that have left him 20 points behind Vettel. Pole is not crucial at Silverstone, however, although every winner at the circuit since 2000 has started from fourth place or higher. Hamilton has taken the top slot for the last two seasons.

{"content":"HURGHADA, Egypt/BERLIN (Reuters) - German officials said on Saturday they had been left  dismayed and furious  by the stabbing of two German women at an Egyptian beach resort, calling it a deliberate attack on foreign tourists. An Egyptian man stabbed the two German tourists to death and wounded at least four others on Friday at a popular seaside vacation spot on the Red Sea, officials and witnesses said. The knifeman killed the two German women and wounded two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel in Hurghada, then swam to a neighboring beach to attack at least two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before being caught by staff and arrested, officials and security sources said. It was the first major attack on foreign tourists since a similar assault on the same resort more than a year ago, and comes as Egypt struggles to revive a tourism industry hurt by security threats and years of political upheaval.  We now have the sad certainty that two German women were killed in the attack in Hurghada,  a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.  According to what we know, the act was a deliberate attack on foreign tourists - a particularly devious and criminal act that leaves us sad, dismayed and furious,  she added. Sources close to the investigation told Reuters the attacker was taken to Cairo for questioning by prosecutors after officers from Egypt's domestic security agency conducted an initial inquiry.  The suspect, from a village in the southern Kafr al-Sheikh province, arrived in Hurghada at 5 a.m. on Friday in a public bus and waited until shops opened before buying a knife, the sources said. The entrance of the beach of the Zahabia Resort is seen in Hurghada, Egypt July 15, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyHe then bought a ticket for 100 Egyptian pounds ($5.60) to enter a beach where he killed the two German tourists and injured two others before jumping over a wall, swimming to the neighboring beach and carrying out more stabbings. Greater Scrutiny Police questioned the shop owner who sold the attacker the knife but later released him. The knife was found in the water by divers, a source in the Sunny Days El Palacio resort said. Slideshow (5 Images)One wounded woman was airlifted to a hospital in Cairo due to the seriousness of her injuries. Sources did not specify her nationality. Zahabia hotel's beach was sealed off and placed under the control of security forces. Authorities ramped up security measures in Hurghada and are applying greater scrutiny with regards to letting Egyptians enter hotels. A security official at the El Palacio hotel told Reuters two of the injured were Czech and two Armenian, but other officials said one of the women was Russian. They were being treated at a local hospital. The Czech Foreign Ministry tweeted that one Czech woman had sustained a minor leg injury. The attacker's motive was still under investigation, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt is fighting Islamist insurgents in the Sinai Peninsula, where they mainly target security forces, but militants have also attacked tourist targets in the past, as well as Coptic Christians and churches.

{"content":"The Colorado Rockies may have entered the All-Star break with their best first-half record in club history, but the second half of the season started the same way too many games leading up to the Midsummer Classic ended. Coming off their most lopsided defeat of the season, the Rockies attempt to put an end to their recent losing ways Saturday when they play the second of three games in New York against the Mets. Colorado finished the first half with a 52-39 mark, although that record comes as a bit of a disappointment considering the team was 21 games over .500 as recently as June 20. The Rockies' early-season stellar pitching has fallen off dramatically, however, and the club that spent 67 days atop the National League West is in a tailspin that has seen it lose 14 of 19 after New York cruised to a 14-2 trimuph in Friday's series opener. Colorado's night nearly got a lot worse as Nolan Arenado left the game early with a hip injury after slipping on the bases, although manager Bud Black deemed the move to remove the All-Star third baseman  precautionary.  The Mets backed ace Jacob deGrom with 19 hits Friday, including two from T.J. Rivera, who is batting .441 during a nine-game hitting streak. TV: 7:10 p.m. ET, ATT SportsNet Rocky Mountain (Colorado), WPIX (New York) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rockies RH Tyler Chatwood (6-10, 4.42 ERA) vs. Mets RH Seth Lugo (3-2, 4.59) Chatwood continued to struggle with his command and dropped his third consecutive start Thursday against Cincinnati, giving up three runs on eight hits and four walks in six frames. The 27-year-old, whose road ERA (3.19) is almost twice as low as it is at home (6.14), is winless in his last five turns overall and has issued 19 of his major-league high 57 walks over his last four outings. Chatwood has thrived against the Mets in his career, going 3-0 with a 1.50 ERA in five starts. Lugo will pitch at home for only the second time in seven games (six starts) Saturday and looks to improve on a shaky outing to open to July after going 3-1 with a 3.55 ERA in June. The former 34th-round draft pick permitted six runs over five innings at Washington on July 4 before allowing a solo homer over three relief innings at St. Louis five days later. Lugo was charged with two runs despite yielding only one hit and one walk over three relief frames last July in his first career appearance against the Rockies. Walk-Offs 1. Mets OF Yoenis Cespedes went 4-for-6 on Friday after batting .133 over his previous 11 games. 2. Rockies OF Charlie Blackmon, who leads the majors with 119 hits, is batting .405 during a nine-game hitting streak and has multiple hits in four of his last five contests. 3.

{"content":"Yasiel Puig wasn't included among the eight participants in Home Run Derby or one of the six Los Angeles Dodgers to take part in the Midsummer Classic Tuesday in Miami, but his performance in the second-half opener was certainly of that caliber. Coming off his third two-homer outing of the season, the former All-Star outfielder attempts to lead the red-hot Dodgers to an eighth straight victory Saturday when they continue a three-game road set versus the Marlins. Puig hit a tiebreaking solo shot in the fifth inning but saved his best for last Friday, crushing a two-strike offering for a go-ahead, three-run blast off closer A.J. Ramos with two outs in the ninth to help Los Angeles (62-29) pull out a 6-4 victory - the club's 27th win in the past 31 games. The triumph was the Dodgers' second ninth-inning rally in just over a week and marked their 25th comeback victory of the season. Miami entered the break winning five of its last six and had Los Angeles on the ropes in the opener, but Ramos was unable to get the final strike he needed three times in the ninth before blowing his second save in 19 chances. The Marlins are the NL's best offensive team in July by a wide margin, however, owning league-best marks in batting average (.313) and runs scored (62).

The first-time All-Star has allowed one run or fewer in nine of his last 11 outings - surrendering only one homer over that time - and hasn't lost in any of his last 13 turns dating back to May 30, 2016. Marcell Ozuna is 6-for-20 and Giancarlo Stanton is 3-for-23 against Wood, who is 5-3 with 3.00 ERA in 12 games (nine starts) versus Miami. Urena capped off a fine first half with a disappointing no-decision Sunday at San Francisco, giving up three runs on five hits - including a pair of homers - over five innings. The 25-year-old Dominican has fallen off a bit since a five-game winning streak from May 23-June 23 (3.38 ERA), going 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA in three outings since. Urena has been dominant in three appearances (two starts) spanning 15 1/3 innings against the Dodgers, going 1-0 with a 0.59 ERA. Walk-Offs 1. The Dodgers are 53-18 since 1B-OF Cody Bellinger's promotion on April 25, and the club is 34-9 when he and fellow All-Star 3B Justin Turner are in the lineup together. 2. The Marlins' eight-game streak of collecting at least 10 hits - the second-longest in club history - came to an end Friday. 3.

Seattle lost 10 of 14 games prior to the All-Star break but was sharp in the opener as it posted a 4-2 victory. The Mariners are one of nine teams that are part of a cluster for the two wild-card berths but sit three games under .500 due to their streaky nature and are hoping former ace Felix Hernandez can serve up a second straight strong outing.  We've got to be consistent. That has been our issue,  Seattle manager Scott Servais told reporters after Friday's opener.  Felix is out there (Saturday) and coming off a good one. We've got a good vibe in our clubhouse right now.  Chicago, which sits in last place in the AL Central, is struggling with five defeats in its last six games.

It was the 31-year-old's best effort since returning from a calf injury as he compiled a 5.50 ERA over his three previous outings. Hernandez is 5-6 with a 3.80 ERA in 18 career starts against the White Sox and has struggled with Melky Cabrera (8-for-25) while shutting down Jose Abreu (2-for-13).

Arrieta has surrendered 14 home runs in 18 starts after giving up 16 all of last season and 10 in his Cy Young Award campaign in 2015. Miley won his last start before the break, holding Minnesota to one run over 5 2/3 innings after going 1-4 with an 11.69 ERA in his previous six outings. The 30-year-old hasn’t made it through six innings in his last seven starts dating back to June 1, when he pitched seven innings of one-run ball to beat Boston.

Atlanta’s victory pulled the Braves within five games of Colorado in the loss column for the final NL wild-card spot. TV: 7:10 p.m. ET, FSN Arizona, FSN South (Atlanta) PITCHING MATCHUP: Diamondbacks LH Patrick Corbin (6-9, 4.71 ERA) vs. Braves RH Mike Foltynewicz (7-5, 3.77) Corbin closed the first half by going 0-3 across his final four starts, but did not pitch poorly in allowing two runs or fewer in three of those appearances. He lost to Cincinnati on Sunday despite striking out nine and allowing only two runs in six innings. The 27-year-old looks to reverse a rough showing away from home in the first half when he went 1-6 with a 7.57 ERA. Foltynewicz showed why the Braves project him as a top-line starter, allowing only six runs across his last four starts while going 3-0 with a .217 opponents’ batting average. Six days after taking a no-hitter into the ninth inning at Oakland, Foltynewicz held Washington to two runs in six innings on July 6. The 25-year-old is 4-0 with a 2.98 ERA and 40 strikeouts in 42 1/3 innings across his past seven starts. Walk-Offs 1. Friday’s triumph marked the 15th victory in their last at-bat for the Braves this season. 2. Atlanta RHP Jason Motte was placed on the disabled list with a lower back strain and the Braves recalled RHP Jason Hursh from Triple-A Gwinnett. 3.

{"content":"After coming out of the All-Star break flat, the Cleveland Indians look to avoid a third straight loss when they visit the Oakland Athletics on Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game set. Cleveland was unable to expand its 2 1/2-game lead over Minnesota in the American League Central as it managed only four hits in Friday's series-opening 5-0 setback. All-Star Jose Ramirez recorded a double for the Indians' lone extra-base hit and has hit safely in 11 of his last 12 contests. Oakland mustered just six hits itself, but it was enough for the club to post its third consecutive victory at home. Two of the Athletics' hits were solo homers by Rajai Davis and All-Star Yonder Alonso, who trails team leader Khris Davis (24) by three as he continues to shatter his previous career high of nine (2012). Oakland's strong pitching performance in the opener was a welcome change, as the club surrendered 23 runs during a four-game series at Cleveland earlier this season. TV: 9:05 p.m. ET, SportsTime Ohio (Cleveland), NBCSN California (Oakland) PITCHING MATCHUP: Indians RH Corey Kluber (7-3, 2.80 ERA) vs. Athletics RH Paul Blackburn (1-0, 0.66) Kluber has allowed a total of three earned runs in 37 innings over his last five starts but has recorded only two victories in that span. The 31-year-old native of Alabama settled for a no-decision against Detroit on Sunday, when he gave up one run and three hits in five frames while having his streak of consecutive turns in which he reached double digits in strikeouts halted at five. Kluber improved to 2-4 in seven career appearances (six starts) versus Oakland when he gave up two hits and struck out 10 in six scoreless innings on June 1. Blackburn has been impressive during his first stint in the major leagues, allowing two runs - one earned - and 11 hits in 13 2/3 innings over two starts. The 23-year-old Californian is coming off his first career victory, a triumph at Seattle on July 6 in which he gave up one run and eight hits over 7 2/3 frames. Blackburn failed to record a strikeout in the win and served up his first homer but issued just one walk for the second time. Walk-Offs 1. Ramirez is second in the AL with a .331 batting average and is three homers away from reaching 20 for the first time in his career. 2. Oakland RHP Andrew Triggs, who went 5-6 with a 4.27 ERA in 12 starts this year, underwent season-ending on his left hip Thursday. 3.

Trout and the Angels look to rebound from a series-opening loss when they host the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game set. Trout went 1-for-5 in Friday's 10-inning, 2-1 loss - Los Angeles' eighth in 11 games - after missing 39 contests with a torn ligament in his left thumb. The Angels went 19-20 without the two-time American League MVP, who is 5-for-9 with two homers against scheduled Tampa Bay starter Alex Cobb. Brad Miller delivered the tiebreaking double in the 10th on Friday to give the Rays their seventh victory in 10 games.

The 29-year-old is 3-1 with a 2.38 ERA over his last six outings and gave up fewer than three earned runs in five of them. Cobb is 1-2 with a 6.51 ERA in five career starts against the Angels, including a loss on May 23 in which he gave up four runs and seven hits over 7 1/3 innings. Ramirez never had started a major-league game prior to this season, but he is the team's leader in victories after making 17 starts prior to the All-Star break. The 28-year-old defeated Texas in his last turn as he allowed just two hits in six scoreless innings. Ramirez defeated Tampa Bay on May 22, when he allowed two runs and six hits over 6 2/3 frames.

{"content":"The All-Star break did nothing to slow down the Milwaukee Brewers, who hope to extend their lead in the National League Central when they host the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game set. Milwaukee won six of its last seven contests before the break and picked up where it left off by posting a 9-6 triumph in Friday's series opener. The Brewers - who own a 5 1/2-game division lead over the Chicago Cubs - rolled to victory on the strength of an eight-run second inning that was powered by Ryan Braun's sixth career grand slam, which put him ahead of Cecil Cooper, John Jaha and Jeromy Burnitz for the franchise lead. Manny Pina went 2-for-3 and drove in a run, giving him three multi-hit performances and six RBIs in seven contests this month. Philadelphia remains mired in the NL East basement as Friday's setback was its sixth loss in seven games. Maikel Franco recorded four of the Phillies' nine hits and drove in a pair of runs while Odubel Herrera, who also registered two RBIs, has hit safely in six of his last seven contests.

The 24-year-old native of Louisiana has given up a total of five runs and recorded 34 strikeouts in 29 1/3 frames over his last four turns and has yielded more than three runs just once in his last seven outings. Nola was superb in his two previous career starts against Milwaukee, allowing one run and striking out 16 over 13 innings while notching a pair of victories. Nelson has won each of his last three starts, including a road outing against the New York Yankees on Sunday in which he gave up three runs over five innings. The 28-year-old Oregonian has thrived at home of late, going 4-0 with a 0.97 ERA and 45 strikeouts in his last five turns at Miller Park. Nelson has posted a 1-1 record and 6.89 ERA in three career outings against Philadelphia. Walk-Offs 1.

{"content":"Nearly three months after landing on the disabled list, Madison Bumgarner is set to return Saturday as the San Francisco Giants continue their three-game series against the host San Diego Padres. The Giants are moving veteran Matt Cain to the bullpen to accommodate Bumgarner, who injured his shoulder and ribs in a dirt-bike accident in April but looked sharp in a minor-league rehab start on Monday.  His intensity, his presence, all that, trust me, I'm hoping things like this are a shot in the arm for the club,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy told reporters.  We just really had a horrible (first) half. Getting guys back hopefully will do a lot for the psyche of the club.  San Francisco snapped a four-game losing streak with Friday’s 5-4 victory as Gorkys Hernandez recorded a career-high four hits and closer Sam Dyson escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth inning. Dyson ended the game by retiring Jabari Blash, who was recalled from Triple-A El Paso earlier in the day after Hunter Renfroe was placed on the disabled list with a strained neck. Renfroe’s injury caused manager Andy Green to move Wil Myers from the leadoff spot to No. 3 in the order, where he went 1-for-4 on Friday. TV: 8:40 p.m. ET, NBCSN Bay Area (San Francisco), FSN San Diego PITCHING MATCHUP: Giants LH Madison Bumgarner (0-3, 3.00 ERA) vs. Padres RH Jhoulys Chacin (8-7, 4.32) Bumgarner pronounced himself ready after allowing two hits over six scoreless innings in a rehab start for Single-A San Jose on Monday. The four-time All-Star, who landed on the disabled list for the first time in his career, also serves as a threat at the plate with 14 home runs over the last four seasons. Myers is 5-for-30 with seven strikeouts against Bumgarner, who is 0-3 with a 4.73 ERA in his last four starts against the Padres but tossed a complete game in his last outing on April 8. Chacin won his second straight outing last Saturday, holding Philadelphia to one run and three hits over 6 1/3 innings. The 29-year-old continues to exceed expectations, allowing fewer than three earned runs in seven of his last 10 starts. Buster Posey is 9-for-25 with one homer against Chacin, who has posted a 1.68 ERA in nine starts at Petco Park this season and owns a 7-6 record and 3.33 ERA in 17 career games (16 starts) versus San Francisco. Walk-Offs 1. Padres RHP Brandon Maurer has converted 14 straight save opportunities since May 28. 2. Giants INF Eduardo Nunez (hamstring) was activated from the disabled list prior to Friday’s game and doubled in five at-bats. 3.

{"content":"The Houston Astros have pulverized Minnesota pitching this season and look to defeat the host Twins for the fifth straight time in 2017 when they meet Saturday for the middle contest of their three-game set. Houston collected 14 hits in Friday's series-opening 10-5 victory and has outscored the Twins 50-21 in the four victories. The Astros got a three-run homer from Brian McCann to cap an eight-run second inning in their latest offensive onslaught while Marwin Gonzalez also went deep as part of a 3-for-5 performance. All-Star Jose Altuve recorded two hits after five consecutive three-hit efforts to help Houston (61-29) move 32 games above .500 for the first time since the final day of the 1999 season. Minnesota has dropped three consecutive games but figures to receive a boost on Saturday as Joe Mauer (back) is eligible to be activated from the disabled list.  I think that reports coming into town were that he had a good break in terms of returning to good health,  Twins manager Paul Molitor told reporters.  So far, I've seen nothing that has dispelled that. I'd be surprised if he's not ready to be active (Saturday).

The 34-year-old All-Star has excelled on the road, going 6-2 with a 2.19 ERA and 1.03 WHIP in eight turns. Santana is 3-0 with a 2.02 ERA in five career outings against Houston but wasn't involved in the decision on May 29, when he gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings. Musgrove is winless over his last four starts as he remains in the rotation with Dallas Keuchel and Collin McHugh sidelined with injuries. The 24-year-old was shelled for 18 runs and 23 hits - including six homers - in 15 innings over his last three turns. Musgrove is just 2-6 with a 5.40 ERA in nine home starts this season.

The final two contests of their three-game series in Pittsburgh this weekend could help determine whether they buy or sell. Josh Bell’s three-run blast in the ninth inning lifted the Pirates to a 5-2 win in Friday’s series opener, giving Pittsburgh its National League-best third walk-off home run of the season and keeping the Pirates close enough to the fray to consider themselves contenders. Pittsburgh (43-47) has won 17 of its last 29 to get within four games of .500 and is seven games behind National League Central leader Milwaukee with star outfielder Starling Marte due back from suspension Tuesday. The Cardinals (43-46) are in a similar spot, having underachieved in the first half but sitting only 6 1/2 games back.

Lynn is 6-6 with a 4.76 ERA in 21 games (19 starts) against the Pirates and has split two meetings this season.

Beltre has knocked in eight runs, pushing his career total to 1,601, and walked three times in the last four contests while Mike Napoli also homered Friday to give him five blasts in his last eight outings for Texas. Hamels gave up five hits combined in two wins before the All-Star break and tries to keep the Rangers surging against the suddenly slumping Royals, who send fellow left-hander Danny Duffy to the mound. Kansas City has lost four straight games after winning six of seven to push itself back into the American League playoff chase, and coughed up an early 3-0 lead in Friday’s setback.

Toronto utilized home runs from Jose Bautista and Steve Pearce as well as an outstanding start by Aaron Sanchez to coast to a 7-2 victory in the series opener, its fifth win in the last seven games. The Tigers have lost three of their last four and left nine runners on base in Friday's setback, which came without second baseman and leadoff hitter Ian Kinsler (flu-like symptoms).

Sale went into the break leading the majors in strikeouts (178) while ranking near the top of a number of other major statistical categories. Included in his phenomenal first half was a 10-strikeout performance over eight innings against the Yankees on April 27, which left him with a 1.31 ERA in 11 career meetings (eight starts) against New York. Sale's first-place club opened a 4 1/2-game lead over the Yankees with a two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning in Friday's series opener, handing closer Aroldis Chapman the loss in the latest bullpen disaster for New York, which has lost five straight one-run games. The Yankees have dropped 19 of 26 overall, their deficit in the division matches a season high and they learned Friday that starter Michael Pineda is a candidate for Tommy John surgery.

{"content":"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Flames ripped through three floors of a Honolulu tower block, killing three people including a mother and her adult son on Friday, officials and media said.  The blaze at the 36-story Marco Polo condominium complex sent thick black smoke pouring over the city, a month to the day after a deadly high-rise fire in London. Firefighters sprayed water onto the flames from nearby balconies and brought them under control at about 6.30 p.m. local time (0430 GMT Saturday), fours hours after the fire began, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told reporters.  I looked down I could see the billowing smoke coming up,  resident Ron Chiarottino said.  I heard three women's voices screaming, pleading, moaning, 'Please help me, please' continuous screaming for five or ten minutes, and then I didn't hear anymore.   The Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper said a mother and her adult son were among the three people who perished on the 26th floor, where the fire started. At least 12 other people were injured, it added. Fire Chief Manuel Neves told reporters that the building did not have a sprinkler system.  Without a doubt if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin ... the unit (where) the fire started,  he said.   More than 100 firefighters tackled the fire and officers were conducting a room-by-room search, a task that could take several hours, he added.

In London, at least 80 people were killed when a fire gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower block on June 14. That building was also built in the 1970s and did not have a sprinkler system.  Slideshow (8 Images)Images posted online on Friday showed orange flames raging on several floors and debris falling from windows. There were no immediate reports on what caused the blaze in Honolulu.  We were all trying to help as much as we could ... but there was a fire and you could see it spreading,  said 72-year-old resident Karen Hastings, who was in the building when the fire broke out. One firefighter and four residents were taken to hospital while eight other residents were treated at the scene, the Star-Advertiser said.  Volunteers were looking after residents at a nearby park, the Hawaii Red Cross said on Twitter. The fire forced the closure of a major road in front of the condominium complex, the Honolulu police department said on  Twitter.

{"content":"SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - Daniel Ricciardo's run of five successive podium places looks in danger of ending after the gearbox on his car was replaced ahead of the British Grand Prix, incurring an automatic five-place grid penalty. Gearboxes must last for six races and the one in Ricciardo's Red Bull, which was swapped out before Saturday's final practice, had not done so. The Australian won in Azerbaijan in late June and finished third in Austria two weeks ago. It was his second grid penalty of the season, after a similar five-place drop in his home race in Melbourne in March. He started from the pit lane on that occasion and failed to finish the race. Mercedes rival Valtteri Bottas, who won in Austria from pole position, also has a five-place penalty for Sunday's race after a similar gearbox change. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel leads Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton by 20 points after nine of 20 races. Hamilton, who had a five-place drop in Austria, is chasing his fourth successive British Grand Prix win and fifth in total.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Venus Williams will hope to reclaim her Wimbledon crown after a nine-year wait on Saturday against Garbine Muguruza, in a final that has the makings of a classic battle of the big hitters. Venus, aged 37 and undergoing a barely credible tennis renaissance, last stepped out onto Centre Court to contest a singles final in 2009. She lost that match to Serena Williams, having beaten her younger sister to lift the aptly named Venus Rosewater Dish the previous year - the most recent of her seven grand slam titles. Victory in Saturday's final - in which, with rain a possibility, the Wimbledon roof may come into play - would see the evergreen American surpass Serena as the oldest major title winner since the sport turned professional in 1968. Having finished runner-up in the Australian Open in January, Venus would also move to the top of the leaderboard as the best main tour player of 2017. Albeit on a less eye-catching scale, Muguruza is enjoying a comeback of her own. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 13, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza celebrates winning the semi final match against Slovakia’s Magdalena RybarikovaToby MelvilleHaving reached her first slam final at Wimbledon in 2015 and then gone one better in 2016 by winning the French Open - playing Serena both times - the form of the Venezuela-born 23-year-old dipped towards the end of last year. But since May she has made the semi-finals on the Rome clay - beating Venus in the last eight in three sets - and on the Birmingham grass. With both players boasting similar strengths and weaknesses, the older Williams has been open about picking Serena's brains  on how best to neutralize Muguruza's powerful serve and forehand, even joking this week that she wished her younger sister could play the match in her stead. En route to Saturday's final, for which bookies make the Spaniard the slight favorite, both players have dropped just one set. That means a decider could be on the cards, which history suggests would favor whoever starts best. Of grand slam contests in which they have taken the first set, Muguruza has lost just two of 42, and Williams 18 of 250.

{"content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government helped to secure a more than 240-million ($310 million) pound investment from Toyota in its English plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese carmaker over post-Brexit trading arrangements, two sources told Reuters.  Toyota said on March 16 it would install its new car platform at its Burnaston plant. One source, who is familiar with the letter, said that Toyota delayed the decision due by the end of December while it weighed up a number of factors including Brexit. The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but refused to release it.  The source said the letter was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan last year when it decided to build two new models at its northern English plant. The document sparked public and lawmaker concern about secretive deals. The source, who did not say when the letter was sent, said it contained several reassurances.   They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles, commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry,  the source said. A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on whether it had received such a letter. He referred to the company's March 16 statement which said the British government was providing funding for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that  continued tariff-and-barrier free market access... will be vital for future success.  Britain said in March it would back up the investment from Toyota, which builds roughly 10 percent of Britain's 1.7 million cars, by spending 21.3 million pounds to support skills and training, research and development and innovation, subject to an independent assessment. A spokesman at the business ministry declined to provide any comment for this story. Business minister Greg Clark said last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms. Reuters made a freedom of information (FOI) request to the business ministry to see documentation relating to the investment decision, which the ministry said included a letter. In its response, an official at the ministry refused to release the letter and a company briefing note, saying the information was  both highly commercially sensitive  and  would be likely to cause harm to the company's commercial interests if disclosed.  Clark has refused to publish the Nissan letter. He said he will release the information when it is no longer commercially confidential. FILE PHOTO: New cars are parked at Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby, central England February 18, 2009.Darren Staples/File PhotoMany of the world's biggest car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain's exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019. Redacted Emails Toyota finalised its decision at a meeting between its Europe President and Chief Executive Johan van Zyl and Clark on March 15, the day before the official announcement, a third source, who is close to the company told Reuters.  In response to the FOI request, the business ministry said there were three documents relating to discussions between the firm and top government officials since Clark was appointed in July last year: a letter, a confidential company briefing and an email exchange. Slideshow (2 Images)It initially refused to publish all three but after Reuters appealed the decision, the department released a redacted email exchange. Reuters asked for correspondence between the company and Clark, a special advisor, a junior minister and the ministry's automotive team. The email exchange included three messages which were written after a meeting between Clark and van Zyl. The emails are redacted so that it is not possible to know who received them.   We picked up from the recent meeting with Greg Clark that Toyota has a significant investment decision coming up before the end of the year, for a new European 'architecture plant',  according to official correspondence dated Sep. 9.   Dr Zyl noted that uncertainties over future trade arrangements are a worry, and SofS (Secretary of State Clark) sought to reassure on the alignment of company and HMG (Her Majesty's government) goals.    It would (be) great to understand more about the decision, and if there are any ways in which HMG could help,  the email from the official said. Clark had meetings with Toyota officials in September, November and March, according to an official government log.  Japan's Nissan, Toyota and Honda account for around half of British car output. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with British Prime Minister Theresa May in April and called for a smooth Brexit to allow Japanese firms to continue to operate. Toyota has yet to say which models it will build in Burnaston over the next decade.

{"content":"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland may need to raise interest rates as soon as early 2018 because of risks to the inflation outlook or if real interest rates stay below zero percent for too long, the business daily Parkiet cited a central banker as saying. Eugeniusz Gatnar told the newspaper he believes inflation may reach the central bank's target of an annual 2.5 percent faster than by the end of 2019 as envisioned in the bank's recent analysis, prompting a need to increase rates. Poland's 10-member rate-setting Monetary Policy Council has held the benchmark interest rate unchanged at an all-time low of 1.50 percent since a 50-basis-point cut in March 2015.

{"content":"Posey, Giants hold off Padres SAN DIEGO -- Buster Posey homered and had two RBIs as the San Francisco Giants survived Johnny Cueto's abbreviated outing to beat the San Diego Padres 5-4 on Friday night. The win might have been costly as Cueto exited the game with two fingers and a thumb on his pitching hand showing signs of blisters. Cueto might miss his next start, according to Giants manager Bruce Bochy.  You could tell he wasn't quite right,  Bochy said.  That was what kept him from going out there. After the fourth inning he said, 'I can't finish my pitches' so I had to make a move.'  Posey, who entered the game with two hits in his last 19 at-bats, produced a seventh-inning, 429-foot blast off reliever Ryan Buchter for his 11th homer on the year and his first since June 22. Posey had his first RBI when he singled in the game's initial run. Gorkys Hernandez had a career-high four hits to lead the Giants' 14-hit attack. Cory Gearrin (3-2), who relieved Cueto, secured the win after pitching a scoreless inning. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PadresSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchSam Dyson worked the ninth for his fourth save, but not before the Padres scored once and had the tying run at third when Jabari Blash flied out.  It got kind of exciting there at the end,  Bochy said. Cueto escaped without a decision and has won just twice in eight starts; last year he was 13-1 at the break. The right-hander lasted four innings and was charged with three runs and six hits. He struck out five and walked three. It's the second time this season he's been bothered by blister symptoms, but he didn't skip a turn on the first occasion. Cueto, through a translator, said this ailment has never stuck him before this year and the cause could be the composition of the baseballs.  I think so, probably,  Cueto said.  I feel that the ball is tighter and with my three fingers I can't feel the ball.  I think the best thing for me to do is to take some time off. Right now it feels bad. I'm not throwing very well and I don't want to hurt myself.  Clayton Richard (5-9) went 5 2/3 innings and surrendered four runs, 11 hits and two walks. Richard, who hasn't won in five starts in a row, struck out four.  I thought he settled in relatively nicely there, until the sixth inning,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  The sixth inning kind of got away from him.  It started with a leadoff walk to Hunter Pence which led to Richard's downfall.  That's something I have control over and one of the things I could change,  Richard said.  It's really difficult when you have the lead going and you're expected to come away on top and I wasn't able to do that.  The Giants regained the advantage with a two-run sixth as they chased Richard. Denard Span knocked in the go-ahead run with a single to score Joe Panik, who produced the second of consecutive singles against Richard. In the fourth, San Diego took its first lead at 3-2 when Austin Hedges' single drove in Erick Aybar after his double to right. The Padres tied it 2-2 in the second. Blash, who was recalled earlier from Triple-A El Paso, doubled in Cory Spangenberg after his inning-opening walk. Blash then scored on Aybar's single. San Francisco went up 2-0 on Cueto's second-inning flare to right field, which brought in Brandon Crawford. After Crawford was safe at the plate, Hedges fired down to first base where Cueto was retired after rounding the bag aggressively. The Giants struck in the first, taking a 1-0 lead on Posey's RBI single. Posey's hit fell just in front of a diving Blash in right field to bring around Brandon Belt after he reached on a two-out single.

{"content":"Miller lifts Rays past Angels ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The big cheers early in Friday night's game between the Los Angeles Angels and Tampa Bay Rays were for Mike Trout, who was returning for his first game since suffering a torn ligament in his left thumb on May 28. But the night belonged to a local kid, Rays starting pitcher Jake Faria, who had a significant cheering section of his own that ultimately had reason to celebrate. Faria gave up one run in 6 2/3 innings, leaving with the score tied at 1. Brad Miller's two-out RBI double in the 10th inning off Angels reliever Cam Bedrosian (2-1) was the game-winner in Tampa Bay's 2-1 victory at Angel Stadium. Trout went 1-for-5 with a single and a stolen base, including a strikeout for the final out of the game. Alex Colome pitched the ninth for his 26th save, the last of four Rays relievers who followed Faria. For Faria, who gave up five hits, the game was a homecoming. He grew up in Anaheim and his family had Angels season tickets. And when he was in high school at nearby Gahr in Cerritos, he modeled his delivery after former Angels pitcher Jered Weaver. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AngelsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch I only had to leave nine (tickets),  Faria said.  But my dad ended up buying 60 and my stepdad bought 30 and there were others that filtered in and bought their own tickets. There was probably 200-plus.  It was weird at first. I tried to make it feel like it was any other game. But then being there in the outfield (before the game), stretching and running, I'm looking up ... it was pretty awesome.  The only run Faria allowed came on Albert Pujols' home run leading off the second inning. But he had to dance around trouble in the third and fourth innings. In those two innings, he gave up two singles, walked two, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch. But he escaped both jams, getting Pujols to end the third and Cameron Maybin to end the fourth.  We just didn't get that hit,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  It looks like (Faria's) got really nice poise, used a good split, changed speeds well, hit his spots and got some big outs.  We were in some situations where we could have broken the game open and couldn't do it. I think we were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position and that's been plaguing us most of the year.  For Faria, though, it was par for the course. He's 4-0 with a 2.00 ERA in his seven starts, and all seven have been quality starts (at least six innings, three earned runs or fewer).  We all continue to be impressed with the way he goes about his starts and competes,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  And even when he isn't feeling his best, he finds a way to limit damage and give us every opportunity to score runs.  The Rays, though, couldn't do much with Angels starter Ricky Nolasco, who gave up two hits in seven innings. Both hits came from Evan Longoria, who homered in the first inning and doubled in the seventh. After the seventh, it became a battle of bullpens. Tampa Bay's Adam Kolarek, Tommy Hunter and Brad Boxberger (2-0) preceded Colome. The Angels got scoreless innings from Blake Parker and Bud Norris before Bedrosian gave up a two-out single to Wilson Ramos, followed by Miller's drive off the right-center field fence. Trout's only hit in the game was a single in the third inning. He dived back headfirst into first base after rounding the bag, then slid headfirst into second when he stole a base, the same way he injured the thumb six weeks ago.  Mike's going to play baseball; that's what he's about,  Scioscia said.  Mike's a player that makes everybody around him better, and we need him. Hopefully, we'll get settled and these groupings will work and get some offense. And Mike's obviously a big part of that.  NOTES: To make room for CF Mike Trout on the roster, the Angels optioned OF Eric Young Jr. to Triple-A Salt Lake. Young hit .260 with three homers, 11 RBIs, 18 runs scored and eight stolen bases in 34 games after being called up to take Trout's roster spot May 29. The Angels also called up LHP Jose Alvarez and optioned RHP Mike Morin to Salt Lake. ... Rays OF Colby Rasmus was placed on the restricted list by the Rays on Thursday and isn't expected to return to the club this season because of personal reasons. Rasmus, who was on the disabled list since June 23 because of a hip injury, hit .281 with nine homers and 23 RBIs in 37 games this season.","keywords":"Adam Kolarek,Albert Pujols,Alex Colome,Blake Parker,Brad Boxberger,Brad Miller,Bud Norris,Cam Bedrosian,Cameron Maybin,Colby Rasmus,Eric Young Jr.,Evan Longoria,Jake Faria,Jered Weaver,Jose Alvarez,Kevin Cash,Mike Morin,Mike Scioscia,Mike Trout,Ricky Nolasco,Sammy Sosa,Tommy Hunter,Wilson Ramos,BBO,RAYS,ANGELS,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 02:50:00","news_title":"Miller lifts Rays past Angels","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED7F4A8422"}
{"content":"Gray ignores trade rumors as A's blank Indians OAKLAND, Calif. -- It was less than an hour before first pitch Friday night when Oakland Athletics right-hander Sonny Gray heard about a Tweet out of Chicago that he had been scratched from his scheduled start against the Cleveland Indians. Gray has been the subject of trade rumors for weeks. So he, as well as family members and friends who text messaged him, naturally wondered if he had been traded.  It's hard,  Gray said.  You get 50 text messages 45 minutes before the game and that's when you just try to put your phone away and go to a place where you can block everything out and get ready for the game. So that's kind of what I tried to do.  As it turned out, Gray wasn't scratched, and he threw six shutout innings in a 5-0 victory at the Oakland Coliseum. Gray (5-4) allowed two hits, struck out five and walked one. He had his fourth straight quality start and has gone 3-1 with four earned runs in 27 innings during that span.  At times it can be difficult,  Gray said of the rumors.  You just don't know. You just don't know. It's just one of those things that you have to deal with sometimes. Whatever happens is going to happen, and that's out of my control.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at AthleticsA's center fielder Rajai Davis, who played for the Indians last season when they won the American League title but lost to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, went 2-for-3, scored two runs and hit his third home run of the season in the fifth inning, a solo shot. Davis wasn't going to be in the lineup until rookie center fielder Jaycob Brugman became ill.  When someone goes down like that, someone else gets an opportunity and Rajai made the best of it,  A's manager Bob Melvin said. Yonder Alonso also hit a solo home run in the fifth, his 21st homer of the season. Cleveland manager Terry Francona returned to the bench eight days after undergoing a medical procedure to correct cardiac arrhythmia. Francona, who missed the Indians' previous six games and the All-Star Game, wore a heart monitor. Indians right-hander Carlos Carrasco (10-4) allowed five runs and six hits, including two home runs, as his five-game winning streak ended. He struck out 10, walked two and lost for the first time since June 3 at Kansas City.  He gave up, you know, the solos,  Francona said of Carrasco.  I think on a normal night, or a night when we're swinging a little bit, it looks like a lot more competitive game, but that's kind of the way Oakland has been. They can hit the ball out of the ballpark. Even in this spacious place they hit the ball out of the ballpark, and that's what they do.  The A's led 4-0 through five innings and made it 5-0 in the seventh when rookie Matt Chapman lead off with a triple and scored on a wild pitch by Nick Goody that bounced just a few yards away, to catcher Yan Gomes right. Chapman got a great jump and scored on a head-first slide, beating Gomes' throw. Oakland relievers Ryan Madson, Sean Doolittle and Santiago Casilla each threw a scoreless inning. They combined to blank the Indians on two hits with six strikeouts. The A's scored twice in the third inning to take a 2-0 lead. Davis led off with an infield single, the first hit Carrasco allowed. Matt Joyce lined a double to right-center field, driving in Davis, who barely beat second baseman Erik Gonzalez's relay throw home to Gomes.  As soon as I picked my head up, I took a quick peed and saw (Gonzalez) had the ball and they were about to throw home,  Davis said. I said, 'Uh oh, this is going to be close' When Gomes took a little step to the right, I said,  Now I can see where he goes and then I'm going to slide the other way.  Joyce went to third on the throw home, and Marcus Semien brought him home with a sacrifice fly to deep center field. Davis made it 3-0 with a leadoff home run in the fifth inning. He launched Carrasco's belt-high, 2-0 fastball into the left-center field seats.  It was a fastball down the middle,  Carrasco said.  I was just throwing a slider for ball, a slider for ball, you get behind in the count you just throw a fastball.  Then with two outs in the inning, Alonso hit a solo shot to right-center field, increasing Oakland's lead to 4-0. NOTES: Cleveland OF Lonnie Chisenhall (strained right calf) was placed on the 10-day disabled list, and he's expected to miss more than two weeks.

{"content":"Blue Jays return from break with 7-2 win over Tigers DETROIT -- Aaron Sanchez gave the Toronto Blue Jays just what they needed, a solid start from a pitcher who could be a pillar in their rotation. Jose Bautista drove in two runs with a home run plus a sacrifice fly to back six innings of one-run ball by Sanchez on Friday night while the Blue Jays got their 10-game post All-Star break road trip off to a successful start with a 7-2 victory over the punchless Detroit Tigers. Sanchez (1-2) was making only his seventh start of the season due to a blister on his right middle finger. He allowed a double plus six singles to a Detroit offense that had been without a home run since Dixon Machado's in the second inning on July 6 until Andrew Romine hit his fourth home run with one out in the ninth off reliever Jeff Beliveau. Between the home runs, Detroit had just six doubles among 36 hits in 41 innings. Sanchez walked two and struck out four.  He was really good,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  He looked good. He was popping it pretty good, threw some good breaking balls. He looked like the old guy. That's a good sign. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at Tigers He's a big part of our team. We need him. He's definitely the freshest guy out there. His finger feels good. It wouldn't surprise me if he got on a nice little roll.  Toronto (42-47) sealed it in the eighth with three runs, one when Russell Martin drew a four-pitch, two-out walk from reliever Blaine Hardy and two more when Josh Donaldson lined a 3-2 single to left. That put the Blue Jays up 7-1. Danny Barnes gave up one single in the seventh, Joe Biagini got three outs in the eighth and Beliveau finished the ninth to wrap it up. Bautista, in his 19th game as the leadoff hitter, greeted Tigers reliever Warwick Saupold in the seventh with his 15th home run, upping the Blue Jays' lead to 4-1. Kevin Pillar drew a sixth-inning walk on a full count pitch from Detroit reliever Shane Greene with the bases loaded to increase the Toronto lead to 3-1.  You have to throw strikes,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.  You can't walk 10 guys and win games in the major leagues.  The Tigers got runners at first and third with nobody out in their fifth on singles by Jose Iglesias and Alex Presley, but the Blue Jays escaped with just one unearned run scoring thanks to Miguel Cabrera hitting into an inning-ending double play. The run scored when third baseman Donaldson caught Alex Avila's line drive but threw the ball wildly to first for an error that let both runners move up, shaving Toronto's lead to 2-1.  That was a lot better than recent starts in my book,  Sanchez said.  There was a lot of weak contact. I felt like at the beginning I was still trying to find the zone a little bit. My release point.  It was ball, strike, ball, strike, the first couple innings. That kind of got my pitch count up. Then I felt like I kind of settled down, got into a groove, got into the sixth.  Steve Pearce pounded a 2-0 fastball from Justin Verlander (5-7) leading off the Blue Jays' fifth for his seventh home, breaking a scoreless tie. Pillar reached second when J.D. Martinez dropped his fly ball near the foul line for an error, advanced on a groundout to short and scored an unearned run on Bautista's first-pitch sacrifice fly to center, giving Toronto a 2-0 lead.  You just can't have that many deep counts,  Ausmus said.  You have to give Toronto some credit, especially against Verlander, but when you are pitching from behind every time, you are going to keep turning over the lineup and your defense is going to get bored from being out there so long.  Verlander threw 114 pitches in his 5 1/3 innings, running up 2-2 counts on seven batters and 3-2 on six. He struck out five and two of his three walks came to the last two batters he faced. Detroit is 7-15 in its last 22 games to fall to 10 below .500 (39-49) for the season and increase the likelihood it will be a seller by the time the non-waiver trade deadline is reached July 31. NOTES: The Blue Jays have tabbed LHP Francisco Liriano and RHP Marco Estrada to work the Saturday/Sunday games. ... Tigers LHP Daniel Norris is eligible to come off the disabled list (groin) on Tuesday, but whether he will start or not is up in the air, according to manager Brad Ausmus. ...

{"content":"Astros pound out 10-5 win over Twins HOUSTON -- Houston Astros manager A.J. Hinch wasn't surprised by the ragged performance of his team or its opponent on Friday night and, despite an early lead that should have made for a relaxing evening in the home dugout, all Hinch sought was a victory to cure his uneasiness. Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez slugged home runs as the Astros produced another offensive showcase in their 10-5 win over the Minnesota Twins at Minute Maid Park. McCann capped an eight-run second inning with his three-run blast while Gonzalez drove his 17th homer to straightaway center field as the Astros (61-29) added two runs in the third to extend to a nine-run lead. Houston clubbed both home runs off Twins reliever Phil Hughes. The Twins (45-44) pushed back against Astros right-hander Charlie Morton (7-3) but got no closer than having the tying run on deck with two outs in the sixth inning. Hinch summoned All-Star reliever Chris Devenski to put out that fire and keep Houston comfortably in control.  I didn't like the way that whole game felt,  Hinch said.  Obviously, I felt really good at 10-1 and then it was slowly starting to deteriorate. They were getting a lot of baserunners; they stranded a lot of baserunners (11). It just wasn't worth not going to our guys. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Astros (Luke) Gregerson hadn't pitched in a while and (Ken) Giles hasn't pitched a ton the last two weeks. I just wanted the game to end so I used our best guys (in the eighth and ninth innings).  Gonzalez finished 3-for-5 with two RBIs and two runs scored. Jose Altuve and Carlos Beltran both were 2-for-4 with a walk and a run scored for Houston, which has won nine of 12 games. Twins second baseman Brian Dozier produced his 21st career leadoff home run, a club record, and finished 2-for-5 with four RBIs. He added a two-out, bases-clearing double in the fourth. Right-hander Jose Berrios (8-3) was pulled in the second and suffered the loss for Minnesota.  It just seemed from the get-go for whatever reason he looked uncomfortable,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Berrios.  He had trouble getting settled in.  Undeterred by the four-day break for the All-Star Game, the Astros pounded Berrios into submission in the second, with six consecutive batters reaching base to erase a 1-0 deficit. Gonzalez, Alex Bregman and George Springer had run-scoring hits in succession for a 3-1 lead. Altuve walked and Josh Reddick added a sacrifice fly before Carlos Correa delivered an RBI single to center that chased Berrios and pushed the Houston advantage to 5-1 with two outs.  I understand that they are in first place in the division and that they're really hot right now. But that doesn't mean you don't follow your game plan,  Berrios said.  Obviously, they were ahead in most of the counts and that's how they were able to get to me early.  After McCann greeted Hughes with his 11th home run, a shot to right field on an 0-2 count, the Astros led 8-1.  It's just one of those things where this team is different,  McCann said.  It's different because everyone shows up on a daily basis and everyone in here loves baseball. It has been a pleasure.  Berrios was charged with only two earned runs after a fielding error by Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco helped fuel the Astros' outburst. He issued three walks and allowed four hits while notching five outs before departing what was his shorting outing by a wide margin this season. The Astros had their own issues with clean play, committing a pair of errors in the fifth inning. Morton recorded 10 strikeouts but also allowed five runs (four earned) and walked five batters. NOTES: Twins 1B Joe Mauer took batting practice and is poised to be reinstated from the 10-day disabled list in time to start the middle game of the series on Saturday night. Mauer landed on the DL on July 7 (retroactive to July 5) with a lower back lumbar strain. ...

{"content":"Eight-run second propels Brewers to 9-6 win over Phils MILWAUKEE -- Once again, Zach Davies was far from his best, but once again the Milwaukee Brewers' offense came through big for the young right-hander. Orlando Arcia hit a three-run home run and Ryan Braun belted his sixth career grand slam as the Brewers scored eight runs in the second inning and held on for a 9-6 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night at Miller Park. Davies (11-4) gave up six runs -- five earned -- on seven hits and five walks while striking out six over 5 1/3 innings.  I don't think he was on top of it tonight,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  Five walks, that's not him. There were a couple of walks that really hurt him. Free passes, there are times where you are maybe pitching around somebody, but in a game like this there were a couple of walks that hurt him.  Phillies starter Nick Pivetta (2-5) went five innings and allowed a season-high nine runs on seven hits with three walks and five strikeouts.  This is his first go-round in the big leagues,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's shown us a lot of promise and I like what he's been doing. Today wasn't his best.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BrewersPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchStaked to an early, 2-0 lead, Pivetta struck out the first four batters before Domingo Santana's one-out double in the second. Pivetta allowed seven consecutive batters to reach. Arcia cleared the bases along the way with a three-run homer when he hit Pivetta's 1-2 pitch over the left-center field wall. It was his ninth homer of the season. After Pivetta sandwiched walks to Davies and Eric Thames around a single to Jonathan Villar, Braun came up and wasted little time. He crushed Pivetta's first offering to straight-away center for his 11th home run and his sixth career grand slam, giving the Brewers an 8-2 lead.  It was a high breaking ball,  Counsell said.  It might have been a ball, actually. I knew Ryan was going to be aggressive that at-bat after his first at-bat. He threw him a bad pitch for a guy that was going to be aggressive.  From there, though, Pivetta settled in. After Braun's grand slam, he retired nine consecutive batters.  It's just part of the game,  Pivetta said.  My concern was after giving up eight runs, going out there and trying to minimize the damage as much as I can so we don't have to wear out the bullpen or use too many position players.  Philadelphia got two runs back in the fifth when Maikel Franco singled to right-center for his second hit of the day. Milwaukee made it a 9-4 game in the bottom of the frame on a sacrifice fly by Manny Pina before the Phillies got within three in the sixth on Odubel Herrera's two-run shot off Davies.  I mean, I'm (angry about) my performance, definitely,  Davies said.  But the team's winning and you can't be selfish in that aspect and be upset and show it when the team is doing what it should be doing.  Franco finished with four hits for Philadelphia while Aaron Altherr added a pair of doubles but had to leave the game in the fifth after suffering a mild strain of his right hamstring. Corey Knebel worked a scoreless ninth for his 15th save of the season as the Brewers won for the 10th time in their last 12 games and maintained a 5 1/2-game lead over the second-place Cubs in the National League Central.

{"content":"Russell rescues Cubs after blowing big lead vs. O's BALTIMORE -- The Chicago Cubs banged out four homers in the first three innings on Friday night to go ahead 8-0. Then they lost the lead and needed some late help from Addison Russell to pull out a dramatic win to properly start the second half. Russell hit a tiebreaking solo homer off Brad Brach in the top of the ninth inning as the Cubs shook off blowing an eight-run lead in a 9-8 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Russell lined a homer to left on the first pitch from Brach (2-2) with one out in the ninth. It was Chicago's fifth homer of the game. The shortstop's eighth homer this season occurred after Baltimore's Mark Trumbo hit a two-run homer to left against Koji Uehara (3-4) in the eighth that tied the score at 8.  It feels good to come out with that win,  Russell said.  (I was) just looking for a ball in the zone. The biggest thing for me is just making sure I see the pitch, track it, and put a good swing on it.  Russell entered the game stuck in an 0-for-10 skid but went 2-for-4 and raised his average to .230. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at OriolesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCubs closer Wade Davis pitched the ninth for his 17th save. The Orioles (42-47) scored eight straight runs after the Cubs took the big early lead. That's a reason why Chicago manager Joe Maddon thought this victory was so important.  It was really important under the circumstances,  Maddon said.  We had such a big lead and then forfeited that lead. That's the part that would've made it even more difficult. Under the circumstances of how that game was played tonight, it was really good to finish it off.  Willson Contreras (three-run) and Kyle Schwarber (solo) both homered as the Cubs (44-45) scored four in the first. Ben Zobrist and Jason Heyward added two-run homers in the second and third, respectively, and Chicago took the early eight-run lead. The Cubs pounded Orioles starter Kevin Gausman for eight runs and seven hits in the three innings. Gausman saw his ERA jump to 6.39, and while he avoided the loss, the right-hander was not happy.  Yeah, it's frustrating,  Gausman said.  Obviously, I wanted to come out here and hit the ground running going into this second half. It was just bad.  The bullpen kept the Orioles in the game after Gausman's rocky start. Five pitchers combined to allow that one run and three hits in six innings. They struck out six and walked only one.  It was great,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  That's as good as you could ask, especially with that much time off. We're lucky because with that much time off, we had everybody available.  The Cubs answered a 49-minute rain delay by starting quickly in the first, when Zobrist led off with a double and went to third on a one-out single from Anthony Rizzo. Both came around to score as Contreras crushed a three-run homer to left-center field. Schwarber added a solo shot on the next pitch, which made it 4-0 against Gausman. The right-hander found more trouble in the second as Zobrist lined a two-run homer to right. Heyward added a two-run homer to deep right that made it 8-0 in the third, again off Gausman. The Orioles answered with a Welington Castillo solo homer in the third and a Chris Davis RBI double off starter Mike Montgomery in the fourth. The Orioles then put runners at second and third with one out in the fifth, ending Montgomery's night. Justin Grimm entered and allowed RBI singles to Trumbo and Trey Mancini and a Joey Rickard two-run single that sliced the lead to 8-6 before Ruben Tejada flied out, ending the inning.

{"content":"Napoli, Beltre guide Rangers by Royals KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Mike Napoli hit a rare Texas Rangers pinch-hit home run and Adrian Beltre just continues to knock the ball out of the park at age 38. Napoli and Beltre accounted for all of the Rangers' runs as they rallied to defeat the Kansas City Royals 5-3 on Friday night. The Royals (44-44) have dropped four straight and are winless in five games this season against the Rangers (44-45), who won their 10th straight over Kansas City dating to last season. Napoli's pinch-homer with Carlos Gomez aboard in the seventh broke a 3-3 deadlock. Napoli pulled Mike Minor's 2-2 pitch 444 feet out to left.  That's what he is here for,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said of Napoli hitting Joey Gallo.  We just felt the better matchup was Napoli.  It was the Rangers' first pinch-homer since Leonys Martin did it May 19, 2015, at Boston.  Any time you can come through like that late in the game, it's always fun,  Napoli said.  Especially coming off the bench in a pinch-hitting situation. It's tough, but I just got ready to play and put a good swing on it.  Minor tried to fool Napoli with a changeup. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at Royals I thought it was the right pitch,  Minor said.  It just came back over the plate. If I execute the pitch, we're fine.  Beltre helped the Rangers rally from a 3-0 deficit with a three-run blast in the sixth. It was Beltre's 453rd career home run, moving him one past Carl Yastrzemski and into 38th place on the all-time list. That also upped his RBI count to 1,601 and put him within 20 of reaching 3,000 career hits. The Royals increased their advantage to 3-0 in the fifth when Whit Merrifield doubled down the right-field line and scored on Jorge Bonifacio's single to center. Bonifacio was out at second, trying to stretch his hit into a double. That lead soon evaporated. Jason Hammel did not allow a hit until one out in the sixth, but he failed to get out of the inning. Elvis Andrus chopped one off the plate for an infield single, which Hammel deflected, for the first Texas hit. Nomar Mazara's fly-ball single to shallow left moved Andrus to second before Beltre homered.  It's been the theme, kind of for the year,  Hammel said.  It's been just one pitch, which more or less, I want to be down in the zone with it and it's just a hanger that ends up costing us.  We let them back in the door there. If we shut the door there, I think we win the ballgame. A slider in the dirt that's just got to be a better executed pitch there.  For a guy who's sitting and from what I know and the experience of just facing him, he sits soft with two strikes. I've thrown him quite a few to him already. So he was looking for it and it stayed up enough for him to put a good swing on it.  After Robinson Chirinos' two-out single on Hammel's 108th pitch, manager Ned Yost went to his bullpen, bringing in left-hander Minor.  If you take back just the one pitch, he was outstanding,  Yost said. Rangers starter Martin Perez (5-6) threw 89 pitches in seven innings to pick up the victory. Perez allowed three runs and eight hits. He is 3-0 in his past four starts. Matt Bush worked a flawless eighth and left-hander Alex Caudio got the final three outs for his second save this season. The Rangers have lost five games this season they have led after eight innings, but this time the bullpen maintained the lead. Eric Hosmer's infield single in the Kansas City sixth extended his hitting streak to 16 games, the longest active streak in the majors. Hosmer was quickly erased when Salvador Perez grounded into his 13th double play, one behind the league leader. Hammel held the Rangers hitless for the first five innings, allowing only three baserunners. He walked Beltre to leadoff the second and Carlos Gomez with two outs in the fifth. Hosmer's fielding error put Mazara on base with out in the fourth. Alcides Escobar extended his hitting streak at home to 11 games with a second-inning home run that clanged off the left-field pole and put the Royals up 2-0. Mike Moustakas, who reached on an infield single, was aboard when Escobar homered on a 2-0 Perez offering. NOTES: Royals RHP Neftali Feliz went on the paternity list and RHP Miguel Almonte was recalled from Triple-A Omaha to take his bullpen slot. ... Rangers RHP Keone Kela, who is on the disabled list with a stiff shoulder, is back on a throwing program, but Texas manager Jeff Banister said it is doubtful he would be activated for the weekend series with the Royals. ... Royals RHP Nathan Karns has not yet decided whether to have season-ending thoracic outlet syndrome surgery, but he acknowledged that he is leaning in that direction. ... OF Bubba Starling, who was the Royals' 2011 first-round pick, was placed on the Triple-A Omaha disabled list with an oblique injury.","keywords":"Adrian Beltre,Alex Caudio,Carl Yastrzemski,Carlos Gomez,Elvis Andrus,Eric Hosmer,Jason Hammel,Jeff Banister,Joey Gallo,Jorge Bonifacio,Keone Kela,Martin Perez,Matt Bush,Miguel Almonte,Mike Minor,Mike Moustakas,Mike Napoli,Nathan Karns,Ned Yost,Robinson Chirinos,Salvador Perez,BBO,RANGERS,ROYALS,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 00:56:00","news_title":"Napoli, Beltre guide Rangers by Royals","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED7F44PUV9"}
{"content":"Cano powers Mariners past White Sox CHICAGO -- If the Seattle Mariners are going to rebound from a disappointing first half, manager Scott Servais believes the secret can be found in more consistent play. Servais certainly can't complain about the first step the Mariners took Friday night. Robinson Cano hit a three-run homer and James Paxton struck out nine in six innings as the Mariners beat the Chicago White Sox 4-2. Paxton (8-3) scattered five hits and allowed two earned runs on a night when the left-hander and the Seattle bullpen combined for 15 strikeouts. Edwin Diaz picked up his 14th save with a scoreless ninth inning. Cano's third-inning blast gave the Seattle pitchers all the offense it needed as the Mariners opened the second half of the season with their fifth victory in the last 15 games. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at White SoxBut Servais said thewin can only be the beginning.  We've got to continue to roll with this and keep building on it,  he said.  We've got a good vibe in our clubhouse right now, (we have) a really good discussion of where we're at as a ballclub right now. I think that's really important to laying all on the table so our guys know where things are at and that they have to pick it up.  Matt Davidson and Tyler Saladino hit RBI doubles for the White Sox, who didn't manage a hit after the fourth inning. Chicago starter James Shields allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings. The Mariners jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the third inning after Cano blasted his 18th home run of the season off the top of the right field wall. Cano belted the first pitch he saw from Shields after Mike Zunino walked and Jean Segura singled earlier in the inning.  I knew I hit it good,  Cano said.  It was good it went over the fence.  The White Sox got within 3-2 in the fourth inning on a Davidson double that scored Avisail Garcia, who singled and then stole second. But the Mariners quickly extended their lead back to two runs in the fifth inning when Segura -- who doubled to lead off the inning and advanced to third on a Cano groundout -- scored on a wild pitch by Shields.  I kept the team in the game, but two pitches really cost me,  Shields said.  The one to Cano, obviously, the homer, and the passed ball. If I make my pitches right there, I think it's a whole different ballgame. I'm not happy with the outing, but we're going to keep grinding it out and move forward.  Paxton, meanwhile, settled in and got stronger as his outing went on. He retired the final eight hitters he faced and finished with back-to-back strikeouts to set up the Seattle bullpen for success.  That will work,  Paxton said of his start.  Started getting my legs under me a little bit and started to feel better in that fifth and sixth inning after I got it going a little bit.  Saladino gave the White Sox a 1-0 lead in the second inning with an RBI double that scored Garcia, who singled with one out. Garcia advanced to third with a stolen base and a Zunino throwing error. After Davidson struck out, Saladino -- who was activated from the disabled list on Friday -- lined a ground-rule double into the right field corner. But once Cano sparked the offense and the pitching got rolling, the Mariners got off to the kind of start they were hoping to find coming out of the All-Star break.  It's really important when every game means more,  Cano said.  Every game is important that we win so we can keep ourselves in the race.  NOTES: The Mariners promoted Nasusel Cabrera to interim bullpen coach to replace Mike Hampton, who resigned July 2 to spend more time with his family. Cabrera has worked as a batting practice pitcher and assistant coach since joining the Mariners' major league staff in 2015. ... The White Sox activated RHP Miguel Gonzalez off the 10-day disabled list after he had been sidelined since June 15 with A/C joint inflammation in his right shoulder.

{"content":"Conforto, deGrom lead Mets to rout of Rockies NEW YORK -- Few teams in baseball could have used a 1981-esque reboot of the season at the All-Star break more than the New York Mets. But the second half beginning Friday the way the Mets wished the first half unfolded allowed them to maintain a flicker of hope they can make an unlikely run into postseason contention. Jacob deGrom won his sixth straight start when seven Mets had at least two hits apiece in a 14-2 rout of the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field. The Mets expected to receive a combination of ace-caliber pitching and timely hitting regularly in the first half. But deGrom was the only member of the projected Opening Day rotation to avoid the disabled list and lineup anchor Yoenis Cespedes -- who entered Friday in a 5-for-40 skid before collecting a team-high four hits -- was one of five everyday players shelved by injury. As a result, the Mets (40-47) are 9 1/2 games behind the Rockies (52-40) in the race for the National League's second wild card.  We just have to do our best to capitalize on opportunities that are provided for us and presented to us,  Mets right fielder Jay Bruce said.  That was a good win tonight. That's a good team over there. They've been playing well all year. So, we know what we're capable of.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at MetsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchDeGrom (10-3) continued to do what he's capable of performing like one of the best pitchers in the game on Friday, when he allowed two runs (one earned), four hits and one walk while striking out 11. He threw 26 pitches in the first inning before retiring 14 straight between the first and fifth.  I knew I threw a lot of pitches in the first inning, so my goal was to get some early outs and I was able to do that,  deGrom said. DeGrom has produced a 1.53 ERA in his last six starts, a stretch in which he has thrown at least seven innings every time while striking out 47 and walking 10. He has seven double-digit strikeout games this season and has thrown at least eight innings five times, a figure exceeded only by the Washington Nationals' Max Scherzer (six).  A guy like Jake -- I thought we had five of them to start the season -- (is one of) those number one guys,  manager Terry Collins said after the Mets improved to 12-6 in deGrom's starts.  When you need them, they rise up. They're there when you need them the most. They keep you from having losing streaks, because when it's their turn and you've lost three or four in a row, they step up and they shut the other team down.  Cespedes, who missed 44 games in the first half due to various leg injuries, offers a similar boost at the plate and in the field to the Mets. The left fielder doubled to start a six-run third inning, capped New York's scoring by beating out an infield RBI single in the eighth and snuffed out the Rockies' biggest threat in the sixth by nabbing D.J. LeMahieu at the plate to finish an inning-ending 7-2 double play.  He's got all the skills,  Collins said.  If we're going to get in it, he's got to lead the way.  DeGrom spotted the Rockies an unearned run in the first when he committed a throwing error one batter before Geraldo Parra laced a one-out RBI single. But deGrom got the run back in the second when he followed up Travis d'Arnaud's run-scoring groundout by hitting an RBI single to give the Mets the lead for good. T.J. Rivera (two-run double), Jose Reyes (RBI single), Michael Conforto (run-scoring groundout) and Asdrubal Cabrera (two-run single) helped the Mets blow the game open in the third. Rivera homered leading off the fourth and Conforto hit a three-run shot in the sixth. Cabrera drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth. Parra and Charlie Blackmon had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who have lost 14 of 19. Blackmon scored Colorado's second run on a sixth-inning wild pitch.  It's one game, against a guy who was on,  Rockies manager Bud Black said. Jon Gray (2-1) took the loss after allowing eight runs, nine hits and three walks while striking out one in two-plus innings. It was the second shortest start of Gray's career.  I just wanted to get positive energy going for the first game, and it sucks to kind of let the whole team down like that,  Gray said. NOTES: Mets LHP Josh Smoker (left shoulder strain) made his third rehab appearance, allowing one run in one inning for Class A St. Lucie. ... Mets RHP Jeurys Familia (blood clot in right shoulder) began a throwing program on Thursday. ... Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) began a rehab assignment Thursday, allowing an unearned run in two innings for Double-A Hartford. ...

{"content":"Freeman propels Braves past Diamondbacks ATLANTA -- A seven-week stint on the disabled list didn't cool off Freddie Freeman's bat and neither did the All-Star break. Freeman belted his third homer in seven games since returning from a broken wrist and delivered the decisive hit in the eighth inning Friday night as the Atlanta Braves defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3.  He's special and we all know that,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  He just keeps doing it and has all year.  Freeman, who moved from first base to third to keep Matt Adams' bat in the lineup, is hitting .400 (12-for-30) with six extra-base hits and 10 RBIs while getting at least one hit in all of the games since his return.  I feel like it's all in my approach,  Freeman said when asked about the secret for not missing a beat at the plate.  All I'm trying to do is hit line drives to the shortstop.  Freeman's 17th homer in the sixth was pulled, but his single in the eighth off reliever Archie Bradley went to left field.  We thought about taking the bat out of his hands and putting him on,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  But we believe in Archie and Freeman just beat us.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at BravesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchBrandon Phillips, who had doubled, fell down rounding third base after Ender Inciarte scored the tying run, but the veteran second baseman scrambled home to put the Braves ahead when left fielder Gregor Blanco threw to second base.  Obviously, it was an awkward play and it didn't turn out the way we wanted,  Lovullo said. The Diamondbacks gave the Braves a scare in the ninth, but Inciarte spoiled A.J. Pollock's home run bid with a leaping catch at the fence in center field. Jim Johnson retired the next two batters harmlessly to get his 20th save. Rex Brothers (1-0) received credit for the victory after getting the last out of the eighth. The loss was the ninth in the past 12 games for the Diamondbacks (53-37). The Braves (43-45) have won 15 games in their last at-bat -- the most in the majors. Bradley (3-2) hadn't allowed a run in 16 of his previous 17 games and the two runs he gave up with four hits in the eighth matched the total for his previous 24 outings spanning 23 2/3 innings.  Archie is our guy. He'll get the ball every time in the eighth inning,  Lovullo said. The Diamondbacks had taken the lead in the top of the eighth on an unearned run. Chris Owings singled, took third as catcher Tyler Flowers made a throwing error on his stolen base and scored on a two-out wild pitch by reliever Jose Ramirez. Paul Goldschmidt's 21st homer tied it in the seventh inning. The All-Star first baseman picked on a high changeup from left-handed reliever Sam Freeman and deposited it to left-center field that just made it into the seats. The blast cost Braves starter R.A. Dickey a chance for a fifth straight home victory and got the Diamondbacks' Taijuan Walker off the hook for a potential loss. Dickey limited Arizona to one run in six innings despite eight hits, two walks and a hit batter. The 42-year-old knuckleballer struck out four.  I've felt pretty good for a while now,  said Dickey, who has a 1.09 ERA in his past five starts.  Finding the right rhythm.  Walker hung a 1-0 curveball to Freeman with one out in the sixth inning and the Braves slugger drove the pitch over the right field wall. The Diamondbacks lost a chance for more than one run in the top of the sixth when Walker grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded. Arizona had four straight singles, with Daniel Descalso's third hit driving in the run. The Braves scored a first-inning run against Walker on a leadoff double by Inciarte, their lone All-Star Game representative, and a two-out single by Matt Kemp. The Diamondbacks had seven runners on base in the first four innings against Dickey but hit into a double play and left six stranded.

{"content":"(Reuters) - Investors may have overbuilt U.S. housing stocks as data has yet to match up with the homebuilder sector's biggest rally in five years.   The S&P; 1500 Homebuilding index .SPCOMHOME of homebuilder companies has surged 32 percent this year and hit a decade-high earlier this week. By contrast, the wider S&P; Composite 1500 Index .SPCOMP has gained less than 9 percent. Housing optimists are pinning their bets on strong U.S. job creation, low interest rates, tight housing supply, robust earnings estimates and a lack of recessionary red flags.  Some investors still see opportunities, but others warn the stocks may have run too far.   The sentiment has been quite positive for housing but where they are today, I'm not a buyer of housing stocks. The stocks have run up faster than the data supports and there are better pockets of value in the market,  said Erin Browne, global macro portfolio manager at UBS O'Connor in New York. Brown cited weakening growth in building permits and new projects, known as housing starts, since the first quarter as well as land and labor constraints.   While new home sales still look solid, they are still low versus historical levels, given the ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots which is constraining faster growth,  she said.   Data shows first quarter single-family housing starts grew 6 percent year-over-year and 8.5 percent in May. Overall housing starts have risen 1.27 percent so far this year. Next week's June data is expected to show an 8.3 percent increase from May.  Demand overall has been positive for the builders,  according to Will Randow, analyst at Citi, although he questioned whether it was positive enough to support such an outsized gain by the group. Randow believes the stocks have risen partly on hopes that policy changes by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump could help boost home sales. Double-Digit Growth Wall Street analysts expect most home builders to report solid double-digit earnings growth, according to Reuters data.  D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), whose quarterly profit is seen rising 14 percent, and PulteGroup (PHM.N), pegged for 15.5 percent earnings growth, will both report in the last week of July. But Randow says the 2017 median earnings estimate for 12 housing stocks he covers has barely changed in the last three months.  Maybe the stocks have gotten ahead of themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see any sort of correction in housing starts.  Earlier this week, Barclays downgraded four U.S. homebuilders, citing a buyer traffic pullback in its June survey that was inconsistent with rising valuations. Short interest in seven homebuilders - the four biggest and the three biggest year-to-date gainers - has risen by 20 percent for 2017, with much of that increase coming in June and July, according to financial analytics firm, S3 Partners. Of the seven, the biggest recent short-selling increase was in LGI Homes (LGIH.O), whose shares are up 46.6 percent for 2017, followed by NVR Inc (NVR.N), up 51.4 percent. And recent trading in SPDR S&P; Homebuilders ETF (XHB.P) has leaned toward defensive bets with options positioning implying  investors are on guard against a near-term decline. Still, some investors still see value.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, likes D.R. Horton and LGI Homes, and expects a home shortage to boost prices.   Maybe there's another 20 percent in these stocks over the next 12 months, assuming that interest rates stay relatively low,  said Bradshaw.  I still think there's plenty of home buyers and not that many homes.

{"content":"Red Sox clip Yankees with 2 runs in 9th BOSTON -- Andrew Benintendi's bat nearly became the story of Friday night's game when he teased a potential go-ahead three-run homer for the Boston Red Sox in the seventh inning. Two innings later, Benintendi let his feet do the talking. Benintendi walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to bring in the winning run as the Red Sox came back to beat the New York Yankees 5-4 at Fenway Park.  No, that's a first. It's a good one,  Benintendi said when asked if he had ever experienced a walk-off walk in his baseball career. In fact, the Red Sox had not won on a walk-off walk since Sept. 23, 2000, when Trot Nixon worked a free pass in the 10th inning against the Baltimore Orioles. It also was Boston's first game-ending walk against the Yankees since Ted Williams scored in the 11th inning of a 1-0 win in August 1956. With Boston trailing 4-3, Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia both reached on infield singles to lead off the bottom of the ninth against Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman (2-1). A successful double steal put two runners in scoring position before Xander Bogaerts poked a grounder to second base in the next at-bat. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at Red SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchThe ball was mishandled by New York's Ronald Torreyes and Betts scored the tying run as Pedroia advanced to third. Chapman intentionally walked Hanley Ramirez to load the bases before walking Benintendi.  I wasn't as sharp as I would like to be,  said Chapman, who blew his third save of 2017.  They hit the ball a couple times in that inning. My control wasn't there tonight. It just got complicated in that inning.  Ramirez had a two-run shot for his 14th homer of the season while Pedroia, Bogaerts and Benintendi each finished with one RBI for the Red Sox (51-39). Boston extended its lead over New York in the American League East to 4 1/2 games.  It's a credit to our guys of not maybe losing focus inside some at-bats,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  We battled, we fought back. Just a good finish to this one.  Gary Sanchez hit a two-run homer, his 14th this year, and Brett Gardner had an RBI for the Yankees (45-42), who started the second half on weak footing after losing 18 of 25 entering the All-Star break.  It's frustrating because we've put ourselves in some situations to win some games and we haven't been able to close them out for whatever reason,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. Boston's Drew Pomeranz gave up four runs on six hits and two walks with seven strikeouts in a six-inning no-decision for the Red Sox. Robby Scott (1-1) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win. Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery, recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before the game, allowed three runs on six hits and three walks with three strikeouts in a four-inning no-decision.  I was just a little too quick to the plate,  Montgomery said of his outing.  There's a lot of factors, probably pulling out a little quick.  New York scored three runs in the fifth inning to grab a 4-3 lead. Gardner's one-out RBI single brought the Yankees within a run. Sanchez's blast in the next at-bat traveled approximately 409 feet and easily cleared the Green Monster in left field. Sanchez also drove in New York's first run with an RBI single in the third. Ramirez gave Boston a 2-1 lead with his estimated 406-foot Monster shot in the bottom of the inning. Pedroia gave the Red Sox a temporary two-run cushion with his bases-loaded RBI single in the fourth. NOTES: Boston 3B Pablo Sandoval was designated for assignment Friday. The Red Sox still owe him $49.5 million on his five-year, $95 million contract.  (We felt) we were not a better club if he was at the (major league) level,  president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. Sandoval, 30, hit .212 with four home runs and 12 RBIs in 32 games this season. ... New York RHP Michael Pineda (right UCL tear) was placed on the 10-day disabled list after being informed he needs Tommy John surgery. ... Yankees 1B Greg Bird (right ankle bruise) might require ankle surgery, general manager Brian Cashman said. ... New York activated DH Matt Holliday from the 10-day DL. 1B Garrett Cooper made his major league debut after signing a major league contract. INF/OF Rob Refsnyder was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Boston promoted 3B Rafael Devers, ranked the team's No. 1 prospect by Baseball America, to Triple-A Pawtucket. The 20-year-old hit .300 with 18 homers and 56 RBIs in 77 games with Double-A Portland this year.","keywords":"Andrew Benintendi,Aroldis Chapman,Brett Gardner,Brian Cashman,Dave Dombrowski,Drew Pomeranz,Dustin Pedroia,Garrett Cooper,Gary Sanchez,Greg Bird,Joe Girardi,John Farrell,Jordan Montgomery,Matt Holliday,Michael Pineda,Mookie Betts,Pablo Sandoval,Rafael Devers,Rob Refsnyder,Robby Scott,Ronald Torreyes,Ted Williams,Tommy John,Trot Nixon,BBO,YANKEES,RED_SOX,WRITETHRU,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Baseball","news_time":"2017-07-15 00:12:00","news_title":"Red Sox clip Yankees with 2 runs in 9th","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-redsox-writethru-idUSMTZED7F43BUS8"}
{"content":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Online game developer Boyaa Interactive International Ltd said its chairman has become a co-defendant in a bribery probe involving its indirect Chinese subsidiary in Shenzhen, after being under investigation for more than a year.     The company, with a market capitalization of HK$2.6 billion ($333.2 million), first announced last May that its chairman has been detained and was being investigated by judicial authorities in China, although details of the probe were not known. Boyaa said in a statement late on Friday the subsidiary had received an indictment from the judicial authority as a defendant due to its alleged act of bribery, while chairman Zhang Wei, as the legal representative of the Shenzhen subsidiary, has become a co-defendant of the case.  The company said the case would not cause any adverse impact to its business, operations and financial status. It was well prepared to ensure that the normal operations of the group would not be affected, regardless of any possible outcome. The company, citing its lawyer, said Boyaa Shenzhen would plead not guilty and  the prosecution evidence is insufficient to support a conviction . If convicted, however, the maximum penalty on the legal representative is up to five years imprisonment, it said. The case is expected to be heard within the next three months.
