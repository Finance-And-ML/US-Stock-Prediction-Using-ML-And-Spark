The 19 defendants were formally charged earlier this month, having been first detained late last year, and the trial at Baoshan District Court in the north of Shanghai is expected to reach a fairly swift conclusion. Melbourne-based Crown is 49 percent owned by billionaire James Packer, and the most senior employee on trial is its Australia-based head of international VIP gambling Jason O'Connor. Three of the accused, believed to have been junior staff, had been released on bail. Family members were ushered into the courthouse as they arrived with lawyers in a convoy of cars on Monday morning, and some wore masks. Journalists were barred from attending proceedings. The case has forced Crown to tear up its strategy of luring wealthy Chinese to the casino hub in the Chinese territory of Macau and instead shift its focus back home. Crown does not directly run casinos in China. But it relies heavily on Chinese gamblers at its Australian operations, as it had done in Macau until last month when it sold its remaining stake in Macau-focused Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd for $1.16 billion. China has been cracking down on attempts by casinos to woo high-spending Chinese gamblers within China. In 2015 thirteen South Korean casino managers were arrested in China for offering Chinese gamblers free tours, free hotels and sexual services. The trial is the latest in a series of high-profile cases in China involving foreign firms. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC was fined nearly $500 million in 2014 and food maker OSI saw employees jailed last year. $1 = 6.8390 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Winni Zhou and Engen Tham; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/crown-resorts-china-trial-idUSL3N1JN15S"},

Participants included Chelsea Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified data before former President Barack Obama granted her clemency.   Honored to represent the ACLU at this years NYC Pride March,  Manning said on Twitter, posting a photo of her riding in a red convertible.  Started to lose my voice from screaming so much,  Manning, who was released from a military prison in May, added.  A group of marchers heading down New York's Fifth Avenue carried photographs of U.S. President Donald Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as others waved banners bearing the word 'RESIST' and the rainbow flag of the Pride movement. In contrast, a smattering of anti-Trump signs in San Francisco was drowned out by a desire to let loose.  It's too good a day to be upset about Trump,  said Richard Babb, 66, of San Francisco.  In New York, Brad Hoylman, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate, said lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were  under assault  by the Trump administration.  He already rolled back rights for transgender students, for example, and the list is on and on,  he said.  So we have a lot more work to do, that's why we are here today.  As a candidate, Trump promised to protect gay people. But his move in February to revoke the Obama administration's guidance letting transgender students choose which gender bathroom they use, and his executive order last month to promote religious liberty have been seen by some as discriminatory.  The New York march's grand marshals this year include the American Civil Liberties Union, which was chosen for its history of litigation defending gay rights; Brooke Guinan, a transgender woman who works as a firefighter in the city; and Geng Le, a gay rights activist in China.  Pride this year is showing that we are here, we are queer, and we are not going to sit down for anything less than full rights, full equality,  said Austin Anderson, a 28-year-old advertising worker at the New York event.      Participants take part in the LGBT Pride March in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., June 25, 2017.Carlo AllegriThe march route ends on Christopher Street in Manhattan's West Village to commemorate the riots that broke out there in 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in an event seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement. New York's first Pride march started close by a year later.  West Coast Parties In San Francisco, revelers had to pass through one of dozens of metal security detectors to get into the main plaza. Slideshow (14 Images) Happy Pride everyone!  a security monitor yelled to the crowd, as people cheered and saluted.  Have fun today.  Two gay cousins attended the parade dressed in tutus and unicorn headbands.   We see this as a party, not a political protest,  Qiaira McPeters, 18, said. Despite that, McPeters said that she feels things for gay people have been getting worse.   Gay people are getting beat up all the time,  she said.  In Seattle, hundreds of people marched downtown in unusually hot weather, many in skimpy outfits and carrying pink balloons. A rainbow flag was hoisted to the top of the city's iconic Space Needle.  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, the first openly gay person to hold that job, joined the parade with his husband, Michael Shiosaki.  Today we celebrate our unity,  he said in a video posted on Twitter. The Seattle Police Department, which put rainbow-colored decals on their patrol cars, said a group of people blocked the parade route for about 30 minutes to hold a sit-in in honor of Charleena Lyles, the black mother slain by city police a week ago. There were no arrests, police said. [L1N1JG04T] Writing by Jonathan Allen and Eric M.

Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision.  I have very serious concerns about the bill,  she said on ABC's  This Week  program.  It's hard for me to see the bill passing this week.  Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) speaks to reporters after Senate Republicans unveiled their version of legislation that would replace Obamacare on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2017.Joshua Roberts We don't have enough information. I don't have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,  he said on NBC's  Meet the Press.  Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare. Slideshow (2 Images) If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes I’ll consider partial repeal,  Paul said on ABC. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing.  I think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats  are doing everything we can to fight this bill because it's so devastating for the middle class.  The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.

The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 97.269 after falling 0.4 percent on Friday. The index had climbed to a one-month peak of 97.871 earlier last week, supported by expectations that the Fed, fresh from a mid-June rate hike, would tighten policy again as early as September. But such expectations ebbed over the course of a week, with investors doubtful of another rate increase this year as U.S. indicators have on balance fallen short of forecasts.  The main reason behind the weakness of the dollar, which has lost its upward momentum since the Fed rate hike, is U.S. yields stuck at low altitude,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  Yields appear to better reflect U.S. fundamentals relative to equities, and in focus this week are political developments and the various indicators due for release.  U.S. data due this week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index. On the political front, the U.S. Senate hopes to vote on a healthcare bill this week to replace Obamacare. But with as many as five Republican senators oppositing the bill, getting a vote by the end of this week could be difficult. The Trump administration will find it hard to follow through with tax cuts and fiscal stimulus steps, seen as dollar-supportive factors, without passing the healthcare bill first.  The market has essentially given up on a number of key U.S. plans passing through Congress within the year, so any delays to the healthcare vote should not come as a surprise,  said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.  But there is room for a positive surprise for the dollar if the healthcare bill actually goes forward.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose briefly after the Fed tightened policy this month, but have drifted lower since as expectations of low inflation continued to boost demand for longer-dated debt. Friday's decline took it closer to a seven-month low of 2.103 percent plumbed on June 14. The greenback was steady at 111.290 yen, held below a near one-month high of 111.790 touched last Tuesday.

The embattled air bag inflator maker said it would seek $1.588 billion in financial aid from U.S.-based auto parts supplier Key Safety Systems (KSS). The Tokyo Stock Exchange said shares of Takata would be delisted on July 27 after it filed for bankruptcy protection. The stock will be suspended for all of Monday, after closing at 160 yen on Friday.  Takata's bankruptcy is bad news, but since the market has long known that the company was in trouble, its impact to overall investor sentiment is limited,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. The Nikkei rose 0.1 percent to 10,161.02 in midmorning trade. Analysts expect the stock market to be supported by hopes of solid earnings.  We stand by our view that the 20,000 level is a key support level with positive focus to increase on stock specific earnings, corporate actions and ROE increases,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Limited. Elsewhere, Toshiba Corp tumbled as much as 6.9 percent after the Tokyo Stock Exchange decided to downgrade the stock to its second section from August. Mining shares staged a rally after oil prices rose early on Monday. Inpex Corp climbed 1.7 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration rose 1.2 percent.

The South Korean lifer has mandated JP Morgan, Citigroup, Nomura and UBS as joint bookrunners for the subordinated capital securities and is eyeing an issue size of around $500 million next month. The move comes as Korea prepares to adopt international accounting standards and stricter domestic solvency rules that will require insurers to boost their capital reserves. South Korea will implement International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17 Insurance Contracts, which require insurers to report liabilities on a mark-to-market basis rather than book value, resulting in a larger amount of recorded liabilities.  Under IFRS, Korean insurers need to increase their reserves quite substantially, so liabilities will increase and their capital or equity will decrease,  said Stella Ng, an analyst at Moody's.  Quite a few insurers are planning to restore capital or strengthen their positions before IFRS becomes effective in 2021.  The standard is expected to put pressure on Korean insurers and force them to use market-consistent discount rates to evaluate their liabilities. These rates will be much lower than the 6 percent or more that the top three insurers currently use to calculate liabilities. Korean lifers have about 535 trillion won ($468 billion) of liabilities that will be affected by IFRS17, according to estimates from the Korean Insurance Research Institute. This amount could increase by 23-33 trillion won if IFRS is implemented, said a Bank of Korea report in December. The implementation of IFRS17 comes as Korean financial regulators are also setting up stricter solvency rules for insurers, such as raising requirements on risk-based capital ratios. Moody's Ng said hybrid issuance is expected to be a key channel to replenish capital due to its more favourable regulatory treatment over subordinated debt. Hybrid coupon payments are also paid as dividends and do not have an earnings impact on insurers’ profit and loss statements, she said. Bankers said several Korean insurers were discussing the possibility of obtaining international credit ratings to access the more liquid global capital markets. A source working on the deal said Kyobo's transaction would be an attractive investment relative to bank Additional Tier 1 securities, since the deal will not be subject to domestic bank rules that restrict a bank from using annual profits for coupon payments. The 144A/Reg S securities are expected to be rated A3/A– (Moody's/Fitch). Kyobo's investor meetings in the US, Europe and Asia begin today until July 7.

He had just watched the Dodgers score five runs on four wild pitches in the seventh and eighth innings, a record implosion that lifted Los Angeles to a bizarre 12-6 win, its 10th victory in a row, and sent the Rockies to a frustrating fifth straight loss.  Things kind of unraveled,  Black said of the seventh inning, when the Dodgers scored three runs on consecutive wild pitches by reliever Adam Ottavino to take a 7-6 lead in a game they once trailed 5-0.  I've been around the game for 38 years, so I've probably seen something like this before. But I can't remember it.  You never know how a game is going to unfold. Was this a record?  It was historic. The two teams combined for eight wild pitches, the most in a game since 1913. The Dodgers became the first team to score five runs on wild pitches in a game since 1920. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DodgersColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchDodgers starter Brandon McCarthy threw three wild pitches in the second inning to help Colorado score three runs, and the Rockies led 5-0 after three. Los Angeles trailed 6-4 in the seventh before the game went weird. Justin Turner singled and Logan Forsythe doubled to put runners in scoring position with two outs. Rockies manager Bud Black went to Ottavino, who came in with a solid 3.08 ERA but walked Austin Barnes on a full-count pitch to load the bases.  I thought the full-count pitch was pretty good,  Black said. With Yasmani Grandal at the plate, Ottavino threw a hard cutter off the shin guard of catcher Tony Wolters, allowing Turner to score and make it a 6-5 game. The right-hander's next pitch broke hard in the same spot and bounced past Wolters all the way to the backstop, allowing Forsythe to score from third and Barnes to race home from second for a 7-6 lead. In the eighth, Ottavino threw two more wild pitches with runners on third, pushing the lead to 9-6. Los Angeles' Cody Bellinger hit a two-run home run, his second of the day and league-leading 24th of the season, and reliever Kenley Jansen followed with an RBI double to make it 12-6.  It's pretty crazy,  Bellinger said of the win.  We're clicking so well now that even if we trail by five runs, we think we can come back.  Jansen was asked to record a five-out save, coming in with an out in the eighth to hold what was then a one-run lead. The chance to hit and produce a double was just a bonus.  I really thought we could come back,  said Jansen, who earned his 17th save.  There are no surprises on this team.  The Dodgers have won 16 of their last 17 and are 24-6 since May 25. It was their 11th straight home win, and their 17th straight game with a home run, tying the L.A. franchise record set in 1970. Enrique Hernandez homered in addition to Bellinger's two bombs. The Brooklyn Dodgers hold the all-time record with a 24-game homer streak in 1953. The Dodgers have hit 41 home runs in their past 16 games. The Rockies' losing streak has been marked by pitching performances that went sour, from two starters allowing nine runs each, to Tyler Chatwood walking eight on Saturday, to Ottavino's late-game wildness.  This is a great test for us, to see where we are and what we need to do,  Black said.  The pitching has been pretty tough for us right now. We'll see the way we bounce back.  NOTES: Dodgers RHP Kenley Jansen made his 14th straight appearance without allowing a run. He issued his first walk of the season, after posting 51 strikeouts, a major league record for the start of a season. ... Dodgers SS Corey Seager sat out a second game after sustaining a mild right hamstring strain on Friday. The Dodgers will wait a few more days before deciding if they will put him on the 10-day disabled list. ... Los Angeles OF Franklin Gutierrez was placed on the DL with ankylosing spondylitis, an auto-immune condition that causes stiff joints. INF Mike Freeman was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... Rockies RF Carlos Gonzalez was out of the lineup for the third straight game because of a sore right shoulder sustained in the final game of the Arizona series.

While Roger Federer was winning a ninth Halle title on Sunday afternoon to mark himself out as favorite, fellow 35-year-old Lopez rounded off a magical week on the Queen's Club lawns by winning the Aegon Championships. Left-hander Lopez said he is playing the best tennis of his career and few would argue with that after victories against world number three Stan Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych, Grigor Dimitrov and finally Marin Cilic in the space of a week.  Considering the results of the best players in the world, it is true that it is probably the most open Wimbledon in the last 10 years, I will say,  Lopez said, referencing the struggles of Wimbledon champion and world number one Andy Murray and three-times winner Novak Djokovic.  Roger is playing great. He's not playing much, but when he's playing, he's winning. Novak and Andy, it's true that they are not playing their best, I will say, and Rafa (Nadal), he hasn't played on grass for a long time.  So it's probably a little bit more open.  Lopez, for all his elegant grasscourt skills and one of the most devilish serves in tennis, has only made three Wimbledon quarter-finals in 15 visits. After a thrilling Queen's final against Cilic in which he saved a match point before clinching a final set tiebreak 10-8, Lopez clearly believes his best Wimbledon run might still be ahead of him, possibly in the next few weeks. Tennis - Aegon Championships - Queen’s Club, London, Britain - June 25, 2017   Spain's Feliciano Lopez celebrates during the final against Croatia's Marin Cilic   Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien Tennis is a unique sport where anything can happen. From one day to the other, it can be so different,  Lopez, who will be ranked 25 on Monday and will be seeded at Wimbledon, said.  It is true that I'm going into Wimbledon with a lot of confidence. Probably this is the Wimbledon that I feel more confident going into it.  But next week, you know, the draw has to be done. And then I hope I can still play in the same way. Tennis is about sensations, feelings.  Winning here, it's the best preparation I can have. But on the other way, I think you can have a very tough draw from the very beginning.  Lopez is the first Spaniard to win Queen's since Nadal in 2008 after which the Mallorcan won Wimbledon. The 31-year-old Nadal will arrive this time having just claimed a 10th French Open but with no competitive grasscourt play, having pulled out of the Queen's Club event. Lopez warned against writing off his compatriot, though.  He didn't play one match on grass for such a long time. But with Rafa you never know, because he's capable of everything,  Lopez said.  But Roger, for sure, is the number one contender.  Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ian Ransom","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-london-lopez-idUSKBN19H05I"},

While board members stressed the need to discourage markets from speculating that a withdrawal of stimulus was near, they also showed little appetite for additional easing despite subdued inflation. With inflation distant from the BOJ's 2 percent target and likely to take time accelerating, the best approach would be to maintain the current ultra-loose policy, the board members were quoted as saying in the summary released on Monday.  The price stability target cannot be achieved easily within a short time-frame. It is crucial to maintain accommodative financial conditions and keep the economy expanding as long as possible,  one board member was quoted as saying.  It's necessary to continue with the current easy policy persistently and wait for a steady increase in demand and further falls in the unemployment rate to lead to higher wages, prices and inflation expectations,  another member said. Such comments align with a dominant market view that the BOJ will maintain a neutral policy stance, neither raising nor lowering interest rates for the time being, hoping that  improvements in the economy will gradually push up inflation. The BOJ kept monetary policy steady at the June meeting, and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months, signaling its confidence in an export-driven economic recovery that is gaining momentum. Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented the BOJ with a fresh communications challenge, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might dial back its stimulus - even though such a step remains a long way off. One board member said improvements in the economy, as well as the BOJ's expanding balance sheet, were partly behind growing market attention to when and how the BOJ may withdraw stimulus.  As the economy continues to improve, the BOJ needs to be accountable for its thinking on monetary policy to avoid raising concern among market participants,  the board member was quoted as saying.  The fundamental problem ... is that the timing of an exit cannot be foreseen as achievement of the price target is still considerably distant,  another board member said. After three years of heavy asset buying failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework last year to one better suited for a long-term battle to beat deflation. Despite growing signs of strength in the economy, inflation remains subdued as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-conscious consumers. Data due on Friday will likely show core consumer inflation hit 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, a Reuters poll found.

But while leading 6-1 in the first-to-seven final should make victory a near certainty, the Kiwis are not complacent.  We are not taking anything for granted,  New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling said on Sunday after coolly steering his space-age 50-foot (15 metre) catamaran to yet another win over the team's nemesis, Oracle Team USA's skipper Jimmy Spithill. It was Spithill and the team bankrolled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison who in 2013 turned an 8-1 deficit against New Zealand into a 9-8 victory and a successful defence of the oldest trophy in international sport. Burling, who at only 26 could also unseat Spithill as the youngest ever person to helm a winning America's Cup team, has exuded a disarming calm on and off the water. He won Olympic gold in Rio last year in the 49er skiff class with fellow crew member Blair Tuke and has brought a youthful confidence to New Zealand's campaign to regain the  Auld Mug , which was first won by the schooner  America  in 1851. If New Zealand triumph, many will put it down to the revolutionary  cycling  system developed to power the hydraulics needed to control the catamaran's foils, which lift it out of the water, and the vast  wing  sail which drives it along. Their  cyclors , including an Olympic cycling medallist, have kept their heads down throughout the contest, pedalling furiously to provide enough oil in the system to allow the boat to perform almost balletic pirouette manoeuvres on the water. Mind Over Matter But while the America's Cup is as much a design as a sailing race, with tens of millions of dollars invested in the racing boats, psychological games are also crucial. The charismatic Spithill has more expertise in match racing, the sailing equivalent of a boxing contest, and the benefit of nearly two decades of America's Cup experience. Even after losing two races on Sunday, Spithill was not in any mood to give up, conceding that the U.S. crew had been outsailed by Burling and his five Kiwi team mates, but vowing to come out fighting again on Monday and take one race at a time. None of this seems to have rattled Burling, despite a capsize in a semi-final race which nearly ended the Kiwi dream. If he can show the same composure on Monday, the man who has become the face of the New Zealand team could win himself a place in yachting history.

Rivera hit two home runs and made a key defensive play on a steal attempt, leading the Mets to an 8-2 victory and a three-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants. Right-hander Rafael Montero limited the Giants to one run in 5 2/3 innings for his second career win, helping the Mets record their second road sweep of the season and first in San Francisco since 2013.  We got here and we wanted to do something good,  said Rivera, whose club was swept in four straight by the Los Angeles Dodgers to start the week.  Coming here and sweeping San Francisco, that shows a lot about the chemistry and the demeanor of this team.  Rivera, who began the day with just three homers, smacked a two-run shot in the second inning and a solo blast in the fourth, both off Giants left-hander Matt Moore.  It was funny because (hitting coach Kevin Long) and I, we talked a couple of weeks ago that I never had had a home run (off) the same pitcher twice,  Rivera said of the 15th multiple-homer game by a Met this season.  Today was the day. I just wanted to help the team win and do something good.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at GiantsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchJay Bruce added a two-run homer in the eighth inning and Curtis Granderson a solo shot in the ninth, increasing New York's total of road home runs this season to a major-league-best 68. The four homers gave the Mets 46 in June, a franchise record for a single month. New York still has four games remaining in the month. The Mets' previous record for home runs in a month was 45, set initially in August 2015 and tied in August 2016. Montero (1-4), who was making his 15th career start, was supported by an error-free defense and a potential rally-killing play by Rivera while protecting a lead his teammates gave him in the top of the first inning. He allowed five hits and two walks in his 104-pitch outing in improving his career record to 2-9. Montero struck out a season-best seven.  I hope this is who you see from now on because his stuff's good enough,  Mets manager Terry Collins said of Montero, whose previous two outings had been in relief.  Hopefully this is a huge wake-up call that he can pitch in this league.  After the Giants scored on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Buster Posey to get within 3-1 in the third, Montero caught a break when Rivera threw out Hunter Pence trying to steal second base with San Francisco's leading home run hitter, Brandon Belt, at the plate with a full count. The out ended the inning, stranding Joe Panik at third base.  I didn't send him,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said before coming to Pence's defense.  We can't keep laying back. We've got to force the issue a little bit.  Five New York relievers picked up Montero with 3 1/3 innings of one-run, four-hit ball. Bruce and Rivera finished with three RBIs apiece for the Mets, who have hit 27 home runs in their past 14 games. Bruce, Rene Rivera, Granderson, Asdrubal Cabrera, Wilmer Flores, Lucas Duda and T.J. Rivera had two hits apiece for New York, which outhit the Giants 14-9. The Mets stranded 15 baserunners, the Giants eight. Moore (3-8) was pulled after 4 1/3 innings, having allowed five runs and seven hits. He walked two and struck out five. Denard Span and Pence had two hits apiece for the Giants, who lost their fifth in a row and 12th in their last 13 games. Posey drove in the two runs with a sacrifice fly and an infield out. Three of Posey's at-bats came with a total of eight runners on base. He popped out into a double play on the other occasion.  These are tough times. No getting around it,  Bochy said.  I've been around a long time. This is as tough as I've ever been around. The baseball gods are really testing this group. Enough is enough.

In the Tigers' dugout at Petco Park, manager Brad Ausmus discussed pinch-hitting switch hitter Andrew Romine against right-handed San Diego Padres closer Brandon Maurer.  But Mahtook had been swinging the bat pretty well, and righties seem to have a little more luck against Maurer at times,  Ausmus said.  So, we just kind of stuck with Mikie.  Good decision. Mahtook went the opposite way with a Maurer fastball and grounded a two-run single to right to give the Tigers a 7-5 victory that snapped an eight-game losing streak and ended what had been an 0-6 trip to the West Coast on a happy note.  It's a monkey off our back for sure,  Ausmus said after the Tigers won for only the fourth time in their past 17 games.  There's no question when you get a win, it releases some pressure. It's just one game. We dug a hole on this road trip, and we need to dig ourselves out of it. We've got some ground to catch up. This is one step.  The Padres entered Sunday looking to sweep their third home series since the end of May and extend their winning streak to four games. Then they jumped out to leads of 3-0 and 5-3 before faltering.  What hurt us was not cashing in on several other opportunities,  Padres manager Andy Green said. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at PadresDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchSan Diego failed to get a runner home from third with no outs while leading 3-0 in the second and from second and third with one out while leading 5-3 in the fourth.  We didn't hit in some runners-in-scoring-positions,  Green said.  I also thought there were a few balls we could have come up with today that we didn't,  referring most notably to Mahtook's triple to right center in the fourth that drove home Detroit's first run and led to a three-run inning. Two hitters later, James McCann lined a double just past the glove of third baseman Cory Spangenberg. And then there is the question of Maurer, who is a Jekyll-and-Hyde late-inning reliever. In save situations, he has converted 14 of 16 opportunities, although he has a 4.29 ERA. However, all seven of the runs he has allowed in save situations have come during his two blown saves. He has allowed only nine hits and two walks with 13 strikeouts in 14 2/3 innings in save situations. Non-save situations are a completely different matter. He is 0-3 with an 8.62 ERA. He has allowed 15 runs on 23 hits and five walks with 12 strikeouts in 15 2/3 innings.  When you look at the statistics, there is something to it,  Green said.  But he's pitched remarkably well in save situations.  Maurer has converted nine straight save opportunities while allowing one hit and one walk over nine innings. Ian Kinsler opened the ninth with a double off Maurer (0-4). Former Padre Justin Upton drew a one-out walk, and both runners advanced when J.D. Martinez was retired on a topped ball in front of the plate. Mahtook then singled past Padres second baseman Carlos Asuaje. Right-hander Bruce Rondon (1-1) was credited with the win after pitching a scoreless eighth inning, and Justin Wilson earned his sixth save. Neither starting pitcher was exceptionally sharp nor around for the decision. Padres left-hander Clayton Richard couldn't hold a pair of multi-run leads, allowing five runs on nine hits and two walks with three strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings. Detroit right-hander Jordan Zimmermann allowed five runs on six hits and three walks with five strikeouts in four innings.  I knew going into the game this wasn't the best matchup for Clayton,  Green said.  The long ball kind of hurt Jordan,  Ausmus said.  It was not as good a start as we've seen recently.  The Padres took a 3-0 lead in the first two innings, but the Tigers tied the score with three runs in the top of the fourth. Wil Myers drove the first pitch he saw from Zimmermann 412 feet into the second deck in left field for his 15th homer to give the Padres a 1-0 lead in the first. Erick Aybar then opened the second with his sixth homer, a 389-foot drive to right. The Padres added a second run in the inning before anyone was out when Hunter Renfroe singled, moved to second on a passed ball and scored on Matt Szczur's triple to right-center. With Szczur on third and no outs, the Padres had a golden opportunity to extend the lead, but Zimmermann struck out the next three hitters. Upton opened the Tigers' fourth with his second double of the game. With one out, Mahtook tripled to right-center just beyond the dive of center fielder Szczur to score Upton. Mahtook scored on McCann's two-out double past the dive of Spangenberg. Jose Iglesias followed with a game-tying single with the pitcher's spot up next. The Padres scored twice in the bottom of the inning, which opened with a single by Aybar and a walk by Renfroe. Aybar moved to third on a flyout to center and scored on a suicide squeeze by Richard -- the Padres' second successful suicide squeeze in as many games. Renfroe scored on a ground-rule double to left by Jose Pirela. But Zimmermann again ducked further damage, stranding two runners in scoring position with one out. The Tigers again drew even in the top of the sixth when Nicholas Castellanos hit his ninth homer of the season following an inning-opening single by Martinez. Castellanos' opposite-field drive to right carried 395 feet. NOTES: 1B Miguel Cabrera hit second in the Tigers' batting order Sunday for the first time this season. He went 1-for-5. ... The Tigers hope to have Victor Martinez back Wednesday. The designated hitter has been on the 10-day disabled list with an irregular heartbeat. He is scheduled to take batting practice Tuesday. ...

Ryu, who carded a course-record 61 on Saturday to open a five-stroke lead, finished two shots ahead of countrywoman Amy Yang and Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn. Ranked third in the world, Ryu is projected to supplant No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn for the top spot when Monday's rankings are released. Ariya did not compete in the event. Ryu finished at a tournament-record 18-under 195 for her fifth career victory. She also won at the ANA Inspiration in April for her second major title. The only misstep for Ryu in the final round was a bogey at No. 11, allowing the fast-closing Yang to get within two shots. However, Ryu birdied the next hole to double her lead and coasted to the victory. Ryu admitted having such a sizable lead entering the day made her  nervous  but said a birdie on the par-three third hole calmed her down.  To be honest, compared to the last two days, today wasn't a really great game so I had to really keep myself to, 'OK, don't comparing to any other rounds, just keep focused’,” Ryu said.  Yesterday my (sports) psychologist said don't try to be perfect, so I think that was really key word on the golf course today.  Yang had eight birdies, an eagle and three bogeys in her round of 64 while Moriya closed with a 66, capping it with a birdie-eagle finish.  I get a lot of confidence from this week and hopefully keep playing solid and finish in another good week,  said Moriya, who posted her fourth straight top-10 finish. Michelle Wie matched Yang with a final-round 64 to finish in a tie for fourth place with American Stacy Lewis (69) at 13-under 200.

Owings worked Ramos for a walk in a 12-pitch at-bat after Paul Goldschmidt singled with two outs in the 11th inning, and Descalso followed with a ground single to right field to give the Diamondbacks a 2-1 walk-off victory over the Phillies on Sunday at Chase Field.  He is trying to put 'CO' away with two strikes and try to make his best pitches and 'CO' keeps fouling them off. I'm sure the pitcher is frustrated at that point,  Descalso said.  'CO' did a great job of battling there to get us into a spot where we had a runner in scoring position.  Descalso and Goldschmidt had two hits apiece as the D-backs (48-28) moved 20 games over .500 for the first time this season and extended their best start in franchise history. They have won 14 of their last 17 games and are two games ahead of the pace set by the 2001 team. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at DiamondbacksPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch Just trying to have a good at-bat,  Owings said.  Ever since the season started, you just have that vibe in the dugout where something good is going to happen. Whoever is up there, a lot of confidence in who is at the dish.  Left-hander T.J. McFarland (4-1) pitched the 11th for the victory, giving up a one-out walk before getting out of the inning with a double play. Handyman Descalso, who made his fifth start at third base Sunday, also has started at second base, first base and left field this season.  He is always able to manage the moment, manage the at-bat,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  He's always engaged in what he has to do. He's had big at-bats on big platforms for many years. You can always count on getting his best effort.  Right fielder Aaron Altherr had three of the Phillies' nine hits and catcher Andrew Knapp had two. Philadelphia (24-50) has lost 15 of 18 entering Monday's final game of the four-game wraparound series. The Phillies have the worst record and the worst road record (10-30) in the majors.  Once again not enough offense,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  We have to put some crooked numbers up there and we haven't been doing it. We have had our spurts, but the key to success at any leve,l but especially at this level, is consistency.  Arizona starter Randall Delgado gave up four hits and a walk in five scoreless innings, striking out four. Philadelphia starter Jeremy Hellickson gave up one run and three hits in six innings in his first start at Chase Field since spending 2015 with Arizona. The Diamondbacks broke a scoreless tied in the fourth inning when Nick Ahmed doubled into the left-field corner and Goldschmidt singled between third base and shortstop for a 1-0 lead. Goldschmidt leads the majors with 65 RBIs. Philadelphia tied the game in the seventh inning after Odubel Herrera beat out an infield single to second base with one out to start the rally. Knapp singled and Ty Kelly hit into a force-out at second base before Howie Kendrick's looping single over first base tied the game at 1. Kendrick is a career .441 hitter at Chase Field in 68 plate appearances.

Saunders, who had a career-high 24 homers with Toronto last season, was hitting .205 with six homers this season. ...

Brent crude futures were up 24 cents, or 0.53 percent, at $45.78 per barrel at 0047 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 21 cents, or 0.49 percent, at $43.22 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index stayed low on Monday against a basket of currencies amid fading expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year. A weaker dollar also makes oil cheaper for countries using other currencies.  Commodities stabilised after a turbulent week where most sectors suffered large falls,  ANZ bank said in a note.  A slightly weaker U.S. dollar also helped improve investor appetite.  Although oil prices have bounced back from 10-month lows, they are still down about 13 percent since late May, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers agreed to extend a deal to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next March. But crude supplies in the United States, which is not part of the OPEC-led deal, have been dampening the impact of curbs. U.S. energy firms added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2014, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc. RIG-OL-USA-BHI. Amid the rise in U.S. drilling activity, money managers cut net long U.S. crude futures and options holdings to their smallest long position since November.

Liriano pitched six-plus sharp innings, Bautista drove in four runs and the Toronto Blue Jays whipped the Kansas City Royals 8-2 on Sunday afternoon. Closer Roberto Osuna, who did not pitch on Friday because of anxiety issues, worked the ninth. He gave up a single and struck out three in one scoreless inning, although it was not a save situation.  It's slowly getting better, but I'm getting better, so that's a good thing for me,  Osuna said. With Osuna unavailable Friday, the Toronto bullpen yielded a four-run ninth. None of the Blue Jays' three relievers allowed a run Sunday. Liriano (4-3) picked up first victory since June 2 and only his second since April 29. Liriano is 100-95 since breaking into the majors in 2005 with Minnesota.  It means a lot to me,  Liriano said of reaching 100.  I feel like I had to battle through a lot and go through a lot of stuff and being injured a lot, but things happen for a reason. I'm just thankful and very happy.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RoyalsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchHe stymied the Royals on six hits and two runs. He was pulled in the seventh after Salvador Perez started the inning with a double and Cheslor Cuthbert walked. Danny Barnes replaced Liriano and retired the next three Royals on fly balls to end the threat. Bautista is hitting .381 with four walks in five games since moving to the top of the Blue Jays' order.  Generally he's always a high-on-base guy,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  He gets on base and draws a lot of walks, and he's dangerous when he's hitting. He had a nice, big day today, which we needed. You know what, he strikes fear into pitchers. A lot of times what happens in baseball, even the good starters, that first inning can be a little rocky.  The Blue Jays snapped a 2-2 tie with a five-run sixth inning on two hits, three walks and a Cuthbert error. Josh Donaldson's double off Peter Moylan plated Bautista and Steve Pierce. Moylan had walked Bautista with the based loaded for the first run of the inning. Rookie left-hander Scott Alexander (0-2) started the inning by giving up a pinch-single to Darwin Barney and walking the next two batters before Moylan replaced him. Bautista homered with Ryan Goins aboard in the fifth to tie the score at 2. Bautista got the green light on a 3-0 Jason Hammel pitch and hammered it an estimated 450 feet to the left-field grass. Bautista's seventh-inning single off Neftali Feliz, who was making his Royals debut, scored Kevin Pillar. Hammel was pulled after five innings, allowing two runs, five hits and three walks while striking out six. He threw 105 pitches.  A very small strike zone today contributed to him getting his pitch count up,  Royals manager Ned Yost said. The Royals were unanimous in their belief that plate umpire John Tumpane had a strike zone not much larger than a postage stamp.  It was definitely small,  Hammel said.  For what we did in the bottom of the zone execution-wise, I think we should have been rewarded a little bit more. It's tough when in big situations when you make a pitch and it's not called a strike, it can change the outcome big time.  Moylan thought he threw a strike to Bautista before walking him with the bases full. He had words for Tumpane. After he was pulled, Moylan had additional words for the umpire and was ejected.  I don't usually get emotional out there, but I just sort of had enough,  Moylan said.  I don't want to say there's no accountability, but I go out there and I'm trying to get Scotty out of a situation and I think I can do my job. That sort of call changes sort of my mindset. I've got to do a better job of locking back in and not walking him.  Hammel kept the Blue Jays off the board until the fifth inning but required 64 pitches to navigate through the first three innings. He gave up a double to Russell Martin in the first. He walked Troy Tulowitzki and yielded a single to Pillar in the second. In a 24-pitch third inning, Donaldson walked and Justin Smoak singled with two outs. The Blue Jays, who lost the first two games of this series, have not been swept in Kansas City since 1993. NOTES: Royals LHP Danny Duffy, who went on the disabled list May 29 with a strained oblique, made his initial minor league rehab start Saturday night. He threw 48 pitches in 2 2/3 innings for Triple-A Omaha, giving up two runs and two hits, including a home run to the last batter he faced. ... The Blue Jays and Royals are both idle Monday. Toronto returns home Tuesday to play Baltimore. RHP Kevin Gausman and Orioles RHP Joe Biagini are the Tuesday probables at Rogers Centre. The Royals will start rookie LHP Matt Strahm on Tuesday at Detroit. The Tigers will counter with RHP Justin Verlander.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED6P4IBCST"},

In a finale that would have done Woods proud, Spieth sank his 60-foot sand shot at the first extra hole for birdie to edge fellow American Daniel Berger at TPC River Highlands. The precise execution enabled Spieth to overcome a back nine meltdown in which he putted poorly and almost allowed fast-finishing Berger to steal victory. Spieth carded a closing 70 to Berger’s 67, the pair finishing at 12-under-par 268, two strokes ahead of compatriot Charley Hoffman and New Zealander Danny Lee. “For the bunker shot to go in, that was awesome. I don’t know if I’ll ever have a moment like that again,” an excited Spieth said in a greenside interview after clinching his 10th victory at the age of 23 years, 10 months and 29 days. Woods was the youngest since detailed records began in 1983 to reach 10 victories. He was 23 years, six months and four days when he posted the milestone. A flair for the dramatic is nothing new for Spieth, who also holed a bunker shot for his first victory at the 2013 John Deere Classic.

To live for these moments and produce moments like that, I feel very lucky, very blessed.” Slideshow (5 Images)The former world number one did not feel so blessed after missing two putts from inside four feet on the back nine to almost fritter away what had looked like being a comfortable victory.

I felt more comfortable in the bunker than from four feet (and) I got really lucky to hit the tree and have it go in the fairway.  The playoff loss deprived 24-year-old Berger of a second victory in three starts, having won the St. Jude Classic two weeks ago. “I played great today so I’m not going to be too upset,” said Berger, who sportingly gave Spieth a thumbs-up gesture when his rival holed the winning bunker shot.  “It’s just Jordan doing Jordan things.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ken Ferris / Ian Ransom","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-travelers-idUSKBN19G0YI"},

Coleman, beaten by Olympic silver medallist Justin Gatlin in the 100 metres on Friday, was pipped by 0.01 seconds by Webb who closed quickly to win in 20.09 seconds.  It's been a long weekend,  said Coleman, the year's fastest man at 9.82 seconds in the 100 metres.  I felt my legs tighten up near the end, but no excuses.  It was a pretty successful week, qualifying for the team in two events.  Co-favorite Noah Lyles's world championship hopes ended when he withdrew from the semi-finals with a hamstring strain. Upsets also struck in the men's 110m hurdles and women's 200 on the final day of the selection meet for August's world championships in London. Former American indoor champion Aleec Harris surprised world record holder Aries Merritt in the hurdles, running 13.24 to Merritt's 13.31.  We were running into a headwind, and that’s tough for a guy who only weighs 160 pounds,  Merritt said.  I haven’t done any speed work yet and I’m running really fast. I’m excited about what’s to come this summer.  Collegian Deajah Stevens took down Olympic bronze medallist Tori Bowie in the women's 200, also run into a headwind. Stevens won in 22.30 seconds, followed by Kimberlyn Duncan (22.59) and Bowie (22.60), all making the U.S. team.

There are so many great American sprinters, it is great competition running with them.”  Olympic gold medallists Dalilah Muhammad and Ryan Crouser provided the brightest moments for established athletes, both claiming 2017's bests. Muhammad won perhaps the most impressive women's 400 metres hurdles race ever,  blazing 52.64 seconds as three women dipped under 53 seconds in the same race for the first time in history.  I am feeling amazing,  said Muhammad. Slideshow (7 Images)Only five women have run faster. Shamier Little (52.75 and Kori Carter (52.95) trailed Muhammad as six women ran 53.82 or faster, another first. Crouser delivered the longest shot put in 14 years, 22.65 metres, on his last attempt.    I came in a little more rested than usual, so there was a lot of power there,  said Crouser, now seventh best on the all-time list. The toss came moments after reigning world champion Joe Kovacs had unleashed a throw of 22.35 metres for the lead. Crouser and Kovacs will be joined on the U.S. world championships team by former U.S. champion Ryan Whiting (21.54). Olympic silver medallist Sandi Morris claimed the women's pole vault at 4.80 metres as she outdueled London gold medallist Jenn Suhr (4.65m).

I am so excited,  Harvick said.  I think as you look at it, getting our first win with Ford, this has been a great journey for us as an organization and team. Kurt (Busch) winning the Daytona 500 and we have run well. Everybody from Bush, Jimmy John's and Mobil 1, Outback, Hunt Brothers and everybody. It is a great day. It finally all came together and we were able to not have any cautions there at the end.  Rodney had great strategy and I was able to take care of the car and get out front. I felt like the 78 (Martin Truex Jr.) was the car we had to race, and then, he had problems and from there, we were in control.  The win also was his first win on the road course. The race ended under the checkered and yellow flags after Kasey Kahne crashed on the final lap. Harvick took the race lead from Kyle Busch with just under 45 laps remaining and then losing it to Truex a lap later. But when the field began cycling through green-flag pit stops in the last 40 laps, Harvick cycled ahead of Truex. Truex lost a cylinder and retired from the race with engine problems inside the final 25 laps.  It's very disappointing,  Truex said.  I mean, sitting there running second on seven cylinders and stayed right with the leader. I mean, this Toyota was so good today. Everyone at Furniture Row (Racing) did an awesome job with it. Everybody back in Denver, thank you for guys for just crazy fast cars. TRD (Toyota Racing Development) stuff has been really good for the past year and a half. You know sometimes these things happen, so appreciate all their effort out there at TRD. Make good power, it's just this one wasn't ready to go the whole distance today.  Brad Keselowski stayed out longer and still needed to make one final pit stop when he lost the lead to Harvick with 22 laps remaining. Keselowski finally pitted inside the final 20 laps. By that time, Denny Hamlin was a distant second to Harvick and Clint Bowyer third. Bowyer got by Hamlin to take second inside the final five laps and give Stewart-Haas Racing a one-two finish, with Harvick still holding a sizable lead.  We were fast all weekend,  Bowyer said.  With clean air and a long run, that's always my strong suit. We got the long run, we just hard to start dead last to get it.  Keselowski got by Hamlin on the final lap to finish third for his first career top-five Sonoma finish. Hamlin and Kyle Busch rounded out the top five.  The Freightliner Ford was really good today,  Keselowski said.  We didn't have the qualifying fun we wanted. We had amazing race pace. That's a credit to everyone at Team Penske. It felt really good. I just wish I could run this race again I think I might have had better car than driver today and I learned a lot. Just an amazing fun day.  Hamlin led early in the final third stage of the race that made up the last 60 laps of the 110-lap race when he stayed out after Jimmy Johnson gave up the lead to pit between the second and third stages.  It was good, definitely had a great car,  Hamlin said.  We didn't have quite enough at the end. We did have real short run speed. We didn't' really have great long run speed. We had just had good middle speed and that worked out for us. We had good pit strategy and really passed a lot of cars today and that's about what we had.  Johnson claimed his first stage win of the season by running up front at lap 50, the end of the second 25-lap stage. Keselowski and Matt Kenseth were second and third at the end of the stage. Truex led the way early in the second stage but gave up the lead to pit during a debris caution on lap 39. When Truex hit pit road, Johnson inherited the lead. Truex lost several more positions with a slow stop, in addition to the varying pit strategies. Several drivers pitted before pit road closed in the final laps of the second stage. The move didn't pay off for Bowyer, though, as he was nabbed for speeding on pit road. Truex won the opening 25-lap stage, followed by A.J. Allmendinger and Kyle Larson in second and third. It was Truex's 11th stage win of the 2017 season so far. Truex passed pole-sitter Larson for the lead on lap 10. After losing the lead, Larson ran off track, giving up second to Allmendinger. The top three were shuffled outside the top 10, though, when the yellow flag waved for the first time on lap 15 for an incident involving Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Danica Patrick that resulted in slight damage to Larson's car. Larson, Earnhardt and Patrick also were players in a second incident that brought out the third caution on lap 31 and ended the race for Ricky Stenhouse Jr., the other driver involved.  They were three-wide in front of us trying to go through turn four, which never works,  Stenhouse said.  They were all dive-bombing each other and then the 10 (Patrick) got spinning and I tried to go low and she just kept coming down the track. We just clipped it a little bit and tore the left front up too bad to continue. It is a bummer for our day. We felt like we had probably a decent Sonoma car for us. Really just wanted to get out there and make laps. I thought we were decent on the long run, just trying to get there.  NOTES: The race was the first in stages for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series on a road course. ... Matt Kenneth had to start in the back because of an engine change. Alon Day also started in the back after missing driver introductions. ... Erik Jones and Chase Elliott started the race in backup cars because of wrecks in practice. They started where they qualified, because they had already gone to backups by qualifying. ... Kevin Harvick won the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West race at Sonoma on Saturday. ... Kyle Larson's pole at Sonoma was his third pole of the season but marked the fifth time this year he started first. He started first in two other races by virtue of being the points leader when rain forced cancellations of qualifying. ...

Death keeps no calendar, and Ansatullah knows no time!  But a few hours later, on that same October morning last year, a second SMS pinged - one he could not ignore.  Say 'yes' to Rampal (a proposed coal-fured power plant) otherwise you will be hacked to death incredibly by us!  Reporting the threats to police, Muhammad learned that Ansatullah was probably a mistype and referred to Ansharulla or Ansar al Islam, an Islamic extremist group linked to al Quaeda. The group, implicated in a series of brutal attacks and murders against atheist and gay rights bloggers, had also claimed the murder of a Bangladeshi sociology lecturer in 2014. Now they seemed to have 60-year-old Muhammad in their sights for his role leading a seven-year campaign against plans to build a $1.5 billion coal-fired power plant in Rampal, southern Bangladesh, on a site teeming with waterways, mud flats and a host of threatened species from crocodiles to pythons. The protests have turned nasty with at least 20 protesters injured in January and five detained when police launched tear gas and water cannons against anti Rampal protesters. Activists fear the plant, a joint venture between Indian and Bangladeshi state-run power corporations, will destroy the Sundarbans, one of the world's largest mangrove forests and a UNESCO World Heritage site home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger and rare Irrawaddy dolphins. Muhammad - author of more than 30 books - says the mangrove forest is extraordinarily rich in flora and fauna and key to the livelihoods of millions of people. Air Pollution  This has also been a huge natural safeguard against frequent cyclone, storm and other natural disasters in the country,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The lives and properties of up to four million people who live on it will be threatened if there is no Sundarban.  Scheduled to open in 2021, the plant is expected to burn about five million tonnes of coal each year, pumping out carbon and sulphur dioxide emissions in the process. Despite local opposition and calls from the United Nations for the plant to be re-located, the government is pushing ahead, saying Bangladesh needs huge amounts of electricity to develop. Currently, just two percent of power is generated using coal while natural gas reserves are dwindling. Anwarul Azim, a spokesman for the joint venture company, the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company Ltd, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it was  unlikely to harm the Sundarbans  because the plant will be 14 km away from the outer edge of the forest and 69 km from the UNESCO heritage site.  As a result, the scanty amount of exhaust from the power plant won't be any cause for harm to the Sundarbans,  he said. He said stringent environmental standards had been approved by the Department of Environment and were compatible with World Bank and International Finance Corporation criteria. Muhammad, however, fears an environmental  disaster . Dangerous Liaisons Speaking in his Dhaka home, the economist said he is only too aware of the personal risk he runs in opposing a multi-billion dollar government project, particularly one that is championed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  We need to take this risk,  Muhammad said.  By destroying a natural huge forest, power and other commercial enterprises reflect a blind development paradigm that puts profit before people and environment.  When committee activists investigated the death threats against him, they told Muhammad the telephone belonged to a member of the Awami Olama League, an Islamist arm of the ruling Awami League. The phone owner denied sending the threats. Muhammad says he has no intention of giving up. Over two decades, the professor and his campaign group - the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas Mineral Resources, Power and Ports - have questioned the role of several multinational resource companies in Bangladesh and their relationships with local partners, government contractors and politicians. In 2006, they helped scupper a British company's attempt to establish an open coal mine in northwestern Dinajpur district. The company abandoned the project but four lives were lost in the battle to clear farmland. Muhammad was also integral to a 2007 campaign that quashed multi-billion dollar energy investment plans by the Tata Group. A year later, when a military-backed caretaker regime was in power in Bangladesh, the professor was threatened with death if he did not stop appearing on television. In 2009, he was injured when a public rally against an oil exploration project in the Bay of Bengal turned violent. Network of Activism Erin Kilbride, from the human rights campaign group Front Line Defenders, said governments, companies and armed groups target activists like Muhammad because their deaths not only affect families and friends but disrupt whole activism networks.  In Bangladesh, for example, following the murders of bloggers and LGBT activists, we documented a sharp decline in advocacy for indigenous peoples, land, and environmental rights as well,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Muhammad says that deaths in state or police custody are not uncommon in Bangladesh and reflect the breakdown of law and order and legal institutions. He said the lack of a free media made things even harder with little public awareness about issues like Rampal. But Muhammad takes heart from the fact that the campaign against the Rampal has linked like-minded activists worldwide, allowing them to share information and support each other. In January this year, supporters of the Sundarbans joined forces in more than 20 countries, from as far afield as Germany to South Korea, in a Global Day of Protest against the plant. However the economist says his greatest fear now is the Sundarbans might lose their UNESCO listing, conferred in 1997, with a meeting next month to consider the heritage status.  If we say yes to the largest, coastal mangrove forest in the world then we must say 'no' to commercial projects harmful for its survival,  he said.  There are many ways to increase the country's GDP but there is no way to reproduce the Sundarbans.

The decision came at a special meeting of the air-bag maker's board, public broadcaster NHK said. The Nikkei business daily also reported the decision to file in Japan, without citing its sources. Takata's U.S. arm filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion, a court filing showed. The firm would file a similar procedure in Japan in the coming hours, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The filings would open the door to a financial rescue from U.S.-based auto parts supplier Key Safety Systems, which Takata has tapped as its preferred financial sponsor as it must keep churning out millions of replacement air-bag inflators. It also faces billions in lawsuits and recall-related costs to its clients, including Honda Motor Co, BMW , Toyota Motor Corp and others which have been paying recall costs to date. Faulty air-bag inflators made by the 84-year-old Japanese company have been linked to at least 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries around the world. The ammonium nitrate compound used in the airbags can become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the safety devices to explode. Global transport authorities have ordered about 100 million inflators to be recalled, a process that has dragged on for nearly a decade. Industry sources have said that recall costs could climb to about $10 billion. Costs so far have pushed the company into the red for the past three years, and it has been forced to sell subsidiaries to pay fines and other liabilities. As a result, the company has seen its liabilities shoot up to 397.8 billion yen as of March, while it posted 30 billion yen in net assets, down sharply from about 160 billion yen five years ago. Industry sources say Takata would be able to complete the current global recall under bankruptcy, but could face problems if further recalls are required down the line. It has sought help from rival suppliers including Sweden's Autoliv Inc to produce replacement inflators. It also faces potential liabilities stemming from class action lawsuits in the United States, Canada and other countries. Earlier this year, Takata pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of falsifying data on its inflator defects, agreeing to pay a $1 billion fine. Founded as a textiles company in 1933, Takata began producing airbags in 1987 and at its peak became the world's No. 2 producer of the safety products. It also produces one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally, along with childseats, steering wheel systems and other components. CEO and Chairman Shigehisa Takada, the bookish grandson of the company's founder, has been criticised for his handling of the recall crisis. He has promised to resign after a new management team takes over. $1 = 111.2100 yen Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu in Tokyo, Additional reporting by David Shepardson on Washington D.C.; Editing by William Mallard and Stephen Coates","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/takata-bankruptcy-japan-idUSL3N1JM0HA"},

But playing away from home just got a little sunnier. Yonder Alonso and Khris Davis drove in runs in the eighth inning as the A's rallied for a 5-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox to complete a three-game sweep Sunday.  It's no secret we struggle on the road,  starting pitcher Sonny Gray said.  It was a nice series for us.  The A's swept a three-game series at Guaranteed Rate Field for the first time since July 2005. They also won their first road series since April 10-13 at Kansas City.  The road's been a serious problem for us, so guys will feel good about that,  A's manager Bob Melvin said. Adam Rosales and Matt Joyce homered for two insurance runs in the ninth -- the fourth time this season Oakland has hit back-to-back home runs. The A's totaled eight home runs in the series. Joyce hit his 10th of the season and Rosales hit his fourth. Oakland improved to 12-25 away from home and recorded its first road sweep since September. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at White SoxOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch We needed it,  Rosales said about the series victory. Melky Cabrera homered in the ninth for the White Sox, who have lost six of seven. A's closer Santiago Casilla allowed the home run before earning his 13th save in 16 chances. Gray (3-3) limited the White Sox to two runs (one earned) and four hits in seven innings for his first road victory since July 26, 2016, against Texas. White Sox starter Derek Holland gave up a run, struck out six and walked two in six innings. He exited after allowing a leadoff single in the seventh. In four previous June starts, Holland was 1-3, allowing 22 runs in 15 2/3 innings.  I'm pretty happy with the way most of (my starts) have been this year,  Holland said.  I feel like I've done a good job of getting those quality starts as much as I can, but the thing is I need to go longer. I should be getting into the seventh and not having 110 pitches.  The A's went ahead with three singles and an error in the eighth. Alonso's single off David Robertson dropped into left field and gave Oakland the lead after Davis' single off Tommy Kahnle (0-2) tied the game. The A's began the rally with a leadoff single and an error by third baseman Matt Davidson.  Our bullpen's doing a great, it really is,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  You can't take away from what they've been doing for us all year long. We've been going to them a lot. Hopefully what's not lost is Holland's outing today was really, really good.  Chicago's Adam Engel hit his first career home run, a solo shot with two outs in the third inning.  I actually had some friends and family in town, so hitting it is just one of those things where you just kind of smile and you are happy that your friends and family are here to watch it,  Engel said. Jose Abreu doubled, advanced on a flyout and scored on a passed ball for a 2-0 Chicago lead in the fourth. Jed Lowrie's pinch-hit, two-out RBI double cut the lead to one in the seventh. Rosales advanced from first but held up at third on Lowrie's hit. Rajai Davis struck out looking to end the inning. The White Sox's Alen Hanson doubled, advanced on a grounder and tried to score when the ball got away from catcher Josh Phegley in the first. Gray tagged out Hanson on his headfirst slide.  Sonny's an athlete,  Melvin said.  You know he's going to be in position to make the play. (Phegley) got rid of it pretty good. It's one thing about Sonny -- we don't worry about bunts too much. There are a lot of things he takes care of on the mound. It's like having another infielder on the mound.  NOTES: White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (left biceps bursitis) will make his season debut this week in Chicago, but the team has yet to decide on a date, manager Rick Renteria said. Chicago has  TBA  listed as Wednesday's starter against the Yankees. Rodon last pitched Friday in a rehab outing with Triple-A Charlotte. ... White Sox RHP Chris Beck exited after a comebacker struck his left leg in the ninth. He has a bruised left hamstring and is day to day. ... A's INF Jed Lowrie might not see a doctor after all on Monday after he missed Saturday's game due to straining his knee, manager Bob Melvin said. Lowrie had a pinch-hit double in the seventh before he was replaced by a pinch runner Sunday. ... Oakland 3B Matt Chapman is expected to be released from the hospital Sunday after receiving treatment for an infection in his knee, Melvin said. Chapman went on the DL retroactive to June 19 for left knee cellulitis. He is eligible to be reinstated Thursday. ... INF Franklin Barreto hit second in the Oakland lineup on Sunday, one day after he homered batting seventh in his major league debut. Melvin said the move was made to stagger left-handed batters in the lineup against LHP Derek Holland. ...

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 miles per hour (85 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Dora is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday,  said the NHC. The NHC warned of possible heavy rains along the southwestern coast of Mexico but added that the center of the storm is expected to move parallel to but remain offshore of the coast of Mexico. It said no coastal watches or warnings are in effect. Dora is moving toward the west-northwest at around 14 mph (22 kmh), and this general motion is expected to continue over the next 48 hours. It is expected to produce rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches along coastal sections of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoacan through Monday, said the NHC.

In the most closely watched contest, the northern port city of Genoa - a traditional left-wing stronghold - seemed certain to pass to the center-right for the first time in more than 50 years. The candidate backed by the anti-immigrant Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party will get around 54 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for the candidate backed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), according to final projections based on the vote count. The elections are a setback for PD leader and former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who took a back seat in campaigning after seeing his party roiled by internal divisions this year.  The wind is blowing for the center-right from the north to the center to the south, this is an extraordinary victory,  said Renato Brunetta, the lower house leader of Forza Italia. Around 4.3 million people were eligible to vote in 110 municipalities that were up for grabs after no candidate won more than 50 percent in the June 11 first-round election. Although Sunday's vote was one of the last before the general election, local factors mean it may not provide a clear reflection of parties' national popularity. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is Italy's most popular party nationwide according to some opinion polls, performed very badly in the first round and only made the run-off in one of the 25 largest cities. The turnout was also very low, at around 47 percent. Pd Problems Nevertheless, Sunday's result could serve as a call for unity among the center-right parties, which are in competition at the national level. Their strong showing suggests if the parties can unite under a single leader they would be a force to be reckoned with at the general election. That must be held by May 2018 but the broad coalition backing Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni is fragile and political analysts say an early vote this autumn cannot be ruled out.   We have clearly lost these elections,  said the PD's lower house leader Ettore Rosato. Around 10 provincial capitals held by the center-left going into the elections looked set to pass to the center-right. Genoa is the latest of a string of recent defeats in the PD's traditional strongholds. Last year it lost Turin, Italy's third-largest city, and the capital Rome, to 5-Star. The partial count on Sunday also put the center-right ahead in the northern cities of Verona, Como, Piacenza, Monza and Pistoia and in Catanzaro in the south.  It also seemed sure to win in the central city of L'Aquila, another recently center-left stronghold where the center-left candidate had led after the first round. The PD seemed set to score significant successes in Taranto in the south and Padua in the north. The northern city of Parma went to the incumbent mayor who was elected as 5-Star's first ever mayor in 2012 but ran as an independent after falling out with the movement's leadership. 5-Star, which was only founded nine years ago, looked set to add eight mayors to its modest national tally, including a victory in the Tuscan city of Carrara.

Standing with his right arm wrapped up, Matt Bush also savored his moment after enduring his toughest stretch closing out games. Robinson slugged a home run in the top of the fourth inning and Bush struck out Gary Sanchez with Aaron Judge on first base in the ninth as Texas held on for a 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday after bolting to a seven-run lead. Robinson appeared in his second major league game after joining the Rangers on Saturday and produced his first two hits. His first hit was a homer into the Yankees' bullpen beyond the right-center field wall as Texas led 7-0.  You can't really put it into words yet, but a lot of work went into that moment for me,  Robinson said. Gradually the lead eroded as the Yankees chipped away, first with four runs against Nick Martinez (3-3) on a single by Judge and a three-run homer by Sanchez in the fifth. Then it became a one-run game in the seventh on a solo homer by Ronald Torreyes off Jose Leclerc and a RBI single by Didi Gregorius off Alex Claudio. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at YankeesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchThe lead could have been completely erased. Before Gregorius' single, he nearly hit a three-run homer, missing it by a few feet down the right-field line. The rally ended with Gregorius' single because right fielder Shin-Soo Choo threw out Sanchez, who tried to reach third from first base. Enter Bush, whose last two outings saw him blow two saves and allow four earned runs. One was a game-tying homer to Brett Gardner on Friday, but this time Bush struck out the left fielder. After getting Austin Romine, he had Judge down to the last strike but gave up a single.  It's Yankee Stadium,  Bush said.  You know where you are. You know the situation. Just trying to breathe, just let it go, trust in my ability and what got me here. That's it.  After a brief consultation with manager Jeff Banister, Bush needed five pitches to retire Sanchez on a 1-2 curveball in the dirt and convert his ninth save in 13 opportunities.  That was a big-boy save,  Banister said. Before Robinson's first homer and Bush's  big-boy save,  the Rangers jumped to a 3-0 lead through the first inning and a 6-0 lead through two innings. Elvis Andrus started with an RBI single and Adrian Beltre followed with a two-run homer against Michael Pineda (7-4). Choo then slugged a three-run shot about halfway into the second deck in right and the Rangers seemingly were on their way to easily winning for the 11th time in 16 games. While the Yankees nearly came back, their two-week slump continued. When Sanchez struck out, the Yankees fell to 2-10 in their last 12 games, with seven of those defeats coming by three runs or less. Compounding matters for New York were a few more injuries. The Yankees lost Aaron Hicks to a ribcage injury in the fourth inning and he likely is headed to the disabled list. New York also played without Starlin Castro, who had a shot in his right wrist on Saturday, and Matt Holliday, who was sick.  You worry about the injuries,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We were kind of limited with what we had today, but you have to keep it in perspective.  It's two weeks, but we're still tied for first place in our division. We had a tough, poor, two weeks; in a sense, you could have gotten in a lot of trouble, but we're in a good spot.  Perhaps more concerning to the Yankees is their pitching continued to falter. Pineda allowed a season-high seven runs and six hits in four innings. It was the third time in his last five starts that he gave up at least five earned runs.  Sometimes those things will happen,  Castro said.  We're not a machine. We're not playing good baseball right now, but we'll keep pushing and fighting, and I think we'll be in good shape.  Martinez allowed four runs and six hits in five innings. NOTES: The Yankees held their 71st Old-Timers' Day and former C Jorge Posada made his first appearance six years after retiring. Tim Raines, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame next month, was honored when former manager Joe Torre presented him with two seats from old Yankee Stadium. ... Texas INF Joey Gallo (sore hamstring) was not with the team as he was getting examined by a doctor in Arlington. The Rangers hope he can rejoin them on Monday in Cleveland. ... Yankees CF Jacoby Ellsbury went 2-for-5 as the DH in his second rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. New York manager Joe Girardi said it's possible that Ellsbury could be activated if OF Aaron Hicks (ribcage) goes on the disabled list Monday. ...

Investors poured $9 billion into Asian government and corporate bonds in May, topping $8.8 billion in April, ANZ Research shows. Both were the highest levels since September 2016. Daniel Morris, senior investment strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management in London, said initial hopes U.S. President Donald Trump would lift inflation and growth through fiscal stimulus have been dashed. That has pulled both the dollar and U.S. debt yields back.  So Asian fixed-income starts to look a lot more attractive,  he said. After hitting a two-year high of 2.641 percent in December, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR have fallen back. They dropped to 2.103 percent last week, their lowest level since Trump's election win, after the United States reported that May core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was the lowest in two years. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate increase and hawkish tone, which came on the same day as the data, failed to substantially lift Treasury yields. While U.S. five-year yields US5YT=RR, which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.8 percent last week, they are well below this year's peak of 2.148 percent hit in March.  The big picture remains one in which investors have more faith in the longevity of the current regime of exceptionally easy monetary conditions than they have in the sustainability of the cyclical upswing in corporate earnings,  said Paul O'Connor, co-head of multi-asset strategy at Janus Henderson Investors in London. That has left Asian bonds looking relatively attractive, analysts said. India, South Korea, Malaysia Benefit The ANZ data covers the Asian emerging bond markets of South Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and China. Most funds in April and May poured into India, where returns on 10-year government bonds are around 6.5 percent IN10YT=RR, Malaysia, at 3.9 percent MY10YT=RR and South Korea, where yields are around 2.13 percent KR10YT=RR, the data shows.  The fact that there has been a reduction in tail risk in terms of European political risk, the fact that there are less inflation expectations in the U.S. and therefore expectations for monetary policy could be more dovish, is generally supportive of Asian fixed income,  said Omar Slim, Asian fixed income portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments in Singapore.  Asia also continues to have relatively good credit metrics.  The bond market strength might prompt a pullback in demand in the near term, analysts said, but the longer-term outlook is positive, especially as low U.S. inflation is undercutting the conviction for higher Fed interest rates. The risk is if the Fed does follow through on its hawkish messaging even as inflation is subdued. Last week, after their second rate rise this year, Fed officials suggested they are more concerned about keeping rates too low for too long than they are about raising them too fast or too high. The investment in Asia bonds is partly a bet on the region's relatively strong economic growth - the International Monetary Fund forecasts Asia-Pacific GDP will rise 5.5 percent in 2017 and 5.4 percent in 2018. There are also strong inflows into Asia across asset classes, so bond demand is not about risk aversion, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. Inflows into Asian equities have been positive this year, and the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is up 22 percent.  If you see very strong inflows in debt and less so in equities, then it's fair to make the statement that it's risk aversion. But the fact that you're seeing strong inflows into both means this is not the case,  Goh said.

In the most closely watched contest, the northern port city of Genoa - a traditional left-wing stronghold - seemed certain to pass to the center-right for the first time in more than 50 years. The candidate backed by the anti-immigrant Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party will get around 54 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for the candidate backed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), according to final projections based on the vote count. The elections are a setback for PD leader and former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who took a back seat in campaigning after seeing his party roiled by internal divisions this year.

Around 4.3 million people were eligible to vote in 110 municipalities that were up for grabs after no candidate won more than 50 percent in the June 11 first-round election.

Eddie Rosario had three hits, including a home run, and Ervin Santana pitched six scoreless innings as the Twins completed a three-game sweep of the Indians with a 4-0 victory on Sunday at Progressive Field. The Twins shut out the Indians in two of the three games and outscored them 13-2. It's the Twins' first three-game sweep in Cleveland in 26 years.  We talked about how we got embarrassed at home (last weekend),  Twins second baseman Brian Dozier said.  So we wanted to stick it to them here. We didn't just want to win the series, we wanted to sweep. We wanted to stomp on their throats.  Twins pitchers held Cleveland scoreless in 25 of the 27 innings of the series.  Our guys should enjoy this. They played their butts off,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  That was a really fun series. I was confident coming in that we would play well. This is not a comfortable place to play, but to come in here and win three games, you've got to feel good about that.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at IndiansMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchCleveland won seven of eight games on a road trip that began with that four-game sweep in Minnesota. That allowed the Indians to move past the Twins and into first place in the American League Central by 2 1/2 games. But the Twins' sweep in Cleveland allowed them to take first place back from the Indians.  We're a pretty streaky team,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.  Three days ago, we were hot.  Santana (10-4) gave up nine hits with seven strikeouts and no walks.  It feels good to be back in first place. We need to keep playing baseball like we can,  Santana said. Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin (4-9) pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving up four runs and nine hits with five strikeouts and a season-high three walks.  It's disappointing,  Tomlin said.  We had a chance to spread (the Indians' division lead) out a little, but that didn't happen at all. They wanted it more than we did and came away with three wins.  The Twins, who never trailed in the three games, took the lead in the second inning. Eduardo Escobar led off with a single to center and moved to second on a bunt single by Rosario. Tomlin retired Jorge Polanco on an infield popup for the first out. But Jason Castro doubled to left field, scoring Escobar and Rosario to give Minnesota a 2-0 lead. The Twins extended their lead to 3-0 in the fourth when Rosario led off the inning by hitting a line drive into the seats in right field for his 10th home run. The Indians had plenty of chances to score against Santana, but as was the case all weekend, Cleveland was unable to get a big hit. In the three-game series, the Indians were 1-for-23 with runners in scoring position. In the second inning, Cleveland had runners at second and third and two outs and failed to score. In the third inning, they had a runner at second and two outs and failed to score.  The key is you can't try to do too much,  Santana said.  Just keep making your pitches in good locations. Throw strikes. If they get a hit, good for them.  In the fourth inning, the Indians had runners at second and third and one out but failed to score. In the fifth, they had a runner at third and one out and failed to score, and in the sixth they had runners at second and third and one out, and again came up empty.  We were undisciplined,  Francona said.  We got hits, but we were never able to string anything together.  Meanwhile, the Twins kept adding on. In the sixth, Rosario led off with a single and scored on a double by Castro to make it 4-0.

Gennett, the second baseman, collected at least four hits in a game for the second time this month as the Reds defeated the Washington Nationals 6-2 on Sunday to salvage the finale of the three-game series and break a four-game skid.  He has just been swinging the bat and playing great defense,  said right-handed pitcher Scott Feldman, the starter and winner for the Reds against Washington.  I am really happy for him. He is showing what he can do up here. He obviously has some pop. He has been doing a great job and it has been fun to watch.  Feldman said Gennett also keeps the spirits up for the Reds in the clubhouse.  He just does a lot of things to keep it loose,  Feldman said of Gennett, now hitting .308. Gennett went 4-for-5, including a homer, and drove in two runs and catcher Tucker Barnhart was 2-for-4 with two RBIs. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at NationalsCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchGennett, a Cincinnati native, was 8-for-14 in the series with three RBIs. It was the second four-hit game for Gennett with the Reds, as he had five hits (four home runs) on June 6 against the St. Louis Cardinals.  He has been a sparkplug for us,  said Reds right fielder Scott Schebler.  That is what we need right now.  Schebler tossed a relay throw to Gennett, who fired to home to nail Brian Goodwin for the first out in the fifth. That was big as the Nationals would have had runners on second and third and no outs with Daniel Murphy at the plate if Goodwin would have been held by third base coach Bob Henley.  That's the toughest job on the field,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said of being the third base coach.  Two great throws,  Feldman said. Feldman (6-5) gave up two runs in seven innings as last-place Cincinnati (31-43) won for just the second time in 15 games. Feldman has the only two wins by a Reds starter since June 8.  I got off to a nice early lead,  said Feldman, who used an effective changeup.  Me and Tucker worked well together. It was just being on the same page. I always say I have to throw my changeup more.  The loser was Washington starter Tanner Roark (6-5), who gave up nine hits and six runs in six innings. He was coming off the shortest start of his career, when he allowed six runs in 2 2/3 innings at Miami on June 19. Roark now has a 5.15 ERA after posting a mark of 2.83 in 2016.  Everything was just out reach or an infield hit,  Baker said of the hits against Roark.  He settled down in the middle innings and found his control. He threw the ball better than the score indicated. It is frustrating for him.  The Reds scored five runs in the first off Roark as Gennett, the second batter of the game, had an RBI single and then scored on a throwing error by right fielder Bryce Harper. Patrick Kivlehan drove in a run with a fielder's choice and Barnhart, the No. 8 hitter, had a two-run double off Harper's glove with two outs to make it 5-0. Gennett had a solo homer in the second to up the margin to 6-0. Gennett and Washington third baseman Anthony Rendon, who was 0-for-4, have both had 10 RBIs in a game this season -- the first time two players have done that in one season since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920. Michael A. Taylor hit a two-run homer in the fourth to trim the lead to 6-2. Taylor has three homers in the last two games and five homers in his last 11.  I thought they gave Scott some really good at-bats early and jacked up his pitch count,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  Nothing was coming easy. You take the six-run lead and go 'OK, they're going to make a push.' Taylor hits a two-run homer and (you think) 'We could use a tack-on run.' We didn't get any more, but between Scott and the bullpen they were able to shut it down. I thought Scott was at his best in those last three innings or so.  Harper had three hits for Washington (45-30) and Goodwin had two. Billy Hamilton had two hits for the Reds.  We had some runners on base,  said Baker, the former Reds skipper.

It was kind of just a clear mind,  Davies said.  I went out there to have fun. ... Today was a lot better.  The plan worked. The right-hander bounced back from his worst outing with one of his best, the Milwaukee offense awoke from its slumber and the Brewers beat the Atlanta Braves 7-0 on Sunday at SunTrust Park. Davies (8-4) had allowed a career-high eight runs in his last start but fired seven shutout innings against Atlanta to help the Brewers salvage one game in the three-game series and snap Atlanta's four-game winning streak.  He did a great job,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.  It was an outing where you felt he was in control the whole outing. For the most part, he was just ahead of hitter. He had hitters off balance the whole day.  Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at BravesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta managed to get only two runners as far as second base against Davies. Only once did the Braves have two runners aboard against the starter. Davies scattered four hits and walked one batter, retired the last eight men he faced and silenced an Atlanta team that had scored 128 runs in June, the second most in the major leagues. Davies even contributed on offense with a double -- the first extra-base hit of his career -- and scored a run.  I wanted to be part of the hitting, too,  he said. Paolo Espino pitched the final two scoreless innings for the Brewers. The Milwaukee bullpen has not allowed an earned run in its last 17 straight innings. Milwaukee got two home runs, a two-run shot from third baseman Travis Shaw and a solo homer from center fielder Keon Broxton. Shaw's homer landed on top of the Chop House restaurant in right field, the first ball to land there since the park opened, and was measured at 429 feet.  Probably the second-best ball I've hit this year,  said Shaw, who clobbered one 458 feet against St. Louis on April 21.  It was a good start in the first.  Broxton was 3-for-4 with a double, a homer and three RBIs. He had a two-run single to highlight a three-run third inning. Broxton was 6-for-11 in the series with two homers. The Brewers scored in each of the first four innings and finished with more runs than they have since June 14. Milwaukee scored just five runs in the first two games of the series.  We try not to get into lulls for too long and today was another example of that,  Shaw said.  The first two games offensively we just didn't do anything and today we were able to have some focus.  Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (6-6) continued to struggle at home. He lasted only three innings and allowed seven runs and seven hits, two of them homers, and two walks. In nine starts at SunTrust Park, Teheran is 1-6 with a 7.58 ERA. He is 5-0 with a 2.89 ERA on road games.  He was just erratic,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  The last couple outings he's been so good. Didn't look like he had the ability to get anything where he wanted it today. Today it wasn't working for him. Just had a hard time getting the ball where he wanted and end up paying for it.  Despite the loss, Snitker couldn't complain about his team's 7-3 homestand.  Great homestand. We had some really good ballgames,  Snitker said.  Today just didn't work. Julio wasn't hitting on anything and had a tough day. Their guy was really efficient and throwing the ball well.  NOTES: Milwaukee is expected to activate OF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) and 2B Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) from the disabled list for Tuesday's game in Cincinnati. Both have been on a rehab assignment with Class A Wisconsin. The Brewers claimed C Stephen Vogt, who was designated for assignment by the Oakland A's earlier this week. The Brewers optioned C Jett Bandy and OF Lewis Brinson to Triple-A Colorado Springs, but will likely need to make one more roster move by Tuesday. ... Atlanta still has not named a starter for the second game of its road trip against San Diego. That turn is being reserved for RHP Bartolo Colon if the veteran can get past the back issues that have kept him on the disabled list. ... Milwaukee 3B Travis Shaw's throwing error in the second inning was his first error since April. ... Atlanta SS Dansby Swanson saw his hitting streak end at eight games, but CF Ender Inciarte extended his streak to eight games. ...

Edinson Volquez continued his perfect record against the Cubs, defeating the defending World Series champions 4-2 on Sunday afternoon at Marlins Park. But Russell's injury overshadowed the Marlins' win to some extent. After all, Russell was the starting shortstop in last year's All-Star Game. He also hit 21 homers and drove in 95 runs at age 22, helping the Cubs end their 108-year championship drought. Russell said he would take a day or two to get treatment but did not know if he would get tested.  There's a difference between when you are trying to work through something and when you are working against something,  said Russell, who missed three games in mid-May due to the same issue.  I don't think there is anything wrong. ... It's definitely frustrating.  Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MarlinsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchThe Cubs have certainly been frustrated by Volquez, who is 8-0 with a 3.12 ERA against Chicago in 13 career appearances. Volquez (4-8) was wild, walking five batters, and his high pitch count led to an early exit. Still, he allowed just five hits and two runs. He also escaped two bases-loaded situations with just one run allowed in those spots.  I don't like it, but I had no choice,  Volquez said about pitching with runners on base.  You start walking people, you get yourself in trouble.  Fortunately for the Marlins, A.J. Ramos picked up his 12th save of the season, leading a stellar effort by the bullpen. Giancarlo Stanton hit a solo home run, his 20th long ball of the season, and Martin Prado added a two-run double to lead the Marlins (34-40), who split their four-game series against the Cubs (38-37). Cubs left-hander Mike Montgomery (1-4), who picked up a save the last time he faced the Marlins on June 5, took the loss, allowing four hits, two walks, three runs (none earned) in six innings. Miami opened the scoring in the first. Ichiro Suzuki reached on a fielding error by Russell. Miami cashed in with an RBI single by Marcell Ozuna -- who got his hit on the fourth straight curveball he saw -- and on Prado's two-run double.  There was an awkward spin on the ball,  Cubs manager JOe Maddon said of Russell's error.  I understand that.  Maddon said he was much more upset with a missed sign on a hit-and-run that resulted in Ian Happ getting thrown out at second base. Wilson Contreras was at that plate when the sign was missed.  Physical mistakes, make as many as you need to,  Maddon said.  But there were just a couple of other things we did today that kind of gave (the game) to them.  Chicago missed an opportunity in the second inning when Anthony Rizzo flied out to center field with two down and the bases loaded. And that was a pattern the entire game as Chicago left 11 runners on base.  We were probably just trying too much,  Maddon said.  Instead of just focusing on scoring one, we were trying to score them all. Just score one.  The Cubs cut their deficit to 3-2 with sacrifice flies by Rizzo in the fourth and Tommy La Stella in the fifth. But even there, the Cubs stranded multiple runners in those innings. Jarlin Garcia (one inning), David Phelps (1 2/3 innings) and Ramos (1 1/3 innings) pitched scoreless relief for the Marlins, and Stanton added his insurance run in the seventh. The Marlins have scored just 15 runs in the past six games, but they managed to split them against two 2016 playoff teams, the Washington Nationals and Chicago.  The pitching has kept us close,  said Ramos, who has just two four-out saves this season -- both against the Cubs.  But we're going to start hitting again pretty soon.  NOTES: Miami rested CF Christian Yelich and 2B Dee Gordon. Ichiro Suzuki, 43, became the oldest starting center fielder in baseball since at least 1900. ... Chicago rested CF Albert Almora. ... The Cubs have signed their first pick in this year's draft (LHP Brendon Little) and their third selection (RHP Cory Abbott).

The court in the coming days is also expected to act on President Donald Trump's emergency request seeking to revive his travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries, which was blocked by lower courts. Although there are no firm indications that Kennedy, 81 in July, will step down, some of his former law clerks have said he is considering it. Any announcement could come after the court has finished issuing its rulings on Monday morning. Kennedy has repeatedly declined to respond to media requests seeking comment on his plans. He joined his former law clerks at a reunion event on Saturday night, with several attendees saying he did not address the rumors. If Kennedy were to retire, President Donald Trump, a Republican, would have a historic opportunity to recast the court in a more conservative posture, possibly for decades to come. He has already appointed one conservative justice, Neil Gorsuch. But Gorsuch replaced a conservative in a similar mold, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Replacing Kennedy, the swing vote for the last decade on the closely divided court, would be more significant. Kennedy has sided with the court's four liberals on some major issues, most notably gay rights. Speaking on ABC's  This Week  program on Sunday, Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, declined to say if there has been any communication between the White House and Kennedy. The nine justices are due to rule in six cases, not including their decision expected in the coming days on the travel ban. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2016.Yuri GripasOf the remaining cases argued during the court's current term, which began in October, the most eagerly awaited one concerns a Missouri church backed by a conservative Christian legal group. The ruling potentially could narrow the separation of church and state. The church sued after being denied state taxpayer funds for a playground improvement project because of a Missouri constitutional provision barring state funding for religious entities. Slideshow (2 Images)Trinity Lutheran could be headed for a lopsided win, with two liberal justices joining their conservative colleagues in signaling support during the April oral argument. It was one of the first in which Trump's conservative appointee to the court, Neil Gorsuch, participated. The most notable of three immigration-related cases in which rulings are due on Monday is a dispute over whether immigrants detained by the U.S. government for more than six months while deportation proceedings unfold should be able to request their release. The case takes on additional significance with Trump ratcheting up immigration enforcement, placing more people in detention awaiting deportation.  The court also is set to decide a case that could clarify the criminal acts for which legal immigrants may be deported. Another involves whether the family of a Mexican teenager shot dead while standing on Mexican soil by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Texas can sue for civil rights violations. As the justices look to finish work before their summer break, they must decide what to do with Trump's travel ban, which was blocked by lower courts. The administration wants the ban to go into effect while the litigation continues. The March 6 executive order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to let the government implement stronger vetting. Trump has said the order is needed for national security.

The FTC argued the merger would undermine competition and lead to higher interest rates, poorer service and branch closures in remote areas. To overcome the objections, Shinwa Bank and Eighteenth Bank had been preparing to sell loans to other banks, but three officials familiar with the matter said reaching the target would be difficult. One official said the banks were not expected to sell enough loans to satisfy the FTC. Japan's 100-plus regional banks have struggled, particularly in rural areas, as the country's dwindling population has led to weaker loan demand. Wafer thin lending margins under the Bank of Japan's negative rates policy has also squeezed profitability. To survive, some have tried to merge with neighboring rivals, but so far the sector has remained largely unchanged even as big city banks contracted from 21 to three  megabanks  over the past 20 years. Fukuoka Financial Group's president said earlier this month that he still hoped to complete the merger by October. A spokesman said the bank would have to decide in July whether to delay the transaction. Elsewhere, two smaller banks in Niigata prefecture Sea of Japan coast, Daishi Bank Ltd and Hokuetsu Bank Ltd , agreed to merge and are awaiting authorities' approval.

Fister was facing the Los Angeles Angels, the team that released him on Thursday after three minor league outings, for the Boston Red Sox, the team that claimed him off waivers on Friday. But the Angels (40-39) got the final say, taking the game 4-2, and the series. Fister went six innings, giving up three runs on seven hits with three walks and six strikeouts. He took the loss, falling to 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA.  Quality outing,  Boston manager John Farrell said.  He's a bang-bang play away from a scoreless outing. I thought he held his stuff really well through the entire time that he was on the mound. Good life to his fastball, good sink. Threw a number of good cutters. I thought he pitched in to both lefties and righties effectively. That was a very good start on the part of Doug today.  Related CoveragePreview: Angels at Red SoxLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchHe was bested by Angels rookie right-hander Parker Bridwell, who went 6 2/3 innings, giving up two runs on seven hits with no walks, four strikeouts and a hit batter. Bridwell earned the win, improving to 2-0.  It was much needed and Parker just keeps coming in and keeps us in games in some pretty tough places,  said Angels manager Mike Scioscia.  It's great to watch.  Bridwell needed just 75 pitches, 52 for strikes.  That was partly on their part, too, swinging early,  Bridwell said.  Once I figured out what they were doing, I had to be more precise with fastball location. I was happy with the way first three or four went. I wasn't throwing very many stress pitches. It was them swinging early and me being able to keep the ball down.  Fister pitched a lightning-fast and efficient, 1-2-3 first inning, needing just 10 pitches, including a three-pitch strikeout of leadoff batter Cameron Maybin. But in the second inning he gave up three runs -- Juan Graterol's two-run single was the big hit -- as the Angels sent six batters to the plate.  That was the small hiccup and, unfortunately, I got to do a better job than that,  Fister said.  I got to execute some pitches and make sure that guys don't do what they did. So that's on me.  Boston (41-34) cut the deficit as Mitch Moreland led off the bottom of the inning with his 11th home run of the season. Jackie Bradley Jr. got Boston to within a run when he led off the fifth with his 10th homer of the season. The Angels added a run in the ninth off Boston closer Craig Kimbrel, pitching for the first time since June 18. Ben Revere led off with a single, scoring on Kaleb Cowart's one-out single to right. Cowart, who was called up before the game to make his season debut, went 2-for-3 with a walk, two RBI and a run scored.  He had a great game,  Scioscia said.  Kaleb had about 30 minutes of sleep and came out and took his groundballs.  Yusmeiro Petit earned his first save, going two scoreless innings. NOTES: Red Sox LHP David Price developed a cracked fingernail on the middle finger of his throwing hand during Saturday's loss to the Angels. Manager John Farrell expects Price to make his next scheduled start. ... Angels LHP Tyler Skaggs suffered a setback Saturday as he tries to make his way back from a strained oblique. He was schedule to pitch in his first rehab game on Saturday, but was scratched because of general soreness in his oblique and abdominal area. He was able to throw on Saturday and is expected to join the team at Dodger Stadium on Monday, going through a full evaluation. ... Boston LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, on the disabled list since June 2 with a right knee subluxation, is expected to make his first rehab start Thursday with Double-A Portland, throwing about 75-80 pitches. Angels INF Yunel Escobar was out of the lineup again on Sunday after injuring his thumb on a diving play in Friday's game. Scioscia said he is improving. ... Red Sox LHP Brian Johnson, on the DL since June 15 with left shoulder impingement, threw his first bullpen session on Sunday. Farrell said Johnson would continue to progress with bullpen sessions before there is a plan to get him into games. ... 1B/DH Albert Pujols is expected to play one of the two games at Dodger Stadium starting Monday. The most likely scenario would be for him to play Monday, with the Dodgers starting LHP Rich Hill. ... RHP Bud Norris, on the DL with right knee inflammation, has begun aggressive long toss, manager Mike Scioscia said. The Angels are hoping he can pitch from a mound this week.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-redsox-writethru-idUSMTZED6P4F4ANW"},

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Baltimore Orioles haven't been a late come-from-behind team much this season, but they enjoyed that role Sunday, rallying in the ninth inning for a 8-5 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field.  We just want to play some crisp baseball games,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said after winning his second straight game and getting 4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief from his bullpen while Tampa Bay's relievers struggled. Baltimore scored three runs in the ninth against Rays closer Alex Colome (1-3), who struggled for the second straight outing. Joey Rickard put Baltimore ahead with an RBI ground-rule double, and after an intentional walk to load the bases, Colome hit Jonathan Schoop to bring in a second run. Rickard scored on a sacrifice fly by Adam Jones. The Rays (40-38) had been 35-3 this season when leading after seven innings and the Orioles (37-38) had been 3-34 when trailing after seven. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at RaysBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch Not the way we wanted to finish off a homestand here,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  At the end of the day, their lineup, especially the bottom of the lineup, caused a lot of damage.  Baltimore right-hander Brad Brach (2-1) picked up the win in relief, pitching the final two innings, includng a 1-2-3 ninth. The Rays hadn't lost a home series since they dropped three of four to the Royals in early May. The bullpen struggles started an inning earlier as Rays reliever Chase Whitley, trying to hold a one-run lead in the eighth, gave up a solo home run to Schoop, his 15th homer of the season to tie the score at 5. Colome, who had given up four earned runs in his last 19 appearances entering the week, has now allowed five in his last two outings, raising his ERA to 3.15.  If you miss one pitch, they can take it,  Colome said.  If I have to pitch tomorrow, I'd do the same thing. I don't have to change anything.  In the fifth inning, the Rays got to Baltimore starter Chris Tillman, who came in with an 8.39 ERA, as Mallex Smith and Corey Dickerson singled, setting up a three-run homer by Evan Longoria to give the Rays a 5-3 lead. Longoria's 12th home run of the season went to left field and shifted momentum back to the home team, which had won seven straight rubber games and had split the first two games of the series with Baltimore.  They're constantly good,  Tillman said of his bullpen after the game.  They're always good. They're solid if you give them a chance. When you set them up to pitch where they need to be pitching, they're pretty darn good.  Baltimore got within a run on Trey Mancini's solo home run in the sixth off Rays starter Jake Odorizzi -- his 11th straight appearance giving up a home run, the longest such streak by a Rays pitcher since James Shields served one up in 10 consecutive games in 2006 and matching the franchise mark set by Wilson Alvarez (11 in 1998). The Orioles had jumped ahead with a two-run rally in the second inning -- Caleb Joseph singled, Craig Gentry doubled, and both scored on a double by Paul Janish off Odorizzi. The Rays' first two runs were brought in by second baseman Taylor Featherston, who had an RBI single in the second and a sacrifice fly in the fourth, cutting the Orioles' lead to 3-2 after Joseph added a solo home run. NOTES: The Rays are making a change to their starting rotation, with LHP Blake Snell rejoining the group Wednesday after a solid stint in the minors. RHP Erasmo Ramirez will move back to the bullpen to make room, and Tampa Bay will need to make a roster move before Wednesday to open a 25-man spot for Snell. ... Baltimore will have RHP Kevin Gausman on the mound Tuesday as the Orioles open a three-game series at Toronto. Tampa Bay will start RHP Alex Cobb on Tuesday to open a three-game set at Pittsburgh. ... An official scoring change was made to Friday's game. DH Mark Trumbo's fourth-inning single has been changed to an error on Rays SS Tim Beckham. That makes an ensuing run unearned, so RHP Chris Archer's season ERA drops from 3.97 to 3.88.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED6P4F49NV"},

In the most closely watched contest, the northern port city of Genoa - a traditional left-wing stronghold - seemed set to pass to the center-right for the first time in more than 50 years. The candidate backed by the anti-immigrant Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party will get between 52 percent and 56 percent of the vote, compared with 44-48 percent for the candidate backed by the ruling Democratic Party. Around 4.3 million people were eligible to vote in municipalities still up for grabs because no candidate won more than 50 percent in the June 11 first-round election. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is Italy's most popular party nationwide according to some opinion polls, performed very badly in the first round and only made the run-off in one of the 25 largest cities. The exit polls on Sunday also put center-right candidates clearly ahead in the northern city of Verona and in Catanzaro in the south. The central city of L'Aquila, where the center-left candidate had led after the first round, was too close to call. First projections based on the actual vote count will be released at around 23:45 (5.45 p.m ET) and final results are expected to be known early on Monday.

The government will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros, so that it will take over the remains of Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said the total funds  mobilized  by the state would be for up to 17 billion euros - three times more than had initially been estimated to recapitalize the banks with public money. The deal, approved by the European Commission, allows Italy to solve a banking crisis on its own terms, ensuring the two Veneto lenders are not wound down under potentially tougher European rules. The cost for taxpayers, however, is hefty.  Those who criticize us should say what a better alternative would have been. I can't see it,  Padoan told reporters after the government spent the weekend drafting an emergency decree to liquidate the two banks. The decree effectively means that the Veneto banks' branches and employees will be part of Intesa Sanpaolo by Monday morning, a move designed to avoid a potential run on deposits that could have spread chaos across the whole banking industry. The decree will have to be voted into law by parliament within 60 days. Related CoverageItaly to appoint special administrators for Veneto lenders: sourceIntesa Sanpaolo board tasks CEO with completing purchase of Veneto banks' assetsUnder the plan, the banks' soured loans, as well as legal risks stemming from a mis-selling scandal, will be moved to a bad bank, partly financed by the state. Junior bondholders and shareholders in the two banks will suffer losses, but senior bonds and depositors will be protected. Padoan said that on top of the 5.2 billion euros payment to Intesa, which includes 1.3 billion euros to cover job cuts, the state will offer guarantees to fund potential losses arising from due diligence of the two banks' soured and risky loans. A treasury source said the government estimated that the total 12 billion euros in guarantees would translate into a fair-value exposure of just 400 million euros for the state, but did not explain how it arrived at that figure. The EU Commission also said in a statement that the  net costs to the Italian state will be much lower than the nominal amounts of the measures provided . It too did not explain. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoBanking analysts, however, said the state could ultimately be on the hook for up to 17 billion euros, even though some value could be salvaged once the soured loans were fully analyzed, limiting the final bill for taxpayers. 'Tough Conditions' Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's best-capitalized large bank, said last week it was open to purchasing the rump of the good assets for one euro on condition Italy's government passed a decree agreeing to shoulder the cost of winding down the two banks. Setting tough conditions for the deal, Intesa CEO Carlo Messina has insisted that his bank's capital ratios and dividend policy would not be affected by the transaction. Slideshow (6 Images) Without Intesa Sanpaolo's offer - the only significant one submitted at the auction held by the government - the crisis of the two banks would have had a serious impact on the whole Italian banking system,  Messina said in a statement on Sunday. The European Central Bank, which supervises the two lenders based in the country's rich north-eastern Veneto region, had declared on Friday that they were  failing or likely to fail , setting in motion the process that led to them being wound down. After months of tense negotiations between Rome and EU regulators, Italy has been allowed to use national insolvency procedures rather than EU rules designed to prevent the use of state money to deal with bank crises. Those EU rules could have imposed losses on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect ahead of national elections next year given that Italian households hold a large chunk of bonds issued by banks. Some European officials have voiced exasperation at the way Italy has dealt with a string of trouble spots in its banking industry, which is weighed down by nearly 350 billion euros of soured debts -- a third of the euro zone's total. The country's fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, is being bailed out by the state to cover a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros. Four other smaller banks were wound down in 2015. The future of the Veneto banks had hung in the balance over the past two years since the ECB uncovered a capital hole caused by a spike in bad loans and a mis-selling scandal whereby the banks' customers were sold shares in exchange for loans. The dragged-out negotiations between Rome, Frankfurt and Brussels and their outcome on Sunday have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of banking supervision and the credibility of Europe's own rules for dealing with bank crises.

It took Qadisia, located in the west of Raqqa, after three days of intense fighting, it said in a statement on one of its official social media feeds.  The SDF has pushed Islamic State from swathes of northern Syria over the past 18 months. Turkey-backed Syrian rebels have also taken territory from it and the Syrian army has this year advanced rapidly against it in desert areas.  The U.S.-backed coalition has supported SDF advances against the jihadist group throughout the Raqqa campaign with artillery and air strikes, including some against Islamic State leaders.  This month, the coalition said its air strikes had killed Turki Binali, a Bahraini cleric who was the group's top religious authority and the most senior known Gulf Arab in Islamic State.  It also said last week it killed Fawaz al-Rawi, who it said was an important Islamic State financier, in an air strike in Syria.  However, coalition air raids have also caused large numbers of civilian casualties, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.

Where's the Muslim ban?  said Spencer, who following Trump's election victory was filmed saying  Hail Trump  and drawing Nazi-like salutes at a conference.

Though the victory for Sevastova, 27, will not make the same waves as 20-year-old Ostapenko's startling performance at Roland Garros, it still represented a remarkable breakthrough. Like Ostapenko, Sevastova's first title in 2010 came soon after her 20th birthday but within three years she had to walk away from the sport, worn down by injuries and illness. Yet after making a comeback 20 months later in 2015, she reached two more finals last year, in this same Mallorca tournament and Bucharest, before further progress this season culminated in Sunday's triumph over Goerges. The German had stormed into the final for the loss of 14 games but Sunday's match was a tight contest with the key to the outcome being the consistency of world No.19 Sevastova as she made only 10 unforced errors over two and a quarter hours.

A VW spokeswoman said workers will get a 4.7 percent wage rise from this month, another 4.7 percent increase from January 2018 and a further 4.1 percent boost from November 2018 plus a 500 euro ($560) one-off bonus. The deal is a compromise between the union's original demand of a 16 percent hike over two years and the company's offer of a combined 8.7 percent boost. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 workers who joined the strike on Tuesday will return to work, and production lines that normally make about 1,000 cars a day will resume operations on Monday morning, the spokeswoman added. The union confirmed on its Facebook page that an agreement had been reached.  We're ending the strike with a very successful negotiation. We managed to agree on a combined wage hike of 14.12 percent by November 2018,  union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016, including the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques. The company pays its Slovak employees, excluding top management, an average of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average but less than half of the 4,200 euros earned by equivalent employees in Germany, according to the union. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has supported the strike, saying Volkswagen should pay its Slovak workers the same pay as its western European ones. The Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of strike would have cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. The company, which exports almost all of its output, did not comment on the impact of the six-day strike. Slovakia's growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver.

In contrast, a smattering of anti-Trump signs in San Francisco was drowned out by a desire to let loose.  It's too good a day to be upset about Trump,  said Richard Babb, 66, of San Francisco. In New York, Brad Hoylman, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate, said lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were  under assault  by the Trump administration.  He already rolled back rights for transgender students, for example, and the list is on and on,  he said.  So we have a lot more work to do, that's why we are here today.  As a candidate, Trump promised to protect gay people. But his move in February to revoke the Obama administration's guidance letting transgender students choose which gender bathroom they use, and his executive order last month to promote  religious liberty  have been seen by some as discriminatory. The New York march's grand marshals this year include the American Civil Liberties Union, which was chosen for its history of litigation defending gay rights; Brooke Guinan, a transgender woman who works as a firefighter in the city; and Geng Le, a gay rights activist in China. Back to Stonewall The march route ends on Christopher Street in Manhattan's West Village in order to commemorate the riots that broke out there in 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in an event seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement. One of the first Pride marches happened close by a year later. In San Francisco, revelers had to pass through one of dozens of metal security detectors to get into the main plaza.  Happy Pride everyone!  a security monitor yelled to the crowd, as people cheered and saluted.  Have fun today.  Two gay cousins attended the parade dressed in tutus and unicorn headbands.  We see this as a party, not a political protest,  Qiaira McPeters, 18, said. Despite that, McPeters said that she feels things for gay people have been getting worse.  Gay people are getting beat up all the time,  she said. (Writing by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Bill Rigby)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-lgbt-pride-idUSL1N1JM09S"},

A VW spokeswoman said workers will get a 4.7 percent wage rise from this month, another 4.7 percent increase from January 2018 and a further 4.1 percent boost from November 2018 plus a 500 euro ($560) one-off bonus. The deal is a compromise between the union's original demand of a 16 percent hike over two years and the company's offer of a combined 8.7 percent boost. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 workers who joined the strike on Tuesday will return to work, and production lines that normally make about 1,000 cars a day will resume operations on Monday morning, the spokeswoman added. The union confirmed on its Facebook page that an agreement had been reached.  We're ending the strike with a very successful negotiation. We managed to agree on a combined wage hike of 14.12 percent by November 2018,  union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016, including the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques. The company pays its Slovak employees, excluding top management, an average of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average but less than half of the 4,200 euros earned by equivalent employees in Germany, according to the union. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has supported the strike, saying Volkswagen should pay its Slovak workers the same pay as its western European ones. The Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of strike would have cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. The company, which exports almost all of its output, did not comment on the impact of the six-day strike. Slovakia's growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, produces more than 1 million vehicles a year, making it the biggest per-capita auto producer in the world.

Both the Socialists of Prime Minister Edi Rama and the rival Democratic Party led by Lulzim Basha are seeking a majority as neither party won the 70 seats needed for a majority in the 2013 or 2009 election.  The exit poll by Italy's IPR Marketing, with a margin of error of two percent, showed the Socialists are set to win between 45 and 49 percent of the vote, which could secure them more than half of the seats in parliament.   The Socialist Party might have won more than 71 seats (in the 140-seat parliament), but this is still an opinion not a certainty,  IPR Marketing's Antonio Noto said. Both main parties want to ditch the Socialist Integration Movement (SIM) of president-elect Ilir Meta, which gained the role of king-maker by propping up their respective governments for the last eight years. The state election commission extended voting by an hour to 1800 GMT due to a low turnout as temperatures reached as high as 39 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest day so far this year.  But at 8 p.m. when polls closed turnout was around 44.90 percent, the lowest this century.  The ideas of neither candidates for prime minister convinced those Albanians who make the difference so they did not turn out to vote,  said Ylli Manjani, a former justice minister sacked by Rama a few months ago. The vote is being closely watched by Albania's European neighbors, keen for it to leave behind a history of election irregularities and violence. The Interior Ministry said in a statement hundreds of cases of vote buying and intimidation of voters had been reported, but gave no further details.

State television broadcast footage of Assad standing to pray in a large mosque in Hama behind its imam, with other clerics standing alongside and a large crowd of worshippers.  State news agency SANA quoted the preacher as saying that Assad's presence in the city for Eid showed that victory and the return of security were only  a few steps  away.      Syria's civil war has turned to Assad's favor since 2015, when Russia sent its jets to help his army and allied Shi'ite militias backed by Iran turn back rebels and win new ground.  Since the war began in 2011, it has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions more from their homes, sparked a global refugee crisis and drawn in regional and world powers.  The conflict is far from over. Rebels hold swathes of the country, including around Idlib province near Hama, and launched a new attack in Quneitra in the southwest on Saturday.  Rebels also hold the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus, parts of the desert in the southeast and a large pocket south of Hama around the city of Rastan.  As recently as March, rebels advanced from Idlib province to within a few kilometers of Hama, before the army and its allies pushed them back in weeks of fierce fighting.

Focus on Islamic State Assad has not made a declared visit to Hama, which is about 185 km (115 miles) from Damascus, since the war began. Last year he delivered Eid prayers in Homs, about 40km (25 miles) closer to Damascus. Slideshow (3 Images)Early in the crisis he visited Raqqa, a city that has since become the Syrian capital of Islamic State and now faces an assault by a U.S.-backed coalition to drive out the militants.  The fight against Islamic State, which has attacked Western cities, has become the focus of Western leaders, some of whom have softened demands that Assad must quit to end the crisis.  In March, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Assad's fate would be decided by Syrians, a change in rhetoric after years of insisting he step down to allow a political solution.  France's new President Emmanuel Macron said this month he did not see Assad's departure as a condition to end the fighting and the priority was stopping Syria becoming a failed state. The U.S. and other Western states, along with Turkey and Gulf monarchies, have long supported some of the rebels, an array of groups that includes Islamist and nationalist factions. Assad describes them all as terrorists.  His military has said its focus is on the campaign in the desert, where it is advancing against Islamic State to relieve a besieged government enclave in the city of Deir al-Zor.

Children gathered in squares on the eastern side of the city. Some played on old swings and others with toy guns and rifles, which were among the toys allowed by Islamic State militants after they took over the city in June 2014. The militants implemented an extreme version of Islam which associated toys with a face, like dolls, with idolatry. They encouraged youngsters to train on weapons and changed text books to reflect their military ideology. Children were asked to add up bombs or bullets in maths exercises. Eid prayers were allowed under Islamic State but festivities were not. But for many, Sunday's Eid celebrations were overshadowed by the destruction of their historic leaning minaret, blown up by the militants on Wednesday, and fears for thousands of civilians trapped in the Old City in western Mosul still under Islamic State control.       It won't be real Eid before we return home,  said a man in his 60s, displaced from the western side of the city, across the Tigris river, where fighting continues.   Some expressed sadness over the destruction of the 850-year-old Grand al-Nuri mosque and its leaning 150-foot (45-meter) minaret.       Eid is not the same,  said a man who declined to give his name as fear is still present even though Iraqi forces dislodged the insurgents from the eastern part of the city months ago. Iraqi forces took the eastern side from Islamic State in January, after 100 days of fighting, and started attacking the western side in February. The militants are now besieged in Mosul's Old City. Islamic State retaliated with a series of suicide attacks in Hay al-Tanak, a poor neighborhood west of the Old City.  The security forces blocked a violent attack carried out by (people wearing) explosive belts, in Hay al-Tanak,  said a military statement, showing pictures of black smoke it said came from fires set to houses and cars by the militants. The Iraqi military didn't confirm Islamic State statements that the insurgents took control of Hay al-Tanak and began attacking the nearby Hay al-Yarmuk neighborhood. Witnesses said they saw residents fleeing the area.

About 350 Islamic State fighters, most of them non-Iraqis, are defending their remaining stronghold in Mosul's densely populated Old City, an Iraqi general said on Sunday. He expected the battle for the city to end in days. Trapped  Most of the dead bodies are foreigners, most of the fighters are foreigners, we see some trying to escape across the Tigris,  said Major-General Sami al-Arithi, a Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) commander. The U.S.-trained urban warfare units are leading the fight in the narrow alleyways of the historic district which lies by the western bank of the Tigris. Slideshow (14 Images)More than 50,000 civilians, about half the Old City's population, remain behind Islamic State lines, complicating the troops' advance, Arithi told state TV. The civilians are trapped in crumbling old houses in harrowing conditions, with little food, water or medicines, according to those who have escaped. Aid organizations say Islamic State has stopped many from leaving, using them as human shields. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks. Iraqi authorities were hoping to declare victory in the northern city by Eid, a three-day festival which started on Sunday for Mosul's Sunni Muslim population and many Iraqi Shi'ites, celebrating the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Arithi said the CTS were about 25 meters (yards) from the Nuri mosque, from where Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and Syria three years ago.   The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the fighting has dragged on as the militants reinforced positions in civilian areas, launched suicide car bomb attacks, laid traps and kept up sniper and mortar fire. The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate . Islamic State remains in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and has been assumed to be hiding in the Iraqi-Syrian border area. There has been no confirmation of Russian reports over the past week that he has been killed. In Syria, the insurgents'  capital , Raqqa, is nearly encircled by a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition.

Vettel Fuming Hamilton also denied the accusation that he had deliberately  brake-tested  his rival, arguing that he was merely  controlling the pace.   Like all the other restarts, I slowed down in the same spot,  he said.  He was obviously sleeping and drove into the back of me.   Vettel was left fuming at the perceived injustice after being the only one of the two title rivals to be punished.  In the end I don't agree with the penalty that I got, because if you penalize me then you should penalize us both because that was not the way to do it,  the championship leader was quoted as saying on the F1 website.  I think F1 is for grown-ups. The maneuver before was not necessary and obviously damaged my front wing. (It) damaged his rear also I think a little.  That was not the right way to do it, exiting the corner, accelerating and then braking. I don't think there was any point in doing that.  Hamilton began the race on pole and avoided the melee in lap one to establish himself as leader, but his progress was stymied when he ceded his lead after pitting due to a loose head rest. Vettel's sanction saw him drop from second to ninth but he recovered to extend his championship lead over Hamilton to 14 points. Hamilton's troubles extended his disappointing record in Baku, the 32-year-old matching last year's fifth-place finish.

Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku, Azerbaijan - June 25, 2017. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton arrives before the race.David Mdzinarishvili They've seen today how a four-time champion behaves and I think, hopefully, that doesn't ripple into the younger categories.  Vettel Fuming Hamilton also denied the accusation that he had deliberately  brake-tested  his rival, arguing that he was merely  controlling the pace.   Like all the other restarts, I slowed down in the same spot,  he said.  He was obviously sleeping and drove into the back of me.   Vettel was left fuming at the perceived injustice after being the only one of the two title rivals to be punished.  In the end I don't agree with the penalty that I got, because if you penalize me then you should penalize us both because that was not the way to do it,  the championship leader was quoted as saying on the F1 website.  I think F1 is for grown-ups. The maneuver before was not necessary and obviously damaged my front wing. (It) damaged his rear also I think a little.  That was not the right way to do it, exiting the corner, accelerating and then braking. I don't think there was any point in doing that.  Hamilton began the race on pole and avoided the melee in lap one to establish himself as leader, but his progress was stymied when he ceded his lead after pitting due to a loose head rest. Vettel's sanction saw him drop from second to ninth but he recovered to extend his championship lead over Hamilton to 14 points. Hamilton's troubles extended his disappointing record in Baku, the 32-year-old matching last year's fifth-place finish.

Kerley, who was already the year's fastest man at 43.70 seconds, won his first U.S. championship at the American world championships trials on Saturday in 44.03. His superb performance left 1992 Barcelona Olympic one-lap champion Watts enthusing about a 22-year-old who, he believes, possesses a rare talent.   He's tall and has a lot of power, but what makes him special is he has a rare combination of speed and power,  said Watts in an interview.  We've seen it before, but maybe only four or five of the great ones.  The United States was once overwhelmingly dominant in the event with seven consecutive Olympic gold medals between 1984 and 2008, but the last two have been won by Kirani James, of Grenada, and Wayde van Niekerk, of South Africa.  The United States needs a special guy to have a resurgence,  Watts said.  Kerley is that guy.   It's going to be exciting to see what the U.S. is going to do in the world championships and in the future.  The task will not be a simple one, though. Awaiting Kerley and his American team mates at August's world championships in London will be Van Niekerk, who took down two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson's world record in Rio de Janeiro with a stunning run of 43.03 seconds.  Wayde has no weaknesses,  said Watts.  He has everything you need to run great. He has the stamina, he has the speed, he has the endurance and, most of all, he has the courage.  That was most evident from 300 to 400 meters, said Watts, now an assistant coach at the University of Southern California. Van Niekerk also has range and speed, having run under 10 seconds in the 100 meters, sub-20 seconds in the 200 and on the cusp of sub-43 seconds in the 400. Watts, who lost his U.S. collegiate record to Kerley this spring, also sees that same courage from Kerley late in the race.  The only weakness in Kerley is that he is young,  Watts said.  Now he has the opportunity to compete on the world-class level as a professional.  Who knows, maybe two years from now we will see sub-43 from him.  Yet Watts also felt that to challenge Van Niekerk in London Kerley would have to be  prepared to compete at a high level and that particular high level may be a blistering first 200.  That was the major difference in running the 400 meters these days, said Watts, who clocked 43.50 when he triumphed in Barcelona.  We were coming through there (200m) in 20.9, maybe 21.0, 21.2 seconds. These guys are coming through, like, 20.5, 20.6. That's where I see the matchup (in London).

To cap another frustrating weekend for the team's Dutch starlet Verstappen, the 19-year-old was forced to retire on lap 11 with major engine troubles forcing him into his fourth retirement in the last six races. Yet Red Bull's team were gradually snapped out of their misery by Ricciardo driving to his first victory since the Malaysian Grand Prix last season.  We were totally depressed after the first quarter of the race,  Red Bull principal Christian Horner told Sky F1.  Max was going faster and faster and (then we lost) him with an engine failure.  Daniel's race then began to come alive. He was making great progress. He nailed it.

Daniel has had four podiums and a race win but I'm sure a big race is around the corner for Max.  After retiring in Bahrain, Spain and Canada, Verstappen has not hidden his frustrations with Red Bull's recent technical issues, complaining after qualifying that the unreliable engine was limiting his progress. Ricciardo, who has largely avoided the mechanical issues that have affected his team mate, was able to spare a thought for Verstappen.  We're still not perfect yet,  the Australian driver said.  We got one car to victory lane but we haven't had two cars finishing strongly since China. That's a target for the team to get both close if not on the podium soon.

(Reuters) - Officials with the conservative U.S. political network overseen by the Koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the Senate this week and will lobby for changes to it. At a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to Charles Koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the Senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare. “We have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by Charles Koch and his brother, David. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since its passage in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Phillips and other aides to the Koch network told Reuters they want to see the Senate bill do more to roll back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans. They also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the U.S. healthcare system and cut costs. The aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote. Similar concerns helped steer the House’s version of the bill in a more conservative direction. A primary mover of that effort, Mark Meadows, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, attended the Koch donor event. Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he is prepared to support the Senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on Trump’s desk is possible. However, Meadows said the Senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on Obamacare’s insurance exchanges to offer less-expensive plans that do not comply with that law’s coverage requirements. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who currently opposes the Senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. Cruz attended the Koch event here, as did Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who remain undecided. Meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes. Senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the July 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the House. If the Senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the House, Meadows said it is conceivable the House could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the Senate and House bills. That, he said, could result in sending the bill to Trump’s desk for his signature before the recess. Getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult. Five Senate Republicans, including Cruz, have publicly voiced their opposition to the current Senate draft. No Senate Democrats are expected to back it, which means McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Senate Republicans. As a sign of the Koch network’s influence, Phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as $400 million before next year’s congressional elections to advocate for the network’s conservative causes.

When Prada boss Patrizio Bertelli pulled the team backed by the Italian luxury goods group out of the competition in April 2015, he offered key members of his team to help Emirates Team New Zealand, which is now challenging Oracle Team USA. As the holder of the  Auld Mug , the U.S. team gets to decide the rules, and the decision to change the specifications of the boats stirred the already bad blood with the Italians, who called the change an  abrupt and unacceptable imposition . Most significant among the team members who joined New Zealand's attempt to dethrone Oracle was former Luna Rossa skipper and team director Max Sirena who switched ship in October 2015 to work alongside New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton. Sirena won the 33rd America’s Cup with BMW Oracle Team and led the Luna Rossa challenge in the 34th edition of the cup.  Luna Rossa said at the time of his move to Emirates Team New Zealand that this underlined  the sporting and friendly ties of mutual respect  built up since 2000. As well as helping the New Zealand team out with personnel including designers, Bertelli has also helped them with support boats and other  assets , America's Cup sources told Reuters. For the Record  These ties could come into play in the next phase of the cup because victory for New Zealand, who lead the U.S. holders in the first-to-seven competition, would mean they get to decide on the format of the 36th America's Cup. A close relationship between Bertelli and Matteo de Nora, who is Team Principal and a financial supporter of Emirates Team New Zealand, has led to expectations among other America's Cup teams, sponsors and sailors that Luna Rossa will become the  Challenger of Record  if New Zealand win. Under the terms set out by the America's Cup  Deed of Gift , which dates back to the 1850s, the Challenger of Record is the first one accepted by the new defender of the cup.  This is done formally by a yacht club linked to one of the teams and there is usually a scramble to get the challenge in as soon as the final race is decided, with notice being served to the winning team as their boat crosses the finish line. The challenger then negotiates initial crucial terms of the next cup, including location, the type of boat, the format and the rules under which teams will compete.  We all understand that they (New Zealand) are likely to have Luna Rossa as a challenger of record, but what their plans and intentions are is completely unknown,  America's Cup Regatta Director Iain Murray told Reuters this week.  Oracle has signed up to a  framework agreement  with four of the other challengers this year which would mean the cup being held every two years in foiling catamarans and a series of match races along the lines of Formula One around the world. But not everyone liked the idea, with some saying it was not true to the spirit of the cup and New Zealand boycotted it. The New Zealand camp have not said so far what they will do if they win the cup back.  Editing by Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sailing-americas-italy-idUSL8N1JM0HZ"},

As the global financial crisis slowly fades from the rear-view mirror, the world's biggest central banks are struggling to decide how and when and what speed they can begin returning their monetary policy settings to something like normality. The highlight of the European Central Bank's  Forum on Central Banking  in Sintra -- the old getaway of Portuguese monarchs -- is likely to be Wednesday's panel discussion including the heads of the European, British, Japanese and Canadian central banks. For the ECB, the main issue over the next few months, after giving up its bias toward more rates cuts earlier this month, is whether to extend or start winding down its bond-buying program. With euro zone growth picking up and inflation slowly moving in the right direction, as price data at the end of the week may show, the idea of extending the program will be anathema to the bank's more hawkish members, Germany in particular. The 2.3 trillion euro program, designed to revive inflation, is set to run until the end of 2017, and a gradual withdrawal known as tapering would carry it well into next year. On top of the economic arguments over whether to extend the program, there is a technical problem: the growing scarcity of German government bonds available for the ECB to buy.  Sources with direct knowledge of the discussion told Reuters this will be a key consideration for the bank when it discusses the bond-buying program.    Data from Germany's Ifo economic institute on Monday is expected to show only a slight fall in business morale this month from last month's record high, which may strengthen the resolve of those opposed to yet more money printing by the central bank.  Our base case is that in September the ECB will announce a reduction of monthly purchases, starting in January 2018,  Credit Suisse analysts said in a weekly note to investors. Boe, Boj, Boc The Bank of England, meanwhile, is caught between rising inflation and a 30-year high in factory orders on the one hand and weak wages, political instability and the complex process of extricating the country from the European Union on the other. FILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi arrives at the ECB Forum in Sintra, Portugal June 28, 2016.Rafael Marchante/File PhotoThe Bank voted 5-3 last week to keep borrowing costs unchanged - a closer outcome than expected - and on Wednesday its chief economist surprised investors by saying he was close to voting for a rate hike, too. Part of the reason for the narrow split is inflation has hit its highest level in nearly four years, pushed up by the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Overall, analysts seem unconvinced that the Bank will vote in favor of increasing borrowing costs anytime soon.  We find it hard to see why the BoE as a committee will risk a rate hike as the country heads into the Brexit negotiations in an environment of high political and economic instability,  Credit Suisse wrote. While the Bank of England and European Central Bank wrestle with their policy problems, however, spare a thought for the Bank of Japan and its bond-buying hangover. After years of snapping up bonds in a bid to revive inflation, the BOJ holds assets equivalent to more than 90 percent of the country's gross domestic product. And still inflation remains far below its 2 percent target rate, as a raft of data due out on Friday are expected to show. Nevertheless, with the economy showing signs of recovery, talk is emerging about how the BOJ can begin preparing an exit strategy. It faces a tricky balancing act: It must convince the markets it has a game plan, but if it reveals too much too quickly, investors could dump their bonds, sending yields sharply higher and destabilizing the market. The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, shocked markets recently when it raised the prospect of hiking rates sooner than had previously been anticipated. But data on Friday showed the country's inflation rate cooled more than expected in May, reducing the odds of an early rate rise. So it too finds itself in the need of a bit of a Portuguese getaway.

Speaking on ARD TV's  Bericht aus Berlin , Schaeuble noted the parliamentary budget committee could by itself approve the 8.5 billion euro ($9.51 billion) loan to Greece, meaning a full debate in parliament was not required.   I don't have any difficulty at all talking openly about it,  Schaeuble said when asked if the full parliament would discuss the loan to Greece as the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have demanded. But he said on June 16 that calls from a senior lawmaker in the SPD, Johannes Kahrs, for a full debate on the deal for Greece could unsettle financial markets. Schaeuble said he had talked to conservative lawmakers in parliament about the deal and the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that was less than conservatives had hoped for, but that there had hardly been any questions about it.

Euro zone ministers, under pressure from the IMF, said they could in 2018 extend the average maturities of Greek loans and grace periods by up to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. But this was not enough for either the IMF or the ECB, with the Fund deciding to wait with disbursements to Greece until the euro zone provides more clarity on debt relief.

In his strongest statement of support for Qatar in the nearly three-week-old crisis centered on the Gulf state, Erdogan said the call to withdraw Turkish forces was disrespectful and that Doha - which described the demands as unreasonable - was taking the right approach.      Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed a boycott on June 5 on Qatar and issued 13 demands including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran, shutting the Turkish base and paying reparations. Doha said it was reviewing the list, but said it was not reasonable or actionable.  We approve and appreciate the attitude of Qatar against the list of 13 demands,  Erdogan, speaking outside a mosque in Istanbul, said.  ...This approach of 13 demands is against international law because you cannot attack or intervene in the sovereignty of a country.  Bahrain's foreign minister said on Sunday that outside interference would not solve the problem.  It is in the interest of these powers to respect the existing regional order which is capable of solving any issue that may arise,  Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa said in a message on Twitter, without naming Turkey. The 13 demands are apparently aimed at dismantling Qatar's interventionist foreign policy which has incensed conservative Arab peers over its alleged support for Islamists they regard as threats to their dynastic rule. Qatar along with Turkey, whose ruling AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics, backed a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt before it was overthrown in 2013. The Arab states have demanded Qatar cut any links to the Brotherhood and other groups they deem to be terrorist, ideological or sectarian.

An air force contingent was also envisaged, it said. Erdogan said Turkey had also offered to establish a military base in Saudi Arabia, but never received a clear answer.  If Saudi Arabia wants us to have base there, a step towards this also can be taken,  he told reporters.  I made this offer to the king himself and they said they will consider this.    They did not come back to us since that day and even though they still didn't come back to us on this, asking Turkey to pull back its troops (from Qatar) is disrespectful against Turkey.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo won in Baku after a chaotic race which saw Ferrari's Vettel given a 10-second stop-go penalty when he steered into the back of race leader Hamilton's Mercedes under safety car conditions after a red-flag stoppage on lap 22. The four-time Formula One champion seemed infuriated with Hamilton after the British driver slowed on the exit of Turn 15. After the initial collision, the German gesticulated angrily with both hands as he then pulled alongside his rival and hit the side of Hamilton's car. After his penalty, imposed by the stewards for dangerous driving, Vettel recovered to finish in fourth, one place ahead of his British rival. The episode left Hamilton incensed.  Deliberately driving into another driver and getting away pretty much scot-free as he still came fourth, I think that's a disgrace. I think he disgraced himself today,  the Briton told Channel 4.  Imagine all the young kids that are watching Formula 1 today and see that kind of behaviour from a four-time world champion. I think that says it all.  If he wants to prove that he's a man, I think we should do it out of the car face to face.  Driving dangerously, which in any way can put another driver at risk... we were going slow, if we had been going fast it could've been a lot worse.  It definitely sets a precedent within F1 and it also does for all the young kids that are watching us drive and conduct ourselves.  They've seen today how a four-time champion behaves and I think, hopefully, that doesn't ripple into the younger categories.  Hamilton also denied the accusation that he had deliberately  brake-tested  his rival, arguing that he was merely  controlling the pace.   Like all the other restarts, I slowed down in the same spot,  he said.  He was obviously sleeping and drove into the back of me.  That wasn't, for me, an issue.  Hamilton began the race in pole and avoided the melee in lap one to establish himself as race leader, but his own progress was stymied when he was forced to cede his lead after pitting due to a loose head rest. While Vettel's sanction saw him drop from second to ninth, he eventually recovered to extend his championship lead over Hamilton to 14 points. Hamilton's disappointing race in Azerbaijan extends his underwhelming record in Baku, with the 32-year-old emulating last year's fifth-placed finish.

Morocco's foreign minister named the man as Said Chaaou, a 50-year-old former parliamentarian from Morocco's northern Rif region, who has been the subject of two arrest warrants accusing him of criminal association and international drug trafficking, issued by a Moroccan court in 2010 and 2015. The Moroccan statement did not accuse Chaaou directly of organizing recent protests in the north of the country but suggested he was involved in supporting unrest in Rif region, long a hotbed of anti-government sentiment. A movement called Hirak al Chaabi in Arabic has led months of protests, accusing officials of corruption.  Specific information has been provided to the Dutch authorities for several months regarding the involvement of this trafficker in financing and providing logistical support to certain sectors in northern Morocco,  the ministry said in a statement.  It was made clear to the Dutch authorities that it is imperative that concrete and urgent measures be taken.  The statement did not name the man, but Morocco's Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita told Reuters it referred to Chaaou. Chaaou did not answer calls to his telephone in the Netherlands and his lawyer could not be contacted immediately. One of the more than 300 lawyers defending Hirak activists who have been detained and imprisoned said that Chaaou had no ties with Hirak.  The Hirak movement has to do with demands of the people who live in the Rif,  said Abdessadak Elbouchattaoui, dismissing as  rumors  reports that Chaaou provided funding and logistical support to Hirak. In a joint statement on their websites, the Netherlands Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Security and Justice dismissed Morocco's decision to recall its ambassador as  incomprehensible and unnecessary . A day before Morocco recalled its ambassador in the Netherlands, Chaaou streamed a nearly two-hour live video on his Facebook page in which he criticized government officials for their treatment of his native Rif region. The video was viewed more than 120,000 times. Since October, demonstrators have repeatedly taken to the streets in Rif around the northern city of Al-Hoceima to vent their frustration over the economic, social and political problems of a North African kingdom that presents itself as a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.  The people of Rif went to the streets with just and legitimate demands,  said Chaaou in the video, in which he also asserted his support for  self-determination  for the region. One senior Moroccan official said Moroccan authorities had in the past arrested and sentenced a Moroccan national on the request of the Netherlands for a crime committed there.  We treat the demands of other countries seriously, and we expect the same from other countries,  the official said.  Chaaou is free and feels protected. That's why he’s trying to become a political leader.  Rif once declared itself independent briefly in 1920s to resist colonial rule. Some government supporters have accused the Hirak protesters of being separatists, an idea rejected by those involved in the Al-Hoceima protests. Chaaou is involved with a group calling for independence for the Rif region. Since the northern protests broke out, authorities have responded by arresting as many as 100 leaders and members of Hirak al Chaabi since the end of May.  Reporting by Samia Errazzouki; Writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by David Goodman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morocco-netherlands-idUSKBN19G0TG"},

The Italian took the lead with 15 laps to go after starting fourth, with French Yamaha Tech3 rider Johann Zarco on pole for the first time, but was then overtaken by Petrucci with five remaining after rain began to fall. Rossi hit back on the following lap and held on to the finish. Zarco fell out of contention after pitting to swap bikes with seven laps to go and then being caught speeding in the pitlane. Vinales had made his way to fifth place before crashing at the chicane.  I can't explain what happened, because I don't even know why I crashed,  he said.  I was pushing myself over the limit, trying to bring the Yamaha to the top and I think that if I hadn't crashed I could have reached the riders in front.  It was everything or nothing and finally I got nothing.

It took the former 22nd-round draft choice a while to make the majors -- he was drafted in 2013 -- but it obviously was worth the wait.  It's something I'll never forget,  Leiter said.  I was probably more excited for this than I was making my major league debut.  Leiter pitched in relief 12 times for the Phillies earlier this season before being called back up to start Friday.

However, drilling a hole into that hopeful scenario is the current bear market in oil prices and an economy showing signs of growth below the pace expected earlier in the year.  A lot of the expectation for a recovery in earnings is predicated on oil prices being around $47-$50 a barrel,  said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.  So if you don't get those numbers, you don't get the strong earnings the stock market needs. This is not trivial stuff. It creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility in forecasts.  U.S. crude futures have been pressured lower by a supply glut. They've averaged over $48 per barrel so far this quarter, but traded around $43 on Friday and are down more than 20 percent from February, when they hit an 18-month high. U.S. stocks are in the ninth year of a bull run which has been fueled of late by bets on pro-growth policies from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, with the timetable for reforms stretching further into the future, earnings are seen as a critical support for stock prices. With indexes near record highs, there is speculation among Wall Street analysts about whether a correction is due. Earnings expectations have dropped for 10 of 11 industry groups since early April, with only industrials looking better than they did then. The benchmark S&P; 500 stock index as a whole is expected to deliver 7.9 percent profit growth, down from 15.3 percent in the first quarter, and below the 10.2 percent forecast in April, Thomson Reuters data shows. On Thursday, Nike will be the first Dow component to report earnings for the most recent quarter. The season heats up in the second week of July. Technology earnings are seen posting double-digit growth, helped by gains in semiconductor companies, and financials are close behind with estimated 8.1-percent profit growth. While lower energy prices can help some sectors such as industrials and transports, as well as boosting consumer sentiment, high expectations for energy earnings growth mean any stumble will be felt broadly. Energy sector profits are seen up a whopping 683 percent from a year ago, when many companies posted losses, according to Thomson Reuters data. Without energy, profit growth estimates drop to 4.8 percent for the quarter. Expectations for the sector will probably have to come down for the second half of the year if low oil prices persist, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.  The one wild card right now is the price of oil. Expectations that are baked into full-year forecasts assume a higher price for oil certainly than we have now,  he said. Energy has been the weakest performing sector so far this year, with the S&P; energy index down near 15 percent. Over-Optimistic Forecasts? The drop in oil prices notwithstanding, some analysts have cautioned that Wall Street has been too optimistic about overall earnings. Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co, cut his 2017 S&P; 500 earnings estimates from $127 to $116, below the $131.51 consensus, as economic growth and inflation are not as high as expected.  I'm looking for CEOs to start taking down their forecasts for the year,  Purves said. In fact, the Citigroup U.S. economic surprise index , a gauge of economic data compared to expectations, this month fell near a six-year low. An Atlanta Federal Reserve model recently forecast second-quarter economic growth coming in at a 2.9-percent annualized pace, down from a previous 3.2 percent. Another hurdle for earnings growth: declining corporate buybacks.  Over the past two years, more than 20 percent of S&P; 500 issues have given at least a 4 percent tailwind for (earnings per share) via reduced share counts,  Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said in a note. For the first quarter of 2017, that rate fell to 14.8 percent of companies, and there are indications of  even less support  in the second quarter, he said.

Hamilton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas finished second after overcoming a first-lap collision with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, while Canadian teenager Lance Stroll was third for his first podium after being pipped on the line by Bottas. Ferrari's Vettel got a 10-second stop-go penalty, which saw him drop from second to ninth, after he steered into race leader Hamilton under safety car conditions after a red-flag stoppage.  Nothing happened, did it?  Vettel said to Sky Sports.  He brake-checked me as well, so what do you expect? I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose but for sure it was not the right move.   I got damage, he risked damage,  added the German.  After the incident, we were side by side, I raised my hand and showed him that I wasn't happy with that.   Vettel reacted incredulously when he learned of the 10-second penalty on lap 32, while Hamilton, whose hopes of victory were later ended when he had to pit due to a loose head rest, complained over his radio that the sanction was insufficient.  I don't really care about (what happened),  Hamilton responded.  It's done and dusted and we move on.  I think it's just not driver conduct. It's dangerous driving and to get a 10-second penalty for that...   I don't need to say anything else.  Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku, Azerbaijan - June 25, 2017.

Australian Ricciardo's first victory since he won the Malaysian Grand Prix last year lifted him to fourth on 92.  Slideshow (12 Images) I can't really believe it,  said Ricciardo.  It was a crazy race. We knew the podium was a chance after the restart, then we heard of the problems with Lewis and Seb.  (I didn't think I'd win) for all my money, but this was the race we expected last year, all the safety cars and chaos. We had to stay out of trouble and certainly pulled it off today.  The 18-year-old Stroll's previous best had been a ninth-placed finish on home soil earlier this month, but he kept his nerve under pressure to become the youngest Formula One driver to make the podium in his maiden season. The anticipated Mercedes dominance was tested early on when Bottas came off the kerb and collided with Ferrari rival Raikkonen, forcing both Finns into the pits.  While Raikkonen was ultimately forced to retire later in the race, Bottas staged a remarkable comeback, emulating his fine performance on the Sochi street circuit to battle back to a podium position before overhauling Stroll on the line. Force India's Esteban Ocon finished sixth, equaling his career-best performance, although he may rue missing out on the podium after clashing with Mexican team mate Sergio Perez, whose retirement ended his 37-race streak of consecutive finishes. Ricciardo's Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen, the pacesetter during practice on Friday, was forced to retire for the fourth time in the last six races with engine trouble on lap 11 after the Dutchman attempted to attack Perez and take third.

The decision will put Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at odds with the Conservative and Reform movements of Judaism that have large followings outside Israel but will smooth his relations with ultra-Orthodox parties in his ruling coalition. The wall is revered as a vestige of Judaism's two ancient temples and access to it is segregated by gender. Most religious rites take place in the men's section in accordance with centuries-old Orthodox standards that hold sway in Israel. The government has faced calls by more progressive Jewish movements in Israel and abroad to add an egalitarian section along the wall and in 2016 voted 15-5 to do so, over the objections of ultra-Orthodox cabinet members. But in the face of opposition from the two ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu's coalition, the plan never got off the ground. Last week, the two parties proposed rescinding the 2016 decision. At its weekly meeting on Sunday, the cabinet voted to formally freeze its implementation, the officials said, and Netanyahu instructed a minister from his Likud party to formulate a new proposal.  Today's decision signifies a retreat from that agreement and will make our work to bring Israel and the Jewish world together increasingly more difficult,  Natan Sharansky, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, a main outreach group to Jewish communities abroad. The mixed-gender section was to have been located at a separate expanse of the wall that, when seen from the plaza looking toward the wall, stands to the right of the current Orthodox-administered compound where men and women will still worship separately. More liberal streams of Judaism, which outside of Israel have larger followings than Orthodoxy, chafe at the restriction. The wall is officially administered by an ultra-Orthodox rabbi.

Previous said the company plans to shift away from that area.) By Solarina Ho TORONTO, June 22 (Reuters) - Sears Canada Inc said on Thursday it plans to cut jobs and close about a quarter of its stores as it restructures its operations after a steady decline in sales due to competition from big-box retailers and online merchants. Like many department stores, the Toronto-based company has struggled for years to attract fashion-conscious shoppers who have embraced apparel stores more adept at keeping up with fast-changing clothing trends. The company, which in 2012 was spun off from U.S. department store pioneer Sears Holdings Corp, said it planned to close 59 of its 225 stores and cut 2,900 of its 17,000 workers as part of a restructuring approved by an Ontario bankruptcy court on Thursday. Sears Canada also plans to file a motion to request permission to suspend certain monthly payments to its pension plan because it is running low on cash, according to court documents. It also intends to stop payments to a post-retirement benefit plan providing retirees with life insurance and medical and dental benefits, according to the filing. Retail experts said they were not convinced the company would succeed in its effort to remain in business, but noted that it could get more for its assets by winding down its operations in several phases, rather than pulling the plug through a liquidation.  It's just been baby steps toward the ultimate end,  said Sally Seston, managing director at Retail Category Consultants Inc.  A forced liquidation becomes a fire sale.   One way or another, it's not going to be an easy road for them. As is the case with all department stores,  said Maureen Atkinson, a senior partner at retail consulting firm J.C. Williams Group. Existing lenders have agreed to provide up to C$450 million ($340 million) in interim financing to help the company controlled by billionaire hedge-fund investor Eddie Lampert focus on selling discounted designer labels and low-priced clothing. The plan shifts away from areas long associated with the iconic Sears brand, such as tools, electronics and auto parts. A spokesman said the retailer will continue to sell home appliances. Lou Brzezinski, an attorney who represents several of the retailer's landlords and suppliers, said his clients were relieved that the company had not given up.  It's a measured and a reasonable approach to continuing operations in Canada and we're happy to see that,  Brzezinski said, but noted the fallout would hit employees and retirees the hardest.  It's the older people who need the money for their medical benefits and their dental benefits. They're the ones that's going to have to pay the price.  The company has total liabilities of C$1.1 billion as of April 29, according to financial disclosures. That includes outstanding loans, accounts payable, pensions and other debt. Its shares tumbled 14.7 percent to 40 cents in Thursday Nasdaq trading after touching a record low of 16 cents earlier in the day. The stock did not trade in Canada, where it was halted by the Toronto Stock Exchange. About 78 percent of Sears Canada shares are held by Lampert and others close to the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sears Canada named Bank of Montreal as its financial adviser and the law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP as its legal adviser. It said FTI Consulting would serve as restructuring consultant.

At a 'feel-good' party conference, leader Martin Schulz accused Merkel of silencing debate on issues like pensions and failing to stand up to the United States. The SPD surged in the polls after naming Schulz as leader in late January, overtaking Merkel's conservatives in some, but those gains have now evaporated and the party is struggling to regain momentum. An Emnid poll on Sunday showed Merkel's conservatives widening their lead to 15 points. In an 80-minute speech before the party agreed its policy manifesto, Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, was most passionate on Europe.  Merkel and (Finance Minister Wolfgang) Schaeuble were very firm when it came to policies like austerity in Europe but you hear little to nothing from them about the rule of law and democracy in the EU,  he said, taking aim at Hungary and Poland. Related CoverageFactbox: Investment, social justice top SPD's German election programHe said the SPD aimed to strengthen Europe by stressing the values of human dignity and by investing in innovation.  The chances of denying Merkel a fourth term look slim for the SPD, who are currently junior partners in her right-left coalition, but some have been inspired by the resurgence by Britain's Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn in a June 8 vote.   What we can learn from the British is that we won't let ourselves be depressed by polls. We will fight for our own convictions,  SPD General-Secretary Hubertus Heil told Reuters. German Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) delivers his speech at the party convention in Dortmund, Germany, June 25, 2017.Wolfgang RattayLike Corbyn, Schulz has succeeded to some extent in appealing to younger voters. Some 40 percent of members who have joined since Schulz's nomination are under 35, says Jusos, the youth branch of the SPD.  Despite a roller-coaster few months, delegates of all ages said they felt energized by Schulz.  Martin Schulz spoke in a very committed way, very inspiring,  delegate Frank Boermann from Berlin told Reuters.  He's managed to lift the party again.  Slideshow (13 Images)But the reality of having lost power in two state elections and failing to win in a third this year has knocked morale   despite the cheers and red flags emblazoned with  Time for Martin Schulz  slogans evident in Dortmund on Sunday. With a sharp fall in the number of refugees arriving in Germany, many voters have forgiven Merkel for her open-door migrant policy and see her as a safe pair of hands. To have any chance of winning in September, the SPD needs to mobilize traditional supporters, who have either not voted or shifted allegiance in the past few years. To that end, Schulz has focused much of his campaign on social justice. He wants to reduce taxes for low-and middle earners, keep pensions stable, extend free education and invest more in infrastructure.  He won a standing ovation for saying he would not sign a coalition deal unless it included a commitment to gay marriage. He has, however, disappointed some on the left by refusing to commit to a wealth tax. To defuse an embarrassing showdown on Sunday, the party is appointing a commission to look into it. The SPD even wheeled out ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the last Social Democrat to lead Germany, to boost morale. He said they could still win and reminded them of the SPD's fightback to run Merkel close in the 2005 election - the last one he fought.

A Philippine senator and Duterte's long-time foe, de Lima was arrested in February on drugs charges she says were trumped up as part of a presidential vendetta. Held at police detention facility in Manila that she shares with murder suspects and mangy cats, the 57-year-old lawyer remains implacably critical of the anti-narcotics campaign and Duterte, who will complete his first year in office this week.  The promise of eradicating drugs has defined his presidency,  she said.  It's actually a sham because they are targeting the wrong people.  Duterte's drug war, she says, targets only small-time dealers and leaves drug lords untouched. Called a  prisoner of conscience  by Amnesty International, de Lima believes the real reason she has been locked up is to stop her asking questions about the thousands of killings that critics say have stained Duterte's presidency. Police say they have shot dead 3,135 suspects in anti-drug operations. They have also identified drugs as the motive in another 2,000 killings, and are investigating a further 7,000 murders and homicides.  De Lima and other critics believe many victims were killed by undercover police or their paid vigilantes - a charge the police deny. Last year de Lima chaired a Senate inquiry into the drug war, grilling senior police and a self-confessed hitman in televised hearings that transfixed the nation. The inquiry looked into allegations that police were summarily executing drug suspects in a pattern similar to killings in Davao City where Duterte had been mayor for 22 years. De Lima's toxic rivalry with Duterte began in 2009 when, as chair of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR), she started investigating a spate of vigilante-style killings in Davao City.  It's personal because of my history as CHR chair,  she said.  I investigated him on his own turf in Davao.  A CHR report three years later confirmed the  systematic practice of extrajudicial killings  by a group known as the Davao Death Squad. Duterte denied any involvement in the murders. Aquino's Gift Dressed in her own clothes rather than prison uniform, de Lima appeared relaxed and healthy as she spoke to Reuters in the visiting room of the detention facility, sealed off by high walls and rusting barbed wire inside the national police headquarters. But she described her incarceration as a kind of purgatory. Pro-Duterte lawmakers threatened last year to screen a tape that purportedly showed de Lima having sex with her driver.  They're sexist pigs,  she said.  The whole point was to further embarrass me.  The tape is fake, she said. De Lima and her siblings have told their 83-year-old mother that she has gone to the United States to study, fearing the truth of her arrest would be too upsetting. De Lima said that someone always watches television with her mother so that they can change the channel if she appears on the news.  Psychologically and emotionally this is very challenging,  said de Lima.  It's worse than death.  She said she feared that unknown enemies might poison her, and she only eats food brought in by family and friends.  De Lima is accused of accepting drug money from prisoners when she was justice secretary from 2010 and 2015. She is not entitled to bail and, if found guilty, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  I'm completely innocent,  she said. De Lima is one of two women and 17 men at the facility. Two of de Lima's fellow inmates are former senators detained on corruption charges after an investigation de Lima had carried out when she was justice secretary. She said she is held separately from the ex-senators and the other detainees, most of whom are held on murder charges.  My only companions are the stray cats,  she said. De Lima said she was given a rabies shot after one of them bit her. With no television, cellphones or electronic devices allowed in her cell, de Lima said she was rediscovering books. She was now reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William Shirer's landmark study of Hitler's Germany. It was a gift from an early visitor to her prison: Benigno Aquino, Duterte's predecessor as president. She said she saw many parallels between Hitler and Duterte, who both  loved being surrounded by misfits.  Asked if she had any regrets about opposing Duterte, de Lima replied:  No, none at all. If I had a second life and the circumstances were the same as they are now, I would do it again.

Duterte took power on June 30 last year, vowing to halt the drug abuse and lawlessness he saw as  symptoms of virulent social disease.  Thanks to his campaign, government officials say, crime has dropped, thousands of drug dealers are behind bars, a million users have registered for treatment, and future generations of Filipinos are being protected from the scourge of drugs.  There are thousands of people who are being killed, yes,  said Oscar Albayalde, Metro Manila's police chief told Reuters.  But there are millions who live, see?  A growing chorus of critics, however, including human rights activists, lawyers and the country's influential Catholic Church, dispute the authorities' claims of success. They say police have summarily executed drug suspects with impunity, terrorizing poorer communities and exacerbating the very lawlessness they were meant to tackle.  This president behaves as if he is above the law - that he is the law,  wrote Amado Picardal, an outspoken Filipino priest, in a recent article for a Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines publication.  He has ignored the rule of law and human rights.  The drug war's exact death toll is hotly disputed, with critics saying the toll is far above the 5,000 that police have identified as either drug-related killings, or suspects shot dead during police operations.   Most victims are small-time users and dealers, while the masterminds behind the lucrative drug trade are largely unknown and at large, say critics of Duterte's ruthless methods. If the strategy was working the laws of economics suggest the price of crystal meth, the highly addictive drug also known as 'shabu', should be rising as less supply hits the streets. But the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency's own data suggests shabu has become even cheaper in Manila. In July 2016, a gram of shabu cost 1,200-11,000 pesos ($24-$220), according to agency's figures. Last month, a gram cost 1,000-15,000 pesos ($20-$300), it said. The wide ranges reflect swings in availability and sharp regional variations. Officials say Manila's street prices are at the lowest end of the range. And that has come down, albeit by just a few dollars.  If prices have fallen, it's an indication that enforcement actions have not been effective,  said Gloria Lai of the International Drug Policy Consortium, a global network of non-governmental groups focused on narcotics. The problem is, according to Derrick Carreon, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency's spokesman, that while nine domestic drug labs have been busted, shabu smuggled in from overseas has filled the market gap. Related CoverageStray cats, killers and no regrets: Duterte's drug-war foe on life in jail Demand needs to be addressed because there are still drug smugglers,  Carreon said. While smuggled shabu has kept the price down in the capital, the official data shows the price has gone up in the already substantially more expensive far-flung regions, like the insurgency-racked southern island of Mindanao. Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao last month after militants inspired by Islamic State stormed Marawi City, and the army's failure to retake the city quickly has dented the president's image as a law-and-order president. Afraid of the Dark Surveys by Social Weather Stations (SWS), a leading Manila pollster, reveal a public broadly supportive of Duterte's anti-drug campaign, but troubled by its methods and dubious about its effectiveness. SWS surveys in each of the first three quarters of Duterte's rule showed a  very high satisfaction  with the anti-drug campaign, said Leo Laroza, a senior SWS researcher. In the most recent survey, published on April, 92 percent said it was important that drug suspects be captured alive. A portrait of Jenny Royo and her husband Rogelio Gilvuena is lighted by a candle inside their shanty at a fishport in Navotas city, metro Manila, Philippines June 18, 2017.Dondi TawataoRespondents also reported a 6.3 percent rise in street robberies and break-ins. More than half of those polled said they were afraid to venture out at night, a proportion that had barely changed since the drug war began, said Laroza.  People still have this fear when it comes to their neighborhoods,  he said.  It has not gone down.  Public and police perceptions of crime levels seem to diverge. The number of crimes committed in the first nine months of Duterte's rule has dropped by 30 percent, according to police statistics cited by the president's communications team. Albayalde, the capital's police chief, said people, particularly in Manila, felt safer now, especially due to a crackdown on drug users who he said commit most of the crime.  In the first 11 months of Duterte's rule, police say 3,155 suspects were shot dead in anti-drug operations. Critics maintain that many of them were summarily executed. Police say they have investigated a further 2,000 drug-related killings, and have yet to identify a motive in at least another 7,000 murders and homicides.  Human rights monitors believe many of these victims were killed by undercover police or their paid vigilantes, a charge the police deny. Slideshow (3 Images)For residents of Navotas fishport, a warren of shacks near Manila's docks, the body count is too high. There were nine killings in a single night in Navotas earlier this month, according to local media. In mid-May, said resident Mary Joy Royo, a dozen gunmen arrived on motorbikes and abducted her mother and stepfather. Their corpses were found later with execution-style gunshots to the head and torso.  They should be targeting the drug lords,  Royo told Reuters.  The victims of the drug war are the poor people.  Ripple Effect As the death toll has risen, so has domestic and international outrage. In October, the Hague-based International Criminal Court said it could investigate the killings if they were  committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population.   Police operations were halted for much of February after it emerged that anti-drug police abducted and killed a South Korean businessman last year, but the outcry over the rising body count has rarely slowed the killing or led to prosecutions. The Philippine Commission on Human Rights is investigating 680 drug-war killings.  In this country the basic problem is impunity,  Chito Gascon, the commission's chairman, said.  No one is ever held to account for the worst violations. Ever.  Police chief Albayalde says that the force's Internal Affairs Service (IAS) investigates all allegations of abuse by his officers.  We do not tolerate senseless killings,  he said.  We do not just kill anybody.  IAS told Reuters it had investigated 1,912 drug-related cases and recommended 159 officers for dismissal due to misconduct during anti-drug operations, although it didn't know whether any had yet been dismissed. Earlier this month, 19 police officers charged with murdering two drug suspects in their jail cell in November were released on bail and now face trial for the lesser crime of homicide. Duterte, who has repeatedly urged police to kill drug suspects, had already vowed to pardon the officers if they were convicted.  You have a head of state who says, 'Kill, kill, kill,' a head of state who says, 'I've got your back,'  said CHR's Gascon.  That has a ripple effect.

As of Sunday morning  Transformers: The Last Knight,  the fifth installment directed by Michael Bay, looks to bring in $69.1 million from 4,069 domestic locations during its five-day opening weekend. That's a franchise low for the sequel from Paramount and Hasbro, behind the first in the modern series, which earned $70.5 million in 2007.  The Last Knight  carries an estimated $217 million production budget. This makes  Transformers: The Last Knight  the latest summer blockbuster to bank on overseas ticket sales to have a shot at turning a profit. In China, the big-budget action sequel made $41 million in its opening day alone. The projected international come through Sunday is $196.2 million, powered by $123.4 million in China.  The Last Knight  comes at a time when Paramount could have used an all-around hit, following recent misses  Baywatch  and  Ghost in the Shell.  While the latest  Transformers  movie has been advertised as  the final chapter  and Bay's last go-around, the franchise will continue -- Paramount has at least two more movies slated, including a spinoff that could star Hailee Steinfeld. The franchise has historically been massively profitable and seen solid multiples for the studio. Together, the first four earned over $1.3 billion domestically and well over $3.5 billion worldwide. The latest take on the series centers on an alliance between Bumblebee, Cade Yeager -- who Mark Wahlberg also played in 2014's  Age of Extinction  -- and roles played by franchise newcomers Anthony Hopkins and Laura Haddock. Together, the team works together to save the world. Audiences have earned the film a B+ CinemaScore, while critics have mostly dismissed it -- it currently holds a 15% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  The Last Knight  was uncontested at the box office this weekend, but a few indie releases showed traction.

This is Focus' third collaboration with Sofia and she's created an entertaining, atmospheric thriller featuring strong female representation in front of and behind the camera.  And Kumail Nanjiani's critically adored romantic comedy  The Big Sick  should earn $435,000 during its opening weekend in five locations -- that would give the Lionsgate and Amazon Studios release the highest per screen average of any film that has opened this year so far.  Kumail and Emily's true story provided audiences of all ages a much-needed alternative to the summer blockbusters,  said Bob Berney, Amazon Studios' distribution chief. Otherwise,  Wonder Woman  continues to post impressive numbers, and holds onto second place during its fourth weekend in theaters. This weekend, it should earn an additional $25.2 million, bringing its domestic total to $318.4 million. Earlier this week, the film became the highest-grossing live-action movie to be directed by a woman -- a major distinction for Patty Jenkins. Disney and Pixar's  Cars 3  also looks to earn $25.2 million domestically during its second weekend. Some estimates have the film slightly lower, just below $25 million. The family film, which won last weekend's box office, is expected to pass the $100 million mark in North America by Monday.  Transformers: The Last Knight's  performance is a tough break for the summer box office's bottom line domestically. For the past two years, this weekend has seen monster grosses for  Jurassic World  and  Finding Dory.

But Kvitova settled into her rhythm in the second, taking a 5-1 lead before stuttering a little at the end of the set with two double-faults handing her opponent a break. But the Czech kept her composure and took the contest into a third set, where she broke in Barty's first service game.

Ankara was infuriated by a U.S. decision last month to arm the YPG, which Washington sees as a vital ally in the battle against Islamic State in its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa but which Turkey deems an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union and Turkey, has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. Turkish defense ministry sources said on Thursday the United States had pledged that weapons provided to the YPG would be taken back once Islamic State was defeated. However Erdogan, addressing members of his ruling AK Party in a speech marking the start of the Islamic Eid holiday, appeared to dismiss those assurances, saying Turkey's friends and allies were cooperating with terrorists.  The ones who think they are tricking Turkey by saying they are going to get back the weapons that are being given to this terrorist organization will realize that they are making a mistake eventually,  he said. Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan talks to media after the Eid al-Fitr prayers in Istanbul, Turkey, June 25, 2017.Murad Sezer But it will be too late for them,  he added, saying that if violence spilled over Syria's border into Turkey, Ankara would hold to account anyone who supplied arms to the YPG.   We will make the real owners of those weapons... pay for any bullet that will be fired to our country, for every drop of blood that will be shed,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump decided to arm the YPG fighters, who form a main part of the U.S.-backed force fighting Islamic State inside Raqqa, despite protests from NATO ally Ankara and a direct appeal from Erdogan at a White House meeting last month. Erdogan said the decision contravened the military alliance's framework of cooperation.    Faced with turmoil across its southern border, Turkey last year sent troops into Syria to support Syrian rebels fighting both Islamic State and Kurdish forces who control a large part of Syria's northern border region.  I want all the world to know that in northern Syria, on our border, we are never going to allow a terrorist state to be established,  Erdogan said.

As Jacques Delors said, for Europe we need a vision and a screwdriver,  Macron told an audience at the Humboldt University, citing the former president of the European Commission.  Unfortunately, we currently have a lot of screwdrivers but we are still lacking a vision.  Now, less than two months after surging to victory in the French election, Macron is filling the void, articulating a path forward for the continent, and crucially, bringing Germany along with him. That was the main take-away from a meeting of European Union leaders last week in which Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel stood side by side at an end-of-summit news conference and sent a message of total unity. After more than a decade of sputtering and stalling, it may be premature to declare that the Franco-German engine is revving on all cylinders again. Macron still faces the daunting challenge of delivering on his plans to reform the French economy. Only if he is successful will he end the mutual distrust between Paris and Berlin that has prevented close cooperation in past years. Merkel, for her part, must win a fourth term in September. If she does, she could still struggle to convince skeptical conservative allies to work with the centrist Macron. But the past weeks, culminating in the joint appearance in Brussels on Friday, have helped lay to rest two of the big question marks that loomed over Macron's election victory last month: whether he could maintain the momentum that propelled him into the Elysee Palace, and whether Merkel would be prepared to embrace his ideas on Europe. For the past decade, as the continent lurched from one crisis to the next, Merkel seemed more comfortable making gradual adjustments to European structures, like tightening screws with a screwdriver, than coming up with inspiring new visions.          Now, with Europe out of acute crisis mode and feeling more confident against a backdrop of economic growth and political disarray in Britain and the United States, the 39-year-old Macron, emboldened by his party's strong performance  in parliamentary elections this month, is stepping into the breach. Full Weight     In Brussels, he made clear that he would not shy away from confronting countries like Poland and Hungary if their right-wing governments failed to respect European democratic values. He promised to respond in kind if countries like China and the United States do not play fair on trade. And he pressed his fellow leaders to embrace a more ambitious approach to European defense cooperation.   On all three of these issues, Merkel's instinct in the past would have been to soft-pedal out of concern for sensitivities in Warsaw, Budapest, Washington, Beijing and - on the issue of defense - in Germany. But in Brussels she threw her full weight behind Macron. This did not go unnoticed in other EU delegations, particularly among eastern Europeans unsettled by the looming departure of Britain and the erratic U.S. presidency of Donald Trump. FILE PHOTO: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron shake hands after a news conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, May 15, 2017.Fabrizio Bensch If the (Franco-German) engine works too well it is not always the best for the EU,  said a senior EU diplomat from an eastern country.  We hope that they will be wise enough to control their speed.  Officials in Britain and the United States are also uneasy. A more confident, assertive Europe is likely to be a tougher counterpart in Brexit negotiations. At the summit, British Prime Minister Theresa May looked diminished and defensive next to the rejuvenated duo of Merkel and Macron. While applauding the political momentum in Europe generated by Macron's victory over far-right leader Marine Le Pen, Charles Kupchan, a former European adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama, expressed concern that a bolder, brasher Europe might end up defining itself in opposition to Washington.  I worry about that,  Kupchan said.  The worst outcome is a revived European project that is in part about breaking with the United States.  Slideshow (5 Images)That seems unlikely given Merkel's Atlanticist leanings. But with an election looming, she has shown a willingness speak out more forcefully against the Trump administration, which is deeply unpopular in Germany. Earlier this month, she surprised people at home and abroad by stating that Europe may not be able to rely on the United States any longer and must prepare to fend for itself. Whether she persists with this defiant line at a G20 summit she will host in Hamburg on July 7-8 will be telling. Euro Zone One of Europe's biggest challenges, reform of the euro zone,  was not a major topic at the meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. But it is the focus of intense talks between Berlin and Paris ahead of a meeting of the two governments a week after the G20 in which a number of new bilateral initiatives are expected to be unveiled. Here too, Merkel has shown a readiness to move towards Macron. Speaking at an industry conference in Berlin last week before the EU summit, she surprised members of her own party by expressing an openness to two of Macron's most controversial ideas - the creation of a budget and a finance minister for the euro zone.  That really got people's attention,  said a senior French official who is involved in the preparations of the Franco-German meeting.  Paris and Berlin are edging closer than they have been in a very long time.

Cynthia Randolph, 24, was being held on Saturday on $200,000 bail for the deaths of her 16-month-old son and 2-year-old daughter last month, Danie Huffman, a spokeswoman for the Parker County Sheriff's Office, said in an email. Randolph had originally told investigators that she had been folding laundry and watching television in her rural home west of Fort Worth while the boy, Cavanaugh Ramirez, and his sister Juliet Ramirez played in a back porch, according to a criminal complaint. After noticing the children were missing, Randolph told officers she found them unresponsive in a locked car and broke a window to rescue them. The temperature was close to 96 Fahrenheit (36 Celsius) and emergency personnel that Randolph had called pronounced the children dead at the scene, the court filing said. Cynthia Marie Randolph, 24, arrested in connection with the deaths of her two young children after the children died in the car from heat exposure, seen in undated booking photo received by Parker County Sheriff's Office in Weatherford, Texas U.S., on June 24, 2017.

When she told them to get out and they refused, Randolph  shut the car door to teach Juliet a lesson, thinking she could get herself and her brother out of the car when ready,  the statement said. Randolph went inside the house, smoked marijuana and took a nap for two or three hours. When she awoke, she found the children unresponsive inside the car and broke the window to make it look like an accident, the statement said. Randolph faces two first-degree felony counts of injury to a child causing serious bodily injury. Huffman and a person who answered the phone at the Parker County jail had no information about whether she had an attorney.

They started abusing us, saying we were Muslims and traitors. They said we should go back to Pakistan,  Junaid's brother Shakir told television channel CNN-News18. Goyal said one of the attackers had been arrested and they were hunting for others in the group. The attack was the latest against Muslims who make up about 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion population. In April, a Muslim dairy farmer was lynched in the north-western state of Rajasthan for allegedly smuggling cows. Opposition groups have criticized Modi for failing to speak up against the violence targeted at Muslims, accusing his party of a sectarian bias.  An atmosphere of hatred and Islamophobia is being created in the country,  said Asaduddin Owaisi, the head of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (All India Council of the Union of Muslims).

FIFA would not confirm a report in Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper that the 23 members of Russia's squad at the 2014 World Cup were among those being investigated. It said that the entire squad underwent pre-competition and post-match doping tests, which were all negative and which were under FIFA's direct control. Russia's deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko, who is also head of the Russian Football Union, dismissed the allegations and said there never was nor will be doping in Russian soccer.   Don't pay attention to this, they have been writing about us negatively since 2010,  he told the TASS news agency.   Our national team is endlessly checked. We have doping tests at all matches. In soccer this has never been a central theme.  A report by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren in December said more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and paralympic sport were involved in or benefited from an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive doping tests.  The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said that more than 30 sports, including soccer, were involved. Russia will host next year's World Cup and is currently staging the Confederations Cup, considered a dress rehearsal for the 2018 tournament.  FIFA has simply confirmed that, in close collaboration with WADA, it is still investigating the allegations involving football players in the so-called McLaren report,  said FIFA in an emailed statement to Reuters.  FIFA said it had not referred to any particular players and  cannot comment on the status of ongoing investigations.  It said it wanted investigations to be completed quickly and that it could not provide further details until then.  All players participating in the 2014 FIFA World Cup – including all members of the Russian squad – underwent pre-competition and post-match tests, all of which resulted negative,  it added.   FIFA was in charge of the tests and sent all samples to be analyzed by the WADA-accredited laboratory in Lausanne.  Russia were knocked out in the group stage of the tournament after losing to Belgium and drawing against South Korea and Algeria.

The speeding tanker overturned on a sharp bend on a highway on the outskirts of the city of Bahawalpur. The driver lost control when the vehicle blew a tire, a provincial government spokesman said. A large crowd of people gathered, many to collect fuel in containers, and the tanker exploded in a huge fireball about 45 minutes later. Rescue workers said that about 80 people had been injured.  People of the area and passers by had started gathering fuel when it exploded, burning everybody,  provincial government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan told Reuters. An estimated 20 children were among the dead, he said. The accident happened the day before Pakistan celebrates the Eid al-Fitr festival, when families get together to celebrate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Many bodies were burned beyond recognition and television pictures showed piles of burnt out motorcycles, apparently those of people who were collecting fuel or watching events unfold. Police had tried to clear the area before the tanker exploded but people ignored them, Khan said, adding that the initial crash had blocked the road, causing a traffic tailback. The driver of the tanker survived the accident and was taken into police custody, he said. The explosion took place on a stretch of highway cutting through the village of Ramzan Joya. Khalil Ahmed, a 57-year-old former government employee who lives in the village, said he had lost 12 relatives in the fire, which firefighters extinguished in two hours.  One body has been recovered and 11 others are still missing,  Ahmed said.  After the spill, people began calling their relatives to come and gather the oil, and some showed up from nearby villages as well. There must have been 500 people gathered when the fire began.  Oil is a precious commodity for villagers in Pakistan, where more than 60 percent of the population survives on $3 a day, according to a World Bank survey.  People were collecting oil in bottles, cans and household utensils. We tried to get them to move back before the fire started but no one was listening,  Ahmed said. He estimates that about 100 people from the small hamlet are missing.  The day of judgment has arrived for our village,  he said. About 50 people were killed in bomb attacks in Pakistan on Friday but there was no suggestion of an attack on Sunday.  According to initial reports, somebody tried to light a cigarette,  said rescue services spokesman Jam Sajjad Hussain. Police in the area could not be reached for immediate comment.

The eight Muslim leaders entered the conflict zone in the heart of Marawi City alongside rescue teams. It was not immediately clear what was discussed with Abdullah Maute, one of two brothers in charge of the Islamist group named after them. Retired General Dickson Hermoso, who coordinates efforts to free trapped civilians, said a unilateral eight-hour truce by the army to mark the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday was extended to enable the talks, details of which he withheld to avoid jeopardizing chances for dialogue.  We need to balance this because this is very precarious,  Hermoso told reporters. He said the Maute group released some women and children on Sunday and the emissaries had come under fire briefly from rebel snipers.  We have only established a foothold with the Maute,  he said.  We hope both sides will again grant us the respite.   The military had on Saturday said Abdullah Maute had fled from the town and was no longer in the fight. Though they have no solid evidence, the authorities believe his brother, Omarkhayam, was among three of the seven Maute brothers killed.   A source familiar with the meeting said the emissaries were from Marawi and were only granted access to Maute because they were of the same  Maranao  clan. The seizure of Marawi has caused the biggest internal security crisis in decades for the Philippines, and a realization that the long-feared arrival of Islamic State could be a reality. Images of black-clad fighters and Islamic State flags flying in Marawi has caused alarm in the mainly Roman Catholic nation, and the protracted occupation and presence of foreign fighters suggests the militants may have bigger designs on the southern Philippines than previously imagined. The daily air strikes were halted on Sunday but small skirmishes took place as rebel snipers fired intermittently on positions held by troops. Rescue teams tried to reach trapped civilians and recover bodies of dead residents killed in the heart of a city battered for weeks by clashes, air strikes and artillery shelling.

We have reports there were around five people who came out from ground zero,  Herrera told news channel ANC.  We're very confident we can rescue more.  Muslims attended prayers at a Marawi mosque in an emotional gathering. The violence has displaced some 246,000 people, and killed more than 350, most of them rebels, and about 69 members of the security forces. Twenty-six civilians have been killed but officials believe many more could be dead. Slideshow (9 Images) This is supposed to a day of happiness,  said Imam Aleem Ansari Abdul Malik, who led the prayers.  Families should be together but they were torn apart.  He reminded Muslims to shun the advances of radical groups.  This is just a small fire, do not allow the flames to go bigger by joining extremists,  he said. Conditions for those trapped in Marawi have been dire, with witnesses reporting bodies on streets, limited food and water and a constant threat of being killed by either the militants, or air strikes. The threat of Islamic State gaining a foothold in the Philippines has been raised by their losses in Syria and Iraq, and intelligence reports that the militants are seeking new bases from which to project their agenda. Though the military is confident it can retake Marawi soon, the level of the militants' preparations, combat capability and resilience has created some trepidation about whether their assault could be the beginning of a wider campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Emmanuel Garcia, head of the Western Mindanao civil-military operations, on Saturday said intelligence indicated that Malaysian operative and extremist fundraiser Mahmud Ahmad had been killed, while Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State anointed  emir  of Southeast Asia, had fled.

Atlanta (36-38) was supposed to be in the midst of its rebuilding cycle this season but is looking like veteran contenders of late with wins in seven of the last eight contests, including a 3-1 triumph on Saturday in the second game of the series behind 42-year-old R.A. Dickey and 35-year-old Brandon Phillips.  It's been a good homestand and we played good baseball all up and down the lineup,  Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters.  The bullpen, the starting pitching, and guys are just playing the game and expecting to win right now.  The Brewers (40-37) are going through a bit of a funk offensively and did not score more than four runs in any of their last seven games. Milwaukee's bats will try to provide more support on Sunday for right-hander Zach Davies, who goes up against Atlanta's Julio Teheran.

The 24-year-old enjoyed a stretch of five straight starts bridging May and June when he allowed three or fewer earned runs in each but struggled in his last two turns. Davies allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings in his lone previous start against Atlanta - a no decision on Aug. 8, 2016. Teheran allowed three or fewer earned runs in each of his last three outings but suffered a loss against San Francisco on Tuesday, when he was reached for four runs - three earned - and six hits over 7 1/3 innings. The Colombia native runs into trouble with the home run ball and surrendered a total of 12 in his last seven turns. Teheran is 2-2 with a 1.91 ERA in six career starts against Milwaukee. Walk-Offs 1.

The Cardinals hope to avoid a sweep at the hands of the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday, when the National League Central rivals wrap up their three-game series. St. Louis swept a home series against Pittsburgh while posting a 12-12 record in April and followed that up by going 13-13 in May despite winning nine of its first 12 that month. The Cardinals' pitching has fallen on hard times lately, however, and the team fell to 8-15 in June following Saturday's 7-3 setback - the 10th time this month it has surrendered at least six runs. While the Cardinals lost for the eighth time in 11 contests to clinch their first sub-.500 month since June 2016, the Pirates have won nine of 14 and guaranteed themselves a series win at a venue where they had dropped seven straight prior to Friday's triumph. Saturday's result marked the first time in five meetings this season the outcome was decided by more than one run.

The 24-year-old native of Delaware hasn't worked past the fifth inning in any of his last 11 outings, although he has fared much better on the road (1-2, 3.45 ERA) than at home (1-4, 7.36). Kuhl took the loss in one of his best starts of the season on April 18 at St. Louis, giving up two runs and three hits over six frames. Leake turned in his finest effort in nearly a month Tuesday at Philadelphia but did not stay around long enough to get a decision despite allowing one run and three hits over six innings of an 8-1 victory. The outing halted a four-start losing streak for the Arizona State product, who was 5-2 with a 1.91 ERA through nine starts before posting a 6.20 ERA over his next four turns prior to Tuesday. Leake has fared well in 29 career starts against the Pirates, going 10-5 with a 3.29 ERA. Walk-Offs 1.

The BIS, an umbrella body for leading central banks, said in one of its most upbeat annual reports for years that global growth could soon be back at long-term average levels after a sharp improvement in sentiment over the past year.  Though pockets of risk remain because of high debt levels, low productivity growth and dwindling policy firepower, the BIS said policymakers should take advantage of the improving economic outlook and its surprisingly negligible effect on inflation to accelerate the  great unwinding  of quantitative easing programs and record low interest rates. New technologies and working practices are likely to be playing a roll in suppressing inflation, it said, though normal impulses should kick in if unemployment continues to drop.  Since we are now emerging from a very long period of very accommodative monetary policy, whatever we do, we will have to do it in a very careful way,  BIS's head of research, Hyun Song Shin, told Reuters.  Stay the Course   If we leave it too late, it is going to be much more difficult to accomplish that unwinding. Even if there are some short-term bumps in the road it would be much more advisable to stay the course and begin that process of normalization.  Shin added that it will be  very difficult, if not impossible  to remove all those bumps.  Related CoverageEuro zone lenders dampen global banking recovery decade after crisis: BISGood communication from central bankers will be important, but even more crucial is the need for banks to be strong enough to cope with any turbulence. The BIS identified four main risks to the global outlook in the medium-term. A sudden flare-up of inflation which forces up interest rates and hurts growth, financial stress linked to the contraction phase of financial cycles, a rise in protectionism and weaker consumption not offset by stronger investment. The first seems unlikely for now at least, with Shin saying that the BIS, like many, had been surprised that inflation and wage growth has remained so subdued as growth in major economies has picked up. The question for central bankers, therefore, is whether new technologies and working practices had fundamentally changed the inputs in their economic models and whether it is right to keep such a heavy focus on keeping inflation at certain levels -- near 2 percent for likes of the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve.   Inflation is certainly not the only variable that matters ... and we should keep one eye at least on financial developments,  Shin said. A broadening away from inflation-targeting to financial market conditions would require a mindset change in large parts of the world and could speed up interest rate cycles. When the U.S. Federal Reserve last embarked on rate increases more than a decade ago, it took two years to raise them from 1 percent to above 5 percent, with hikes at 17 consecutive meetings. In the current cycle, it has taken 18 months for a 1 percentage point increase. Protectionism The BIS report added that the lack of clarity over inflation also makes it far harder to judge how far rates could go up before they start coming down again.   In practice, therefore, central banks have little alternative but to move without a firm end-point in mind,  it said.  The report also touched on another current global theme -- protectionism, potentially one of the most damaging of the four main risks it identified. One piece of research based on the U.S. transport industry estimated that if 10 percent tariffs were put on imports from Mexico or China, U.S. labor costs would have to drop by about 6 percent to compensate for the higher costs of  imported inputs . For some of the largest emerging markets there were also concerns about dollar debt and protracted credit expansion, often alongside rising property prices, storing up risks. Low interest rates, though, have generally kept debt-service ratios below critical thresholds.  The policy challenge is to take advantage of the current tailwinds to put the expansion on a sounder footing,  said Claudio Borio, head of the BIS monetary and economic department.  First and foremost, that requires building resilience, domestically and globally.   The BIS’s financial results, which were also published on Sunday, showed the Swiss-based bank had made a net profit $1.124 billion over the year to March 31 and had a balance sheet worth $329 billion.

The financial sector faces an improving but still challenging environment,  the BIS, a forum for central bankers, said in its annual report.  The near term economic outlook has brightened substantially and financial headwinds have turned into tailwinds in many advanced economies.  Banks should use the  growth dividend  to increase their resilience to market shocks and reshape business models, it added. An improved economy will stop the rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) whose repayments have fallen behind.  That said, the banking systems in some jurisdictions still look vulnerable to a further deterioration in credit quality. In a number of euro area countries, for example, the share of NPLs remains stubbornly high.  Euro zone authorities had to intervene in struggling Spanish bank Banco Popular earlier this month, and face pressure to sort out some of Italy's problem lenders as well. But economists say that Europe was hit by two crises - one financial, the other related to euro zone countries' debt. In the meantime, U.S. banks have benefited from their main market being in a stronger phase of the economic cycle - though the euro zone economy is recovering. Europe, however, is widely seen as being slower and less aggressive in tackling struggling banks compared with the United States, and the region is still  overbanked . The BIS said banks globally have made progress in cutting leverage and diversifying income, but market valuations for many lenders still point to investor scepticism, the BIS said. The price to book ratio of euro area lenders remains below 1, meaning a bank's market value is less than its balance sheet, it added. The gap between observed and required returns-on-equity has narrowed, but in Europe the gap widened most recently, highlighting persistent pressure to further improve profitability, the BIS said. BIS economic adviser and head of research, Hyun Song Shin, said European banks were also helping to give the impression that finance globally, as measured by cross-border lending, was in headlong retreat.  The consolidated perspective makes clear that the shrinkage of international banking is largely confined to European-headquartered banks,  Shin said.

The Food and Allied Workers Union and employers from eight Illovo farms in Kwa-Zulu Natal province have failed to reach an amicable agreement under the auspices of the CCMA and a strike certificate has been issued,  an FAWU statement said. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is a dispute resolution body mandated by law to mediate labour disputes. Illovo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of London-listed Associated British Foods and operates in South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Swaziland. The labour dispute comes as the South African economy is in recession for the first time since 2009 because of weakness in manufacturing and trade. There is also growing opposition in the country to President Jacob Zuma, whose decision in March to fire finance minister Pravin Gordhan triggered credit downgrades by all three major credit rating agencies. FAWU members are seeking a 10 percent wage increase, versus the 5 percent annual rise the union says employers are offering, as well as pension benefits for both full-time and seasonal workers among a host of other demands.  That 5 percent is an insult. If you look at what the inflation rate has been since December, it would mean workers are toiling for nothing,  provincial FAWU organiser August Mbhele said. Mbhele said the lowest paid workers on sugarcane farms earned around 2,752 rand ($213.06) monthly, and that most lived over 30 km (18.6 miles) away from the farms and struggled to find or afford transport. Illovo was not immediately available for comment. Agriculture accounts for less than 5 percent of South Africa's GDP but is expected to help to boost the economy after recovering from last year's drought.

In an article written for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Welby, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion of millions of Christians globally, said Britons remain deeply divided over Brexit after negotiations got under way last week. May is struggling to repair her authority after losing the Conservatives' parliamentary majority in the June 8 election. She faces pressure from inside and outside her party to temper her plans for a clean break with the EU, with some politicians pushing for Britain to stay in the bloc's customs union or even its broader single market.      We must develop a forum or commission or some political tool which can hold the ring for the differences to be fought out, so that a commonly agreed negotiating aim is achieved,  Welby wrote.

The perpetrators had scaled the fence of the police post near police headquarters and shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing the officer, said Ginting. The attack will compound fears about rising militancy in Indonesia, which has the world's biggest Muslim population. Islamic State sympathizers have carried out a series of mostly low-level attacks in Indonesia over the past few years. National police spokesman Setyo Wasisto said authorities were investigating whether the attackers were inspired by Islamic State and acting on the instructions of Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian who went to fight for the militants in Syria.

Weidmann, who sits on the ECB's rate-setting Governing Council, also said that the bank should not make any further changes to the key parameters of its bond purchase scheme, comments that signal opposition to an extension of asset buys since the ECB will soon hit its German bond purchase limits. Hoping to revive growth and inflation, the ECB is buying 2.3 trillion euros worth of bonds, mostly government debt, a scheme known as quantitative easing and long opposed by Germany, Europe's biggest economy. The purchases are set to run until December and the ECB will decide this fall whether to extend it in order to boost inflation further or to wind it down, or taper.  As far as a possible extension of the bonds-buying program goes, this hasn't yet been discussed in the ECB Council,  Weidmann told the newspaper in an interview.   But in my view, if the solid economic development and price development continues, as expected, it would be time to take a look at an exit from the very easy monetary policies,  he said. Having flirted with deflation for years, price growth is now firmly above 1 percent but will miss the ECB's target of almost 2 percent for years to come, its staff projections show.  A key issue is that self-imposed rules allow the ECB to hold up to one third of each country's debt and given Germany's relatively low debt burden, it is likely to hit this level in the first half of next year.  Any meaningful extension would therefore require a change in the program's rules, a move Weidmann said he firmly opposed. A key risk to curbing stimulus may be pressure from governments since any rise in borrowing costs threatens to blow a hole in national budgets after years of rock-bottom borrowing costs.  This can lead to a political pressure on the Governing Council to continue the loose monetary policies longer than necessary,  Weidmann said. Weidmann, touted a potential successor to ECB President Mario Draghi when his term ends in late 2019, also said that Germany was not in need of stimulus as employment and capacity utilization were already high.

Dismissed as a left-wing no-hoper before elections on June 8, Corbyn attracted a surge of support from 18-24 year-olds that helped his Labour Party deny Prime Minister Theresa May a parliamentary majority. The 68-year old's popularity at Worthy Farm in south-west England could be measured by the number of pro-Corbyn banners on display and Corbyn T-shirts. They easily outnumbered those for the biggest names on the musical bill - Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran - and the chant  Oh, Jeremy Corbyn  rang round the world's biggest greenfield festival. Appearing between British singer-songwriter Craig David and U.S. rap act Run The Jewels, Corbyn - who promised during campaigning to abolish tuition fees -  said he was proud to have led Labour into an election that delivered the biggest increase in the party's support since 1945.  But what was even more inspiring was the number of young people who got involved for the very first time because they were fed up with being denigrated, fed up with being told they don't matter (and) fed up with being told they never participate,  he said to cheers from the crowd.  And that politics that got out of the box isn't going back into the box.  Corbyn, invited to speak on the famous stage by festival founder Michael Eavis, said Glastonbury was about people coming together in support of causes like environmentalism.  There is only one planet - not even Donald Trump believes there is another planet somewhere else,  he said. Eleri Angharad, a 25-year-old musician sporting a Corbyn T-shirt, said the veteran socialist was authentic.  He makes an effort to connect with people, and people connect back with him,  she said. Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses revellers from the Pyramid Stage at Worthy Farm in Somerset during the Glastonbury Festival in Britain, June 24, 2017.Dylan MartinezShe said she wasn't surprised by his support among young people, having seen his popularity rise on social media.  I don't read newspapers, I don't know anybody who does,  she said. But not every young person was won over.  It's very smart to target our age with tuition fees,  said 18-year old Hannah, who voted for the first time on June 8.  He's targeting the naive of our generation.  Engagement Slideshow (4 Images)Corbyn pulled out of a Glastonbury visit last year after the country voted to leave the European Union just as the festival started. Billy Bragg, the singer, songwriter and activist who runs the Leftfield politics and music stage, said Brexit had shocked young people into becoming interested in politics, and their influence had been seen a year later.   Even if it wasn't the youth 'what won it', the engagement among young people has shot up,  he said.  If it can be sustained, it's a sea change in British politics because it means that all parties will have to take their views into account.   An undercurrent of politics also swirled around the Other Stage, where former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher ended his set by asking the crowd to join in a rendition of  Don't Look Back in Anger  in memory of the victims of recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, and the Grenfell Tower fire. Pollster Ipsos Mori said week that age had been a bigger dividing factor on June 8 than in any election since it began keeping records in 1979, with the biggest rise in turnout coming from the young, although they were still far less likely to vote than the old. Both main parties increased their share of the national vote compared with 2015, at the expense of smaller parties. But Labour's share increased by 9.5 points to 40 percent, while the Conservatives' rose 5.5 points to 42.4 percent. Overall, the Conservatives lost 13 seats and Labour gained 30.    editing by John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-music-glastonbury-corbyn-idUSKBN19F0PS"},

Foreign Minister Wang Yi was scheduled to speak in Islamabad on Sunday, a day after meeting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul. Wang said a three-way conference mechanism involving the two countries and China could promote dialogue and cooperation, the Chinese ministry said in a statement.  China sincerely wishes for Afghanistan and Pakistan to improve relations, rebuild mutual trust strengthen cooperation, achieve mutual safety and mutually development,  Wang said, according to the statement.  As Afghanistan and Pakistan's mutual friend, China encourages them to establish a crisis prevention and management mechanism as soon as possible, to properly deal with any kind of sudden occurrence.  In Pakistan, Wang  held wide-ranging discussions  on bilateral relations, regional security and the situation in Afghanistan, the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a tweet. Afghanistan and Pakistan have been uneasy neighbors ever since Pakistan's independence in 1947. Their ties have been poisoned in recent years by Afghan accusations that Pakistan is supporting Taliban insurgents fighting the U.S.-backed Kabul in order to limit the influence of its old rival, India, in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies that and says it wants to see a peaceful, stable Afghanistan. Several people were killed when Afghanistan and Pakistan border troops exchanged fire for hours in early May. As a result, a major border crossing was closed for more than three weeks. 'China's Fight' In his annual Eid al-Fitr message, Afghanistan's Ghani said he had met Wang and the two had discussed peace and stability and the joint fight against terrorism. Ghani used the message, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, to call on armed opposition groups including the Taliban to join the peace process, if they were genuine Afghans concerned about the loss of innocent lives. China is also worried about the spread of Islamist militancy from lawless ethnic Pashtun lands along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, in particular the danger of members of its Uighur Muslim minority being radicalized there. In Pakistan on Saturday, Wang said counter-terrorism was an important part of China's relations with Pakistan and he thanked  Pakistan  for its firm support for China's fight against the violent terrorist group the 'East Turkistan Islamic Movement',  China's Xinhua news agency reported. China says the East Turkistan Islamic Movement is a violent Uighur group, with links to militants in South Asia, who want to make the far western region of Xinjiang a separate state. Uighur exiles and rights groups though say unrest in Xinjiang is more a reaction to repressive government policies than the plotting of any cohesive militant group. Beijing denies abusing rights in Xinjiang. China is also investing heavily in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has promised $57 billion in investment in projects along a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of its ambitious Belt and Road plan linking China with the Middle East and Europe.

The left-handed ace didn't give them another. After toughing out a 33-pitch first inning that included a bases-loaded, one out situation, Kershaw settled into his dominating form and throttled the Rockies for his 11th victory of the season. He allowed four hits and a walk in six shutout innings as the Dodgers won their ninth straight 4-0. Joc Pederson extended the club's streak of games with a home run to 16 with a first-pitch shot to center in the third inning, the longest streak since the 1960 team hit one in 17 straight. They're 15-1 in those games.  I don't recommend throwing 33 pitches in an inning,  Kershaw said.  I've had some struggles in the first inning. At a point you just try to limit the damage. It's a cliche, but the mindset is to forget what's happened and just make the next pitch.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DodgersColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchA double by DJ LeMahieu, infield single by Nolan Arenado and a walk loaded the bases with one out, but Kershaw struck out Ian Desmond on four pitches and Trevor Story on three to end the threat. After the walk in the first, Kershaw retired 13 straight and 17 of the last 19 Rockies he faced. Brandon Morrow, Pedro Baez and Sergio Romo retired nine of 10 Rockies to close it out.  You're always concerned when the pitch count gets over 30 with one out in the first,  manager Dave Roberts said.  But Clayton finds another level. Plus, guys squeeze the bat a little harder when they're facing a guy like Clayton.  The hard-hitting Rockies have scored one run in the first two games of the series and have lost a season-high four straight. They've gone from a half-game ahead of the Dodgers in the NL West to 3 1/2 games behind in a blink.  You've got to capitalize on those (chances),  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  At least get a run. That was a tough one. We had him 30 plus pitches. It looked as though we might be able to break through in the first.  That shows the caliber of talent he is, to be able to get a strike out with the bases loaded. And then get the out after that as well. He's not pitching around guys. He's going at you with three solid pitches.  Kershaw has been especially rough on the Rockies. He is 21-6 all-time in 36 starts with a 3.04 ERA, the most wins against any team he's faced. He has a career 1.46 ERA covering 17 starts against Colorado at Dodger Stadium. Pederson's home run was his sixth of the season and fourth in his last 11 games. He's hitting .333 during that span with seven RBIs.  It's fun to be a part of this,  said Pederson, who has been on the disabled list twice this season.  'You're always looking for a good first pitch to hit. But there's not a thought in the clubhouse about home run streaks at all. We have a nice routine going.  Rockies starter Tyler Chatwood (6-8) walked eight in 3 1/3 innings, tying his career high, including two in the second inning that produced a run and four in the third for two more.  It's pretty frustrating, especially because I felt like I beat myself tonight,  Chatwood said. NOTES: Dodgers SS Corey Seager has a Grade 1 hamstring strain in his right leg and sat out Saturday's game. He had a MRI exam Saturday morning to examine the injury he suffered in the second inning Friday. He's listed as day-to-day. ... Rockies CF Charlie Blackmon singled in the fifth for his 100th hit of the season. ... Rockies RF Carlos Gonzalez was out of the lineup again with a sore right shoulder. ...

The fighting has displaced some 246,000 people, and killed more than 350 people, most of them rebels, and about 69 members of the security forces.  This is the most painful, the most sorrowful occasion, Eid al-Fitr, that we have experienced for the last hundreds of years,  said Zia Alonto Adiong, a spokesman for the provincial crisis committee. In Malaysia, the civil war in Yemen was on the minds of two refugees who prayed at the main mosque in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Sisters Sumayah and Nabila Ali said they sought refuge in Malaysia after fleeing Yemen where more than 10,000 people have died in two years of conflict.  When we say poor people, children who are not safe, are always in danger, we hope that one day it will be safe again and people will be happy again. Inshallah,  said 28-year-old Sumayah.

And more importantly, his back is pain-free. The right-hander, who was activated from the 10-day disabled list earlier in the day, pitched five-plus innings, allowing one run on four hits with no walks and eight strikeouts, as the Houston Astros defeated the Seattle Mariners 5-2 Friday night at Safeco Field. McCullers (7-1) said he was more concerned his arm was almost too lively after getting a two-week break between starts.  Coming out of the 'pen, I didn't know if I was going to throw strikes tonight,  McCullers said.  My arm felt extremely good, definitely fresher than I'm used to.  McCullers opened with four perfect innings before Nelson Cruz led off the fifth with a single.  I thought he was great,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of McCullers.  It was nice to see him come out pretty hot. He was mid-90s from the very beginning and had a really good breaking ball.  They put a couple good swings on him mid-game, but I don't think we could have asked for much more coming back from a long break.  Josh Reddick hit a two-run homer in the third inning and Brian McCann added a three-run double in the seventh for the American League West-leading Astros, who won for the fifth time in six games and snapped the second-place Mariners' season-high winning streak at six. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at MarinersHouston Astros - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch They have one of the best lineups, top to bottom, we've faced all year,  McCullers said.  For us to be able to bounce back (from a 13-3 loss Friday) and get a win, it's good for us.  The Mariners made things interesting in the ninth against Houston closer Ken Giles, loading the bases with two outs to bring up pinch hitter Mike Zunino, whose 29 RBIs this month lead the major leagues. Giles walked Zunino on a 3-2 pitch to bring in a run, but struck out Carlos Ruiz on a called third strike to end it. Ruiz lined a 1-1 pitch down the left-field line that just hooked foul, otherwise the Mariners might have tied it.  It's tough to win games,  Hinch said.  I mean, we played pretty well and they battled at the end.  Leading 2-1, the Astros loaded the bases in the seventh with singles by George Springer and Carlos Correa and a catcher's interference call on Ruiz. With two outs, McCann hit a ball down the right-field line. Mitch Haniger made a diving attempt and had the ball in his mitt, but it popped out when Haniger hit the turf. The three-run double gave Houston a 5-1 advantage.  Some nights it's literally a game of inches,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Haniger gave everything he had to get to the ball and Chooch (Ruiz) missed a big hit late by about a foot.  The Mariners' first hit came in an unlikely fashion, on an infield single by Cruz. Cruz topped the ball down the third-base line. Alex Bregman charged and made a bare-handed play, but his throw wasn't in time. Kyle Seager followed with a one-hop double off the center-field wall, putting Mariners at second and third. McCullers struck out Haniger and then got Jarrod Dyson to ground directly to second baseman Jose Altuve. Cruz was caught midway between third base and the plate, caught in a rundown by McCann for the second out as Seager advanced to third. Taylor Motter struck out to end the inning. The Mariners threatened again in the sixth as Ruiz led off with a double and Jean Segura hit a sharp grounder up the middle that shortstop Correa was able to knock down but had no chance to make a play at first. That spelled the end for McCullers.  A.J. didn't tell me a pitch count, but I knew I was close (to being done) after the fifth,  McCullers said.  I just tried to get ahead and stay ahead.  Reliever Will Harris came in with runners at first and third. He struck out Ben Gamel before Robinson Cano grounded a run-scoring single to right field, with Segura taking third. But Harris got Cruz to ground into an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play, preserving Houston's 2-1 lead. Seattle starter Sam Gaviglio (3-2) escaped two-on jams in each of the first two innings, but not in the third. George Springer led off the inning with a single, then was awarded another base when second-base umpire Angel Hernandez called Gaviglio for a balk on a pick-off attempt. That seemed to unnerve the rookie right-hander as Reddick crushed a 1-0 pitch over the center-field wall to open the scoring. Gaviglio went six innings, allowing the two runs on six hits. He walked three and struck out three.  Gaviglio did a real good job, about all we could ask for,  Servais said.

Far-right activists from the True Blue Crew, which says it is opposed to refugees and the  Islamisation  of Australia, faced off with members of a left-wing coalition promoting tolerance in the city. Australia has seen a rise in far-right activist groups and political parties opposed to Islam and Asian immigration following a number of ‘lone wolf’ attacks by home-grown Islamist radicals. Victoria Police said one person was arrested for possession of a weapon and one detained for breach of the peace, and a knife and a knuckle duster were confiscated. “Police were forced to deploy capsicum spray when a small number of protestors attempted to breach a police line, with one person given aftercare as a result of the capsicum spray,” a spokeswoman said. TV footage showed nationalist protesters holding Australian flags on poles or draped around their shoulders, while opposition protesters held placards with anti-racism messages. The rally attracted hundreds of protesters and a heavy police presence kept the opposing groups separated, local media reported. Australia, a staunch ally of the U.S., has been on high alert for home-grown Islamist attacks since 2014 and authorities say they have thwarted a number of plots. Far-right groups and political parties like Pauline Hanson’s One Nation have seized on the mood to push anti-immigration agendas. Concern about immigration has also seeped into the mainstream political discourse, with the governing Liberal-National coalition vowing to tighten rules around citizenship and require applicants to demonstrate how they have embraced “Australian values”. Phillip Galea, a fixture at rallies organized by the True Blue Crew, was charged with planning a terror attack in August last year.

U.S.-trained urban warfare units were channeling their onslaught along two perpendicular streets that converge in the heart of the Old City, aiming to isolate the jihadist insurgents in four pockets. The week-old battle in the Old City is turning into the deadliest of the eight-month U.S.-backed campaign to take back the northern city, which fell to the militants in June 2014.  A Reuters correspondent saw a young girl with facial injuries walking dazed and shocked across the frontline out of heavily-populated district with a group of neighbors. All her family was killed when their house collapsed, they said. The United Nations voiced alarm on Saturday at the rising death toll among civilians in the fighting, saying as many as 12 were killed and hundreds injured on Friday. “Fighting is very intense in the Old City and civilians are at extreme, almost unimaginable risk. There are reports that thousands, maybe even tens of thousands, of people are being held as human shields (by Islamic State),  Lise Grande, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said in a statement.  Hundreds of civilians, including children, are being shot.    Iraqi authorities are hoping to declare victory in the northern Iraqi city in the Muslim Eid holiday, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, during the next few days. Helicopter gunships were assisting the ground thrust, firing at insurgent emplacements in the Old City, a Reuters correspondent reported from a location near the frontlines. The government advance was carving out escape corridors for civilians marooned behind Islamic State lines.  There was a steady trickle of fleeing families on Saturday, some with injured and malnourished children.  My baby only had bread and water for the past eight days,  one mother said. At least 100 civilians reached the safety of a government-held area west of the Old City in one 20-minute period, tired, scared and hungry. Soldiers gave them food and water.  More than 100,000 civilians, of whom half are believed to be children, remain trapped in the crumbling old houses of the Old City, with little food, water or medical treatment. The urban-warfare forces were leading the campaign to clear the Sunni Islamist militants from the maze of Old City alleyways, moving on foot house-to-house in locations too cramped for the use of armored combat vehicles. French journalist Veronique Robert has died in Paris after being wounded in an explosion in Mosul earlier this week, her employer France Televisions said on Saturday. Displaced women and children who fled from clashes walk in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq June 24, 2017.Azad LashkariThe mine explosion killed Iraqi journalist Bakhtiyar Haddad and French journalist Stephane Villeneuve while another freelance reporter suffered minor injuries. Aid organizations and Iraqi authorities say Islamic State was trying to prevent civilians from leaving so as to use them as human shields. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing ground and air support in the eight-month-old campaign to seize Mosul, the largest city the militants came to control in a shock offensive in Iraq and neighboring Syria three years ago. U.S.-supported Iraqi government offensives have wrested back several important urban centers in the country's west and north from Islamic State over the past 18 months.  Historic Mosque Blown Up by Militants Slideshow (20 Images)Military analysts said Baghdad's campaign to recover Mosul gathered pace after Islamic State blew up the 850-year-old al-Nuri mosque with its famous leaning minaret on Wednesday. The mosque's destruction, while condemned by Iraqi and U.N. authorities as another cultural crime by the jihadists, gave troops more freedom to press their onslaught as they no longer had to worry about damaging the ancient site. It was from the mosque that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced himself to the world for the first time as the  caliph , or ruler of all Muslims, on July 4, 2014. Mosul's population at the time was more than 2 million. Baghdadi fled into the desert expanse extending across Iraq and Syria in the early phase of the Mosul offensive, leaving the fighting there to local IS commanders, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials. Recent Russian reports that he was killed have not been confirmed by the coalition or Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the campaign dragged on as IS reinforced positions in inner-city neighborhoods of the city's western half, carried out suicide car and motorbike bomb attacks, laid booby traps and kept up barrages of sniper and mortar fire. By this weekend, the area still under IS control was less than 2 square km (0.77 sq miles) in extent, skirting the western bank of the Tigris River that bisects Mosul. Islamic State retaliated for government advances on Friday evening with a triple bombing in a neighborhood in eastern Mosul, which Baghdad's forces recaptured in January. The attack was carried out by three people who detonated explosive belts, killing five, including three policemen, and wounding 19, according to a military statement on Saturday. The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of Islamic State's  caliphate  as a quasi-state structure, but IS would still hold sizeable, mainly rural and small-town tracts of both Iraq and Syria. In eastern Syria, Islamic State's so-called capital, Raqqa, is now nearly encircled by a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition.

Jake Lamb homered off Lively to start the first of successive Arizona three-run innings, light-hitting catcher Chris Herrmann drove in three runs and the Diamondbacks returned to their high-scoring ways, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 9-2 on Saturday night for their 10th win in 12 games. Robbie Ray (8-3) contributed a double to his own effective pitching while limiting the last-place Phillies to two runs in 6 1/3 innings -- both on opposing pitcher Lively's two-run homer --to improve to 6-0 in his last seven starts, all of them Arizona wins.  Even if a team is in first place or last, we always have the same mindset -- to be relentless,  said Herrmann, who had a pair of hits and a run-saving defensive play at the plate.  We want to score as many runs as we can. Just because that team is struggling, they've been giving us some tough games.  Herrmann, a .183 hitter who often catches for Ray, added a run-scoring single following Lamb's 17th homer leading off the three-run sixth, and had a two-run double in the seventh as the Diamondbacks broke the game open against a team they've beaten four times in five games over the last two weekends. After scoring 26 runs in the final two games of a three-run series in Colorado, the Diamondbacks were shut down Friday night by Phillies rookie Mark Leiter while losing 6-1, only to get their offense going again Saturday with 12 hits. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at DiamondbacksPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch We know we can hit here, we can hit anywhere,  Ray said.  It was kind of an off day (Friday) but we came back and put up some numbers. It's great.  Brandon Drury and David Peralta also drove in two runs apiece for Arizona, which won its 12th in 14 games at Chase Field. The Diamondbacks scored at least nine runs for this sixth time in June, a month in which they're 14-6. The Phillies lost for the 14th time in 17 games. Ray wasn't as dominating as he's been in some recent starts -- he walked four and gave up five hits -- but got timely outs and was bailed out of a seventh-inning jam by reliever Archie Bradley with Arizona up 6-2. Bradley, who has a 10-game scoreless streak, came on with the bases loaded and one out and got Aaron Altherr to ground into a force out at home, with Herrmann making an exceptional stretch catch of third baseman Lamb's off-line throw. Bradley then struck out Tommy Joseph.  The ball was way down the first base line, and I just tried to knock it down and, thankfully, I caught it and kind of drug my foot over the plate,  Herrmann said. At the plate, Lively (1-2), making his fifth major league start, became the first Phillies rookie pitcher to homer since Tyler Green in 1995, with a shot to right field in the fourth that briefly put Philadelphia up 2-1. On the mound, Lively lasted 5 1/3 innings, allowing five runs (four earned) and seven hits -- including Ray's double with one out in the fifth. Ray later scored on Peralta's RBI single, and Peralta also was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to force in another run in the sixth.  I was pretty pumped up about that (homer), but then I stayed a little too pumped up,  Lively said.  But I wouldn't say it was just that, I just didn't squeeze on some pitches down in the zone and that kind of got me ... I just made some bad pitches. I kind of let it get away from me.  Lively had no walks or strikeouts, and that meant a lot of balls were put in play by Arizona's hitters.  They're a good hitting team. So, if you make a few mistakes they're going to find holes if you're not striking anybody out,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's been good for us, but today wasn't one of his better outings.  Center fielder Rey Fuentes finished off the game by making an excellent leaping catch of Cameron Perkins' long drive to the base of the wall. With Arizona leading 1-0 in the fourth, Lively surprised the Diamondbacks and Ray by driving a 95 mph fastball over the right field wall for his first career homer, a two-run shot that followed Cameron Rupp's two-out walk. Lively came into the game 1-for-6 as a hitter but showed previously he could swing the bat by hitting .222 in the minors with one homer for Double-A Pensacola in 2014.  (They) gave me the go-ahead to swing on the first pitch and it (the fastball) was right there,  Lively said. The Diamondbacks came back to tie it in the bottom of the inning on singles by Paul Goldschmidt and Lamb, Chris Owings' sacrifice bunt and Drury's second RBI grounder of the game. Arizona opened the scoring in the second when center fielder Odubel Herrera dropped Owings' long fly ball near the warning track for a three-base error -- Owings didn't appear to agree with the scoring decision -- and Drury drove him in with a grounder to third.

Just what the Padres had been missing became apparent Saturday night when Sanchez hit a go-ahead, two-run, pinch-hit homer in the bottom of the eighth inning to trigger the Padres' 7-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers at Petco Park.  It's amazing to be back and to help the team,  Sanchez said after the switch-hitter's 403-foot drive off Tigers right-handed reliever Shane Greene gave the Padres a 4-3 lead. Ssn Diego tacked on three more runs in the inning.  Since Hector's been hurt, there's been no power bat on the bench and really no left-handed pinch hitter,  said Padres manager Andy Green after his club won a third straight game. Meanwhile, the Tigers extended their losing streak to eight straight games -- their longest losing streak since the 2015 season.  The results we've gotten in the last 10 days, we should be embarrassed by that,  said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.  We shouldn't be embarrassed by the effort, the guys are trying, they care.  The results we should be embarrassed by. We couldn't stop the bleeding tonight. We started giving them baserunners and the home run hurt. Three walks in the eighth and all three scored.  The Padres were trailing 3-2 when pinch hitter Erick Aybar drew a walk to open the bottom of the eighth. Sanchez, who had come off the disabled list a day earlier, drove a 0-and-1 pitch into the right field stands. Sanchez was pinch-hitting for right-handed reliever Kirby Yates (2-1). Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at PadresDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchThe Padres then added three more runs. Carlos Asuaje singled with one out and Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe drew walks to load the bases ahead of a two-run single by Cory Spangenberg. Austin Hedges drove in the inning's fifth run with a single on a suicide bunt attempt. Greene (1-2) suffered the loss, although the Spangenberg and Hedges hits came off left-handed reliever Justin Wilson. Andrew Romine had given Detroit a 3-2 lead in the top of the seventh with a run-scoring single. Romine had a hand in all three Detroit runs. Former Padre Justin Upton opened the Tigers' go-ahead rally in the seventh with a lead-off double against San Diego Padres rookie right-handed starter Dinelson Lamet, who was working in the seventh for the first time in the major leagues. Right-handed rookie Phil Maton replaced Lamet and gave up back-to-back singles to Nicholas Castellanos and Romine, who finished 2-for-4 with a double, two RBIs and a run scored. Upton was 1-for-3 with a walk and a run scored. The Tigers took a one-run lead with a strange, two-run fifth. Upton drew a walk from Lamet to open the inning. Castellanos then topped the ball in front of the plate. Padres catcher Hedges first dropped the ball, then threw to first with Castellanos apparently safe when the throw came out of first baseman Myers' glove with Upton advancing to third. But plate umpire Jordan Baker ruled Castellanos ran inside the baseline en route to first and called the third baseman out on interference with Upton returning to first. Romine then lined a double to right, driving home Upton to tie the game with Romine advancing to third when Renfroe's throw from right sailed into the Tigers' dugout on the third-base side of the field. With the infield in, Jose Iglesias hit a sharp grounder to short. Chase d'Arnaud fielded the ball, but his throw to the plate went off Hedges' glove for an error as Romine scored. The Padres had taken a 1-0 lead against Anibal Sanchez in the bottom of the third without getting the infield. The inning opened with Anibal Sanchez hitting Allen Cordoba on the left wrist, forcing the shortstop out of the game with a wrist contusion. D'Arnaud ran for Cordoba and immediately stole second. Lamet then bunted back to Anibal Sanchez, who overthrew third in an attempt to get the advancing d'Arnaud, who scored on the throwing error. The Padres had tied the game at 2-2 in the bottom of the sixth. Jose Pirela doubled, was sacrificed to third on Asuaje's bunt and scored on Myers' sacrifice fly to left center. Anibal Sanchez allowed two runs (one earned) on two hits and a hit batter with four strikeouts in six innings.

The 13-point list of demands from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE include closing the Al Jazeera satellite television network, curbing relations with Iran, shutting a Turkish base in Doha and paying reparations. The demands are apparently aimed at dismantling Qatar's two-decade-old interventionist foreign policy, which has reflected the clout generated by its vast natural gas and oil wealth but incensed conservative Arab peers over its alleged support for Islamists they regard as mortal threats to their dynastic rule. Doha said it is reviewing the list of demands and that a formal response will be made by the foreign ministry and delivered to Kuwait, but added that the demands are not reasonable or actionable.   The alternative is not escalation, the alternative is parting of ways, because it is very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told reporters.  He said diplomacy with Qatar remained a priority, but added that mediation efforts to resolve the dispute had been undermined by the public disclosure of the demands.  The mediators' ability to shuttle between the parties and try and reach a common ground has been compromised by this leak,  he said.  Their success is very dependent on their ability to move but not in the public space.  Gargash said that if Qatar fails to comply within the 10-day timeline set out in the ultimatum, it will be isolated. But he did not make clear what more could be done since the four Arab nations have already cut diplomatic relations with Doha and severed most commercial ties. The most powerful Middle Eastern country to stand with Qatar in the dispute has been Turkey, which has rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Doha as a sign of support. Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived in Doha since the worst crisis among Gulf Arab states for years erupted on June 5.  Gargash said the Turkish deployment was a  meaningless escalation  and he hoped Ankara would act in a  reasonable way .  We hope that Turkey prioritizes the interest of the Turkish state and not partisan ideology,  Gargash said.  Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party, and Qatar have been the main backers of the Muslim Brotherhood movement that challenges Arab rulers.  Kuwait is helping mediate the dispute as is the United States, for which it has posed a challenging test since Qatar hosts a base housing the headquarters of U.S. air power in the Middle East as well as 11,000 troops. The Sunni Muslim Arab group that imposed the sanctions on Qatar accuse it of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their Shi'ite Muslim enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian rulers. The uncompromising positions adopted by both sides leave little prospect for a quick end to the crisis. The sanctions have disrupted Qatar's main import routes by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But Qatar so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative channels and says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges.

Mid-cap and small-cap indexes underperformed the benchmarks on the back of negative global cues and pressure in metal and oil & gas stocks.  The MSCI’s decision to add China’s so-called “A” shares to its Emerging Markets Index also dented sentiments. Crude oil prices dropped to their lowest level since August on expectations that supplies will exceed demand. Since the highs of around $55 a barrel in the beginning of the year, prices have fallen by more than 20 percent despite an OPEC-led agreement to limit oil production among major OPEC and non-OPEC countries.  This shows that market participants are not convinced the efforts will help prop up prices in a meaningful way in the short term as shale supply continues to rise in the U.S. U.S. index provider MSCI said on Wednesday it would add 222 China-listed large cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets.  This may result in the reduction of India’s weightage in the index by 6.51 bps to 8.85 percent. The outflow from India is expected to be around $2.7 billion after the rejig. PSU Bank stocks were in action after the RBI identified 12 cases that can be immediately taken up under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in an effort to speed up resolution of NPAs.  These account for about 25 percent of the current GNPA that owe 2.5 trillion rupees to the banking system.  The central bank’s move is expected to benefit banks in the longer term where stressed loans are in the range of 8-20 percent, though provisioning for these lenders are expected to shoot up in the short term.  Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel, Electrosteel Steels, Monnet Ispat, Bhusan Power and Steel, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures and Lanco Infra have been referred by lenders for resolution under the IBC.  Stock prices of debt-laden companies were in action as SEBI relaxed restructuring norms. The market regulator announced that new buyers of such companies will be exempt from mandatory open offer and preferential share issue requirements.  But markets seem to be missing the fact that when all stakeholders - creditors, lenders, employees - are expected to take a haircut, won’t the existing shareholders have to take a huge haircut too? In such cases, will these stocks have much value left? Pharma stocks were also in focus after the head of the U.S. FDA said he was working on a “Drug Competition Action Plan” to cut prices of generics and will also to ease norms for companies’ entry in the generic drugs market. IT sector lobby group NASSCOM forecast the sector's export revenues to grow at 7-8 percent for the year to March. Revenue for the domestic market is projected to grow at 10-11 percent in 2017-18.  Infosys is likely to be under the scanner after reports it had reached a $1 million settlement with the state of New York in a visa rules violation case. Meanwhile, the government has hiked the minimum support prices for kharif crops by nearly 7 percent, the highest increase since the BJP came to power in 2014. Such hikes are typically inflationary but with a lag effect of around 6 months.  Another upside risk to inflation is the recent spate of farm loan waivers. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka have announced waivers amounting to over 840 billion rupees, with more states expected to follow suit. On the bright side, consumption may see a boost as a result. In the coming week, investors will keep a close eye on developments related to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax and the monsoon’s progress.  Volatility is expected to remain high ahead of derivative contracts expiry on Thursday. On the macro data front, U.S. GDP data will be declared on Thursday and India’s IIP data for May will be out on Friday.  The next couple of weeks will be crucial for markets as the government rolls out India’s most ambitious tax reform since independence. Any disruption to the economy due to GST could result in a sharp reaction. I would advise investors to wait and watch what unfolds.

Weidmann, who sits on the ECB's rate-setting Governing Council, also said that the bank should not make any further changes to the key parameters of its bond purchase scheme, comments that signal opposition to an extension of asset buys since the ECB will soon hit its German bond purchase limits. Hoping to revive growth and inflation, the ECB is buying 2.3 trillion euros worth of bonds, mostly government debt, a scheme known as quantitative easing and long opposed by Germany, Europe's biggest economy. The purchases are set to run until December and the ECB will decide this fall whether to extend it in order to boost inflation further or to wind it down, or taper.  As far as a possible extension of the bonds-buying program goes, this hasn't yet been discussed in the ECB Council,  Weidmann told the newspaper in an interview.   But in my view, if the solid economic development and price development continues, as expected, it would be time to take a look at an exit from the very easy monetary policies,  he said. Having flirted with deflation for years, price growth is now firmly above 1 percent but will miss the ECB's target of almost 2 percent for years to come, its staff projections show.  A key issue is that self-imposed rules allow the ECB to hold up to one third of each country's debt and given Germany's relatively low debt burden, it is likely to hit this level in the first half of next year.  Any meaningful extension would therefore require a change in the program's rules, a move Weidmann said he firmly opposed. A key risk to curbing stimulus may be pressure from governments since any rise in borrowing costs threatens to blow a hole in national budgets after years of rock-bottom borrowing costs.  This can lead to a political pressure on the Governing Council to continue the loose monetary policies longer than necessary,  Weidmann said. Weidmann, touted a potential successor to ECB President Mario Draghi when his term ends in late 2019, also said that Germany was not in need of stimulus as employment and capacity utilization were already high.

Saturday, the driver of the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet lifted his head and shouted out a pent-up yelp that formed the suitable soundtrack the rookie's first career NASCAR Xfinity Series victory, the American Ethanol E15 250 presented by Enogen.  I feel it all kind of comes around in racing and last week we were so close,  said Byron, who finished .012 seconds behind Joe Gibbs Racing veteran Denny Hamlin last Saturday at Michigan International Speedway.  You've got to have a little bit off luck to win every race that we win and I feel like we got one back for last week.  The final restart with 10 laps to go came just 11 laps after the previous one during which Byron pitted and capped off fuel while taking tires. Good fortune finally found Byron again, who never was seriously challenged down the stretch, but only had four or five laps of fuel left before his last pit stop helped set the stage for victory.  We definitely got a huge break the way the caution fell right there,  Byron's crew chief, Dave Elenz, told FS1 pit reporters during a caution period with 15 laps to go. Byron made the most of it. He won last year at Iowa, but in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.  It's awesome just to kind of come this far,  said Byron, who received a congratulatory call from Rick Hendrick after the win. The ninth caution of the night also benefitted some less familiar top-10 finishers, including Ryan Sieg, who ran second to notch his fourth career top-five finish in 117 series starts. Tyler Reddick took third.  It was fun racing with Tyler at the end,  Sieg said.  We had a little bit of a battle.  Christopher Bell -- in the second leg of his first double-duty weekend -- started on the pole and remained on point the entire first stage, fending off an early challenge from teammate Kyle Benjamin, and a late charge from Sam Hornish, Jr., who made his first start in nine months. Hornish led 183 laps while winning last season at Iowa, but misfortune struck 19 laps into stage two as Bell made contact with his rear fender -- an encounter that sent Hornish careening into the wall. It also ended the veteran stock car and open-wheel racer's first night back with Team Penske.  He came up pretty hard when he got loose and hit me,  said Hornish, who is slated to run a limited schedule this season.  Of course, we got the brunt of it. I'm disappointed. This is one of my favorite places to come to.  Points leader Elliott Sadler shares that sentiment -- even though mostly bad luck plagued his night. He qualified fourth, but was sent to the rear after an unapproved pre-race adjustment was made on his car. No matter. He'd ascended to fifth by the end of the first stage and ended up eighth. Bell settled for 16th after he was collected in an incident involving Brennan Poole and Ryan Reed -- the caution that benefitted Byron and others. Bell led 152 laps to Byron's 78, but as both drivers know, it's the last lap that counts. Especially Byron, who vocally and visually celebrated this week after enduring quiet disappointment the last.  To get second last week kind of hurt, just because we were that close,  Byron said.  But I feel like it gave us extra motivation, and I feel like last year the beginning of the summer was when I kind of hit my stride and I think we won back-to-back, so to now have a second and a first feels really good.

Ramirez tossed six one-run innings and got some help from a balanced Angels offense in a 6-3 win over the first-place Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Ramirez (7-5) allowed four hits and no walks while striking out five. He is the first Angels starter to win five consecutive road starts since Jered Weaver won six in a row in 2012.  This one, especially playing in this park, gave me a lot of confidence,  Ramirez said after making his first career start at historic Fenway. Ramirez has allowed just nine runs in his last 30 innings away from home, good for a 2.70 ERA.  I'm (getting) better timing with my warmup (on the road) before the game starts,  said Ramirez, who is 1-3 with a 5.10 ERA at home this season.  At home, I haven't figured it out yet, but I think I'm getting to that point.  Martin Maldonado, Eric Young Jr., Luis Valbuena and Cameron Maybin and Kole Calhoun each had an RBI as Los Angeles (39-39) bounced back from a 9-4 loss in Friday's series opener. Mitch Moreland slugged a solo home run, his 10th of the season, and Hanley Ramirez had an RBI for Boston (41-33), which has lost three of its last five games. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at Red SoxLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchDespite the loss, the Red Sox remain a half-game in front of the Yankees atop the American League East after New York's loss on Saturday. Boston's David Price (2-2) put up a quality start in a losing effort, allowing three runs (two earned), six hits and one walk with five strikeouts in six innings.  Felt good. Just I didn't make enough big pitches when I needed to,  Price said. Valbuena's sacrifice fly in the sixth inning gave Los Angeles a 3-1 lead. The Angels added two runs in the seventh on Maybin's RBI double and a balk by Boston reliever Fernando Abad later in the inning that allowed Maybin to trot home from third. Red Sox manager John Farrell came out to argue that time had been called before the balk. Home-plate umpire Ryan Blakney appeared to grant Calhoun time just before crew chief Miller called the balk at third base.  It started off that Abad had started and stopped before stepping off the back of the rubber,  Miller told a pool reporter.  The Red Sox argument was that time had been called by the home plate umpire before he balked. John came out and asked Ryan Blakney what he had, and Ryan told him that he had the balk before he called time.   It looked like Abad balked, then stopped, and it looked like the catcher (Christian) Vazquez tried to call time, but the balk happened before all that happened,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. Farrell got in an animated argument with Miller and poked his chest, leading Miller to give Farrell his first ejection of the season.  Time was called,  Farrell maintained after the game.  Time was clearly called before the balk was called. So that was the dispute.  Calhoun's RBI infield single in the ninth made it a five-run game. Ramirez dropped a two-out, ground-rule double in the ninth to bring the Red Sox within four. Angels reliever Cam Bedrosian walked Jackie Bradley Jr. in the next at-bat to load the bases for Christian Vazquez, who reached on a strikeout and a wild pitch to make it 6-3. Blake Parker got pinch hitter Chris Young to strike out swinging to end the game, clinching his first save of the year. Los Angeles clung to a 2-1 lead through the fifth. Maldonado put the Angels on the board first with a two-out RBI single in the opening inning. Moreland tied the score with an estimated 418-foot blast to center field in the second. He had just one hit in 20 previous at-bats. Young restored Los Angeles' one-run advantage two innings later with an RBI single.

LOUIS -- While the St. Louis Cardinals reached a low they haven't plummeted in a decade, the Pittsburgh Pirates secured a series victory and a winning road trip. Jordy Mercer and Josh Harrison each homered, while Gerrit Cole shrugged off Matt Carpenter's leadoff homer to toss six solid innings Saturday night in Pittsburgh's 7-3 decision at Busch Stadium. It was the 25th loss in 37 games for St. Louis, which has lost three straight games. This one featured another poor outing from starter Lance Lynn (5-5), the offense's inability to take advantage of an opportunity to knock Cole around early and a wretched sixth inning that saw the Pirates (35-40) score three runs off one hit.  Lance actually threw the ball well, but a couple of mistakes cost him,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.  They capitalized on them.  Lynn's mistakes occurred in consecutive innings. Working with two outs and Andrew McCutchen at first after a bloop single ended a streak of nine straight hitters set down, Lynn put a fastball right down the middle for Mercer. The Pittsburgh shortstop pounced on it, lining the 2-1 offering over the wall in left for his seventh homer of the year and a 3-1 Pirates lead. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CardinalsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch He comes out you primarily with a fastball, but he locates it well,  Mercer said of Lynn.  I think he wanted to come in and he left it up. I wasn't sure it was going over the wall because it had topspin, but as long as it goes over the wall, that's all that matters.  Harrison trumped Mercer's blast an inning later, rifling a center-cut cutter into the seats down the left-field line for his ninth homer of the season. That made Harrison 10-for-26 with a pair of homers in his career against Lynn.  He creates a wake, a positive wake out there,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Harrison.  He has been really good from the start of the year until now. He's been fun to watch.  Cole was fun to watch if you were a Pittsburgh fan, too. The game turned for him in the second, moments after Lynn popped a double into right-center for his second hit in 23 at-bats. The ball bounced off the warning track and landed in the St. Louis bullpen, forcing Greg Garcia to return to third and denying the Cardinals a 2-1 lead. Cole then whiffed Carpenter, who entered the plate appearance with four homers in 35 at-bats against him, to strand two in scoring position. By the time St. Louis got another man into scoring position, it was a 7-1 game in the ninth and Cole (6-6) was cooling his heels in the locker room. In winning his third straight start, Cole allowed five hits and two walks while fanning five.  Carpenter got him in the first inning, but Gerrit battles,  Harrison said.  He gave us exactly what we needed tonight.  Mercer's RBI groundout in the sixth made it 5-1. Lynn departed two batters later after an intentional walk to Chris Stewart and an unintentional walk to Cole filled the bases. Rookie reliever John Brebbia then gave the Pirates their last two runs, plunking Adam Frazier and Harrison as the sellout crowd of 46,735 booed. Lynn's final line was 5 2/3 innings, six hits and seven runs with three walks and three strikeouts. In his last two starts, he's yielded 14 runs and six homers in 10 1/3 innings.  I felt good, but I just didn't execute when I needed to,  lamented Lynn.  I'm going to regroup and move forward, and make pitches.  The Cardinals made the final margin look a bit more respectable with two runs in the ninth as pinch hitter Stephen Piscotty looped a single to left-center to score Jose Martinez and Eric Fryer. Even that inning was tainted by a baserunning error. Paul DeJong tried to stretch a single into a double and was called out after a replay review overturned the original safe call. At 33-40, St. Louis is off to its worst start since 2007, its last losing season. NOTES: St. Louis CF Dexter Fowler (quad) returned to the lineup Saturday night after missing the previous two games. Fowler was injured in the 10th inning Wednesday night at Philadelphia. ... Cardinals C Yadier Molina (knee) was scratched from their lineup for the second straight game and replaced by Eric Fryer. Molina was struck on the knee by a foul tip in Thursday's 5-1 loss to the Phillies. ... Pittsburgh 1B/OF John Jaso's tie-breaking homer in the ninth inning Friday night was the 50th homer of his career. It was also his fifth homer of the season, four of which have occurred in the seventh inning or later.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6P30P71N"}]
