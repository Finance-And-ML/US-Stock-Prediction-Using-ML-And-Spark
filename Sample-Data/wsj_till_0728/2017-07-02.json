[{"content": "A plan for the sale of             Toshiba Corp.\u2019s        TOSYY -2.51%       semiconductor unit includes an option for             SK Hynix Inc.        000660 0.42%       to eventually take a minority stake in the business, people involved in the proposed deal say, contradicting Toshiba\u2019s public statements.SK Hynix\u2019s potential partial ownership of Toshiba\u2019s chip business could escalate opposition from             Western Digital Corp.        WDC 0.22%      , which currently has a stake in Toshiba\u2019s semiconductor operations and competes with SK Hynix, a South Korean chip maker. Western Digital, based in San Jose, Calif., has filed lawsuits to try to block the sale.The arrangement would also appear to run counter to concerns raised by Japanese government officials about the potential leakage of sensitive technology to foreign competitors.Toshiba says it is nearing an agreement with a consortium led by state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, to sell its crown jewel semiconductor business, which makes NAND flash memory chips, for about $18 billion.INCJ and 100% government-owned Development Bank of Japan plan to acquire 66% of the unit, while the rest would go to U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital, according to the people involved in the deal.Contracts between Bain and SK Hynix will allow SK Hynix to acquire some or all of the stake initially held by Bain at a later date, these people say.SK Hynix\u2019s name isn\u2019t included in Toshiba\u2019s public documents about the consortium but it has been described by Toshiba Chief Executive       Satoshi Tsunakawa       as only providing financing for the deal.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any technology leaks because SK Hynix won\u2019t take any voting rights in the chip unit,\u201d Mr. Tsunakawa said at a news conference on June 23.A Toshiba spokesman said he couldn\u2019t comment on details of the planned sale and declined to make Mr. Tsunakawa available for comment.In explaining SK Hynix\u2019s role, one of the people involved in the deal said: \u201cSK Hynix isn\u2019t a bank that profits from lending money.\u201dThe INCJ and DBJ declined to comment. An SK Hynix spokesman declined to comment on whether the South Korean company is looking to acquire a stake in Toshiba.Western Digital has already expressed concerns about SK Hynix\u2019s inclusion in the consortium.\u201cSK Hynix\u2019s participation increases the likelihood of technology leakage and harm to the joint venture,\u201d Western Digital Chief Executive       Steve Milligan       wrote in a letter sent to Toshiba on June 25, which was provided to the media.Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry couldn\u2019t immediately comment.Toshiba is rushing to raise capital after its U.S. nuclear subsidiary Westinghouse Electric Co. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, saddling Toshiba with billions of dollars in losses. In April, Toshiba warned investors that it might be unable to stay in business.SK Hynix was invited to join the consortium after INCJ failed to attract Japanese electronics companies, the people involved in the process say. The addition of SK Hynix was needed to raise the size of the offer, the people involved in the deal said.Japanese government officials have raised concerns about technology leakage, but that was primarily regarding Chinese bidders as Beijing spends tens of billions of dollars to buy semiconductor technology overseas and develop it domestically.Toshiba and SK Hynix have fallen out in the past over alleged technology leakage.In 2014, Toshiba alleged that SK Hynix illegally obtained semiconductor research data from a former employee of a Toshiba joint venture partner that was acquired by Western Digital last year. SK Hynix agreed to pay Toshiba $278 million to settle a lawsuit in the dispute. The two companies extended a license-sharing agreement shortly after resolving the dispute.A stake in the Toshiba unit would help give SK Hynix a bigger presence in the NAND chip market, where it lags behind in technology and market share. Thanks to high demand from smartphone and computer server makers, sales of NAND flash memory chips totaled $11.7 billion during the first quarter of this year, headed by             Samsung Electronics Co.and Toshiba and followed by Western Digital and SK Hynix, according to research firm             IHS Markit.SK Hynix says it is currently investing billions of dollars to beef up its NAND production capacity.SK Hynix\u2019s potential stake in Toshiba\u2019s chip unit could also raise antitrust challenges that would slow the sale. Toshiba rejected Western Digital\u2019s offers to take over the operations due partly to concerns that authorities, especially in China, would block the deal on antitrust objections, people involved in the deal said.Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com, Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com and Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 23:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-hasnt-revealed-that-sk-hynix-could-get-stake-in-its-chip-business-1499052941", "news_title": "Toshiba Hasn\u2019t Revealed That SK Hynix Could Get Stake in Its Chip Business ", "keywords": "pe deals,sk hynix,struggling toshiba ,toshiba,toshiba chip deal ,toshiba problems ,toshiba selling semiconductor business ,western digital,SK Hynix,000660.SE,KR:000660,Toshiba,6502.TO,Innovation Network Corp. of Japan,Western Digital,WDC,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,computer storage devices,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,semiconductors,personal electronics,financial investments,cellular,mobile phones,computing,computer peripherals,computer hardware,financial services,handheld electronic devices,industrial electronics,industrial goods,investing,securities,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "A breakthrough in Illinois\u2019s fiscal stalemate came Sunday when House lawmakers approved Democratic revenue and spending measures, sending to the Senate what could become the state\u2019s first budget in two years.The proposed budget would fund a more than $36 billion spending plan with a $5 billion tax increase. The state brings in roughly $32 billion a year.During its record-breaking fiscal impasse, Illinois has racked up $14.6 billion in unpaid bills, and credit-rating companies are warning the state\u2019s debt could be downgraded to junk status.A federal judge Friday found Illinois noncompliant with its Medicaid payments, ruling the state must pay $293 million a month and $1 billion over the next year to help reduce the $3 billion it owes to health-care providers.The logjam is the result of a political standoff between Republican Gov.       Bruce Rauner,        elected in November 2014, and House Speaker       Michael Madigan,        a Chicago Democrat who has held the office for more than three decades.Mr. Rauner called a 10-day special session to solve the budget mess before the start of the fiscal year on July 1. But the governor and lawmakers were unable to broker a deal before midnight Friday, leaving the General Assembly working overtime as the state entered its third fiscal year without a budget.\u201cToday, Democrats and Republicans stood together to take a crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way,\u201d Mr. Madigan said in a statement following the votes Sunday. \u201cThere is more work to be done, and we will continue working with Republicans to ensure the issues still on the table are fully resolved.\u201dDemocratic Rep.       Greg Harris,        Mr. Madigan\u2019s top lieutenant in budget negotiations, wrote the revenue and spending measures that passed the House Sunday. Mr. Harris\u2019s revenue bill, the more contentious piece of the budget, increases the state\u2019s personal income-tax rate from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate income-tax rate from 5.25% to 7%.The proposal is largely in line with a similar Republican plan to raise revenue, but Mr. Rauner favors only a temporary increase in income taxes\u2014not the permanent hike outlined in Mr. Harris\u2019s bill.Mr. Harris\u2019s spending bill passed Sunday after receiving preliminary approval from the chamber Friday. The final version was amended Sunday to spend roughly $400 million less than the plan lawmakers voted to support last week, and includes an increase in cuts to state higher education funding to 10% from 5%.In a statement following the House floor action, the governor said he would veto the revenue measure.\u201cUnder Speaker Madigan\u2019s direction, legislators chose to double down on higher taxes while protecting the special interests and refusing to reform the status quo,\u201d Mr. Rauner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a repeat of the failed policies that created this financial crisis and caused jobs and taxpayers to flee.\u201dBut Mr. Rauner\u2019s veto threat may not matter to Democrats, who passed both the revenue and spending measures with more than 71 votes\u2014the threshold needed to override the governor\u2019s decision. The Senate, which will take up the House budget Monday, has a Democratic supermajority which could also reject the governor\u2019s veto.Appeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Illinois Officials Close In On a Deal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 22:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/illinois-officials-edge-closer-to-budget-deal-1499031899", "news_title": "Illinois Officials Edge Closer to Budget Deal", "keywords": "bonds,government services,house,illinois budget,junk rating,senate,special session,standoff,state house,state shutdown,taxes,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,municipal debt"}, {"content": "A bill that would make it tougher for Trump to ease sanctions on Russia faces\u00a0obstacles, with the White House not ruling out a veto and some GOP House lawmakers objecting that the measure would harm U.S. firms.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states are floating possible punitive measures if Qatar doesn\u2019t bow to their demands.Parts of Damascus were on lockdown Sunday after a car bomb killed at least a dozen people in the Syrian capital.Pope Francis replaced a conservative cardinal with a deputy to head the Vatican body in charge of disciplining priests accused in sex-abuse cases.Governors are pushing back on the GOP health bill, urging lawmakers to rethink cuts to Medicaid funding.U.S. consumers are getting letters from insurers warning that ACA plans will be terminated.The U.S. has partly rescinded a ban on the use of laptops on some U.S.-bound international flights.Xi warned Hong Kong that challenges to mainland sovereignty won\u2019t be tolerated, as the former British colony marked the 20th anniversary of its handover.The EU and Japan neared a trade deal, but gaps remain.Congo declared an end to the Ebola epidemic that caused four deaths.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 22:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1499049706", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "news digests"}, {"content": "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia\u2014The top commander of Colombia\u2019s largest rebel movement was hospitalized Sunday following a stroke and remains in intensive care, just days after his group handed over the last of its individual weapons as part of a historic peace deal.Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, checked himself into a hospital emergency room in the city of Villavicencio shortly after 8 a.m. with slurred speech and numbness in his arm, doctors said in a news conference.

On June 22, they gave Qatar 10 days to give in to 13 demands that include closing down state broadcaster Al Jazeera, curbing ties with Iran and ending Turkey\u2019s military presence on its soil.Qatar has indicated that it won\u2019t meet the demands, which would amount to a radical policy overhaul. Qatar\u2019s economy has been resilient so far, but could suffer deeply if the transport ban remains and other economic sanctions are imposed.The Arab states, on issuing the demands, didn\u2019t specify what they would do if Qatar doesn\u2019t comply, but have since floated publicly and privately a number of possible measures aimed at deepening Qatar\u2019s isolation and hurting its economy.Commercial restrictions could be put into place to raise the pressure,       Reem al-Hashimi,        the U.A.E.\u2019s minister of state for international cooperation, said in June.

CAT 0.73%       failed to submit numerous required export filings with the government in recent years, adding to questions facing the manufacturing giant, people familiar with the matter said.The findings are preliminary, these people said, but offer an avenue for investigators to examine whether missing export submissions were part of a possible effort by the Peoria, Ill.-based maker of yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other heavy equipment to avoid paying taxes.The possible missing export filings were discovered as part of a continuing criminal probe into potential export and tax violations at Caterpillar, according to the people familiar with the matter. The probe is the latest in a series of inquiries centered largely on a Swiss subsidiary that U.S. Senate investigators have found was part of a longtime Caterpillar strategy to lower its U.S. tax bill. The Swiss unit has been involved in overseas sales of Caterpillar replacement parts. While the tax-angle of the probe is in its very early stages, investigators believe it could be the beginning of a yearslong investigation, people familiar with the matter say.Caterpillar hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing.\u201cCaterpillar believes its tax position is right,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are in the process of responding to the government\u2019s concerns, and hope to be in a position to bring this matter to resolution within a reasonable timeframe.\u201dAs part of the criminal probe, federal agents from three agencies raided the manufacturing giant\u2019s headquarters and two nearby facilities in early March. A prime focus of the searches was information related to Caterpillar\u2019s export submissions, according to previously disclosed search warrants, but the people familiar with the matter said the government has yet to determine whether there are potential tax implications related to those filings.Investigators have identified discrepancies between what Caterpillar turned over to authorities in response to subpoenas before the raids and the company\u2019s regular filings with the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Automated Export System, the people familiar with the matter said.The export system provides government researchers with U.S. trade data and includes information such as the valuations of products shipped abroad. It also allows law-enforcement agencies to track U.S. exports and monitor shipments to countries facing sanctions. Exporters could face civil or criminal penalties if they fail to file export information or if they submit misleading information.A former senior U.S. Commerce Department official said irregularities in the export system, which receives hundreds of thousands of filings every week, may have a benign explanation, such as a technical mishap in filing electronic paperwork. \u201cIt could be something, it could be nothing,\u201d said this former official, who isn\u2019t involved in the Caterpillar case.The March raids puzzled Wall Street analysts, investors and Caterpillar employees. \u201cEveryone was legitimately caught off guard,\u201d said one person who has been in touch with current Caterpillar employees.Days after the March raids, Caterpillar Chief Executive       Jim Umpleby       said the searches came as a surprise \u201cbecause we have been cooperating with requests for information from authorities.\u201d\u201cWe are cooperating and will continue to act in good faith, and as a good corporate citizen,\u201d Mr. Umpleby added.The Caterpillar search warrants were executed by agents from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s criminal division, the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\u2019s inspector general. The investigation is being managed by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Central District of Illinois in Springfield. A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment.Representatives of the IRS and Commerce Department declined to comment, while a spokesman for the FDIC didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.The March raids and the early findings on the export reports are the latest in a series of inquiries at Caterpillar and its Swiss unit.The company faced public scrutiny about its Swiss unit in 2014, when a report by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described how Caterpillar\u2019s U.S. operation effectively removed itself from the business of selling replacement parts to overseas dealers by assigning the profit to the Swiss subsidiary, lowering its U.S. tax bill. Caterpillar told the panel it pays what it owes in taxes.That year, the subsidiary also was the subject of a civil probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC ended its inquiry in 2015, saying it didn\u2019t intend to recommend enforcement action, Caterpillar said in filings. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.In its latest annual securities filing, the company said it has been \u201cvigorously contesting\u201d an approximately $2 billion bill from the IRS related to transactions by the Swiss unit.As part of its investigation, the government also commissioned a report by a professor at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business that claims Caterpillar engaged in tax and accounting fraud, according to a person familiar with its contents.Caterpillar has declined to address the report publicly, but the company has privately been critical of its findings, questioning its assumptions and conclusions, people familiar with the matter said. The Caterpillar spokeswoman said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on the report.Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Caterpillar Faces More Questions In Probe.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 22:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/caterpillar-faces-new-questions-in-probe-1499038368", "news_title": "Caterpillar Faces New Questions in Probe", "keywords": "caterpillar probe,export probe,tax probe,Caterpillar,CAT,U.S. Department of Commerce,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,commerce department,executive branch,chemicals,machinery,construction machinery,basic materials,resources,fuel additives,industrial goods"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       suffered a rare heavy election defeat, clouding prospects for his policy goals such as revising the nation\u2019s pacifist constitution.Mr. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party lost its position as the biggest party in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly Sunday to an upstart group headed by a former TV anchorwoman who has adopted some of the rhetoric of global populist movements.Yuriko Koike\u2019s       Tokyo Residents First Party and its coalition partner won 78 of the 127 seats in the Tokyo Assembly, while the LDP won 23 seats, its worst-ever result.While the Tokyo vote doesn\u2019t alter the picture of national power, it raises new concerns for Mr. Abe ahead of an election for the lower house of parliament that must be held by the end of 2018. The LDP suffered a landslide election defeat in 2009 shortly after losing a Tokyo election.On Monday, Mr. Abe told reporters he would try to \u201cwin back the public\u2019s trust\u201d following the latest defeat.Mr. Abe\u2019s government has been hit by a slump in public approval ratings in the wake of a series of recent gaffes and scandals, and as it forced through parliament new antiterrorism legislation that some Japanese see as chilling free speech.Mr. Abe has denied repeated accusations from rival politicians and bureaucrats that he used inappropriate influence to help friends win business deals.Despite the setbacks, analysts say the weakness of national opposition parties and Mr. Abe\u2019s tight grip on power within his party mean he will likely continue to lead the government through next year\u2019s election.\u201cA lot of people are not crazy about Mr. Abe, but they think the alternatives are worse,\u201d said       Gerald Curtis,        professor emeritus at Columbia University and a long-term observer of Japanese politics.Mr. Abe became prime minister for a second time in 2012 and is one of the longest serving leaders among advanced economies. Earlier this year the LDP changed a party rule to allow him to run for a new term as party leader, which would keep him in power through 2021.The impact of the Tokyo defeat may be seen in increased resistance within the ruling party to some of Mr. Abe\u2019s policy plans, most notably his aim to amend the constitution. In May, Mr. Abe proposed formally recognizing Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces in the constitution, which has remained unchanged since Japan renounced war at the end of World War II.Mr. Abe has said wants the LDP to come up with a draft revision by the end of this year, but some senior figures in the party have called for caution in making constitutional changes. Surveys show public opinion divided on revising the constitution, with many Japanese reluctant to alter its pacifist mandate.The big winner in the latest election was Ms. Koike, a former defense minister and TV presenter who is viewed by analysts as likely to run for national leadership after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Ms. Koike is the only politician who polls well in surveys about potential national leaders other than Mr. Abe, but she routinely declines to discuss her future political ambitions.\u201cI feel emotional and a strong burden of responsibility,\u201d Ms. Koike said after exit polls showed her party was set for a big win.Mr. Curtis said that while Japan has largely avoided the wave of populism that has swept several Western countries, Ms. Koike was able to tap into a strong undertone of dissatisfaction with incumbent parties around the world. Ms. Koike chided the LDP for being out of touch with regular people and for failing to work for their core interests.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Japan Ruling Party Falters in Local Vote.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 21:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-prime-minister-abes-party-suffers-rare-election-defeat-1499005441", "news_title": "Japan Prime Minister Abe\u2019s Party Suffers Rare Election Defeat", "keywords": " abe, elections,japan, ldp, liberal democratic party, shinzo abe, tokyo residents first party, yuriko koike,Shinzo Abe,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "HIRATSUKA, Japan\u2014Yoshiko Iida, at 85 years old, is a trendsetter.

After that, they\u2019re pushed out altogether.Companies typically figure they are dumping high-price workers who are past their prime. But some are realizing that can be shortsighted, especially in a sales business like Ms. Iida\u2019s when the people walking out the door have client lists that took decades to build. Who better to target consumers in their senior years than other seniors?At Pola, part of             Pola Orbis Holdings Inc.,       the sales force of 42,000 includes about 1,500 salespeople in their 70s, 80s and 90s.\u201cThey\u2019ve worked for a long time, and the relationships with their customers go back just as far,\u201d says Miki Oikawa, who is in charge of the beauty business at Pola. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trust there.\u201dDaiwa Securities Group Inc.       used to set an age limit of 70 for veteran salespeople working under contract. It recently scrapped the limit.\u201cThis will make it possible for us to have more consultants in the age range of 60 to 80, which is similar to the generation that holds the largest financial assets,\u201d says the brokerage\u2019s chief executive,       Seiji Nakata.Some 23% of Japanese age 65 or over were working in 2016, the highest level among the Group of Seven industrialized nations and ahead of 19% in the U.S., according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Still, many of those older workers hold jobs near the minimum wage such as convenience-store clerk. Those with specialized skills often have a harder time.Many companies jump to the conclusion that older workers are likely to make a lot of mistakes and lack the ability of younger workers, said Nobuhiro Maeda, an analyst at a Nippon Life Insurance Co. research institute.\u201cThe reality is that companies aren\u2019t going to make a move unless someone presses their back and tells them it would be meaningful for their business,\u201d Mr. Maeda said.Some Japanese business groups have expressed reservations about raising the retirement age, citing increased costs of retaining older workers in senior positions. The Japan Business Federation says keeping older people in their jobs longer could also discourage younger workers who are aiming to advance into those positions.At             Yakult Honsha Co.      , a manufacturer of fermented milk drinks, there is no retirement age for salespeople, and around 5,000 people over 60 years old, mainly women, are selling the drinks by visiting homes and offices.For companies like Yakult and Pola, the cosmetics maker, it is easier to keep older salespeople because they are contractors working on commission, rather than employees. That means the companies aren\u2019t as exposed to risks if an older salesperson has to take time off.In the case of Ms. Iida (pronounced EE-dah), that risk seems pretty low.She has been on the hunt for customers since 1964, when she started packing Pola products in a diaper bag and going door to door.She said her husband wanted her to stay home as a full-time homemaker, taking care of their two children. So she kept her job secret for years, returning home to prepare lunch and dinner, until one day her sister asked \u201cHow\u2019s your shop doing?\u201d in front of her husband. He later came around and encouraged her to continue her work, she said. He died more than 20 years ago.\u201cWhen I meet my clients\u2014including those I\u2019ve known for long time\u2014I always speak to them with keen attentiveness and sincerity. That\u2019s the biggest secret behind my long career,\u201d said Ms. Iida, an avid golfer and Japanese classical dancer. Ms. Iida said most of her clients are over the age of 60.At first, Ms. Iida educated herself by reading the leaflet inside the product box. Now she attends a company lecture each month with younger colleagues to learn about new products.The pace picks up in June and December, when the women strive to rise in Pola\u2019s semiannual sales rankings. Ms. Iida\u2019s shop brings in about $22,000 a month, above the average $18,000 that most Pola shops in her region make.\u201cLife is all about competition,\u201d said Ms. Iida.Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'More Older Workers Aren\u2019t Shy About Not Retiring.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 21:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-wrinkle-in-japans-retire-at-60-rule-workers-who-dont-quit-1498993202", "news_title": "Working at 85: The Idea of Retirement Is Dying in Japan", "keywords": " elderly,japan, japanese companies, japan workforce, retirement, unemployment,Pola Orbis Holdings,4927.TO,JP:4927,Yakult Honsha,2267.TO,JP:2267,Daiwa Securities Group,political,general news,generational cohorts,society,community,personal finance,retirement planning,beauty,personal care,business,consumer services,specialized consumer services"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014Business confidence among Japan\u2019s large manufacturers strengthened to its highest level in more than three years in the second quarter, according to a central bank survey, as a pickup in the global economy and renewed strength in stocks brightened the outlook for corporate Japan.The main index measuring large manufacturers\u2019 confidence rose to plus 17 in the April-June period from plus 12 previously, according to the Bank of Japan\u2019s quarterly tankan survey.The result compares with a forecast of plus 15, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The index represents the percentage of companies saying business conditions are favorable minus those saying conditions are unfavorable.The survey also showed improved sentiment among large non-manufacturers and a jump in investment plans, though companies were less confident about business conditions three months ahead and about profits for the current business year.The improvement in business sentiment adds to recent encouraging data for Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe\u2019s       administration, pointing to renewed strength in Japan\u2019s economy after the longest expansion since 2006. The tankan reading for large manufacturers was the highest since 2014. Stronger global demand has also helped buoy firms\u2019 and investors\u2019 confidence in the outlook for the economy, a factor that lifted the Nikkei Stock Average above 20000 in June.Analysts said an improved tankan result supports the bank\u2019s view that the economy and inflation are gaining strength, ahead of the release of the BOJ\u2019s quarterly forecasts later this month. But with price rises still far from the bank\u2019s 2% target, the latest result isn\u2019t likely to prompt any changes in monetary policy.While the figures for current business confidence among large firms improved, they were less confident about conditions at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a more cautious stance over the future direction of the economy.\u201cThe June tankan was good overall. But we shouldn\u2019t take the results too optimistically because the overall Japanese economy still lacks a driving force to lead sustainable and strong growth,\u201d said Mizuho Securities chief market economist Yasunari Ueno.Large manufacturers were particularly cautious with their currency and earnings forecasts. They expect the U.S. dollar will trade at an average of \u00a5108.31 for the year ending March 2018 and for pretax profits to fall 3.3% from a year earlier. The dollar was changing hands at \u00a5112.22 in early Asian hours Monday.Still, big companies plan to increase their capital investment in the current financial year by 8%, compared with a 0.6% increase projected in the previous survey.

The report is expected to be used as ammunition for potential tariffs or other barriers on imported steel.\u201cThere\u2019s a just a lot of analysis. It\u2019s a bigger deal than they originally thought,\u201d said an industry expert familiar with the administration\u2019s deliberations.The delay follows struggles that the administration has faced pushing other policy priorities through the legislative and bureaucratic complications of Washington.\u00a0People familiar with the deliberations said that the process was also slowed by the White House focus this week on other major issues, like health care, as well as still-thin staffing at major agencies.Officials said Mr.       Trump       still planned to meet his promise to impose new steel import curbs, just that the timetable had slipped.\u201cI\u2019m not sure when the Commerce Department will release its final report on the steel industry,\u201d said       Gary Cohn,        a top       Trump       economic adviser, at a briefing Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working on it for quite some period of time. It\u2019s in draft form or near-final form.\u201dMr.       Trump       said in late May in a tweet that the report would be issued in June and that he would take \u201cmajor action if necessary.\u201d In an early June Ohio rally, he said that the move will come \u201cvery soon\u201d and \u201cthe steel folks are going to be very happy.\u201dMr. Ross said last month at a hearing on the steel matter that \u201cour hope would be to complete the report by the end of June.\u201dThe delay in finishing the investigation is driven by unexpected difficulties the administration faces in hammering out the practical details of putting barriers on steel over national security concerns, the people said. The Commerce Department is just one agency working on the final report, according to people familiar with the process.The report may not be released until mid-July, after Mr.       Trump       travels to Hamburg, Germany, for a summit of the Group of 20 leading global economies, the advisers said. Mr. Trump is expected to face questions about the steel tariffs during the trip and may face international criticism, or even retaliation, if he imposes tariffs or quotas.\u201cWe will use that as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world, to talk about what\u2019s going on in steel,\u201d said Mr. Cohn, who is seen as representing the pro-business side of the administration.The prospect of American steel tariffs or quotas has caused particular agitation in the European Union, which ranks after Canada as the largest steel exporter to the U.S.\u2014especially since some administration officials have hinted that Canada may be exempted from any limits.\u201cWe are very much concerned that that kind of decisions would be damaging for France and Europe,\u201d France\u2019s economy minister,       Bruno Le Maire,        said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. \u201cWe are an open economy, and it would be very difficult for us to understand such a decision.\u201dEuropeans say American barriers on their products won\u2019t solve what most experts say is the biggest problem hanging over the global steel industry: massive oversupply from China, which accounts for about half of all steel production capacity world-wide. The U.S. already imposes duties on many types of Chinese steel due to alleged dumping and subsidies, so China currently sells very little directly to the U.S., and thus wouldn\u2019t be hit directly by new restraints.The tension between Europe and the U.S. was on display Tuesday, when Mr. Ross canceled a planned trip to Berlin to speak to German officials, then spoke instead via live stream. He was cut off partway through his remarks, which lasted longer than scheduled. German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       followed by telling the crowd: \u201cThose who believe they can solve the problems of this world with isolationism and protectionism are making a huge error.\u201dMr. Trump is also likely to get resistance to the potential limits from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, visiting Washington this week. South Korea ranks just behind Europe in steel exports to the U.S.The steel debate pits different parts of the administration against each other, with \u201ceconomic nationalists\u201d supporting barriers to protect American industry and bring back manufacturing jobs, and the pro-business wing defending free trade to support international business activity and broad economic growth.Last week a number of influential Democratic and Republican lawmakers warned about the dangers of imposing barriers to steel imports, saying they could rises prices and hurt other manufacturers that use imported steel. \u201cDone hastily, we raise costs and prove to our partners that we aren\u2019t reliable,\u201d Rep.       Kevin Brady,        the Texas Republican who chairs the House committee that oversees trade policy, told U.S. trade representative      Robert Lighthizer       at a hearing.Business groups and lawmakers are pushing for mechanisms to exclude types of steel not made in the U.S. in sufficient quantities. Some experts following the talks expect Mexico and Canada to be excluded as the Trump administration is seeking to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, and lawmakers have pushed for other allies including the U.K. to be excluded as well from tariffs or quotas.The Section 232 legal provision allows the president to impose broad tariffs based on an analysis of the national security risks of imported goods. Mr. Trump said he would dust off that provision and other ones to defend American manufacturing from what he sees as unfair competition from China and other countries.Messrs. Ross and Lighthizer, who previously worked with steelmakers, have argued that a healthy industry is critical to national security. Low-cost imports put pressure on mills around the country. The industry blames China for production levels that cheapen prices around the world.But critics of the Section 232 process say the U.S. defense industry represents only a tiny fraction of the country\u2019s steel consumption. They say the process could open up the door for other countries to block imports on national security grounds.\u2014Bertrand Benoit in Berlin and Mike Bird in New York contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   The photo accompanying this article was taken on Feb. 8, 2017.

A man seen as the favorite of none but acceptable to all, the 65-year-old former electrical engineer has managed to turn that tepid sentiment into a defining strength.Over nearly three years in office, Mr. Abadi has narrowed gaps between Iraq\u2019s warring Shiite and Sunni politicians. He balanced competing interests among geopolitical rivals Iran and the U.S., and spearheaded an overhaul of Iraqi security forces, who had fled advancing Islamic State fighters. Iraq is close to retaking Mosul, Islamic State\u2019s psychologically important stronghold.\u201cAbadi has magnificently shifted between leading and balancing,\u201d said       Jon Alterman,        director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIf he led too much then there\u2019d be too many alienated people, and if he balanced too much there would be no forward progress.\u201dToday, Iraq\u2019s security forces are on the verge of defeating Islamic State, the key requirement if the nation wants to enjoy a stable and cohesive future, despite daunting challenges that remain. Sectarian anger still simmers, and the country\u2019s economy and infrastructure have been devastated by years of fighting.\u201cAbadi is riding high,\u201d said one U.S. official in Washington. \u201cBut the government needs to show that it can act to make people\u2019s lives better, and probably the window for that is pretty limited. If it doesn\u2019t, all that goodwill Abadi built up will diminish.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t always such a sense of possibility in Iraq. Before Islamic State swept to power in 2014, the country was at its most-fractious since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Abadi\u2019s predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, was a polarizing figure, accused of fueling sectarian conflict and packing ministries with loyalists.Transparency International ranked the country near the bottom at 171 of 177 countries world-wide for corruption, with such pervasive problems that the country has only moved up a few positions after years of attempted overhauls. Mr. Maliki didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but Sunday released a public statement praising the military and militias.When the festering Syrian civil war next door bled across the border, Iraq\u2019s military crumbled. In June of 2014, militants exploited Iraq\u2019s problems to blitz into Mosul\u2014grabbing nearby land, stores of weapons and oil fields. In Islamic State\u2019s advance, millions of civilians came to live under the Sunni extremist group\u2019s rule.Some Sunnis initially welcomed the militants as an alternative to the predominantly Shiite government of Mr. Maliki. The implementation of Shariah law followed, where people could be jailed for smoking or executed for unauthorized use of a cellphone.Amid the turmoil, the conciliatory Mr. Abadi was tapped to become prime minister, an antidote to Mr. Maliki\u2019s divisive rule. He faced growing alarm among Iraq\u2019s allies.Iran, the world\u2019s biggest Shiite-majority country, couldn\u2019t countenance its neighbor falling to a Sunni extremist group. In 2014 Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the pre-eminent Shiite cleric in Iraq, called on fellow countrymen to rise up to help protect the country; Shiite militias formed that Mr. Abadi has both empowered and theoretically kept under central government control. Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019s elite Quds Force decided to fund and train many of them.Ayatollah Sistani, who typically makes public statements via a representative at Friday prayers, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Islamic State controlIslamic State support/attack zonesSEPTEMBER 2014MAY 2017iraniran", "news_time": "2017-07-02 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-isis-on-the-run-an-unexpected-leader-emerges-in-iraq-1499037395", "news_title": "With ISIS on the Run, an Unexpected Leader Emerges in Iraq", "keywords": " abadi, fighting in mosul, iraq fighting, isis, isis on the run,islamic state, mosul,Haider al-Abadi,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "The six people injured by a gunman in Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were in stable condition on Sunday, including a member of the hospital staff who was in stable but critical condition, according to hospital officials.Henry Bello,        45 years old, shot and killed\u00a0a seventh person, a young doctor,\u00a0before he turned the gun on himself Friday afternoon.Bello was a house physician who could only practice medicine at Bronx-Lebanon because he was working on a limited permit, said Sridhar Chilimuri, the physician-in-chief at the hospital. Bello had finished medical school but hadn\u2019t completed his residency, Dr. Chilimuri said.Tracy Sin-Yee Tam,        32, was filling in for another co-worker when Bello shot her with an AR-15 rifle, hospital officials said. There was no indication that Dr. Tam and Bello knew each other, officials said.Dr. Tam, a physician in family medicine,\u00a0was remembered by\u00a0her colleagues as someone always willing to lend a helping hand. \u201cThat\u2019s her nature,\u201d Dr. Chilimuri said. \u201cFrom her mentors, she had always aspired to work in underserved communities.

A hospital official declined to comment.One doctor then recognized Bello, Dr. Chilimuri said, and got a glimpse of his rifle. The doctor immediately called his supervisor, who then phoned Dr. Chilimuri. Dr. Chilimuri called security at the hospital to initiate a \u201cCode Silver,\u201d to alert staff that there was an active shooter. Dr. Chilimuri said he heard gun shots on the other end of the call.Bello shot five hospital employees and one patient on the 16th\u00a0floor, hospital officials said.

These additional costs could be passed on to European customers, the industry group added.British banks will likely\u00a0have to shift large chunks of their operations into the EU after the U.K. leaves the trade bloc in order to continue servicing customers there.\u00a0The U.K. is currently locked in negotiations with the EU to try to guarantee as much access to the EU as possible, while remaining outside the single market.However, if a deal isn\u2019t cut and the U.K.\u2019s financial hub is frozen out of Europe, then more than \u20ac1 trillion of bank assets, including loans, securities and derivatives, may need to be rebooked into European subsidiaries, according to AFME.That could prove expensive on several counts. Not only do banks have to shuffle staff, expand offices and get regulatory approval, but they would also have to capitalize their new European entities.Investment banks used London as a springboard to sell to clients not only across Europe but also Africa and Asia. Having capital pooled in one place made it more efficient to do business. But if the rights to sell to EU clients from London are lost, BCG estimates that\u00a0\u20ac70 billion of equity capital would have to be pumped into these new European units. These costs amortized over three to five years could reduce the banks\u2019 return on equity, a key measure of profitability, by 0.5% to 0.8%, the report says.Another question is clearing. The European Union\u2019s executive arm proposed plans that could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. BCG estimates that moving the approximately\u00a0\u20ac83 trillion of euro-denominated interest-rate contracts out of the U.K. would force European banks to hold an extra\u00a0\u20ac30 billion to\u00a0\u20ac40 billion of collateral.Clearing is a business that depends on scale, where a mass of contracts with opposite bets can cancel each other out, reducing the amount of capital banks have to hold against the risk. Siphoning off contracts to a new location could make clearing more expensive, analysts say.A survey showed that European businesses were largely unconcerned with the banks\u2019 plight. \u201cMost businesses we interviewed told us that they expect their banks to address all the challenges and absorb all the costs that Brexit could create,\u201d the AFME report said. The report reiterated a point that bankers have been making to policy makers for over a year: Any shift needs to be gradual to allow business to adjust.Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Brexit Could Cost Banks $17.1 Billion.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-could-cost-banks-15-billion-1499036461", "news_title": "Brexit Could Cost Banks $17 Billion", "keywords": "brexit,finreg, Boston Consulting Group ,European Union,Association for Financial Markets in Europe,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,employment costs,productivity,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,management consulting,professional bodies,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,banking,credit,business consultancy,financial services"}, {"content": "The new heir to Saudi Arabia\u2019s throne has launched a crackdown on dissent in recent weeks, attempting to silence activists and critical clerics as well as his deposed predecessor, according to U.S. and Saudi officials familiar with the events.King Salman upended Saudi Arabia\u2019s succession order last month by naming his 31-year-old son,\u00a0      Mohammed bin Salman,        crown prince and next in line to the throne, and sidelining his nephew and heir apparent,       Mohammed bin Nayef,        who has deep ties to U.S. intelligence and is widely viewed by U.S. officials as a stabilizing force in the region.The newly elevated crown prince has limited the movements of Mohammed bin Nayef, the officials said. He has also replaced Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s guards with ones loyal to the royal court, they said, in a bid to ensure that Mohammed bin Nayef doesn\u2019t take any steps to rally support.\u201cThey want to make sure nothing is being plotted,\u201d one of these people said.Referring to Mohammed bin Nayef, a representative of the Saudi royal court said in a text message that there were \u201cno restrictions on his movement whatsoever, either in or outside of Saudi Arabia.\u201d The prince has hosted guests since the leadership change, the representative wrote in an emailed statement.U.S. and Saudi officials said the royal court\u2019s efforts to stifle dissent within the kingdom include monitoring and in some cases infiltrating the social media accounts of some activists and bloggers.Some activists and religious figures viewed as stirring protest on social media have also been summoned in person to meet with interior ministry officials, and at least one of those people was told by officials to quiet down or face jail time, according to people familiar with the matter.The royal court official didn\u2019t respond to questions about the broader attempt to stifle dissent that the people familiar with the situation described.Political parties are banned in Saudi Arabia as are protests, unions are illegal, the press is controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison. Since the 2011 Arab Spring, the kingdom has stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough laws, sentencing offenders to prison terms for Web posts deemed insulting to rulers or threatening to public order.The recent crackdown follows the royal power shuffle and a move earlier in June by the kingdom to lead an economic blockade of neighboring Qatar, and is raising concerns among U.S. officials and observers that more political upheaval may be on the way, since the aging King Salman consolidated power in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.The Qatar blockade was championed by Mohammed bin Salman, while Mohammed bin Nayef favored a more tempered approach through diplomatic channels. That difference of opinions contributed to the timing of the power shuffle, The Wall Street Journal has reported.The elevation of a new crown prince who backs a newly aggressive foreign-policy approach has concerned career U.S. officials who have long looked to Saudi Arabia as a source of stability in the Middle East.Mohammed bin Nayef was a trusted contact for those officials. U.S. President       Donald Trump       has appeared to embrace Mohammed bin Salman by meeting with him in both Riyadh and Washington, D.C., before his elevation to the crown prince role.The White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mohammed bin Nayef \u201cand his U.S. counterparts tended to see eye to eye on things,\u201d said       Steven Simon,        who worked on Middle East security issues as a senior director at the National Security Council during the Clinton and Obama administrations.One former diplomat said of the sidelined prince that in Saudi Arabia and the U.S., \u201cthe whole security apparatus has been dependent on him.\u201dComplaints about the escalating clash with Qatar led Saudi officials to boost efforts to monitor dissident communications and halt public criticism last month, in the weeks leading up to the power shuffle. Officials working for Mohammed bin Salman used technology from Hacking Team, an Italian company that provides surveillance tools to governments, according to people familiar with the matter.Hacking Team didn\u2019t return a call and emails seeking comment.Some critics have left social media. Cleric\u00a0      Bader\u00a0al-Amer       told his followers on June 14 that he will stop posting on             Twitter                   and other social media indefinitely. His announcement came after he tweeted that several clerics and intellectuals believe Qatar\u2019s claim that it doesn\u2019t sponsor terrorism.Ibrahim al-Modaimegh, a former legal adviser to the government, said on June 27 that he was leaving Twitter temporarily for health reasons and hoped the new Saudi leadership would free people imprisoned for their political views.A key official in the effort to quell social-media protest, according to activists and journalists, is an employee of the new crown prince named       Saud al Qahtani.       Mr. Qahtani, an adviser to the royal court who gained the title of minister in 2015, launched a vocal Twitter campaign against Qatar at the time of the June 4 blockade, accusing Qatar of having plotted years ago to kill the late King Abdullah. Mr. Qahtani couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Officials at the kingdom\u2019s ministry of the interior have also been directly involved in the effort to suppress dissenting voices. A few weeks ago, they began summoning journalists, activists, preachers and others who were viewed as being publicly critical to meetings in which they were told to stop expressing these views, according to people familiar with these meetings.The crackdown continued as the end of Ramadan approached, and then, on June 21, the leadership shift promoting his young son and sidelining his nephew.The shuffle followed a series of moves that built up the power base of the younger Mohammed bin Salman, who is leading a plan to overhaul the economy that includes selling shares in the state-owned oil company on a public exchange in 2018.Write to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com and Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi Heir Aims to Silence Deposed Prince.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 18:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-moves-to-silence-deposed-prince-dissidents-1499034642", "news_title": "Saudi Arabia Moves to Silence Deposed Prince, Dissidents ", "keywords": "crackdown,crown prince,freedom of speech,king salman,saudi shuffle,saudi succession,Mohammed bin Nayef,Mohammed bin Salman,political,general news,society,community,religion,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Germany\u2019s best soccer players were on summer vacation. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer went on a tropical honeymoon, while playmaker Mesut Ozil lounged around Beverly Hills. Thomas Muller, the striker, played a bunch of golf. Defender Mats Hummels passed the time by tweeting about the NBA.So the national team sent the next best options to the Confederations Cup, an international tournament that serves as a one-year-out dress rehearsal for the World Cup.But the soccer world hardly noticed a difference. It turns out it doesn\u2019t matter which players Germany sends out to fly the flag. They only need to have rolled off Die Mannschaft\u2019s turbo-charged conveyor belt. With a team of youngsters, first-timers and national team marginals, Germany defeated Chile 1-0 on Sunday night to win yet another major trophy.The Confederations Cup in itself doesn\u2019t mean a huge amount. It can\u2019t match the World Cup or any of the continental championships for prestige or emotional investment. But Germany\u2019s latest party in Russia confirmed a larger truth of international soccer right now: there is no level of the game at which Germany isn\u2019t currently incredible.Three years on from lifting their fourth World Cup, the Germans are steamrolling everyone. Using effectively a B-team in Sunday\u2019s final to hold off Chile, the defending South American champion, was only their latest show of strength. Earlier this summer, Germany also won the Under-21 European Championship. And last year, its Under-23 side earned a silver medal at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Even Germany\u2019s women\u2019s team is bossing world soccer. Ranked No. 2 in the world, it took gold in Rio and is now a heavy favorite to win the European Championship next month.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to reconfirm all of these victories next year,\u201d men\u2019s national team manager Joachim L\u00f6w said after Sunday\u2019s final. \u201cBut at the moment, Germany is still the best team in the world. That\u2019s what this means.\u201dDie Mannschaft\u2019s all-around dominance traces its roots to a major re-think at the German soccer federation\u2019s headquarters following the 1998 World Cup, a relative fiasco that saw the team knocked out in the quarterfinals by Croatia. For a generation of future players that was still wearing diapers, the country\u2019s soccer brass designed new development paths, new coaching methods and new facilities. They knew they were playing a long game.Today the men\u2019s talent pool is so deep that L\u00f6w could afford to take a totally experimental squad to the Confederations Cup, full of players who had never played together. Their average age at the start of the tournament was just 23.9. Only three of L\u00f6w\u2019s 23 men (boys, really) had taken part in the 2014 adventure in Brazil. And seven had never played a minute in the national team jersey.\u201cThey\u2019ve been playing together only for 3.5 weeks after all,\u201d L\u00f6w said. \u201cYou could feel in every training session that something was happening there. They were hungry.\u201dOn Sunday night, L\u00f6w\u2019s 11 starters had 182 national team appearances between them compared with the 932 caps shared by Chile\u2019s starting lineup. With that kind of experience gap in a major final, Chile should have bowled the German kids over. But for all of its attacking verve and veteran know-how, Chile was the side undone by a rookie mistake.In the 20th minute, defender Marcelo Diaz (50-plus international games for Chile) was caught in possession at the back by forward Timo Werner (age 21), who rolled the ball across an open goal to Lars Stindl (six national-team appearances). Stindl had only to tap it home.\u201cYou could see that this team was well prepared and always had a solution,\u201d goalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen said, summing up German soccer these days.For L\u00f6w, the whole situation creates a luxury\u2014some would say a problem\u2014that no other national team coach is even close to having: an utter glut of talented players. By the time he selects his squad of 23 next summer, he could be staring at a pool of 40 to 50 realistic candidates. In other words, he will leave home the equivalent of an entire World Cup squad that would at least make it through the group stage.\u201cWe have players for whom this and the Under-21 [European Championship] instilled a great deal of confidence,\u201d L\u00f6w said. \u201cBut for them, the work is just beginning. The really important tournaments are still coming up.\u201dAs for the stars he left at home this summer, L\u00f6w joked, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if we want to accept them back in the squad.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-is-showing-off-its-soccer-depth-1499032159", "news_title": "Germany Is Showing Off Its Soccer Depth", "keywords": "confederations cup,fifa,germany ,soccer,world cup,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "500 Startups co-founder       Dave McClure       has stepped into a general partner position following what the venture firm called \u201cinappropriate interactions with women in the tech community.\u201dCo-founder       Christine Tsai       wrote in a blog post on Friday that the firm has revamped its leadership structure following an investigation into Mr. McClure\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d behavior.

The pity is that the losers of this political retreat would be American workers with stagnant wages.ObamaCare created a 3.8-percentage-point surtax on capital gains, dividends, interest and other forms of so-called \u201cunearned income.\u201d This tax increase on capital was sold as hitting the rich, but note that it brought the top rate to 23.8% for singles earning as little as $200,000 and couples $250,000. That\u2019s a middle-class couple. Democrats are weaponizing the income-distribution tables as they always do, because most of the $172.2 billion in lost revenue over a decade on a static basis would flow to the top 20% of taxpayers.Support is growing to leave the surtax in place and spend the money on more insurance subsidies for low-income people or something else. Others want to delay repeal, or else defer the debate and deal with the surtax in tax reform. The conceit seems to be that Democrats and the media will give Republicans credit for surrendering, the controversy will melt away, and everyone will repair to the ideological conformity of the Aspen Ideas Festival.Best of luck with that one. Democrats will pocket the concession and continue demagoguing tax cuts for the wealthy as the tax debate begins\u2014only more emboldened for having tasted blood. The details are irrelevant to their opposition. GOP Senators also ought to understand that the goal of this left-right assault isn\u2019t simply to defeat the health-care bill but to sink pro-growth tax reform too.Most immediately, delay makes tax reform $172.2 billion harder, because Republicans would have to find the money in other budget offsets\u2014assuming they really do want to repeal the tax. But in that case, why not do so now? Republicans won\u2019t be in a stronger position after they\u2019ve shown they can\u2019t win the class-warfare argument.The larger progressive ambition is to make it too much trouble to ever again cut marginal tax rates for individuals or businesses to grow the economy, and some conservatives are joining them. They want the GOP to surrender to the neo-Keynesian view that tax rates don\u2019t matter to economic growth or individual behavior. A coterie of Beltway conservatives wants Republicans to repudiate their post-Reagan economic principles and return to their former status as tax collectors for the entitlement state while embracing right-wing income redistribution with child tax credits and family-leave subsidies.The economic merits don\u2019t seem to count in this political fantasia. The reason to repeal the surtax isn\u2019t to shower dollars on the affluent, as if anyone truly believes that is the intent. The reason is to increase the stock of capital and improve the incentives for capital formation, which in turn increases labor productivity, wages and job creation.Cutting the rate on capital income to 20%\u2014it was 15% as recently as 2012\u2014is a major increase in the return on investment and 3.8 points is close to half of the eight-point cut in the Bill Clinton-Newt Gingrich budget deal of 1997. That reform helped propel the 1990s boom, especially in a surge of venture capital in tech and other business startups.The Tax Foundation estimates that repealing the surtax would increase employment over the decade by 133,000 jobs and increase the size of the economy by 0.7%. After-tax earnings across the bottom 60% of the income distribution would be about 0.65% higher than they would otherwise be. Combined with a successful tax reform, workers could see a big pay raise for the first time in years, which was President Trump\u2019s foundational campaign promise.The economic literature is extensive that investors are highly sensitive to marginal tax rates, and they decide when to realize capital gains. Tax receipts for the first eight months of fiscal year 2017 are 3% off projections. The Congressional Budget Office attributes this slowdown to taxpayers who \u201cmay have shifted more income than projected from 2016 to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year.\u201dThis \u201clock-in effect\u201d reduces economic efficiency and therefore growth because capital isn\u2019t being cashed out to find its highest return. An economic expansion that is already long in the tooth at eight years can\u2019t afford a Republican tax rout.When Republicans campaigned to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d ObamaCare, we don\u2019t recall hearing that they meant only some of its tax increases. If they panic on the ObamaCare surtax, they\u2019ll give Democrats a major policy victory without having provided a single vote to pass it. Talk about bad politics.

Beijing may be miscalculating that this U.S. government will behave like every other.The arms sale includes such sorely needed equipment as antiship missiles and torpedoes, though that doesn\u2019t make up for two decades of neglect by past U.S. administrations. Washington is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to help the island if it comes under attack, so the smart policy is to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself and deter a Beijing invasion.Twenty years ago military experts derided the idea of a Chinese invasion as a \u201cmillion man swim,\u201d since the People\u2019s Liberation Army lacked even the amphibious landing capability to move its forces across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait. Today China has landing craft, advanced fighters, ships and submarines. Shore-based missiles make it dangerous for the U.S. Navy to enter the Taiwan Strait in a crisis.Taiwan\u2019s air force still flies some F-5 fighters bought in 1985, and its navy\u2019s two deployable submarines date from the same era. A 2016 report from the RAND Corporation estimated that Taiwan needs to spend $25.3 billion on new weapons over the next 20 years to create a credible deterrent against Chinese attack. The most critical need is for more F-16 fighters so Taiwan\u2019s air force isn\u2019t overwhelmed in the early days of a conflict, as would be the case now.Taiwan deserves some blame for failing to spend enough on its own defense, but President Tsai Ing-wen is committed to buying more U.S. arms and reinvigorating the domestic arms industry. The island began a project to build its own submarines earlier this year, but it will need American help and the Trump Administration can move with dispatch to provide it.Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury last week announced new sanctions to reduce the flow of money through China to North Korea. Treasury said it will cut off the China-based Bank of Dandong from the U.S. financial system for \u201cfacilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea\u2019s WMD and ballistic missile programs.\u201d Treasury also sanctioned Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., and two Chinese citizens,       Sun Wei       and       Li Hong Ri.These sanctions against Chinese entities dealing with the North are long overdue, and we\u2019ve advocated turning the financial screws against any Chinese doing business with the North if China\u2019s government won\u2019t rein in its client regime. Beijing loudly protested the new sanctions and the Taiwan arms sales, but it should understand that the U.S. can escalate on both fronts and there is pressure from both parties in the U.S. Congress to do so.After his friendly visit to Mar-a-Lago in April, Chinese President       Xi Jinping       may have concluded he can take a few token steps on North Korea and resume business as usual. But as the North\u2019s threat to the U.S. and its allies increases, China\u2019s malign neglect is untenable.Appeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-signals-to-china-1499030133", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Signals to China", "keywords": " bank of dandong, china, dalian global unity shipping, donald trump, li hong ri, military weapons, north korea, sanctions, sun wei,taiwan,xi jinping,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,politics,risk news,military action,weapons programs,editorials"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A bill that would make it tougher for President       Donald Trump       to ease sanctions on Russia appeared headed for speedy approval but now faces\u00a0obstacles in the House of Representatives, with the White House not ruling out a veto and some Republican lawmakers objecting that the measure would harm U.S. companies.The bill cleared the Senate last month by a 98-2 vote, a rare show of bipartisan unity in favor of legislation that would slap Russia with new sanctions partly because of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. After the House raised parliamentary objections to the bill, the Senate made technical fixes and sent it back to the House for a vote.For Mr. Trump, the bill presents a dilemma. If it passes as is, White House officials say, the measure would erode the president\u2019s power to conduct diplomacy. But if he works to scuttle the bill, Mr. Trump may open himself to criticism that he isn\u2019t holding Russia accountable for its actions in the election.The House is on recess until next week, and no timetable has been set for considering the bill, which also carries sanctions against Iran. Supporters of the measure from both parties worry that a delay gives opponents more time to soften it.\u201cDoes it give an opening for people to water it down? Absolutely. There are people who would love to see this not happen,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.) recently told reporters.Mr. Trump is to set to meet with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       for the first time in his presidency later this week at the G-20 summit of world leaders in Germany.\u00a0It isn\u2019t clear whether the sanctions bill will come up in conversation.As it stands, the bill would limit the White House\u2019s power to act on sanctions without congressional authorization, requiring the president to seek Congress\u2019s permission to relax the present set of sanctions against Russia.The measure would enshrine into law Russia sanctions that former President       Barack Obama       imposed. It would target Russian actors linked to human-rights abuses, arms sales and malicious cyberattacks. The bill also would strengthen existing sanctions on the Russian energy sector, while adding new sanctions to industries like mining, metals, shipping and railways.The White House says its concern is that the bill restricts the president\u2019s flexibility to carry out diplomacy, ceding more power to Congress.\u00a0The administration hasn\u2019t yet decided whether it would veto the bill if it passes the House unchanged, officials said.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that no administration\u2014not just the Trump administration\u2014but no administration would accept the way Congress is looking to shackle the executive branch,\u201d White House Legislative Affairs Director       Marc Short       said in an interview.Bound up in the issue, some Democrats contend, is Mr. Trump\u2019s own misgivings about U.S. intelligence officials\u2019 verdict that Russia interfered in the election to help him and damage his rival,       Hillary Clinton.Rep.       Eliot Engel       of New York, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview: \u201cThe president and his administration go very soft on Russia.\u201dA White House official disputed that assessment, saying that the Trump administration \u201cis not opposed to being tough on Russia\u201d and is committed to keeping \u201cexisting sanctions programs\u201d intact until the Kremlin \u201cmoderates its anti-U.S. activities.\u201dMr. Trump, on the campaign trail and as president, has frequently voiced skepticism over Russian interference in the election. Pointing to the cybertheft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that were leaked last summer, Mr. Trump said at a candidate debate in September that the perpetrator could have been Russia, China or possibly \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201dLater, as president, he told CBS News that it was difficult to identify a hacker unless the person is caught \u201cin the act.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019ll go along with Russia. It could have been China. It could have been a lot of different groups.\u201dSome House Republicans are raising other objections to the bill. Rep.       Pete Sessions,        a Texas\u00a0Republican who chairs the House Rules committee, said he worries that, if the bill were to pass, energy companies may have to reveal \u201cproprietary\u201d information that could weaken their competitive standing.\u201cWe need to change this bill,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. He added: \u201cYou would expect that a Texas member would understand the needs of companies in Texas.\u201dWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Bill Faces Hurdles.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delay-in-house-opens-russia-sanctions-bill-to-dilution-1499030097", "news_title": "Delay in House Opens Russia Sanctions Bill to Dilution ", "keywords": "2016 election,bill,donald trump,energy companies,interference,russia sanctions,vladimir putin,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}, {"content": "In its 76th year, the \u201cAmerican Century\u201d seems headed for a premature end. Americans are reportedly tired of shouldering the burdens of world leadership, supporting democracy, promoting free trade, and defending their allies. From now on, the American president says, the indispensable nation is going to look out for No.\u00a01, raise new barriers to trade and immigration, and renegotiate\u2014or possibly renege on\u2014recent and longstanding commitments.Europe\u2019s most influential leader, German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        has given voice to what is likely a wider sentiment: America\u2019s allies can no longer count on the U.S. and must take their fates into their own hands.But America\u2019s tendency to draw inward is nothing new. The American Century was first proclaimed by       Henry Luce,        publisher of Time and Life magazines, in words that resonate today. \u201cWe Americans are unhappy,\u201d he wrote in February 1941. \u201cWe are not happy about America. We are not happy about ourselves in relation to America. We are nervous\u2014or gloomy\u2014or apathetic. As we look out at the rest of the world we are confused; we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dHe continued: \u201cAs we look toward the future\u2014our own future and the future of other nations\u2014we are filled with foreboding. The future doesn\u2019t seem to hold anything for us except conflict, disruption, war.\u201d While this may sound familiar, Luce was describing a nation still recovering from the Great Depression. Most Americans were disillusioned with the results of the First World War and determined to stay out of the Second.Many of today\u2019s Americans still haven\u2019t recovered from the Great Recession that began in 2008. Nearly all are deeply disappointed with the results of the seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 1941 Luce argued that \u201cother nations can survive simply because they have endured so long\u2014sometimes with more and sometimes with less significance. But this nation, conceived in adventure and dedicated to the progress of man\u2014this nation cannot truly endure unless there courses strongly through its veins from Maine to California the blood of purposes and enterprise and high resolve.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIt is in this spirit that all of us are called, each to his own measure of capacity, and each in the widest horizon of his vision, to create the first great American Century.\u201dDonald Trump       is not the first president to want to reduce America\u2019s foreign commitments. In 1969, as America began to withdraw from Vietnam, President       Richard Nixon       established a doctrine that came to bear his name, warning that the U.S. would henceforth expect its allies to provide the manpower for their own defense. Presidents       Jimmy Carter,       George W. Bush       and       Barack Obama       also entered office promising a restrained American role abroad.Yet Mr. Carter went on to launch a covert war against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan and enunciated a doctrine of his own, declaring that any \u201cattempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.\u201d Mr. Bush pledged not to engage in \u201cnation building,\u201d yet ended up doing that in Afghanistan and Iraq. During his first term Mr. Obama announced a \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d then the world\u2019s most peaceful region, but spent his second term boosting American military commitments in Europe and the Middle East instead.Isolationism is a recurring temptation of American foreign policy. Responding to new and unforeseen challenges, however, the U.S. has repeatedly resisted that temptation and risen to the demands of global leadership. Is it different this time? Certainly the official rhetoric from the Trump administration is more fervent. And Mr. Trump\u2019s election is a sign that American dissatisfaction with the existent global division of labor is widespread.But we don\u2019t know how the country will respond to the next crisis. It took the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, nine months after Luce\u2019s call to arms, to push the U.S. into World War II. It took the installation of Soviet puppet regimes throughout Eastern Europe to keep America engaged on the Continent for 40 years after the defeat of Nazi Germany. It took the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan for Mr. Carter to commit to defending the Persian Gulf. The 9/11 attacks turned Mr. Bush into a nation builder, and the rise of the Islamic State and the Russian invasion of Ukraine led Mr. Obama to recommit American forces to the Middle East and Europe.Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, discovered that while Americans wanted a less costly foreign policy, they had difficulty accepting the diminished influence that went with it. Americans are unlikely to remain comfortable seeing their leaders heading a coalition of petro-state monarchs and illiberal strongmen while the democratic world marches to a different drum.President Trump and his administration will be tested soon. The test could come in Syria or on the Korean Peninsula, or in some wholly unanticipated place and some entirely unexpected way. Then, when allies\u2019 support and international solidarity will be at a premium, Americans will find out whether their century of pre-eminence has ended.Mr. Dobbins is a senior fellow at the RAND Corp., a former U.S. ambassador and assistant secretary of state, and the author of \u201cForeign Service: Five Decades at the Forefront of American Diplomacy,\u201d just out from Brookings Institution Press.Appeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-retrenchment-is-a-golden-oldie-1499030053", "news_title": "American Retrenchment Is a Golden Oldie", "keywords": " abroad, america first, donald trump, international relations,isolationism, strategy, u.s., united states,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Paris\u2018Seeking the American Macron!\u201d the Weekly Standard\u2019s Bill Kristol tweeted the other day, expressing his disdain for Republicans and Democrats. To hear the French philosopher       Alain Finkielkraut       tell it, Mr. Kristol should look in Paris.Like the anti-Trump Mr. Kristol, Mr. Finkielkraut didn\u2019t care for either choice in his country\u2019s recent presidential election. He has no truck with the xenophobic nationalism of       Marine Le Pen\u2019s       National Front. As for President       Emmanuel Macron,        he is far too American for Mr. Finkielkraut\u2019s taste.The new leader\u2019s official presidential portrait photo was unveiled last week, and the French media noted its striking resemblance to       Barack Obama\u2019s       from 2012. Mr. Macron sent supporters to knock on voters\u2019 doors, a campaign practice that is familiar to Americans but was unheard of here. When the president sings \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem, he closes his eyes and holds his hand over his heart. \u201cThis is not our tradition,\u201d Mr. Finkielkraut, 67, told me in a recent interview at his book-lined apartment near Jardin du Luxembourg.Mr. Finkielkraut himself is a distinctly French type, a celebrity intellectual \u00e0 la R\u00e9gis Debray,       Pascal Bruckner       or Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. His complaints about Mr. Macron\u2014and America\u2014run deeper than political symbolism and ritual. He argues that France faces a \u201ccivilizational\u201d crisis, a degeneration of social bonds whose symptoms include a decaying language, an inability to integrate immigrants, a contempt for French history, and a rise in terrorism, which he calls \u201cthe new ambient music of Europe.\u201dMuch of this he blames on multiculturalism, which he sees as a worldview made in America. \u201cFrance is an old civilization; it has the right to preserve itself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe multicultural society is a multi-conflicted society.\u201d In particular, large waves of Muslim immigrants have failed to adopt the values of the secular republic, known as la\u00efcit\u00e9. Candidate Macron celebrated France\u2019s cultural disunity, proclaiming: \u201cThere is no such thing as a single French culture.\u201d To Mr. Finkielkraut, multiculturalism is a form of American \u201cimperialism\u201d\u2014one that, by denying a country like France its right to maintain its particular identity, belies its claim to celebrate diverse cultures.\u201cWe willingly accept the replacement of the French language by \u2018Globish,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Finkielkraut laments. To illustrate, he cites the English-language slogan of Paris\u2019s 2024 Olympic bid: \u201cMade for sharing.\u201d Originally used in a Cadbury chocolate commercial, the slogan was later adapted by Burger King for its wedge-sliced Pizza Burger.Then there is the new president\u2019s economic program. \u201cEmmanuel Macron\u2019s philosophy is that of homo economicus,\u201d Mr. Finkielkraut explains, referring to the theory that man\u2019s motivations come down to rational self-interest. Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, often sounds less like de Gaulle than Zuckerberg. Last month he proclaimed in English: \u201cI want France to be a nation that thinks and moves like a startup.\u201d He promised the French state would be a \u201cplatform and not a constraint\u201d and added: \u201cEntrepreneurship is the new France.\u201dThe new France sounds a lot like the old America, but Mr. Finkielkraut isn\u2019t alone in thinking the country already resembles the U.S. in its social problems. One of the most popular books in Paris is       Christophe Guilluy\u2019s       \u201cThe Peripheral France,\u201d which cites growing inequality between big cities like Paris and Lyon, which benefit from globalization, and the left-behind rest of the country.Never known as a cheery people, the French are now the most pessimistic on earth. One 2016 global poll found 88% of Frenchmen felt their country was heading in the wrong direction\u2014the highest rate of gloom among all nations surveyed. To be sure, France\u2019s sclerotic welfare and regulatory state has stymied growth. But Mr. Finkielkraut argues that what his country needs isn\u2019t a Silicon Valley on the Seine, but a raison d\u2019\u00eatre\u2014a sense of confidence in its purpose and way of life.Mr. Macron ran on the slogan, \u201cEn Marche!\u201d\u2014\u201cForward!\u201d or \u201cOn the Move!\u201d That\u2019s also the name of his new party.

Two competing candle stores\u2014American Candle and the Candle Shop of the Poconos\u2014beckoned to us with roadside signs, but it seemed advisable to motor on.A predicted band of storms were sweeping across the eastern part of the country as this new summer was beginning. I\u2019d been in New York and was due in Chicago by mid-evening. Flights were being canceled. So, the night before, I\u2019d called a fellow I\u2019d met during the New York visit\u2014a former long-haul truck driver who\u2019d told me he hankered to see the Great Lakes again\u2014and asked what were the chances he\u2019d be willing to drive straight from Manhattan to Illinois. He said sure; we worked out a price.By 8 a.m. we were on the road. You know how divided this country is reputed to be? How ugly things allegedly are? Here\u2019s a suggestion: Cross the United States by road this summer. Take a good look out your window. The country itself is pretty swell\u2014beautiful and vibrant and full of small surprises. We, who live here, may do everything we can to screw things up, but our mutual home brims with moments of random loveliness.On a busy street corner in Newark, N.J., a mother protectively clutched her daughter\u2019s hand as they waited to cross. In eastern Pennsylvania, the soaring, craggy rock formations by the highway sent a silent message: We were here before you were born and we\u2019ll be here after you are gone. Driving over the Delaware River, with the splendor of the famed Delaware Water Gap below, we caught the first magnificent sight of the Pocono Mountains\u2014and those trees, all those breathtaking miles of ancient trees. Who could ever count them? An impossible task.In large cities life can seem crowded and claustrophobic. In rural Pennsylvania the overwhelming sensation was of how much open space America still has to offer: the room, if we choose, to spread out, to free ourselves from barking over each other\u2019s shoulders. What must life here have been like before the telephone, before television, before the internet, when people didn\u2019t have thousands of angry and disembodied voices\u2014the voices of strangers\u2014barraging them every day, stirring them up? When the voices they heard belonged, in the main, to their neighbors?The onetime truck driver favored classical music on his radio, which gave our unfolding view a quietly majestic soundtrack. The lines between counties, the divisions, felt artificial, invisible. The physical nation felt seamless. Exit 277: Lake Harmony. If only.We would hit 20 or 30 minutes of bright sunshine and then another storm. On farmland east of Bellefonte a dozen cows stood in formation in the downpour. At the Milesburg Travel Center we parked next to a gray car populated by one man, his two sons, and three bicycles lashed upright to their roof in the dark rain, like props-in-waiting for       Margaret Hamilton       in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d The skies cleared anew;       Tchaikovsky       was on the radio, and in a pasture near a farmhouse in Hazen a family had set up twin sets of soccer goals.Six hours and 10 minutes into our journey we were in Ohio. So many stretches of concrete over bodies of water, both wide and tiny; this country, when it wants to, has always known how to bridge things. We crossed the Mahoning River en route to Warren. Before the end of our drive there would be the Cuyahoga, the Vermilion, the Maumee, Crooked Creek, Grapevine Creek, the Grand Calumet.In Lorain County, Ohio, was a big new Riddell factory where football helmets are manufactured for the kind of conflict from which combatants expect to go home not hating each other.

One day in early 1987, with Wall Street humming, a meeting after trading closed involved several cases of champagne. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had breached 2000 that day, a cause for celebration. A week and a half later, more champagne was ordered when the average passed 2100. Then again a few weeks later for 2200. Eventually my boss stopped buying bubbly when breaking records became the norm. Japanese insurance companies would show up at the brokerage firm where I was a securities analyst and ask for a list of our five favorite stocks, then hand it to their salesman and say \u201cbuy 50,000 of each.\u201dOn Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, the average dropped 108 points. Rumors swirled that we\u2019d celebrate with cases of Bud Light. No matter: I was with some traders and a client in a stretch limo, headed to watch       Mike Tyson       fight       Tyrell Biggs       for the heavyweight championship\u2014an event staged by       Donald Trump       in Atlantic City, N.J. Man, I miss the 1980s.The market truly crashed the next Monday, dropping 508 points, or 22.6%. In retrospect, there had been signs all over the place. How did everyone miss them? Well, as the old Wall Street adage goes, no one rings a bell at the top (or bottom) of the market.So here we are in 2017. The stock market is supposed to be the great humbler, but the records are coming fast and easy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 8% for the year and flirts with a record practically every day. Some of this is structural: Bonds are no fun, since the yield curve is flattening and three-month Treasurys are 1%. So money flows to stocks\u2014and other weird things.A friend of mine used to run a large-growth mutual fund. In the dot-com mania of 1999, he told me that tens of millions of new capital would flow in every single day. Trying to figure out where to put it, he would consider the new batch of initial public offerings\u2014and then inevitably he just would buy more             Yahoo                   or America Online or             Cisco                   or, what the heck, Yahoo again.Today, money is flowing into exchange-traded funds. But because ETFs are weighted by market cap, that money flows into the biggest names:             Facebook,       Amazon, Apple,             Microsoft,       Google. Classic momos, or momentum stocks. The church of what\u2019s working now. What could possibly go wrong?Sure, the economy is picking up, earnings are growing, and the business is being transformed by mobile, cloud and artificial intelligence. But who doesn\u2019t already know that? On the flip side, we\u2019re at the start of a 30-year cycle of interest-rate raising, nonhousing debt is higher than in 2008, and deciphering China\u2019s direction is as hard as Chinese arithmetic.Remember, bull markets end when the perception of earnings growth disappears, maybe because of a recession or even simply pending inflation. Manias, on the other hand, end when the market runs out of buyers.In 1987, Treasury Secretary       James Baker       refused to support the dollar, and Japanese buyers left town. In late 1999, Federal Reserve Chairman       Alan Greenspan       flooded the economy with money to head off a potential panic over the Y2K computer glitch. Then in early 2000 he pulled the money back in, ending the stock-buying frenzy. In 2007, the subprime mortgage-backed security market rolled over as foreign buyers left, though because of thinly traded markets it took another year to show up in prices.Another ding-dong: In less than a year at least 50 companies, including one named Mysterium, have raised hundreds of millions of dollars via something called Initial Coin Offerings, selling a percentage of a new cryptocurrency service in exchange for other digital coins. That\u2019s a modern version of a blank-check company, which usually ends in tears.So are we facing a raging bull market or a mania? Sadly, you\u2019ll only know in retrospect. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a top today, though if it is, I\u2019m happy to take credit. It could go on for a while. Pundits pore over charts of volatility and put-call ratios. Forget that. Real investors survey the landscape and look for signs of a market gone loco. In one week in late 1999, the hedge fund I used to run had two groups from the Middle East each insist on wiring us $500 million. Practically \u201cThe Gong Show.\u201d We politely declined and then started returning money to our existing investors.Are there any bells ringing now? How about a few months back when someone looked me in the eye and insisted\u2014without cracking a smile\u2014that Uber was a bargain at a $68 billion valuation? Or when, with shades of AOL and             Time Warner,       Amazon bought             Whole Foods                   for $13 billion\u2014and then its stock went up by more than that amount? Or when Tesla missed its numbers again and the stock rose anyway? Or when the price of a bitcoin, backed by nothing but the faith of devotees, hit $3,000, tripling over a year? Or when Hertz stock rose 14% on news of a deal with Apple for a self-driving car that is still vaporware?Listen for whom the bell tolls.Mr. Kessler writes on technology and markets for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-whom-the-bell-tolls-sell-1499029457", "news_title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls, Sell", "keywords": " bear, bonds, bull, crash,investing, markets, sell, stocks, top,Yahoo,AABA,YHOO,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,financial services,securities"}, {"content": "The \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d of Central America\u2014Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador\u2014is one of the world\u2019s most dangerous regions. Drug trafficking and a weak rule of law have spawned powerful organized-crime networks that have overwhelmed government institutions. The instability has cost the region economically, feeding a vicious circle of poverty and violence with spillover effects for Mexico and the U.S.The       Trump       administration recognizes that faster economic growth is part of what\u2019s needed for the region and is looking beyond simply throwing money at the problem. To succeed, it will have to break with the State Department\u2019s conventional wisdom that underdevelopment is caused by a paucity of taxes and regulation. It will also have to climb down from its view that trade is a zero-sum game.Policy makers might start by reading a new report on micro, small and medium-sized businesses in Guatemala by the Kirzner Center for Entrepreneurship at Francisco Marroquin University in Guatemala City. It measures\u2014by way of household surveys in 179 municipalities and interviews with industry experts\u2014\u201cattitudes, activities and aspirations of the entrepreneur.\u201d The work is part of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor study for 2016-17, which covers 65 countries.At a June meeting in Miami with officials from the three Northern Triangle countries and Mexico, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       spoke of the need to \u201cimprove the overall economic competitiveness\u201d of the region and \u201cboost the willingness of private companies to invest in Central America.\u201dThat had to be music to the ears of most Guatemalans since the GEM study ranks Guatemala No. 1 for its positive view of entrepreneurship as a career choice. Guatemala also ranks high (No. 9) for the percentage of the population engaged in new businesses, defined as less than 3\u00bd years old. And it ranks 12th in terms of the percentage of the population who \u201care latent entrepreneurs and who intend to start a business within three years.\u201d Guatemalan early-stage entrepreneurs see themselves as innovative, ranking seventh in the perception that they offer a product that has a unique, competitive edge.Yet Guatemalan eagerness to run a business has not translated into prosperity for the nation, and therein lies the lesson for Mr. Tillerson and friends. The country ranks a lowly 59th in entrepreneurs\u2019 expectations that they will create six or more jobs in five years. It also sinks to near the bottom of the pack (62nd) in creating business-service companies. More than 76% of businesses are consumption-oriented. Service businesses make up only 3.4% of all companies.Failure to create jobs and grow, and the heavy concentration of businesses in the consumer sector, reflects the difficulty Guatemalan entrepreneurs have in getting credit. That\u2019s not unusual in an economy in which more than 72% of businesses operate underground and therefore cannot access the formal banking system. Those businesses generate income but they are not able to make investments for future growth.The World Bank\u2019s 2017 \u201cDoing Business\u201d survey provides many clues about why the informal economy is so large. Guatemala ranks 88th out of 190 countries world-wide for ease of running an enterprise, but in key categories that make up the index it performs much worse.The survey finds that it takes 256 hours to comply with the tax code. The total tax take is 35.2% of profits. It takes almost 20 days to start a legal enterprise and costs 24% of per capita income. To enforce a contract it takes more than 1,400 days and costs more than 26% of the claim.Guatemalan migrants who make it to the U.S. are famously entrepreneurial and send home more in remittances every year than the total value of apparel, sugar and coffee exports. But at home the state is hostile to business and disrespectful of property rights. As a result, most new ventures see the cost of formality as outweighing the benefits.The obvious solution is an overhaul of the tax, regulatory and legal systems in order to increase economic freedom. A lower tax rate and a simpler code would give companies an incentive to operate legally, thereby broadening the base and improving access to credit.Instead the Guatemalan authorities\u2014encouraged by the State Department and the International Monetary Fund\u2014spend their resources trying to impose a complex, costly system in an economy of mostly informal businesses with a much-smaller number of legal, productive entrepreneurs. Recently the United Nations International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala recommended a new tax to fight \u201cimpunity.\u201dThis is no way to attract capital or raise revenue. Nor is Trump protectionism going to help Mr. Tillerson turn Central America around. Companies won\u2019t want to manufacture in the region if they don\u2019t have access to the U.S. market.If the U.S. wants to see an economic recovery in the Northern Triangle, it has to recognize the reality of the market.Write to O\u2019Grady@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-revive-central-america-1499029385", "news_title": "How to Revive Central America", "keywords": " business, el salvador, entrepreneurship, guatemala,honduras, institutions,northern triangle,rule of law,political,general news,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,trafficking,smuggling,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "When you begin to worry that America\u2019s traditions are lost to political correctness and the genius of the Founders forgotten, stand on Main Street in Leland, Mich., and watch a July 4 parade roll past.Leland is a rural hamlet sandwiched between Lake Michigan on the west and Lake Leelanau on the east. It has become a summertime retreat for those who migrate to the water when the prairie begins to bake. I am a Virginian who grew up with the salt of the Atlantic in my nostrils. But I married a daughter of the Midwest, and she introduced me to the Great Lakes, where nostalgic American traditions still resonate.Every summer, several generations of families return to Leland, and the town\u2019s July 4 parade is a main event. In years past, Gen.       Mark W. Clark,        liberator of Rome in 1944, spent his summers along the shore and donned his uniform to march down Main Street with other veterans. A few years back,       Russ Stroud,        who retired here after a successful career downstate as an auto executive, stopped his 1936       Studebaker       grain truck in front of the judges\u2019 stand and, dressed in a tuxedo top and Bermuda shorts, got down on one knee to repropose to his wife.Last year, every spot along Main Street was taken well in advance of the parade, with swarms of young children perched eagerly on both curbs. The Stars and Stripes were everywhere: on silk bow ties, top hats, headbands, T-shirts and painted faces. Uncle Sam, in full regalia, pedaled by on a bike, his white beard and tails flowing in the wind.The parade opened with the color guard, and as Old Glory passed, men and women of all ages stood, some with hands pressed respectfully over their hearts. Next came the veterans, no longer of World War II but Korea or Vietnam or Iraq. Following behind was a series of antique Army jeeps and armored personnel carriers.Then came the Boy Scouts, Leland Township Fire and Rescue, the Cherry King and Queen, and the Grand Marshal in a 1922 convertible. A chorus line of antique cars carried a series of candidates for political office, from local county commissioner to Congress. What, after all, would July 4 be without a reminder that the Declaration of Independence was, among other things, a clarion call for independent choice?There were floats for practically every entity in Leelanau County, from the Coffee Club to the Library Committee to the state-champion volleyball team. All the groups were armed with candy and bubble gum, which they tossed toward the curbs. Children swarmed like pigeons in the park competing for crusts of bread.The float that really captivated the crowd was from Bunek True Value Hardware. In the rear was a wooden outhouse and in front, seated on a white porcelain \u201cthrone,\u201d was someone, no doubt a member of the Bunek family, holding aloft a silver painted plunger like a scepter.Forty-five minutes later, it was over. As the crowd dispersed, everyone wore a smile. Heading to my car, I caught sight of a thematic banner, one of those carried periodically throughout the parade. This one read: \u201cRemember the past, imagine the future.\u201d Good advice for that, and any, July 4.Mr. Boyd is a partner in the Washington office of DLA Piper and served as an assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration.Appeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-main-street-independence-day-1499029319", "news_title": "A Main Street Independence Day", "keywords": "4th of july, america, birthday, flag, fourth of july, indepedence day, leland, michigan, parade, patriotic, united states,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sports,recreation,volleyball,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "The word \u201cLockerbie\u201d entered the global vocabulary on Dec. 21, 1988, when Pan Am Flight 103, en route from London to New York, blew up over the Scottish village of that name. All 243 passengers and 16 crew members died, along with 11 people on the ground. Ten months later, on Sept. 19, 1989, another plane exploded, this time over the Sahara Desert; 170 people perished on UTA\u2019s Flight 772, traveling to Paris from N\u2019Djamena, the capital of Chad.Stuart Newberger       dubs Flight 772 \u201cthe forgotten flight.\u201d Unlike Pan Am 103, the French airliner crashed thousands of miles away from TV cameras and the families of the victims. While Lockerbie and terrorism soon became synonymous world-wide, \u201cUTA 772 might just as well have crashed on the moon,\u201d he writes. Post-crash investigations found that both planes had been destroyed by suitcase bombs planted by Libyan agents acting on the orders of the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi.Mr. Newberger is well-placed to tell the story of Flight 772. He was the lawyer for the families of the seven Americans who died aboard the plane as they sued Libya for damages in U.S. federal court. \u201cThe Forgotten Flight\u201d is an exhaustive examination of the events leading up to the crime and a detailed record of the families\u2019 struggle to hold Libya accountable.Much of the evidence introduced in the U.S. trial was gathered by France, given the French ownership of UTA (now part of Air France). The probe was led by       Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re,        a magistrate judge who had earned the nickname Le Sheriff for his toughness and tenacity. He and his team traveled the world in pursuit of the facts about what happened aboard Flight 772. An early clue came from a Congolese prostitute who said that, a few days before the crash, a Libyan client had told her not to travel on the doomed flight.By Stuart H. Newberger  Oneworld, 320 pages, $30It was, however, the discovery of a tiny piece of green circuit board\u2014\u201cmiraculously recovered from the tons of debris scattered over miles of barren desert,\u201d Mr. Newberger writes\u2014that provided the evidentiary link to Libya. The trail was tortuous: The circuit board had been manufactured in Taiwan for a German company that used it in a remote-controlled timer sold to a Libyan firm connected to Libya\u2019s intelligence officials.When \u201cThe Forgotten Flight\u201d recounts the French investigation, it moves along quickly and resembles a spy thriller. The only flaw in the narrative is the author\u2019s irritating habit of lapsing into pidgin English when relating his conversations with Le Sheriff and others. Zee editor of Meester New-ber-jay\u2019s manuscript ought to have excised these cartoonish passages.The rest of the story, though well told, is not as gripping as the hunt for evidence. Mr. Newberger describes the twists and turns of the legal case brought by the Flight 772 families and reviews other terrorism cases heard in the U.S. and abroad. The book\u2019s final chapters take up sovereign immunity\u2014the legal doctrine that protects countries and their diplomats from lawsuits in U.S. courts unless specific legislation lifts it.Such legislation was passed in 1996, when Congress and President       Bill Clinton       eliminated sovereign immunity for countries that sponsored terrorism, making it possible for the Flight 772 families to sue Libya. In 2007 a U.S. federal judge found Libya responsible for the Flight 772 bombing and in 2008 ordered the Libyan government to pay the unprecedented sum of $7 billion to the families of the victims and to the American owner of the plane, which UTA had leased.Also in 2008 Congress passed new legislation, signed by President       George W. Bush,        restoring sovereign immunity for Libya as part of a plan by the U.S. government to restore normal relations with that country and bring it into an antiterrorist coalition. Mr. Newberger\u2019s judicial victory became moot. Not long after, the State Department began negotiating with Libya, which, in 2009, paid $1.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury to compensate all victims of Libyan acts of terrorism. The Flight 772 families each received about $10 million. Their claims weren\u2019t fully resolved until 2013.Mr. Newberger\u2019s disappointment at this turn of events is understandable. He is upset that the families did not receive a larger settlement and that the process was taken out of the hands of the court, whose judgment, he writes, had provided the families \u201ca significant level of closure on their own personal journeys of pain and loss.\u201dEven so, he is over the top in his denunciation of the U.S. deal with Gadhafi. He sees it as a betrayal of the rule of law, an insult to the victims\u2019 families and a \u201creward\u201d to a murderous despot. Among his most preposterous statements is one in which he says that the judge\u2019s original ruling had been \u201cpushed aside, subject only to the whims of the President.\u201d He never explains why persuading Libya to give up its nuclear program and join the fight against al Qaeda\u2014objectives that the president had determined were in the national interest\u2014amounted to mere \u201cwhims.\u201d The families deserved to be compensated and their loved ones remembered, but not at the cost of Americans\u2019 larger interest in reining in a terrorist state.Near the end of \u201cThe Forgotten Flight,\u201d Mr. Newberger quotes riveting passages from the transcript of the Flight 772 trial. Experts are describing the flight\u2019s final moments\u2014the shards of metal flying through the cabin, the fire, the plane breaking up. Says one: \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance . . . probably better than even, that a lot of passengers were conscious until they hit the ground.\u201dTwenty-eight years after Libyan terrorists killed 170 people over a remote desert, Mr. Newberger\u2019s well-researched book ensures that UTA Flight 772 will no longer be forgotten.Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former deputy editor of the Journal\u2019s editorial page, is the author of \u201cThanksgiving: The Holiday at the Heart of the American Experience.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-02 17:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/terrors-tailwind-1499029226", "news_title": "Terror\u2019s Tailwind", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,disasters,accidents,arts,entertainment,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,reviews"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014How long Europe\u2019s current stock and bond rally lasts may depend on U.S. investors like       Eric Stein.International funds, such as Mr. Stein\u2019s             Eaton Vance,        EV 0.62%       had withdrawn billions of dollars from the eurozone for large parts of the last decade, amid a sovereign debt crisis and weak growth.But even as the region\u2019s economy and markets rebound and political risks appear to clear, Mr. Stein\u2014like many big foreign-based investors\u2014are still cautious amid lingering concerns over political and financial instability.An analysis of the holdings of the 29 largest active equity mutual funds with global mandates\u2014which control close to $500 billion in assets and are predominantly U.S.-based\u2014shows that major active investors outside of Europe, as a group, haven\u2019t added eurozone shares this year, according to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.While local funds can help the upward momentum, and some U.S. hedge funds are wagering on Europe, the large pool of capital from big foreign investors is key to how high those markets can go. International flows helped push European equities higher amid signs of firming economic growth last year.But as valuations rise many of the largest foreign-based investors aren\u2019t buying into the rally until they have greater certainty that Europe\u2019s problems are behind it.\u201cWe can see some cyclical momentum with good growth numbers and signs of political cohesion\u2026 but the question is, how long will that last?\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cSome of the most urgent European issues haven\u2019t magically gone away.\u201dAfter years of underperformance, eurozone equities are on a tear, with the Euro Stoxx index up around 6.5% this year compared with a roughly 8% gain for the S&P 500. In dollar terms, the Euro Stoxx has comfortably outperformed the S&P, given that the brighter economic outlook has pushed up the euro 8.6% against the greenback this year.Eurozone junk-rated bonds have notched a return of 4.2% this year compared with 4.9% for the U.S. market, according to Bloomberg Barclays bond indexes.The eurozone economy grew 2.3% in the first quarter of the year over the same period in 2016, its fastest rate since 2015, compared with 1.4% in the U.S.In politics, the threat to the eurozone from antiestablishment lawmakers who want to take their countries out of the EU has faded. Such parties lost in recent French and Dutch elections and polls show their popularity slipping in Germany, Italy and elsewhere.Meanwhile, Italian authorities last month bailed out two troubled lenders in a move that analysts said was a step toward stabilizing the country\u2019s weak banking sector.\u201cBy and large we\u2019re in an environment where the investment backdrop in Europe is benign,\u201d said       Mark Dowding,        co-head of investment-grade debt at London-based BlueBay Asset Management. Mr. Dowding believes, for instance, that Italian government bonds look attractive at current levels.The yield premium of 10-year Italian bonds over ultrasafe German bunds is currently around 1.7 percentage points, down from a two-year high of around 2.1 percentage points in April before the French elections, according to Tradeweb.But many funds are more cautious after being burned several times before. That was particularly so during the sovereign-debt crisis of 2010 to 2012, when yields on bonds such as Italy\u2019s soared amid concern about a eurozone breakup.Mr. Stein, who is Eaton Vance\u2019s co-director of global income, said that while the short-term outlook for Europe has improved, there are plenty of unresolved problems. That includes uncertainty around Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations, the impact of the European Central Bank tapering its massive bond-buying program and longer term questions over further EU integration and the region\u2019s poor demographic prospects.\u201cWe just seem to have a major European crisis once a year,\u201d he said.The fact that markets have rallied makes some investors all the more cautious.Pacific Investment Management Co. scooped up Italian bonds in the years following the sovereign debt crisis. Now that those yields have fallen, the bonds don\u2019t look so attractive given the prospect of the ECB tapering and remaining political risks, said       Nicola Mai,        global sovereign credit analyst at Pimco.\u201cA eurozone breakup is still very possible over the medium to long term,\u201d said Mr. Mai.Investors sold Italian bonds after ECB President       Mario Draghi       hinted on Tuesday at scaling back the bank\u2019s asset purchases.Still, on some metrics Europe remains cheap compared with the U.S. Analysts estimate earnings per share growth of 16.9% this year for the Euro Stoxx, according to FactSet, compared with 10.3% for the S&P 500. The price-to-book value, which compares a company\u2019s share price to the value of its assets, for the Euro Stoxx index is 1.7, compared with 3.1 for the S&P 500.A wave of foreign money could help lift European assets further because the positioning of global investors in Europe is now \u201cvery low,\u201d said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multiasset strategist at             BlackRock Inc.Ms. Mateos y Lago thinks foreign money flows will return.\u201cThere is a really strong domestic growth story taking place in Europe right now\u2026 people are waking up to that,\u201d she said.Write to Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Funds Don\u2019t Buy Europe Recovery Story.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 16:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-u-s-funds-arent-buying-the-european-recovery-story-1499027984", "news_title": "Big U.S. Funds Aren\u2019t Buying the European Recovery Story ", "keywords": " brexit, ecb taper, europe,finreg, funds,investing, investments,Eaton Vance,EV,European Central Bank,BlueBay Asset Management,Pacific Investment Management,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,financial services,securities"}, {"content": "In his commentary, Jeryl Bier claims that our hate-group designations are overly broad and that our work is biased (\u201cThe Insidious Influence of the SPLC,\u201d op-ed, June 22). Neither claim is true. As Exhibit A, he brings up the Family Research Council (FRC), which he calls \u201cmainstream.\u201d We list the FRC as a hate group because it traffics in incendiary name-calling and demonizing lies about the LGBT community. It constantly portrays gay people as sick, evil, perverted, incestuous and a danger to the nation. If that\u2019s not hate, I don\u2019t know what is. FBI statistics show that the LGBT community is the minority group most likely to be targeted for violent hate crimes.Mr. Bier asserts that because we\u2019ve called out the FRC for its bigotry, we bear a measure of responsibility for a 2012 attack on its headquarters. But publicly calling out hate is not equivalent to espousing it. It\u2019s more important to call out the bigots who wear business suits than those who parade in Klan robes. Anyone familiar with our work couldn\u2019t possibly conclude that we \u201creflexively play down threats from the left,\u201d as Mr. Bier claims.

But he did not dispute the facts or point to similar activity on the left. We have every right to educate the public about hate and bigotry in the public sphere.Finally, Mr. Bier attempts to link us to the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise. We were among more than 600 groups that the shooter \u201cliked\u201d on Facebook.

We are products of a liberal upbringing during the 1960s, and the SPLC was in the sweet spot of the type of organizations we wanted to support. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.The straw that broke our back was when Ben Carson was placed on the extremist hate list. When I heard about this, I immediately called and was told that his name was removed. I must not have been the only supporter who was outraged. There are many good reasons to disagree with Ben Carson\u2019s views, and I have troubles with many of them. However, the one thing I know for sure is that Dr. Carson isn\u2019t a hater, and he has contributed more than most of us to the benefit of our country and will continue to do so. This lack of judgment on the part of the SPLC demonstrated to me that the organization had lost its moral compass, and we could no longer support it.Mark HarrisPalo Alto, Calif.Taking people and groups with different views from your own and lumping them with villains is the mark of intimidation.

Fed watchers will assess whether soft inflation readings are increasingly dividing the Fed over the appropriate course for monetary policy.

The U.S. trade deficit widened in April as Americans stepped up purchases of foreign goods. Imports grew 0.8% while exports fell 0.3%, perhaps due in part to the strong dollar.

Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways are rivals with Etihad for the business of connecting passengers via their Mideast hubs between destinations around the world.The homeland security department called for the ban amid concerns terrorists were trying to smuggle explosives inside a laptop or tablet past security and set off the device in the cabin once the plane is aloft.\u00a0The department required passengers to either check their devices or leave them at home.Washington had considered widening the ban to U.S.-bound flights from Europe and other international departure points. European regulators, airlines and airports lobbied the U.S. government to hold off.Opponents of the widening were concerned it could dent demand for travel and that storing a large number of electronic devices in the cargo area of planes posed safety concerns. Lithium batteries used in many of the devices pose a fire risk.Last week, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u00a0said the ban could be widened to airports that fail to adopt more stringent security checks, including enhanced passenger screening. Airports already subject to the restrictions could see those lifted in return for closer checks.\u201cWe commend Etihad for working swiftly to implement these additional measures. Their efforts are a model for both foreign and domestic airlines looking to adopt the new measures,\u201d DHS said.Officials from the Transportation Security Administration verified the measures put in place in Abu Dhabi and will continue to perform checks.The Abu Dhabi hub is unusual because it has a so called preclearance facility that allows passengers to clear U.S. customs and immigration before they depart. On landing, passengers are treated like domestic arrivals. Etihad said the security measures associated with the preclearance facility allowed it to quickly satisfy U.S. demands and have the electronics ban lifted.The electronics ban was one of several headwinds Washington created for Middle East carriers. A ban the Trump administration put in place on immigration from seven Muslim majority countries also dented demand. The ban was later blocked by courts though a more limited version took effect last week.Etihad said the U.S. is one of its largest markets. It said it flew 203,515 passengers from Abu Dhabi to U.S. destinations in the first four months of the year.Mr. Kelly said the security requirements will affect 180 airlines operating from 280 airports in 105 countries. It would affect about 325,000 passengers a day on nearly 2,000 flights, DHS officials said.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 13:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-rescinds-portion-of-laptop-ban-on-aircraft-1499016485", "news_title": "U.S. Rescinds Portion of Laptop Ban on Aircraft ", "keywords": "airlines,airport security,counterterrorism,laptop security,Emirates Airline,Etihad Airways,Qatar Airways,U.S. Department of Homeland Security,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,transport,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,scheduled passenger airlines,air transport,industrial electronics,industrial goods,security systems,technology,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Fyre Festival, which was marketed as a high-end music festival in the Bahamas but resulted in a logistical fiasco that unfolded publicly on social media, is now at the center of a federal criminal investigation.William \u201cBilly\u201d McFarland, the 25-year-old entrepreneur who promoted the failed festival, was arrested Friday at his penthouse apartment in Manhattan and charged with defrauding investors to raise money for the concert.After spending the night at a detention facility in Brooklyn, Mr. McFarland was released from custody by a federal judge Saturday on $300,000 bond.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged him with one count of wire fraud, accusing him of falsely overstating his company\u2019s revenue to get at least two investors to invest $1.2 million in his music festival. The government said at Saturday\u2019s hearing that the investigation is still ongoing.If convicted, Mr. McFarland faces up to 20 years in prison.Mr. McFarland hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea. Sabrina Shroff, a federal defender representing Mr. McFarland, said that \u201cas this case goes forward, it\u2019ll be clear that Mr. McFarland is simply not the villain the government wants to make him out to be.\u201dThe criminal case against Mr. McFarland comes less than three months after the public collapse of Fyre Festival, which was advertised as a luxurious two-weekend music festival on an island in the Bahamas. Tickets cost up to $250,000 per person, and the concert, expected to feature artists like Blink-182 and Migos, was heavily promoted on social media by celebrities like Kendall Jenner.The festival was abruptly canceled, however, when concertgoers showed up to find unfinished amenities, limited staffing and subpar conditions. Viral photos on social media showed makeshift tents and slices of bread and cheese served in Styrofoam containers. Stranded concertgoers posted about their desperate attempts to return home.At the time, the organizers of Fyre Festival blamed \u201ccircumstances outside of our control,\u201d including bad weather.Mr. McFarland \u201cpromised a \u2018life changing\u2019 music festival but in actuality delivered a disaster,\u201d said Joon Kim, the acting Manhattan U.S. attorney, in a statement.Mr. McFarland was a founder of Fyre Media, a digital media company, and established a subsidiary in late 2016 called Fyre Festival LLC to promote the concert.When Mr. McFarland was soliciting money from investors for the festival, he allegedly made false representations showing Fyre Media was receiving up to $1 million a month in income from thousands of artist bookings. In reality, the government said, Fyre Media had made less than $60,000 in artist bookings.The government also alleges that to show at least one investor he could personally guarantee the investment, Mr. McFarland doctored a Scottrade statement to inflate the value of shares he owned in a particular company\u2019s stock. The fake statement showed Mr. McFarland owned more than $2.5 million in stock, while the real statement showed his stock was only worth $1,500, according to the complaint.Mr. McFarland\u2019s partner in Fyre Festival was rapper Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins. Several civil lawsuits were filed against them after the festival\u2019s failure.Stacey Richman, a lawyer for Mr. Atkins, said her client hasn\u2019t been arrested and isn\u2019t believed to be a target of the criminal investigation, adding that Mr. Atkins was \u201cstunned and disappointed\u201d by the allegations.\u201cHe truly believes and believed in Mr. McFarland,\u201d she said.Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Festival Promoter Charged With Fraud.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 13:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/promoter-behind-failed-fyre-festival-charged-with-defrauding-investors-1499014729", "news_title": "Fyre Festival Promoter Charged With Defrauding Investors", "keywords": "Fyre Festival,Joon Kim,Sabrina Shroff,William \u201cBilly\u201d McFarland,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,arts,entertainment,festivals,fraud"}, {"content": "Current aircraft technology to warn pilots they are flying toward potentially hazardous icing conditions is inadequate, a new study says, dealing a setback to years of efforts to find new ways to prevent ice crystals from clogging airliner engines and speed sensors.The joint U.S.-European report slated to be released in August will conclude that cockpit systems still are unable to pinpoint the most treacherous icing conditions in time, according to preliminary summaries and people familiar with specific findings.Despite years of extensive work by plane makers, equipment suppliers and government researchers, experts have determined that typical weather radar on board jetliners can only provide pilots a few seconds of warning regarding likely locations of risky high-altitude ice crystals. That\u2019s too brief to help crews avoid or otherwise react to such hazards.Representatives of radar manufacturers, regulators and pilot unions concluded that while it is theoretically possible for longer-range identification of ice crystals if they are large and uniform, that is an unlikely scenario during routine operations. Instead, flight tests revealed that today\u2019s airborne radar systems, by themselves, can\u2019t pinpoint the most hazardous smaller crystals more than a few miles in front of jetliners, according the people familiar with the details. The study group is advocating further flight tests, and industry experts continue to work on alternate solutions that incorporate other sensors.Summaries of some of the findings already have circulated among industry technical groups and air-safety authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. But earlier this year, members of the study group said they saw little industry interest in continuing to develop performance standards for radar detection of ice crystals.Ice accumulation can wreak havoc inside modern jet engines or on the tips of airspeed-measuring devices extending from the noses of jets, called pitot tubes. Such incidents are infrequent, but they have caused numerous emergencies in the past two decades and contributed significantly to at least two high-profile commercial airliner crashes.Speed sensors on an             Air France                   jet headed to Paris from Rio de Janeiro in 2009 iced up and malfunctioned while flying through an area known for strong, high-altitude storms, confusing the cockpit crew. Responding improperly to unreliable airspeed readings, the pilots allowed the plane to slow too much and mistakenly continued to pull up the nose at a sharp angle, resulting in a stall that killed all 228 people.When airspeed indicators malfunction, autopilots typically kick off and pilots are then forced, at least temporarily, to manually fly the plane. The Air France crash prompted an industrywide reassessment of pitot-tube designs and pilot training to cope with high-altitude aircraft upsets.Depending on the circumstances, ice buildup also can suddenly shut down engines or reduce their thrust without warning. Powerful thunderstorms can push smaller-than-normal ice particles into the red-hot bowels of engines, where they can accumulate until shedding ice damages rapidly spinning turbine blades or douses ignition sources.A different type of icing problem\u2014associated with gradual ice accumulation inside fuel systems stemming from flights through particularly cold regions\u2014has been shown to unexpectedly restrict engine power. That is what happened to a British Airways             Boeing Co.       777 powered by a pair of             Rolls-Royce Holdings                   PLC engines as it was descending toward London\u2019s Heathrow Airport in 2008. With the runway in sight, the crew couldn\u2019t rev up the engines as required and the plane pancaked into the ground about 1,000 feet short of the strip. The aircraft was destroyed and there were dozens of injuries, but no fatalities.The full range of icing-related problems during high-altitude flight\u2014including more than a dozen verified instances of dual-engine shutdowns on the same plane\u2014have prompted numerous safety directives over the years by the Federal Aviation Administration and its European counterpart.The mandates covered installation of improved speed-sensor hardware and updated engine-control software on a wide range of airliner models. Sometimes, regulators have ordered installation of one type of speed sensor but discovered months or years later that a different version was needed. On certain aircraft manufactured by             Airbus SE,       regulators determined that initial replacement parts failed to demonstrate the required \u201clevel of robustness to withstand high-altitude ice crystals.\u201dEngine makers, including             General Electric Co.      , similarly have tweaked software over the years to prevent internal ice accumulation from causing temporary engine outages, or \u201cflameouts,\u201d only to find out that additional changes were necessary.For roughly the first 40 years of the jet age, safety experts didn\u2019t realize how tiny ice crystals could negatively affect engine performance or plug internal fuel lines. And since relatively few of the early jetliners flew over regions known for super-strong thunderstorms, the chances of experiencing such incidents remained extremely low.But as engine reliability ramped up and aircraft began flying steadily longer routes over water or across polar regions, instances of engine problems stemming from ice crystals increased. For many years after that, however, airplane manufacturers and engine suppliers were hampered in devising solutions partly due to the technical challenges of recreating extreme in-flight conditions in laboratories.Stretching back to the mid-1990s, the FAA and various engine manufacturers investigated incidents of ice-crystal buildups affecting more than 100 big jets around the world. In 2013, the FAA ordered pilots of Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the largest 747 versions powered by GE engines to avoid certain types of high-altitude thunderstorms and airspace containing tiny ice crystals. The engine maker has said it ultimately\u00a0developed software revisions to alleviate recognized problems.For both engines and pitot tubes, icing is a fleeting phenomenon\u2014usually lasting less than a minute\u2014and pilots are trained to avoid drastic maneuvers while they wait for problems to resolve on their own. \u201cFor the ice to clear up, it can be just a few seconds,\u201d according to       Andrea Boiardi,        the top operational safety analyst for the European Aviation Safety Agency. \u201cBut sometimes, the overreaction of the pilots is the problem.\u201dNonetheless, the latest study\u2019s results are a blow to many safety experts who had been looking for new, more-reliable ways to anticipate icing dangers.Last month, the FAA proposed a safety directive to ensure that pilots of certain Airbus A300 and A310 aircraft receive warnings of malfunctioning heating elements intended to deice pitot tubes.Improvements in weather radars have resulted in better information about the size and intensity of storm cells, allowing pilots to more effectively avoid lightning and turbulence.       Carl Esposito,        a senior             Honeywell International Inc.       aerospace official, predicts gradual improvement in detection of ice crystals, as well.If radar data from many airliners is aggregated and fused, the result can provide a detailed picture of weather conditions, including likely icing, for aircraft flying later through the same region. \u201cIt might be too soon for your airplane\u201d to react to warning about impending ice crystals, but \u201cit could be plenty of time for the guy behind you,\u201d Mr. Esposito said during an interview at the Paris Air Show last month.At the same time, \u201cwe continue to look and evaluate other atmospheric sensors\u201d to detect ice crystals, Mr. Esposito said.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Jet Ice-Alert Systems Hit.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/efforts-to-tackle-icing-problems-on-planes-face-setback-1499014335", "news_title": "Efforts to Tackle Icing Problems on Planes Face Setback", "keywords": "faa,icing on planes,corporate,industrial news,airplane accidents,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Three years after he was elected to boost India\u2019s economy, Prime Minister       Narendra Modi       has delivered his most significant economic reform to date. A nationwide goods and services tax that kicked in July 1 is replacing more than a dozen state and central levies, and promises to knit 1.3 billion people in India\u2019s 29 states and seven federally administered union territories into a single market.With its finely tuned gift for hyperbole, the Modi government turned the occasion into a spectacle. On Friday, lawmakers and eminent citizens filed into a parliament building bedecked with lights for a special midnight ceremony to mark the onset of the new tax. In the past, governments have reserved such heightened symbolism for rare commemorations of India\u2019s independence from Britain. With millions of people watching on television, Mr. Modi hailed the new tax regime as \u201ca landmark achievement that is bound to take the nation toward exponential growth.\u201dProponents of the GST, a value-added tax similar to those in place in many countries, laud it as the most far-reaching tax reform in India\u2019s history. They say it will increase efficiency by reducing the number of taxes businesses must file, improve logistics by dismantling border checkposts, and boost government revenues by increasing incentives to pay taxes instead of dodging them.For instance, large firms seeking tax credits will likely favor suppliers who are compliant with the new tax system. If things go as planned, the new tax could end up giving India\u2019s economic growth a boost.Skeptics point out that the model India has ended up adopting\u2014after protracted haggling between New Delhi and the states\u2014is not merely less than perfect. It\u2019s not even a good second best.To begin with, in the clash between India\u2019s love of complexity and the traditional simplicity of a value-added tax, complexity has clearly prevailed. Depending on how you count, India\u2019s GST boasts between five and seven rates, from 0% to 28%. Aerated drinks, many tobacco products and other goods regarded as either harmful or luxuries will attract even higher levies.The complexity opens the door for both potential fudging by crooked businessmen and harassment by venal tax authorities. In places it shades into absurdity. Customers will pay different taxes for the same movie or the same flight depending on how much their ticket costs.In theory, the GST was meant to lower taxes, but in practice India\u2019s rates will be among the highest in the world. Contrast India\u2019s steep rates with those in traditionally well-run and prosperous economies. Australia levies a simple 10% VAT on most goods and services. Singapore\u2019s rate is 7%.In a scramble to come to an agreement between states and the center, the Modi government has left large chunks of the economy outside the new tax net. For now many petroleum products won\u2019t be included. Nor will the GST cover alcoholic beverages or electricity. Perhaps over time the list of exemptions will narrow, but for now they appear glaring.Then there\u2019s the fraught question of harassment by tax authorities. Before Mr. Modi came to power he promised an end to the previous government\u2019s \u201ctax terrorism\u201d against both individuals and businesses. Early on in his campaign, he likened his ideal of tax collection to how a bee collects honey from a flower: in a manner that\u2019s painless and mutually beneficial.In practice, the Modi administration has deepened some of the worst instincts of its predecessor. India\u2019s infamous 2012 retroactive tax law, which allows the government to tax transactions dating back to 1962, remains on the books. The prime minister has armed India\u2019s tax inspectors\u2014not exactly famous for their probity\u2014with draconian powers of search and seizure, and sharply curbed citizens\u2019 ability to appeal against arbitrary decisions. In private, some businessmen complain that the uncertainty this has generated helps explain why private domestic investment in India cratered over the past three years.The GST is supposed to ease harassment by relying on technology. But, true to the bureaucratic spirit of this government, it includes a harsh antiprofiteering clause that allows tax authorities to haul up businessmen they accuse of not passing on the benefits of lower tax rates to consumers.While this isn\u2019t unique to India, it underlines the central problem with the government\u2019s taxation philosophy. Instead of widening the tax base with carrots such as lower and simpler tax rates, it prefers to wield the old socialist stick of punishment.The framers of India\u2019s GST have also ensured that businesses will have to come to terms with a welter of complicated regulations. The jury remains out on how well small businesses, unable to hire batteries of chartered accountants and tax lawyers, will cope with the brave new world that awaits them.For now cautious optimism appears warranted. He may have made too many compromises, but Finance Minister       Arun Jaitley       still deserves credit for forging a difficult political consensus on a long-awaited reform. Many of the teething troubles that businesses fear\u2014such as unclear and excessively complex new rules\u2014will likely become less daunting over time.In Parliament Friday, Mr. Modi praised the GST as a \u201cgood and simple tax.\u201d This may be far from current reality, but it remains a laudable aspiration. His administration deserves credit for taking a big step on a long journey.Mr. Dhume is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a columnist for WSJ.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-reform-win-for-modi-1499014039", "news_title": "A Reform Win for Modi", "keywords": " arun jaitley, goods and services tax,india, narendra modi, tax reform,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,indirect taxation,economic news,sales tax,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       kept his public confrontation with the media front and center over the weekend, on Sunday tweeting a short doctored video of himself tackling and punching a person at the side of a wrestling ring who was meant to represent television network CNN.Mr. Trump also made more extensive remarks criticizing news outlets for their coverage of him at a\u00a0\u201cCelebrate Freedom\u201d concert Saturday night organized by the First Baptist Church of Dallas and held\u00a0at the Kennedy Center in Washington ahead of the\u00a0July 4\u00a0holiday.\u201cThe fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I\u2019m president and they\u2019re not,\u201d he said, in what has been a recurring theme in his speeches since he took office.\u201cThe fact is the press destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used the hatchet and the people saw it right from the beginning.\u201dIn recent days Mr. Trump has seized on CNN\u2019s retraction of a story, and the ensuing resignation of three journalists, to taunt the outlet as \u201cFraud News.\u201d CNN says the story was removed from the network\u2019s website because it hadn\u2019t been through the organization\u2019s vetting standards.A separate fight between Mr. Trump and MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough triggered rebukes from GOP lawmakers as well as Democrats after the president criticized Ms. Brzezinski\u2019s appearance.The president and his aides say that his outspoken social media approach was what people voted for on the campaign trail, and his use of             Twitter                   allows him to circumvent, or respond to, the reporters he believes aren\u2019t accurately conveying his message.\u201cMy use of social media is not Presidential\u2014it\u2019s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.

Instead a world-wide audience witnessed a robbery.In Brisbane, Australia, a crowd of 51,052 saw their countryman, Jeff Horn, upset WBO welterweight champion and future boxing Hall of Famer Manny Pacquiao in a unanimous decision. The result has been described as everything from \u201ccontroversial\u201d to \u201ca crime\u201d against the sport, in post-fight analysis.\u201cIt was a close fight,\u201d said Pacquiao\u2019s promoter, Top Rank\u2019s       Bob Arum.       \u201cI thought Manny won.\u201dBut the 38-year-old Pacquiao (59-7-2, 38 knockouts) hardly resembled the boxer who was named Fighter of the (previous) Decade by both the WBC and the Boxing Writers Association of America. Even given his waning power\u2014Pacquiao hasn\u2019t registered a knockout since 2009\u2014the \u201cThe Battle of Brisbane\u201d should have been decided in his favor.Not only did Pacquiao land 182 punches over the 12-round fight compared to Horn\u2019s 92, but 123 of those were considered power punches, according to CompuBox. Horn (17-0-1, 11 KOs) connected on just 73 power punches and only 15% of the punches he threw overall.After a brutal ninth round in which Horn\u2019s right eye was both bleeding and swelling profusely, referee Mark Nelson approached the Australian\u2019s corner to warn him that the fight was in danger of being stopped.To Horn\u2019s credit, the former Olympian responded in the 10th round and survived to win a lopsided decision in which one judge, Waleska Roldan, gave him a head-scratching 117-111 advantage. The other two judges, Chris Flores and Ramon Cerdan, gave Horn a 115-113 edge.On the television broadcast in the U.S., ESPN\u2019s boxing analyst and long-time former trainer Teddy Atlas scored the fight 116-111 in Pacquiao\u2019s favor.\u201cThat\u2019s the decision of the judges,\u201d Pacquiao said afterward.\u201d I respect that.\u201dLong-time trainer Freddie Roach also refrained from criticizing the judges too harshly.\u201cI have to go along with Manny and say I respect the decision of the judges,\u201d Roach said. \u201cWell, two of the judges [who had it 115-113]. I did think Manny won, but Jeff Horn showed a lot of heart. He is a big, strong fighter, and I congratulate him.\u201dPacquiao may have been done in by two separate cuts along his hairline that remained open for most of the later rounds. However, both wounds were clearly caused by accidental head butts from Horn in the sixth and seventh round, respectively.After the bout, Pacquiao received nine stitches to close a five-centimeter cut on the right side of his head and another eight stitches on a 3.5-centimeter cut along the left side.Pacquiao has the contractual right to a rematch and told reporters he planned on exercising that option.But in a welterweight division that is already loaded with younger talent such as unified champion Keith Thurman and IBF king Errol Spence Jr.\u2014not to mention the imminent return of Floyd Mayweather Jr., who defeated Pacquiao in 2015 and is scheduled to fight MMA star Conor McGregor in August\u2014the Philippine senator\u2019s status is greatly diminished.Pacquiao, who has remarkably won titles in eight divisions since turning pro in 1995, is likely too small at just 5-foot-5 to move up to super welterweight. And should he get back into the ring with the 29-year-old Horn, who has a bigger frame at 5-foot-9, Pacquiao would no longer be seen as a heavy favorite as he was in Brisbane over the weekend.There had previously been talk of Pacquiao facing off against unified junior welterweight champion Terence Crawford, another Top Rank fighter, but Saturday\u2019s performance likely stifled any demand for that fight.Despite the curious result this weekend, boxing\u2019s return to basic cable is only getting started. Both Crawford and junior lightweight titleholder Vasyl Lomachenko\u2014considered by many to be the world\u2019s best boxer, pound for pound\u2014are scheduled to defend their crowns on ESPN. Crawford hopes to unify the 140-pound division with a win over fellow junior welterweight champion Julius Indongo in Crawford\u2019s native Nebraska on Aug. 19, while Lomachenko aims to defend his WBO title against Miguel Marriaga in Los Angeles on Aug. 5.The sport\u2019s resurgent year will be capped off on Sept. 16 with the long-awaited matchup between unified middleweight champion Gennady \u201cGGG\u201d Golovkin and Mexican superstar Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez in Las Vegas.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/manny-pacquiao-lost-more-than-just-a-controversial-decision-1499013416", "news_title": "Manny Pacquiao Lost More Than Just a Controversial Decision", "keywords": "boxing,jeff horn,manny pacquiao,pacquiao,political,general news,combat sports,crime,legal action,robbery,sports,recreation,burglary,theft,routine general news"}, {"content": "The developers behind a large condominium complex have signed a lease with health-care provider Northwell Health, bringing additional medical-care services to the former St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital Manhattan site, the developers said.Northwell Health, which has a network of hospitals and outpatient centers, signed a lease to take 22,000 square feet of space at the Greenwich Lane, a 199-unit, West Village complex built by a joint venture of the Rudin family and Global Holdings Group.

State forces destroyed two of the vehicles but the third detonated in a residential neighborhood home to military checkpoints and government buildings.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the intended target was but the explosion went off near the Air Force intelligence branch, one of the regime\u2019s feared military branches because of its brutal crackdown on dissenters. The attack struck on the first day back to work after the religious holiday of Eid, which follows Ramadan.No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but car bombs are usually the work of Islamic State or other Islamist extremist groups operating in Syria.Attacks in Damascus aren\u2019t unusual. But the capital has been relatively quiet since May, when an internationally brokered de-escalation deal was reached between the Syrian regime and rebels.Islamic State claimed several attacks earlier this year in both Damascus and the central city of Homs. In March, nearly 40 people were killed when suicide bombers attacked a courthouse and restaurant in Damascus in an attack claimed by Islamic State.Much of the focus of Syria\u2019s war in recent months has turned to escalating battles against Islamic State in areas east of Damascus, although fighting is ongoing in the capital\u2019s suburbs and other parts of western Syria.On Saturday, regime forces launched artillery attacks on the town of Ein Tarma in the rebel-held eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus. Local residents alleged the shells contained chlorine gas, causing dozens of injuries but no deaths, according to opposition activists and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The Syrian regime has denied using chemical weapons. But the U.S. and other Western and Arab states have blamed it for such attacks, including the deadly 2013 sarin gas attack on Ghouta, which killed more than 1,400 people.The U.S. and Russia brokered a 2013 deal under which Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad,        facing the threat of a U.S. attack., joined an international treaty barring the use of chemical weapons. Syria agreed to destroy the most dangerous substances from its declared chemical-weapons program, including sulfur mustard and sarin. The treaty also barred the use of chlorine as a weapon. But it didn\u2019t require Syria to destroy its chlorine supply because it wasn\u2019t a declared weapon and because of its widespread household use.Though Ghouta is covered under the de-escalation deal reached in May, regime and allied forces have kept trying to advance into the besieged suburb.\u2014A correspondent in Damascus contributed to this article.Write to Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/damascus-car-bombs-kill-at-least-eight-1498983345", "news_title": "At Least 12 Killed in Syria by Damascus Car Bomb", "keywords": "car bomb,damascus attack,damascus car bomb,damascus car bombing,syria car bomb,syria car bombing,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Central bankers around the world are grappling with a common problem: when and how to normalize monetary policy at a time of normal levels of economic growth, normal levels of unemployment but abnormal levels of wage growth that is keeping inflation lower than their economic models predict.Policy makers at the European Central Bank and Bank of England are facing political challenges that are making their task even harder.At the ECB, the political constraint is its own self-imposed rules setting limits on the size and scale of its quantitative easing program.To avoid getting foul of the European Union treaty prohibition on direct financing of governments by the central bank, the ECB limits itself to buying government bonds strictly in proportion to each eurozone member\u2019s ECB shareholding and capping its ownership of any individual bond at 33%. As a result, its QE program will soon run into capacity constraints\u2014starting as soon as this summer with Germany, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. That leaves it little option but to taper its current \u20ac60 billion ($68 billion) monthly purchases next year, says Gilles Moec, senior European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.That\u2019s a problem, however, because the case for normalizing eurozone monetary policy is particularly weak, despite a recovery whose strength continues to take most economists by surprise. The economy has now expanded for 16 consecutive quarters, creating 6.4 million jobs. Consumer confidence is also at a 16-year high.The sharp reduction in Eurozone political risks following the defeat of populist parties in recent elections in Austria, the Netherlands and France could lead to further upward surprises in growth it leads to a pickup in business confidence and investment. Yet unemployment in parts of the eurozone remains high\u2014suggesting substantial spare capacity\u2014wage increases are low even in Germany and inflation itself fell to 1.3% in June from 1.4% in May, well below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2%.The ECB\u2019s challenge is therefore to construct a narrative that allows it to taper without provoking a taper tantrum that sends eurozone financing costs soaring and undermines the recovery.Last week, ECB President       Mario Draghi       attempted to meet the challenge by declaring that \u201cthe threat of deflation has gone and reflationary forces are at play. As these reflationary forces emerge, the ECB can adjust the parameters of QE to offset an automatic real-terms loosening of monetary policy.Balancing this subtle message was one that ECB would need to be \u201cpersistent\u201d and \u201cprudent\u201d in maintaining highly accommodative monetary policy to support the recovery. The jump in eurozone-government bond yields last week, led by a sharp rise in German bund yields, suggests Mr. Draghi\u2019s rhetorical balancing act wasn\u2019t entirely successful.The Bank of England\u2019s political difficulties are equally daunting.On the face of it, the case for a tightening of monetary policy in the U.K. looks strong. Inflation is well above target at 2.9% and forecast to remain so beyond the BOE\u2019s two-year forecasting horizon. Inflation expectations have risen 0.4 percentage points since July. Unemployment is just 4.7%, and the economy is growing in line with its potential, helped by a growing global economy.A recent hawkish speech by BOE chief economist       Andrew Haldane,        coming after three members of the BOE\u2019s rate-setting committee unexpectedly voted to raise bank rate in June, has fueled speculation the BOE could vote to raise rates later this year.Yet hanging over the U.K. economy is the uncertainty of Brexit. Much of the rise in inflation is the result of the one-off devaluation of sterling after the 2016 referendum. The economy has proved remarkably resilient since the Brexit vote, thanks in large part to a surge in consumer spending to a 10-year high and accompanying collapse in household saving to a 50-year low.Yet there are signs that falling real wages as result of higher inflation are starting to hurt consumer spending and confidence, which is reflected in falling retail sales, car registrations and house prices. At the same time, fears of a chaotic or badly managed Brexit that creates new barriers to EU trade may be deterring business spending. The U.K. economy grew by just 0.2% in the first quarter. Surveys suggest a subdued second quarter and start of the third.That all points to the heightened risk of a premature normalization of monetary policy in the eurozone and UK.Those risks could be heightened by action elsewhere. Should the Federal Reserve respond to a softening in recent data by delaying the three rate increases expected this year, a weaker dollar against the euro and sterling means an effective further tightening of euro-area and U.K. financing conditions. Both the euro and pound appreciated against the dollar last week.That in turn highlights what may be the biggest challenge facing the ECB and BOE as they contemplate their plans for policy normalization: the need to reassure markets by explaining how they would respond if indeed they do make a mistake.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-central-banks-face-added-political-constraints-1499011868", "news_title": "European Central Banks Face Added Political Constraints", "keywords": "brexit,european banks,europe markets,euro zone,monetary policy,monetary stimulus,European Central Bank,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       weighed in on a controversy over resistance from states to turn over voter records, tweeting Saturday: \u201cWhat are they trying to hide?\u201dThe new Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which the administration set up to investigate any election impropriety, had sought information from states that would identify and provide personal details about every registered voter, and the elections they had participated in from 2006.Many states have countered that the request seeks information they consider sensitive and beyond their power to turn over, and that they object to attempts to interfere in their operation of elections.Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican,\u00a0issued a statement Friday saying that he hadn\u2019t yet received the request but that\u00a0he understood from another secretary of state that it sought: \u201cif publicly available under the laws of the state, the full first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in your state), last four digits of social security number if available, voter history (elections voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive status, canceled status, information regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter registration in another state, information regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.\u201dIf he were to receive such a request, he said, he would reply: \u201cThey can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from. Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our State\u2019s right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral processes.\u201dTen states have refused to participate outright, including Mississippi, as well as California and New York. More have said they would only send partial information, and some are still deciding, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press.Kris Kobach, the panel\u2019s vice chairman and Kansas secretary of state, is a Republican supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and pursued a variety of antifraud measures in Kansas that were popular with some but were described as aggressive and discriminatory by critics.The election integrity panel was formed in May after months of unsubstantiated claims by Mr. Trump that voter fraud had tainted last November\u2019s election. It is overseen by Vice President       Mike Pence,        who announced three days ago the letter would be going out. The five other members of the panel include Democrats and Republicans, and its full remit includes looking at voter suppression and registration processes.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important than ensuring the integrity of the American vote,\u201d Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, said on Fox News Sunday in response to a question about states\u2019 resistance to turning over information to the voter fraud commission. \u201cThis information is publicly available, but wouldn\u2019t it be great if Secretaries of State were willing to comply and be a part of this to ensure the voter integrity of the United States? I don\u2019t think that is too much to ask.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, White House principal deputy press secretary, dismissed the state\u2019s objections Friday as \u201cmostly a political stunt.\u201d\u201cThis is a commission that\u2019s asking for publicly available data,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been part of the Commission\u2019s discussion, which has bipartisan support, and none of the members raised any concern whatsoever.\u201dThe issue has galvanized Democrats as well as voting-rights activists, who point to studies that found voter fraud to be extremely rare in the U.S.\u201cThe breadth of this request and complete lack of information about what the commission intends to do with the data is troubling,\u201d said Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet on the election panel was one of several he sent Saturday morning. In two others he resumed his criticism of media outlets, including CNN and NBC.He also wished Canada congratulations for its national holiday today, including to \u201cmy new found friend,\u201d      Justin Trudeau,        the prime minister.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-joins-fray-over-request-for-voter-records-1498927316", "news_title": "Trump Joins Fray Over Request for Voter Records", "keywords": "election panel,voter records,voting fraud,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "BEVERLY, Mass.\u2014There\u2019s a question hovering over the July 4 Horribles Parade this year and it\u2019s all about the limits of horribleness.The Beverly Farms event traces to the 1800s and fits into a long tradition of Independence Day parades in New England that, along with conventional patriotic fare, include \u201chorribles\u201d paraders who lampoon the world around them.Things got a little too horrible last year, though, for some townspeople\u2014too fraught, too tasteless, too insensitive on social issues. One float referred to Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandals. Another included a rendition of a Mexican border wall with people in sombreros.\u201cThe flavor of last year was so political,\u201d said Raeann Downey, chairwoman of the Beverly Farms-Prides Crossing 4th of July Committee. \u201cIt got down and dirty; it was all Trump, Hillary and the wall.\u201dSo this year, a subcommittee of five semiretired parade volunteers carrying clipboards will vet floats to make certain none oversteps the bounds of acceptable horribleness. Scofflaws will be barred from participating.Vulgar words are out, and \u201cwe don\u2019t want body parts,\u201d said Ms. Downey. The vetters, she said, will also steer floats \u201caway from the racial things, the gender things.\u201dHorribles parades likely trace in part to one held in 1851 in Lowell, Mass., as a parody of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, according to the New England Historical Society.Members of that citizen-soldier organization, who marched in whatever uniforms they had, probably \u201clooked a little ratty,\u201d said Charles Fazio, curator of the company\u2019s museum in Boston. Horribles parades, he said, were \u201ca political thing started by some wisecrackers.\u201dOver the years, the lampooning broadened to cultural and civic events. An 1877 horribles parade in St. Albans, Vt., depicted a local building committee in a trundle bed with a nursing bottle, according to the Vermont Historical Society.In recent decades, displays have sometimes tested the limits of horrible taste. Jackson Tingle, 34 years old and coordinator of the Highlands Horribles Parade in Danvers, Mass., cringed when he saw 1970s photos of marchers wearing 17th-century attire, carrying small gallows and holding signs reading \u201cjust hanging.\u201d\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fun,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said sardonically. \u201c\u00a0\u2018They\u2019re making fun of the Salem Witch Trials.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBeverly\u2019s and Salem\u2019s mayors in a joint statement denounced 2008 Horribles parade displays in those communities that satirized a rise in teen pregnancies in nearby Gloucester, Mass. Gloucester\u2019s own Fishtown Horribles Parade had a kerfuffle with a float on which \u201cthe mermaid was a little bit topless,\u201d said Al Kipp, 57, a parade organizer there. An organizer confronted the mermaid mid-parade and told her to keep herself covered.Last year, Mike DeGrange, 39, organizer of the 91-year-old Ancients & Horribles Parade in Glocester, R.I., was surprised by a truck flying a Confederate flag. \u201cWas it a proud moment? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Ancients & Horribles Parade is going to have some horrible things in it.\u201dEven by horribles standards, some of Beverly Farms\u2019s 2016 floats were too much for spectators like resident Jim Thompson, 55. \u201cI stood on the sidelines getting angrier and angrier,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a cup of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts ice tea. So I started throwing ice at them.\u201dAlong with the Trump, Clinton and border-wall floats was a trailer sporting real toilets and making light of the debate over transgender bathroom policies. A display bashed the Cincinnati zoo for the killing of Harambe the gorilla and included a sign some deemed racially insensitive.As criticism spread quickly on the internet, the parade decided \u201cthis year is going to be a little more controlled,\u201d said Ms. Downey, 68, the parade-committee chairwoman.The committee decided to more strictly enforce its \u201cHorribles Parade Guidelines for Entrants,\u201d which prohibits disparagement of religion, sexual orientation and ethnic groups as well as offensive sexual content. It added the wording: \u201cPOLITICAL COMMENTARY AND SATIRE MUST STAY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF ACCEPTABLE PUBLIC DISPLAY.\u201dThe new five-member vetting subcommittee will hop in a truck around 9 p.m. Monday night, July 3, hitting each location where float-building is under way. \u201cIf we can find them,\u201d Ms. Downey said. \u201cSometimes they hide their floats.\u201dThe vetters will keep guidelines on their clipboards and check that each float meets them, said committee spokesman David Bertoni, 65. The committee knows some conclusions will be judgment calls, he said, and has settled on a basic benchmark: \u201cWould the Stephen Colbert show be OK with this?\u201dFloats will undergo another screening before the 8 a.m. parade start. For anything still going too far, Ms. Downey said, vetters will be \u201cbringing black spray paint and duct tape.\u201dResident Sindi Piku, 20, working in a pizza shop, worried the tradition will lose its sass: \u201cPeople get offended so easily.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be politically correct,\u201d said Ms. Downey. \u201cWe want clever, not crude.\u201dJoe Nichols, 29, entering his third Beverly Farms float with friends, hopes the new vetting isn\u2019t too strict.He figures his edgiest appearance was in 2015 dressed as Caitlyn Jenner in fishnet top holding a sign: \u201cBruce Jenner believes in change.\u201dHis group starts bouncing around themes in May or June, looking online for topics that have drawn controversy. The night before the parade, they get a keg and make the float. He said they are keeping this year\u2019s idea secret for now.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about the tradition,\u201d he said, \u201cstaying up all night and making something that is actually horrible.\u201dWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'When Horribles Parades Are Too Horrible, Enter the Clipboards.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-4-horribles-parades-are-supposed-to-be-horriblequestion-is-how-horrible-1499011598", "news_title": "July 4 Horribles Parades Are Supposed to Be Horrible\u2014Question Is, How Horrible?

Female workforce participation began slipping in the U.S. while it kept marching higher in Canada. By 2016, 74.3% of U.S. women between the ages of 25 and 54 were working or looking for work, compared with 82.2% in Canada, according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development data. Both were near 76% two decades earlier. The participation gap between men and women also narrowed more in Canada than in the U.S.Understanding the divergence could help fix America\u2019s growth problem. President       Donald Trump      has pledged to boost annual increases in U.S. output from around 2% to above 3%. Achieving that ambitious goal would likely require, among other things, boosting labor-force participation.Many women choose to remain outside the labor force or spend time away from work, often to care for children. But women who want to work, but don\u2019t or can\u2019t, represent untapped economic potential. Enabling them to join the job market over time could generate stronger labor-force growth, offsetting drags from an aging population and other forces, and in turn boost the economy\u2019s growth trajectory.The continued rise in female workforce participation north of the border could be, in part, a reflection of economic conditions. Canada\u2019s economic growth has edged past that of the U.S. since 1997, averaging 2.5% a year versus 2.3%. Unlike the U.S., Canada avoided a recession in 2001 and also avoided a severe financial crisis last decade. A healthier U.S. labor market might have continued to draw in more women, too.But the phenomenon also likely reflects policy choices.Canada\u2019s federal government encouraged more two-working parent households in the late 1990s and early 2000s by cutting tax rates, adding support for child care and expanding paid parental leave. Quebec\u2019s provincial government introduced universal day care.The U.S. government spends relatively little to subsidize child care and has no national paid family-leave program, though employers are required to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\u201cCanada\u2019s rapid progress in female labor force participation was no accident; it reflects deliberate and targeted policy measures,\u201d International Monetary Fund Managing Director       Christine Lagarde       said last year.Extended leave didn\u2019t seem to have much immediate effect on how many Canadian mothers returned to work after giving birth. But there was evidence subsidized child care boosted the number of Quebecois mothers who worked.An IMF study found Canada\u2019s tax and benefit system changes\u2014including phasing out income surtaxes and introducing a new child tax benefit\u2014helped boost female participation.Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        in a May speech, highlighted research concluding that \u201cpolicy differences\u2014in particular the expansion of paid leave following childbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of child care and increased availability of part-time work\u2014go a long way toward explaining the divergence between advanced economies\u201d in women\u2019s workforce participation.If the U.S. \u201chad policies in place such as those employed in many European countries,\u201d she said, the participation rate for prime-age women could reach 82%\u2014roughly Canada\u2019s level.One study, released in 2013 by Cornell University economists       Francine Blau       and       Lawrence Kahn,        concluded that almost 30% of the decline in U.S. women\u2019s participation relative to other advanced economies between 1990 and 2010 could be traced to those countries pursuing the policies such as those Ms. Yellen mentioned. Some measures might be more effective than others, but \u201call the elements certainly play a role,\u201d Ms. Blau said.The U.S. isn\u2019t the only country where officials are looking to women as a source of stronger economic growth. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations pledged in 2014 to reduce gender participation gaps 25% by 2025. The International Labor Organization in June said achieving that goal would boost global output by 3.9%.Still, there are reasons to proceed carefully in crafting new policies that could ripple through the U.S. economy and society.The White House recently proposed a six-week paid parental leave program, citing the prospect of stronger economic growth as one motivation.But generous paid leave would likely encourage more women and men to remain home longer after birth, benefiting their children but reducing the supply of workers in the short run. It\u2019s also unclear whether paid leave is significantly more effective than unpaid leave in boosting long-term participation; both allow workers to keep their jobs and so ease the eventual return to work.Requiring employers to grant new mothers\u2019 requests for reduced hours or flexible schedules could lead some companies to avoid hiring women for full-time positions, despite laws barring such discrimination.More women might end up in part-time jobs, with limited chances for promotion and career advancement; Ms. Blau\u2019s study noted U.S. women are less likely to work part time and more likely to hold high-level jobs than women in other advanced economies.\u201cPolicies aren\u2019t that easy to devise,\u201d Harvard University economist       Claudia Goldin       said. \u201cSometimes you push one lever and that works, but it hurts something somewhere else.\u201dWrite to Ben Leubsdorf at ben.leubsdorf@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'When Women Boost the Workforce.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 12:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-can-the-u-s-get-more-women-into-the-workforce-ask-canada-1499000402", "news_title": "How Can the U.S. Get More Women Into the Workforce?

New York scored a 5 for regulatory constraint, with 10 being the most constrained. In comparison, West Los Angeles was given 10 points.High costs and low availability of land often are cited as factors limiting development, but the report identified land-use regulation as the primary barrier to new real-estate development. While real-estate companies frequently describe New York as a \u201chigh-barrier\u201d or \u201csupply-constrained\u201d market, those labels no longer fit, Green Street\u2019s report said.Shifts in New York\u2019s regulatory checks that started under a pro-growth agenda of Mayor       Michael Bloomberg\u2019s       administration in the early 2000s have led to a swell of new supply across the different property sectors, the report said.Manufacturing areas have been rezoned to allow for office and residential use. Subsidies have played a role in massive office projects such as Hudson Yards and the World Trade Center, the study said. The growth in the city\u2019s hotel, rental apartment and self-storage sectors highlights the changes in the city\u2019s regulatory restrictions.\u201cEven self-storage, which has long benefited from NIMBYism, is experiencing an explosion of new supply,\u201d the report said. \u201cSelf-storage inventory in Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens is expected to grow at an outsized annual rate of 5-7% through the end of the decade.\u201dHowever, growth in the hotel and self-storage sectors could change, with potential plans to limit these types of developments in the city\u2019s industrial business zones, the report said.Write to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 11:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-constraints-on-development-less-than-other-big-cities-1499009689", "news_title": "New York City\u2019s Constraints on Development Less Than Other Big Cities ", "keywords": " commercial real estate,new york city, nyc, nyc office space, office buildings, office space, real estate,Green Street Advisors,political,general news,real estate,property,financial investments,investment advice,real estate transactions,commercial,industrial real estate,construction,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The selloff in tech stocks is raising the appeal of the 2-week-old             Yahoo        AABA -0.21%       offspring that gives investors slices of two big companies at a 30% discount.The company, dubbed             Altaba,        AABA -0.21%holds the assets that Yahoo didn\u2019t sell to         Verizon Communications,       including a 15% stake in         Alibaba Group Holding,       a 35.5% stake in popular Japanese internet portal         Yahoo Japan               and some patents once held by Yahoo, as well as smaller investments in companies including Snap and         Hortonworks.       It also includes an estimated $8.7 billion of cash.The bet is that the discount will close as Altaba\u2019s management executes its promise to return cash to investors and simplify the fund\u2019s structure. To do that the company needs to figure out how to sell the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan while limiting the big tax bill it would incur. That bill is the primary reason for discount. Altaba shares traded 30% below their untaxed net asset value as of Friday\u2019s close\u2014a gap that has remained fairly consistent through its first two weeks of trading.Tax experts have weighed in on various methods, including arranging for Altaba to be acquired by Alibaba in a tax-free exchange using a \u201chook stock\u201d and executing a cash-rich split-off, among other strategies. Congress could also help by passing a corporate tax cut.Most of these would rely on the willing participation of Alibaba, Yahoo Japan or SoftBank, the latter owning large stakes in both companies. That isn\u2019t a given. But unlike the old Yahoo management, whose strategic missteps were widely criticized by investors, the interest of Altaba\u2019s management is perfectly aligned with shareholders.The downside is relatively limited. The first assumption is Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which is 72% controlled by Altaba and SoftBank, hold up reasonably well. They did last week and Altaba itself fell less than the market.The second is that Altaba can avoid paying the full tax bill. If Altaba does pay a full rate\u201436.5% for Alibaba and 38% for Yahoo Japan, according to UBS\u2014and investors apply an additional 10% discount to account for expenses such as management fees and transaction costs, as is common with closed-end funds, its assets were worth $49.16 a share as of the market close Friday. That is 9.8% below where its shares were trading, implying investors are already giving Altaba some credit for tax efficiency or are applying an additional discount of less than 10%.Many hedge funds have decided Altaba\u2019s management will figure out something. They are further protecting themselves by shorting shares of Alibaba.Meanwhile, Altaba\u2019s management has a simpler lever than tax savings for narrowing the fund\u2019s discount to net asset value: stock buybacks. At the current discount to net asset value, Altaba can effectively use buybacks to get $1 worth of assets for only 70 cents. Altaba bought back 64.5 million shares for $3.4 billion through a modified Dutch auction that ended June 16, helping to absorb the negative effect of the company\u2019s shares being dropped from indexes after the sale of Yahoo\u2019s core business.More stock buybacks should be on the horizon. That alone could be reason to own Altaba.Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 11:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finally-something-good-from-yahoo-1499007601", "news_title": "Finally, Something Good From Yahoo ", "keywords": "altaba stock,Altaba,AABA,Alibaba Group,BABA,Yahoo,YHOO,Hortonworks,HDP,Yahoo Japan,4689.TO,JP:4689,patents,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,commodity,financial market news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,data mining,analysis software,e-commerce,financial services,internet,online,investing,securities,technology"}, {"content": "Federal Reserve officials have attributed soft inflation readings in recent months in part to what Chairman       Janet Yellen       described as \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d factors, such as declines in prices of cellphone plans and a deceleration in prescription drug costs.

Iran\u2019s oil ministry said the contract would be signed Monday afternoon.The Paris-based oil giant has led the charge to return to the oil-rich country since Western sanctions over its nuclear program were lifted. Monday\u2019s deal will be the culmination of months of negotiations after Total signed a preliminary $4.8 billion agreement to develop the giant gas deposit alongside its partners late last year.Total Chief Executive       Patrick Pouyann\u00e9       has indicated the first $1 billion to be pledged on Monday would go toward funding the project\u2019s first phase.Total said the gas from the Pars field will supply the domestic market from 2021. The company had been in talks with Iran to create the country\u2019s first liquefied natural gas export system but they couldn\u2019t agree on a gas price, people familiar with the matter said.International oil companies have been slow to re-enter Iran following a landmark deal with world powers in 2015 that lifted many Western sanctions on Tehran. The energy business remains politically fraught in a country that needs international investment to develop its resources but also sees oil and gas as a vital national asset that shouldn\u2019t be turned over to foreigners.With U.S. sanctions over terrorism, weapons and human rights still remaining, many banks have refused to deal with Iran, and Tehran\u2019s hard-liners have pushed back against attempts by President       Hassan Rouhani\u2019s       administration to sweeten the terms for international oil companies in Iran. Discussions between oil companies and Tehran have also been complicated by the election of U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who has been critical of the nuclear agreement.Total\u2019s Anglo-Dutch rival Royal Dutch Shell PLC has also signaled interest in returning to Iran. In December it signed a preliminary deal to explore future projects in the country, but has yet to make a more concrete commitment.A Total spokesman said its planned investment would remain in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and regulations.Investors have been closely watching to see the terms western companies will get to return to the country.Total\u2019s deal will be the first Iranian Petroleum Contract signed in Iran, and the company said the 20-year contract came \u201cwith very attractive commercial terms,\u201d without disclosing more details.The terms of the deal appear more flexible than previous arrangements Iran signed before sanctions. The 20-year time frame, for instance, is longer than the five-year deals Iran previously allowed.Foreign companies have frequently complained they were unable to recoup their investments in previous contracts signed in the 1990s because Iran had set a fixed amount for project costs.Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Total to Seal $1 Billion Iranian Gas Deal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 09:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/frances-total-set-to-invest-1-billion-in-giant-iranian-gas-field-1499000613", "news_title": "France\u2019s Total Set to Invest $1 Billion in Giant Iranian Gas Field", "keywords": "gas,iran,oil,total,Total,TOT,FP.FR,Iran's oil ministry,China National Petroleum,Petropars,Royal Dutch Shell A,UK:RDSA,Patrick Pouyanne,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,natural gas,oil extraction,integrated oil"}, {"content": "With an estimated 26,000 restaurants in the city, New Yorkers have no shortage of choices when it comes to dining out.Now a growing number of local businesses are focusing on the dine-in crowd\u2014with a twist.Taking a cue from such national outfits as             Blue Apron,       Plated and HelloFresh, some are offering meal kits that simplify the cooking process. Others are delivering fully prepared dishes, but ones that they say are a cut above standard takeout fare.Perhaps the biggest local outfit vying in the space is online grocer FreshDirect, based in Long Island City. Though it is known primarily for its supermarket-style array of products, it began rolling out its own line of kits, priced starting at $19 (for two servings), late last year. Meal options range from lemon Parmesan chicken pasta to braised pork meatballs with saut\u00e9ed leeks and apples.FreshDirect said response to the kits has been strong, with sales growing by double-digit percentages month over month. It said its success is partly due to its sourcing of ingredients for the kits from area suppliers.\u201cWe have a lot of relationships with local farmers and fishermen,\u201d said       Scott Crawford,        a FreshDirect vice president.An even newer entrant in the field is RealEats, a Geneva, N.Y., company that began rolling out its program this month to customers throughout the Northeast.The company offers vacuum-sealed dishes that have been prepared by well-known chefs, including New Yorkers       Dale Talde       and Bill Telepan. The \u201ccooking\u201d required is reheating the pouches in a pot of boiling water. A three-meal-a-week plan for one person runs $45.RealEats said on its website that its meals are made \u201cusing local, never-processed, non-GMO ingredients, free from added hormones, antibiotics, preservatives or junk of any kind.\u201dAnother variation is companies delivering fully prepared meals for home consumption but geared to diners with special dietary needs. A case in point: Epicured, a New York City outfit that made its debut last year and creates dishes for those with digestive disorders, including gluten-free meals. Prices run from $12 to $23 for entrees.Some of these companies say they are ready to take their concepts national if sales boom. It is a playbook that others have followed. Plated, based in New York City, started its meal-kit delivery program in the Northeast five years ago but has now expanded its shipping to 48 states.Either way, the city is a good testing ground for food companies, said       Erik Thoresen,        a principal with Technomic, a market-research firm that has studied the meal-kit and meal-delivery industry. New York is such a competitive dining environment that any business that succeeds here is positioned solidly for expansion, he said.Mr. Thoresen isn\u2019t surprised so many companies are entering the dine-in space, locally and nationally, given the growth curve. Annual sales of meal kits nationwide surged by 260% in 2016 to $1.8 billion, according to Technomic. It projects the market will skyrocket to $12.8 billion in 2021.Interest in the market has also spread to Wall Street. Blue Apron Holdings Inc., the parent company of Blue Apron, went public on Thursday.Not every local business that has attempted to cash in on the craze has succeeded.       Eli Zabar,        a New York foodie fixture who runs restaurants and markets throughout Manhattan\u2019s East Side, tested a meal-kit service last year\u00a0in a small slice of the city but ultimately nixed the program. Mr. Zabar cited the high delivery costs and the difficulty maintaining quality control if the shipping area was expanded as some of the reasons for discontinuing.It was \u201cnot a road I wanted to go down,\u201d he said.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-02 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bon-appetit-local-meal-delivery-services-make-dining-in-simple-1499000401", "news_title": "Bon Appetit: Local Meal-Delivery Services Make Dining In Simple ", "keywords": "dine in,food services,meal delivery,meal kits,Blue Apron Holdings,HelloFresh,Plated,FreshDirect,RealEats,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,e-commerce,internet,online,leisure,arts,hospitality,technology"}, {"content": "The world\u2019s housing crisis has many causes, but there is a stubbornly persistent one that we should have been able to solve by now: Productivity.As prices of components and materials for pretty much every other physical object\u2014cars, cellphones, clothing, etc.\u2014have dropped precipitously, it still costs too much to build a building. Over the past 60 years, productivity in manufacturing has increased eightfold while remaining basically flat in construction, says Jan Mischke, a senior fellow at McKinsey Global Institute who specializes in infrastructure and housing.Gadgets like iPhones, every one the same, benefit from economies of scale, but that\u2019s harder to achieve with buildings, which must fit the sites they are constructed on.As usual, technologists think they have a solution. They are reviving surprisingly old ideas in construction, including prefabrication and modular building. But don\u2019t think \u201ctrailer park.\u201d This time, they\u2019re applying all the logistics and IT knowledge gained from building the global supply chains that deliver mobile devices, and all the automation pioneered by the automobile and other manufacturing industries. Yes, robots may be replacing more workers, but at least this should create more affordable housing.Katerra, a construction startup, has raised $221 million at a valuation north of $1 billion, and it projects up to $500 million in revenue this year. It is, in some ways, the standard-bearer of this new, tech-focused wave of interest in building.The company currently has a single, 200,000-square-foot factory in Phoenix where it manufactures whole walls, including all the windows, insulation, electrical wiring and plumbing. Katerra uses an integrated, computer-aided design-and-manufacturing system that tells all the factory\u2019s automated saws and routers how to produce all the buildings\u2019 components. The same system connects to job-site cranes that lift and place the finished panels.Katerra ships the walls to construction sites, where they\u2019re snapped together like Lego bricks. The company\u2019s goal is to build seven more factories within two years, each intended to serve a different geographic area. \u201cThat will cover the whole U.S.,\u201d says Katerra\u2019s chairman and founder,       Michael Marks,        who was previously chief executive of consumer electronics manufacturing giant Flextronics.Construction is an industry worth more than $1 trillion a year, and Katerra has plenty of competition. A nearly identical process has been adopted by Baltimore startup Blueprint Robotics, Mr. Marks says. Both companies buy their robots and systems from manufacturers of construction robots based in Austria, Germany and Japan, where this kind of prefabricated construction is widespread, he says. Blueprint declined to comment for this piece.Katerra is responsible for its buildings from design to final construction, which it says allows it to further cut costs. In consumer electronics, \u201cdesign for manufacturability\u201d\u2014the reconfiguring of a device\u2019s shape and function to make it cheaper to build\u2014is standard. Another thing Katerra borrows from that industry: buying goods in bulk, direct from suppliers.Some startups are also constructing whole rooms, which can then be stacked atop one another. Google recently announced it placed an order with Factory OS, the startup\u2019s first order, for 300 units of housing for employees. Factory OS Chief Executive Rick Holliday says a previous project built with modular construction saved $105,000 per unit in construction costs, which translated to $700 a month less in rent per unit. Google has said modular construction is also more environmentally friendly, leading to less waste.The tallest modular high-rise ever built was completed in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn in November 2016 by Forest City Ratner Cos. A conventional builder that has explored prefab methods, the company created a factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. At the project\u2019s busiest, upward of 200 people were constructing and finishing individual \u201cmods\u201d\u2014three for every one-bedroom apartment, says Bob Sanna, executive vice president of construction at Forest City.Though successful, the project illustrates some growing pains of the new methods. Forest City had joined with construction giant             Skanska                   on the modular factory, but that relationship ended, after delays in completing the high-rise, in a dispute.It shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that traditional companies are testing prefabricated and modular construction, especially with complicated parts of buildings like bathrooms and staircases. The cost savings from this type of construction are manifold, including less site supervision, easier inspections and lower labor costs, since it\u2019s easier to build things in a factory than on a job site, says Mr. Sanna. To save on labor costs, some companies have even gone so far as to outsource construction of modules to other countries, like Poland.History is littered with architects\u2019 experimental modular building projects, from Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Usonian homes to the Palacio Del Rio hotel in San Antonio, erected in record time to be ready for the 1968 World\u2019s Fair. So why isn\u2019t it mainstream by now?The consensus of those I spoke with, both providers and customers, is that the biggest barrier to modular construction is mindset. Construction is a conservative industry where old habits die hard. In Europe and Asia, modular construction is far more popular than in the U.S., where it represents less than 3% of new building, says Tom Hardiman, executive director of the Modular Building Institute.Modular construction is also far more sensitive to demand. For a building factory to be profitable, says McKinsey\u2019s Mr. Mischke, there must be a need for 3,000 to 5,000 new units of prefabricated housing a year within two hours\u2019 shipping distance from the factory. In the U.S., aging millennials mean there is plenty of demand for housing. But much of it is in cities, where factors such as scarcity of land trump all else and have limited the market for modular construction. Homes, after all, aren\u2019t like cellphones. We can\u2019t just stick the old ones in a drawer when the latest model comes out.Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Maybe Houses Can Be Built Like iPhones.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-youd-want-to-build-a-skyscraper-like-an-iphone-1499000401", "news_title": "Why You\u2019d Want to Build a Skyscraper Like an iPhone ", "keywords": "blueprint robotics,building industry,construction industry,factory os,flextronics,katerra,modular building,modular construction,modular design,prefabrication,startups,technology,Katerra,Blueprint Robotics,Factory OS,Forest City Ratner,Bob Sanna,Jan Mischke,Rick Holliday,Michael Marks,corporate,industrial news,disruptive innovation,political,general news,natural environment,living,lifestyle,personal technology,sustainable development,computers,consumer electronics,building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "U.S. government-bond yields startled many investors in the year\u2019s first half by falling, yanking the rug out from under expectations that a recovery in inflation would drain cash from the credit market.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled Friday at 2.298%, down from 2.446% at the end of last year and well below its recent peak of 2.609% set in March. Yields fall when bond prices rise.Weaker measures on inflation are a big reason for the yields\u2019 decline. Inflation is perhaps the biggest threat to long-term government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed returns. Softening inflation then bolsters demand for Treasury debt, driving down yields.After reaching 2.1% in February, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of overall inflation rose just 1.4% in May from the prior year. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has slipped to 1.4% from 1.8% in February.This came as a surprise to many investors who anticipated inflation would surge as lawmakers cut taxes and unleashed a flood of fiscal spending under a new presidential administration. Now those expectations are diminishing, especially as a retreat in oil prices threatens to weigh down costs for a broad range of products.Many observers now question whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target is really within reach.\u201cThe Fed has been trying to get inflation to 2% for a long time now,\u201d said       Donald Ellenberger,        senior portfolio manager at             Federated Investors.       As the Fed starts to tighten monetary policy, \u201cthe market is saying you\u2019re really never going to get to 2%,\u201d Mr. Ellenberger said.Inflation has become such a focus for credit-market investors that it has overwhelmed concerns about what the Federal Reserve is doing. Yields have declined even as the Fed has raised interest rates twice this year and signaled the possibility of another increase in the second half of the year.Some bond investors say that it almost doesn\u2019t matter what the central bank does unless inflation picks up. The Fed could respond to lackluster inflation by keeping rates steady, which typically supports Treasury prices. Or it could keep raising rates, but that might only further depress inflation expectations, providing still more reason to buy bonds.\u201cIt could be a combination of both of those scenarios,\u201d said       Sean Simko,        head of fixed-income portfolio management at             SEI Investments.       \u201cThe end result is still that rates are not going to go as high as everyone had expected.\u201dOptimism that the       Trump       administration would usher in a new era of economic growth driven by fiscal rather than monetary policy has dissipated. That was punctuated by the 10-year yield\u2019s largest one-day decline in nearly a year on May 17, after reports\u2014disputed by the White House\u2014that President Donald       Trump       may have interfered with an FBI investigation.Also undermining that optimism is the lack of success GOP lawmakers have had in fulfilling their promise to overhaul the health-care system, even as opposition mounts to some of their tentative tax proposals.Several investors said Congress now has a long way to go to win back their confidence that it can pass fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts or infrastructure spending. \u201cIt would take a tax bill to be delivered and voted on for the market to take that seriously again,\u201d said       Brian Battle,        director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners LLC.Some investors say yields can\u2019t fall much further from here. Recent hints that some major central banks could be moving closer to unwinding their monetary stimulus has already unsettled traders, lifting yields from their 2017 lows.In addition, higher interest rates set by the Fed have generally provided a floor for Treasury yields. Few analysts see risks of a recession soon, and geopolitical risks have abated in the aftermath of France\u2019s presidential election, diminishing the chances of a pronounced flight to haven assets.At current levels, there is more room for yields to rise than to fall, said       Jim Caron,        fixed-income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.The 10-year yield is unlikely to drop below 2%, but could rise as high as 2.75% if Congress manages to pass fiscal stimulus, he said.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Low Inflation Hurts Bond Yields.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 08:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weak-inflation-continues-to-hold-down-bond-yields-1498906802", "news_title": "Weak Inflation Continues to Hold Down Bond Yields", "keywords": "2q market report, bond markets, bond yields, credit markets, market report, quarterly report, second quarter, trade, trump, yield curve,Donald Trump,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Bitcoin was designed to be cheap, reliable and fast. Lately, though, many users are complaining that the digital currency is anything but.The cost for investors and consumers to buy or sell bitcoin hit an average of $5 per transaction in early June, the highest rate of its eight-year history as an alternative means of payment. The fee has since come down to about $3.50. Two years ago, it was less than a nickel.The figures, from data provider BitInfoCharts, show that the growing use of bitcoin, whose total value now exceeds $40 billion, is stretching the limits of its current market structure. In turn, dealing in bitcoin is becoming more costly and inconvenient, turning off some customers.High fees make it impractical to use bitcoin as a day-to-day currency. Paying a $5 fee to send $10,000 bitcoin isn\u2019t a big deal, but it\u2019s hard to justify buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin if the transaction costs more than the coffee.An array of bitcoin applications such as cross-border money transfers and small-ticket consumer payments need an affordable bitcoin network to thrive. With higher fees, \u201cI think a lot of use cases start to die,\u201d said       Jonathan Levin,        chief executive of research firm Chainalysis.In recent years, consumers have been showered with rewards for swiping their credit cards\u2014from cash back to airline miles and points for free hotel stays. The merchant pays the fee, the consumer gets the spoils.In bitcoin\u2019s case, the fees are being borne by users.When       Cameron Oatley,        a 19-year-old student in Romsey, southeast England, recently sent a friend $30 worth of bitcoin on a U.S. platform, he was hit with a $6 transaction fee.\u201cThe whole reason behind bitcoin isn\u2019t really there anymore,\u201d Mr. Oatley says. \u201cAny currency where you have to pay a huge portion of the transaction just for the privilege of using that currency is no currency.\u201dBitcoin transactions are processed by a group called \u201cminers,\u201d who maintain the network and get paid for their work in newly created bitcoin and through transaction fees. Until a few years ago, the fees were an afterthought. But rising activity has changed the math.The increased popularity of the currency has pushed the number of transactions to about 260,000 a day from 100,000 a few years ago. The network however, still can only process about seven transactions a second, which has resulted in bottlenecks.To expedite orders, end users have the option of offering a higher fee as an incentive to miners to process their transactions. The fee you pay can determine how fast you get bitcoin.Eric Piscini,        a principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP who specializes in virtual currencies, recently tried to move a small amount of bitcoin without paying a fee. It took two days.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue,\u201d says Mr. Piscini. \u201cIf you want to pay a merchant, either the merchant is taking the risk that the transaction won\u2019t be validated, or he has to wait two days before he gives you the service or product.\u201dBitcoin fees also fluctuate with demand; when trading is busier, the fee goes up. Some services like San Francisco-based Coinbase charge customers an average network fee; others allow users to manually set the fee themselves.Rising fees have led the bitcoin community to renew efforts to solve problems with the currency\u2019s market structure\u2014the so-called \u201cscaling\u201d stalemate that essentially boils down to how many bitcoins can trade at one time.The question of how to best increase network capacity has long divided the industry. Entrepreneurs, who have built businesses around bitcoin, see the currency as something to be used and exchanged frequently. Miners and developers, meanwhile, tend to see it as an asset to hold, like gold. They fear that increasing limits would make it more expensive to be a miner, driving out smaller miners and leading to a more centralized system.The fight has dragged on for two years. New solutions to the standoff were recently proposed and may be adopted this summer, likely lowering fees. Several other potential breakthroughs, however, have fallen apart in the past.Until the bickering ends, the only way for users to ensure their transactions get processed quickly is to offer miners higher fees. \u201cYou hope for the best,\u201d says Cornell University computer-science professor       Emin Gun Sirer.Even though coming changes could alleviate high fees, Mr. Oatley says he\u2019s done with the digital currency. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put another cent into bitcoin,\u201d he said after selling his remaining stake in early June. \u201cThere are too many issues.\u201dWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Bitcoin\u2019s New Problem: High Fees.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-wont-be-buying-a-coffee-with-bitcoin-anytime-soon-1498996800", "news_title": "Why You Won\u2019t Be Buying a Coffee With Bitcoin Anytime Soon ", "keywords": "bitcoin,bitcoin fees,bitcoin mining,bitcoin scaling stalemate,bitcoin transaction fees,digital currency,virtual currency,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,currency options,banking,credit,financial services,virtual currencies"}, {"content": "Oil prices tumbled in the second quarter, swinging into a bear market as many investors who at the start of the year clung to hopes of rapidly shrinking stockpiles finally cut their losses.Crude ended the quarter 9% lower, and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market.It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output, but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices.For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter.At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well.Bullish investors \u201care burned, they are tired and they are surly.

Bullish bets still outnumber bearish ones, but by the slimmest margin since August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Prices ended the quarter on a high note, rising 2.47% Friday, after oil-field services firm         Baker Hughes Inc.       reported that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. edged lower by two, the first weekly decline since January, raising hopes that U.S. drillers are responding to lower prices by pulling back. During the last week of the quarter, prices of U.S. crude futures rose 7%\u2014the largest weekly increase since Dec. 2, the week OPEC struck its deal to cut output. The seven-session streak of gains assuaged worries that prices were on course to fall below $40 a barrel.But the world is still awash in oil.\u201cAll the bearish things are kind of still in play\u201d said       David Leben,        director of commodity derivatives at             BNP Paribas.Even though many analysts still say that crude inventories are falling and that OPEC\u2019s efforts will work, many investors are no longer buying it. Increasingly, the market is divided between those who believe that OPEC\u2019s efforts are paying off and those who don\u2019t.\u201cIt\u2019s alarming to people because this cycle has played out very fast,\u201d said Robin Wehb\u00e9, managing director of the Boston Company, who runs the Dreyfus Natural Resources Fund. \u201cThe oil market has gone from a cartel-managed business to an open-market-driven business.\u201dSaudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts.Citigroup                   is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm\u2019s analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake.Citi analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday.\u201cThe fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,\u201d the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.Goldman Sachs                   on Wednesday also cut its three-month forecast for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for crude, to $47.50 a barrel from $55.Investors are increasingly turning their attention to 2018, where the outlook is murky.Many wonder whether OPEC producers will unleash a flood of oil once their agreement ends. The Goldman Sachs analysts said there is a \u201cshrinking window of time\u201d for global oil supplies to fall before OPEC is tempted to start churning out more oil.

That is the dollar\u2019s largest two-quarter percentage decline since 2011.The dollar has come under fresh pressure after central-bank officials in Europe and Canada last week offered some of their strongest signals yet that they could soon begin winding down monetary policy measures designed to spur economic growth.Investors, viewing these statements as a sign of strength and a possible portent of higher interest rates in those countries, rushed to buy the currencies. The euro soared to its highest level against the dollar in more than a year, while sterling and the Canadian dollar both rallied more than 2%.The developments marked the latest bad news for the dollar, now the worst-performing of the major currencies this year.Few had expected such a turnabout even six months ago.

That is down from 62% in March.Meanwhile, investors are growing more bullish about economic recoveries in Europe and parts of the developing world, even as they fear a U.S. slowdown.After years in which the U.S. economy outpaced growth in the eurozone, the 19-country currency bloc pulled ahead last year, and recent forecasts have its growth essentially even with that of the U.S. this year and next.Emerging-market economies are expected to expand at the even faster rate of 4.7% this year, more than double the pace of U.S. and Europe, according to             J.P. Morgan.\u201cThe rest of the world\u2019s tone is improving while the U.S. is decelerating, and the dollar is reflecting that,\u201d said       Mark McCormick,        North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Securities.Some investors believe the dollar\u2019s performance this year could spell the end for the bull market in the greenback. Periods of dollar strength have typically lasted for around seven years.\u201cWe\u2019re at this pivotal moment now where we\u2019re in the midst of a major turn lower in the dollar,\u201d said       Bilal Hafeez,        head of foreign-exchange strategy for Nomura Securities in London.Alessio de Longis, a portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds, entered the year betting on a broadly stronger dollar but now expects the dollar to trade sideways this year.\u201cThe growth momentum in the U.S. is fading,\u201d Mr. de Longis said. \u201cWithout a reinvigoration of tax reform, which doesn\u2019t seem likely this year, the dollar bull market is probably over.\u201dHedge funds and other speculative investors built up more than $28 billion in bullish bets on the dollar at the end of last year, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. As of June 27, bullish bets on the dollar had shrunk to a net $2.7 billion.Not everyone has lost confidence in a strong dollar:       James Athey,        a senior investment manager at             Aberdeen Asset Management,       still expects the dollar to rise against developed-market currencies such as the yen in the months ahead.\u201cThe dollar has suffered greatly,\u201d said Mr. Athey, who thinks dollar investors are too pessimistic about the Fed\u2019s interest-rate path.\u201cWe think the U.S. economy is still the most robust,\u201d he added.A weaker U.S. currency could help support the recent recovery in corporate profits, which grew at the fastest pace in nearly six years in the first quarter of the year. A falling dollar makes U.S. multinationals\u2019 exports more competitive abroad.A weaker dollar also would relieve pressure on emerging-market nations by making their dollar-denominated debts easier to service and relieving downward pressure on their currencies. Since many developing countries are also commodities producers, a weaker dollar helps these economies because it makes their materials cheaper for nondollar buyers.Even in Europe, where exports to the U.S. have become more expensive as a result of the euro\u2019s 8.6% rise against the dollar this year, signs of growth slowly picking up could mean European companies are better able to withstand a weakening dollar than in previous years. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index has rallied 5% this year.Write to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Dollar Is Biggest Loser This Year.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-gets-squeezed-from-all-sides-1498993201", "news_title": "Dollar Gets Squeezed From All Sides", "keywords": "2q market report,2q markets report,currencies,dollar,euro,foreign exchange,markets, trump trade, yen,Alessio de Longis,Bilal Hafeez,James Athey,Mark McCormick,Donald Trump,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "The Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s Ebola epidemic is over, the country\u2019s health ministry declared, putting an end to the most recent outbreak of the highly contagious disease that caused four deaths.The announcement came after health officials contained a chain of cases in the remote Bas-U\u00e9l\u00e9 province, a forested region in the north east of the country, allowing authorities to register zero cases for 42 days or two incubation periods of the virus, said Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the health minister.The end of the outbreak, declared midnight Saturday, is a huge relief for Sub Saharan Africa\u2019s largest nation, which has been battling a record eighth outbreak near a region where the hemorrhagic\u00a0fever was first discovered in 1976. The outbreak in the remote Likati zone, some 800 miles from Kinshasa, coupled with Congo\u2019s experience in fighting past outbreaks helped officials to quickly snuff out the virus, health officials said.Moumouni Kinda,        program manager for the Alliance for International Medical Action, one of the institutions helping to combat the outbreak, hailed Congolese authorities and their partners for containing the epidemic rapidly by adopting response strategies different from those practiced in West Africa, where the virus killed more than 11,300 people between 2014 and 2016, marking the world\u2019s deadliest episode.\u201cWe preferred to set up small units for the isolation of suspect cases,\u201d Mr. Kinda said. \u201cPatients were mainly isolated in small emergency units and occasionally in their homes to avoid contamination of care teams in charge of transportation. We have made every effort to rapidly deploy secure medical care.\u201dThe virus affected nine people, four of whom died, in an equatorial forest area near Congo\u2019s border with the Central African Republic, according to the public health ministry. There were nearly 100 other suspected cases of the virus but none tested positive, according to health officials. The first victim died on April 24 but the outbreak was only confirmed as Ebola on May 12.Merck                   & Co. announced in May that it was ready to release its new experimental Ebola vaccine to help combat the outbreak in Congo. But because the vaccine isn\u2019t yet licensed, it would only have been administered under a clinical study, which had to be approved by government. Weeks later, Congolese authorities approved the use of the vaccine but health groups declined to deploy it, citing the small scale of cases as well as logistical challenges.Health officials had to rely on motorbikes to reach the epicenter of Likati, which lacks road and rail links with Kisangani, the nearest city, in this mineral-rich but impoverished central African nation.\u201cWe responded very quickly\u201d said Eugene\u00a0Kabambi, a spokesman for the WHO in Congo. \u201cThe remoteness of the area also helped in minimizing the spread.\u201dWrite to Nicholas Bariyo at nicholas.bariyo@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Ebola Outbreak In Congo Ends.'", "news_time": "2017-07-02 06:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-republic-of-congo-declares-end-of-ebola-epidemic-1498992181", "news_title": "Democratic Republic of Congo Declares End of Ebola Epidemic", "keywords": "congo,democratic republic of congo,drc,ebola,who,political,general news,health,medical conditions,outbreaks,epidemics,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "BRISBANE, Australia\u2014      Manny Pacquiao       lost his WBO welterweight world title to Jeff Horn in a stunning, unanimous decision Sunday afternoon in Brisbane.The 11-time world champion entered the fight in front of more than 51,000 people at Suncorp Stadium as a hot favorite but got more than he bargained for against the 29-year-old former schoolteacher.Still, Pacquiao, 38, dominated the later rounds and had Horn wobbling at the end of the ninth.\u201cI felt buzzed for sure, but I\u2019m the Hornet\u2014I\u2019ve got to come back,\u201d Horn said of that round. \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter. Australians aren\u2019t quitters to start with. We\u2019ve showed we\u2019re winners.\u201cIt was the battle of Brisbane, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he added. \u201cAbsolutely unbelievable. So pumped.\u201dPacquiao\u2019s longtime trainer       Freddie Roach       predicted the fight would be short and sweet, but Horn\u2014unbeaten in his 17 previous professional fights\u2014applied pressure by winning some of the early rounds, and Pacquiao needed treatment during the sixth and seventh rounds for a cut from when the two fighters bumped heads.The judges scored the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113, and Horn declared himself \u201cno joke.\u201dSome critics slammed it as a hometown decision, saying the statistics had Pacquiao landing twice the number of power punches as Horn.\u201cThat\u2019s the decision of the judges. I respect that,\u201d Pacquiao was quoted as saying by broadcaster ESPN. \u201cWe have a rematch clause, so no problem.\u201dCo-promotor       Bob Arum       said the result was a close call after some close rounds late in the bout as both fighters looked for a decisive blow.\u201cIt was a close fight, it could have gone either way,\u201d said Arum. \u201cA couple of close rounds, but you can\u2019t argue with the result.\u201dRoach had said earlier in the week that he\u2019d think about advising Pacquiao to retire if he lost the fight, but that would depend on how he fought. Pacquiao announced his retirement after an April 2016 fight against Timothy Bradley, which he won by unanimous decision, but unretired last November to fight Jessie Vargas. The title he won in a decision against Vargas was the one he lost to Horn.Horn said can\u2019t see Pacquiao retiring soon: \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to come back. It was a close decision and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to come back and prove himself.\u201dArum said he\u2019d give it time before talking to Pacquiao about a rematch.\u201cI know Jeff would welcome the rematch, but I don\u2019t know Manny\u2019s future position,\u201d Arum said. \u201cIs he going to stay in politics and not continue in boxing? I don\u2019t know, and he doesn\u2019t know now\u2014it\u2019s unfair to ask him now.\u201dPacquiao\u2019s camp had talked about a rematch with Mayweather if he got past Horn, hoping to avenge his loss on points in the 2015 fight. That seems to be a distant chance now.Pacquiao entered the fight with a record of 59-6-2, but the last of his 38 wins by knockout was in 2009. Horn hadn\u2019t lost a professional fight, but had never encountered anybody of Pacquiao\u2019s credentials.In Marawi City in the southern Philippines, more than 500 displaced villagers at a government hall, along with troops and police, yelled Pacquiao\u2019s name as they watched the bout live on a wide screen.Local officials organized the free public viewing to give some respite from the battle to dislodge Islamic State-aligned militants who took over parts of the city in May.\u201cMany couldn\u2019t accept the result initially, but the entertainment side of it provided a respite from their everyday struggle,\u201d Marawi crisis committee spokesman Zia Alonto Adiong told the Associated Press by telephone. \u201cBut the message of courage and resiliency to face the challenges head on, I think Manny Pacquiao provided that here today.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-02 03:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pacquiao-loses-welterweight-title-to-horn-in-unanimous-decision-1498979145", "news_title": "Pacquiao Loses Welterweight Title to Horn in Unanimous Decision", "keywords": "pacquiao fight,pacquiao-horn fight,pacquiao title fight,title fith,wbo welterweight title,welterweight title,Manny Pacquiao,boxing,combat sports,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "JERUSALEM\u2014Former Israeli Prime Minister       Ehud Olmert       was released from prison Sunday morning, a Prison Service official said.Mr. Olmert, 71, was whisked away by Israel\u2019s security service after his release and driven home, spokesman       Assaf Librati       said. The release came days after a parole board granted him early release from his 27-month corruption sentence.Under the terms of his early release, for the next few months Mr. Olmert must do volunteer work and appear before police twice a month, Mr. Librati said. He can\u2019t give interviews to the media or leave the country.He added that President       Reuven Rivlin       could lift the parole restrictions.Mr. Olmert was convicted in 2014 in a wide-ranging case that accused him of accepting bribes to promote a Jerusalem real-estate project and of obstructing justice. The charges pertained to a period when he was mayor of Jerusalem and trade minister before he became prime minister in 2006.Mr. Olmert, who denied the charges, was originally sentenced to six years in prison. But Israel\u2019s highest court reduced his sentence in December 2015 after acquitting him of some of the charges.His imprisonment ended the last major Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and ushered in the era of       Benjamin Netanyahu       in 2009.Mr. Olmert was a fixture in Israel\u2019s hawkish right wing when he began taking a dramatically more conciliatory line toward the Palestinians more than a decade ago. He played a leading role in Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and the next January became prime minister after then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a debilitating stroke.He resigned as a corruption scandal clouded his administration. He was later charged, convicted and imprisoned.A gifted orator, Mr. Olmert broke a series of taboos while in office\u2014warning that Israel could become like apartheid South Africa if it continued its occupation of the Palestinian territories and expressing readiness to relinquish parts of the holy city of Jerusalem under a peace deal.He led his government to the Annapolis peace conference in November 2007\u2014launching more than a year of ambitious, but ultimately unsuccessful U.S.-brokered peace talks.Mr. Olmert has said he made unprecedented concessions to the Palestinians\u2014including a near-total withdrawal from the West Bank and an offer to place Jerusalem\u2019s Old City under international control\u2014and was close to reaching an agreement at the time of his resignation.", "news_time": "2017-07-02 01:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israels-olmert-released-from-prison-1498973757", "news_title": "Israel\u2019s Olmert Released From Prison", "keywords": "israeli prime minister parole,israeli prime minister prison,israeli prime minister release,olmert early release,olmert prison release,olmert release,Ehud Olmert,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}]
