[{"content": "LONDON\u2014Shares in Britain\u2019s banks fell\u00a0Friday\u00a0on worries about the economy faltering in an uncertain U.K. political climate.Prime Minister       Theresa May       said she will form a government and is looking for support from the Democratic Unionist Party, a small Northern Irish party, after her Conservative party failed to win a majority in\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0snap election.Shares in             Royal Bank of Scotland Group        RBS -0.45%       PLC,             Barclays        BCS -0.19%       PLC,             Lloyds Banking Group        LYG 1.12%       PLC and other domestic lenders only marginally improved from earlier losses following Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s statement on Thursday\u2019s snap elections early\u00a0Friday\u00a0afternoon. The Euro Stoxx index was up 0.3%.Bank analysts said consumer confidence could wobble if Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union is delayed or threatened by the political instability. U.K. economic growth slowed in the first quarter as consumers pared back spending, and banks have been starting to pull back from a four-year lending binge in unsecured credit.Chirantan Barua, an analyst at Bernstein, said the election could by a catalyst for draining excess liquidity from the banking system. He said the U.K. could find it hard to draw in capital and investments until the political situation clarifies.Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell as much as 4% early\u00a0Friday\u00a0on the heightened chance of the main opposition party gaining power if a second election is needed. The Labour party in its election manifesto said it would break up RBS into smaller local lenders, which analyst say would prolong a nine-year effort to get the bank out from under 71% state support.Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group fell 1% and             Metro Bank                   fell 3%. Rising gilt yields would add to the banks\u2019s funding costs and squeeze margins.A fall in sterling\u00a0Friday\u00a0was good news, though, for the U.K.\u2019s Asia focused banks,             HSBC                   and             Standard Chartered.       The two banks\u2019s stocks became cheaper to buy with dollars, and most of their revenues aren\u2019t in pounds. HSBC makes about 25% of its revenue in the U.K. while Standard Chartered has only minimal sterling-denominated revenues.\u2014Margot PatrickAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'British Banks Brace For Election Wobble.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 23:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-banks-brace-for-election-wobble-1497065490", "news_title": "British Banks Brace for Election Wobble", "keywords": "Barclays,BCS,Royal Bank of Scotland Group,RBS.LN,RBS,Lloyds Banking Group,LLOY.LN,Chirantan Barua,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "CNN has cut ties with on-air personality       Reza Aslan,        who tweeted a vulgarity about President       Donald Trump       in the wake of the London terrorist attacks last week.Mr. Aslan, who hosted the CNN series \u201cBeliever\u201d about religion and faith-based groups, called Mr. Trump a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d in response to a tweet from the president after the attack.\u201cCNN has decided to not move forward with production on the acquired series \u2018Believer with Reza Aslan,\u2019\u201d CNN said in a statement released\u00a0Friday\u00a0afternoon.Mr. Aslan,\u00a0an Iranian-American author and a religious scholar,\u00a0had apologized for his tweet, saying he should have used \u201cbetter language\u201d to express his view of the president\u2019s words after the attack.In a statement, Mr. Aslan said he was \u201cvery disappointed in the decision\u201d to cancel his show and that the show\u2019s message of \u201creligious tolerance and exploration is extremely important right now.\u201d He said he recognized that CNN \u201cneeds to protect its brand as an unbiased news outlet,\u201d adding that he too needs to \u201chonor my voice.\u201d\u201cBeliever\u201d had run one season on CNN and was expected to return later this year.This is the second time in recent weeks that CNN has distanced itself from talent over their treatment of President Trump.

The court took the country\u2019s stability into account before making its decision.\u201cCombating corruption is something I also want\u2026but you can\u2019t just go substituting the president of the Republic all the time,\u201d said Gilmar Mendes, the head of the Superior Electoral Court, or TSE, before casting the final vote Friday night.The court\u2019s verdict sparked anger among opposition politicians and many Brazilians. They accused the magistrates of political bias because several judges said they would disregard more recent evidence uncovered in the Car Wash probe. That investigation has ballooned into the biggest of its kind in Brazil\u2019s history, with politicians and executives of major companies accused of running a multibillion-dollar kickback scheme.The majority of the court\u2019s judges said this week that their understanding of electoral law meant that they should only consider evidence available around the time when the case was first filed more than two years ago, before much of the Car Wash evidence was collected.\u201cThrowing out evidence like this just sounds like a gentleman\u2019s agreement,\u201d said Chico Alencar, a congressman for the leftist PSOL party. The TSE\u2019s case was filed shortly after the 2014 elections but gained momentum after executives of meatpacker JBS last month said they bribed Mr. Temer and nearly 2,000 other politicians to get low-interest state loans. Mr. Temer has denied wrongdoing and refused to step down.But his opponents had hoped the TSE could accelerate its longstanding case over illegal campaign financing as a way to fast-track his exit. The TSE had the power to annul the 2014 election results\u2014a move that would have stripped Mr. Temer of the mandate he inherited from Ms. Rousseff. Mr. Temer still faces a separate Supreme Court investigation over the JBS bribery accusations and several impeachment motions in Congress, but both require the approval of Congress to proceed.While Mr. Temer\u2019s approval rating among voters is less than 10%, he is considered a deft backroom negotiator in government and may now be able to muster enough support to cling on to power until presidential elections in 2018, legal scholars say.\u201cThe biggest threat was this judgment\u2014the chances of him reaching the end of his mandate have increased considerably,\u201d said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro.When Mr. Temer took over from Ms. Rousseff, it ended more than a decade of rule by the leftist Workers\u2019 Party. He promised he would overhaul Latin America\u2019s biggest economy and lift the country out of its deepest recession on record. Just as the latest JBS bribery scandal broke, his government was poised to approve critical reforms to Brazil\u2019s generous pension system, which economists say are necessary to avoid a full-blown fiscal crisis.Rafael Cortez,        a political scientist at S\u00e3o Paulo consultancy Tendencias, said Mr. Temer will likely struggle to pass meaningful reforms.\u201cHis victory over his mandate will not automatically translate to support for his reforms,\u201d Mr. Cortez said. The unpopular changes to the pension system, including the introduction of a minimum retirement age, would still likely pass but with significant concessions, Mr. Cortez said.\u2014Jeffrey T.

Those companies\u2019 outsized gains had prompted some uneasiness among investors in recent trading sessions, and a series of downbeat research notes about the group and climbing valuations sparked the Friday selloff, some traders and analysts said.Stock-trading volumes were elevated, making Friday the second-busiest trading day of 2017 as measured by number of shares changing hands on major U.S. exchanges.\u201cTech stocks have done so well, have made such a big move, and people are asking \u2018how much better can it get for them?\u2019\u201d said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co. Mr. Morgan, whose firm owns many of the big tech names, said he isn\u2019t selling because he believes there hasn\u2019t been a change in the earnings potential for those companies.The             Nasdaq Co      mposite fell 113.85, or 1.8%, to 6207.92. Technology companies in the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, dragging the broader index into the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\u2019s 15% year-to-date gain is roughly double the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s rise, and the tech sector in the S&P 500 is up 19%.Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all fell more than 3%, and             Microsoft                   dropped 2.3% on Friday\u2014though all five companies remain up by double digits for the year. Traders and analysts attributed the selloff in part to a research note by             Goldman Sachs                   that called out the five companies\u2019 recent outperformance as potentially overheated.Semiconductor companies, which make the chips that some of these larger tech companies use to build their products, also fell. The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which is up 20% in 2017 after gaining 37% in 2016, fell 4.2% Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average spent much of the session higher on the day before dipping into negative territory in the afternoon and then rebounding to close at a record. The blue-chip index rose 89.44 points, or 0.4%, to 21271.97. The S&P 500 shed 2.02 points, or 0.1%, to 2431.77, posting a weekly decline of 0.3%.U.S. markets were relatively calm through a series of events this week, including a European Central Bank meeting, the surprise result in the U.K. election and former FBI director       James Comey\u2019s       testimony.The S&P 500 didn\u2019t post a daily move of more than 0.3% all week.In the U.K. on Friday, stocks tied to the economy fell and the pound dropped after British voters deprived Prime Minister       Theresa May       and her ruling Conservative Party of a majority in Parliament.Investors fear a hung parliament would usher in a fresh period of political uncertainty and make it more difficult for the U.K. to secure a favorable deal in its negotiations to exit from the European Union.While this sort of event used to generate a more volatile trading environment globally, \u201cthe world seems pretty calm about it,\u201d said Adam Karrlsson-Willis, vice president of equity trading at INTL FCStone Financial.\u201cWe have two years of question marks now,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is sitting on their hands again to wait and see...nobody wants to make a distinct move either way.\u201dEarlier, Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.5% as the dollar climbed against the yen, supporting exporters in the index.

Some said less Conservative influence could lead to a softer Brexit, which could be good for the economy, but others argued that the increased uncertainty will make the divorce even more tortuous and unpredictable.In the short term, however, the direction was clear. The pound was volatile, tumbling 1.7% against the dollar on Friday to $1.2741 in late New York trading, its biggest one-day percentage loss since October and its lowest level since Prime Minister       Theresa May       called the general election in April. The currency was 1.6% lower than where it traded before an exit poll released Thursday evening pointed to a so-called hung parliament.\u201cThe market is focusing on the uncertainty,\u201d said       John Stopford,        head of multiasset income at Investec Asset Management. \u201cThere are concerns about chaos, the risk of a bad deal and an inability to negotiate now the clock is ticking\u201d on Brexit, he said.Worries about the political outlook rocked shares of U.K.-focused lenders and regional house builders. Banking stocks came under pressure amid worries that the main opposition Labour Party would gain influence, or even form a government, having promised a shake-up of the sector.A period of political uncertainty could also keep interest rates lower for longer, which pushed down the yield of U.K. government bonds slightly to around 1.01%, according to Tradeweb.The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 250 index fell for much of Friday before ending up a mere 0.1%. The export-heavy FTSE 100 rose 1% as global companies that generate revenue abroad benefited from the weaker currency.Still, traders described the environment Friday as relatively calm compared with past political shocks.\u201cThe market is absorbing this result much better compared to the Brexit result, but a lot will depend on how things develop,\u201d said       Geoffrey Yu,        head of the U.K. investment office at UBS Wealth Management.Mr. Yu said that rather than placing trades, he would spend his time on Friday sketching out various scenarios and how that could affect markets. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information yet to actually make a judgment,\u201d he said.Investors\u2019 key concern is how the result will affect Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU, formal negotiations for which were set to start in 10 days.The debate was whether the Conservatives\u2019 disappointing result will reduce the pressure for a more complete break from Brussels, which could be good for the pound, or whether the lack of a clear mandate for a governing party would weaken the country\u2019s hand in negotiations and add to uncertainty.The Conservative Party was already talking to a traditional ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, to enlist their future help in voting through its policies. But those seats will offer only a slim majority, meaning that the influence of pro-EU parties, like the Scottish National Party, will be key.If the Conservatives fail to form a government, Labour would get its chance. The left-wing party is expected to take a less hard-line stance in Brexit negotiations and immigration, all of which business and investors want. It too would need to look to the likes of the SNP for support.\u201cA softer Brexit looks more likely, and a softer Brexit is also sterling positive,\u201d said       Ben Kumar,        investment manager at Seven Investment Management. But any government will need more cross-partisan support to secure deals, he said.While Brexit supporters argue that the U.K. would be able to carve out new deals with trading giants such as the U.S. and China, most analysts say the sort of clean break from the EU that Conservatives have advocated would be negative for the British economy, throwing up tariffs and obstacles to trade with its biggest partner and hurting the its large finance industry.But investors say there are multiple moving parts, all of which are hard to predict. If the Tories oust Mrs. May as their leader, for instance, that could trigger another election and more volatility. It could also lead to a more euroskeptic leader taking over the Tories.\u201cThe hung parliament is opening up the possibility of potentially a softer Brexit as well as what I would describe as a bad Brexit,\u201d said       Michael Metcalfe,        global head of macro strategy at             State Street Global Markets,       meaning the U.K. could run out of time to clinch a trade agreement or end up with a bad deal.\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s certain now is that we probably need a bit of a risk premium attached to U.K. assets to reflect that uncertainty,\u201d he said.Investors have become accustomed to political uncertainty in Britain over the past year, which could help explain why moves in financial markets haven\u2019t been more dramatic so far.While few expected a minority government, U.K. asset prices had already factored in \u201ca period of extended political uncertainty given the complexity of delivering on the outcome of last year\u2019s EU referendum,\u201d said Paras Anand, chief investment officer for European Equities at Fidelity International.\u201cSimply put, that we are facing a period of political uncertainty is nothing new,\u201d he added.\u2014Alistair MacDonald contributed to this article.Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com, Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Uncertainty Pressures the Pound.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 20:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-pound-falls-after-conservatives-lose-parliamentary-majority-1496997203", "news_title": "Pound Falls on U.K. Uncertainty", "keywords": "bank stocks,brexit,conservative party,ftse 250 index, general election,hung parliament,jeremy corbyn, labour party, negotiations, new government,pound,price of sterling, shares, sterling,theresa may,uk election, uk markets, uk stocks, uk vote,European Union,Ben Kumar,John Stopford,Geoffrey Yu,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,equity markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014      Theresa May\u2019s       failed election gamble left Tory lawmakers questioning her authority and how the party drove itself into such an error.\u201cOur own campaign was hijacked by ourselves,\u201d Conservative lawmaker       Nigel Evans       told the British Broadcasting Corp. \u201cIt was an amazing own goal.

Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn,        by contrast, held large, spontaneous rallies, where supporters chanted his nickname, \u201cJezza! Jezza!\u201d Party strategists had bet on Mrs. May\u2019s personal popularity, which soared high above Mr. Corbyn\u2019s at the start of the campaign.Beyond that, a series of missteps, including a reversal on a key policy, undermined her slogan that she was a \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leader. The party upset its older, core supporters with a proposal to reduce elderly social care, while it turned off younger voters by not laying out opportunities for jobs and affordable housing, some party lawmakers said.The dynamics of the campaign shifted in the final stretch after the U.K. was struck by two terrorist attacks, in which 30 people were killed. Mrs. May could have used the moment to explain how leaving the EU would enable the U.K. to protect its borders, said       Bernard Jenkin,        a Conservative lawmaker, but instead she came under pressure for a decision to cut police numbers while she was home secretary.\u201cWe failed to connect the right to control who comes into our country with Brexit in this campaign,\u201d Mr. Jenkin said. \u201cWe allowed Corbyn to develop a narrative that somehow the terrorism was our own fault because of our foreign policy.\u201dAnother Conservative lawmaker,       Crispin Blunt,        said one of the party\u2019s key mistakes was underestimating Mr. Corbyn. \u201cHe has successfully made himself a lightning rod for the antiestablishment feeling,\u201d he said.Others said the Conservative campaign was too negative, focusing on Labour\u2019s incompetence rather than the Conservatives\u2019 strengths. The party lost key seats in London, which heavily supported remaining in the EU, and where Mr. Corbyn\u2019s platform of offering free college tuition and an end to cuts to public services resonated with younger voters.On her last day of campaigning, Mrs. May and her husband were met with jeers of \u201cVote Labour!\u201d by several butchers as she took an early-morning stroll through London\u2019s Smithfield meat market.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Lawmakers See Missteps Behind Election Setback.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 20:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservative-lawmakers-see-missteps-behind-u-k-election-setback-1497055570", "news_title": "Conservative Lawmakers See Missteps Behind U.K. Election Setback ", "keywords": "British Broadcasting Corp.,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla.\u2014Florida became the first state with a law that spells out that prosecutors, and not defendants, have the burden of proof in pretrial \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearings when Gov.

The measure puts the Treasury Department in a bind, as Congress sets taxes and requires the Treasury to spend money with one set of legislation, and then forbids borrowing to covering any difference.Last month, Mr. Mnuchin has asked Congress to raise the debt limit without attaching conditions.Government debt, at nearly $20 trillion, hit Congress\u2019s self-imposed limit in mid-March. Since then, the Treasury Department has been employing cash-conservation measures to keep funding itself, steps it has taken routinely in recent years after repeated breaches of the ceiling.Mr. Mnuchin was welcomed with red-carpet treatment on his visit to Ottawa, the first by a Treasury Secretary to Canada in roughly a decade.During the day, he met with select members of the Canadian cabinet, among them Mr. Morneau and       Chrystia Freeland,        Canada\u2019s Foreign Minister, and blue-chip Canadian chief executives.At the joint press conference with his Canadian counterpart, the bulk of questions focused on trade relations between the U.S. and Canada, and what\u2019s in store once renegotiations start among the U.S., Canada and Mexico on revamping the North American Free-Trade Agreement, in August.Mr. Mnuchin said any changes to Nafta will ensure strong two-way trade between the North American partners, and remains confident Washington and Ottawa can address outstanding trade disagreements related to softwood lumber and dairy.On tax reform, Mr. Mnuchin said \u201cnothing is higher\u201d on his agenda than getting tax-code reform through Congress before the end of the year. Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on a question about written testimony from       James Comey,        the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that suggested President Donald Trump told Mr. Comey the investigations into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election cast a \u201ccloud\u201d over the administration\u2019s agenda.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 20:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/backup-plans-in-place-if-debt-ceiling-not-addressed-before-recess-mnuchin-says-1497039046", "news_title": "Backup Plans in Place if Debt Ceiling Not Addressed Before Recess, Mnuchin Says", "keywords": "congress,dairy,debt ceiling,lumber,nafta,Steven Mnuchin,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May       turned to an unlikely partner in a bid to hold onto power, seeking on Friday to push ahead with talks on the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union even after British voters rebelled against her Conservative Party.A year after Britons chose to part ways with the EU in a referendum, voters\u2014particularly young ones\u2014turned out in numbers not seen in two decades to deliver a shock to the British leader, denying her the majority she had gambled to secure. The results cast doubt on her party leadership and her course for a clear split with the bloc.The reckoning for Mrs. May shows Brexit is an issue that continues to convulse British politics. The surprise outcome was the result of a host of other factors as well: a uninspiring campaign by a prime minister criticized for calling the election opportunistically; anxieties over domestic issues such as health services; and a backlash against Brexit among young people, who turned strongly to Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn.Though the Conservatives came in first by a wide margin, they still lost 13 seats and control of Parliament, clouding the country\u2019s path out of the EU and prompting Mrs. May to reach out to Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to form a majority parliamentary alliance with her Conservatives.Anthony Wells,        director of political and social opinion polling at YouGov, said the vote gave young people who stayed home for the Brexit referendum a chance to make up for their inaction.\u201cWe\u2019ve had Trump, we\u2019ve had Brexit, and both were instances where people thought it was never going to happen and didn\u2019t bother to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThose surprise results made it more important for people to vote for what they believe in.\u201dOn Friday, the prime minister seemed determined to cling to office, but some of her Conservative colleagues suggested they have different ideas. If before the election her cabinet served at her pleasure, now she serves at theirs. And even if her battered party can avoid a damaging leadership battle, the instability of minority government means the country could soon be set for another general election.The vote results could potentially force Mrs. May to try to tread a softer path with closer ties to the bloc\u2014or portend a chaotic crash if she fails to line up the parliamentary support she will need as time runs out to reach a deal.The electoral debacle fueled public unease\u2014and in some cases private rage\u2014among Conservatives over Mrs. May\u2019s leadership. Anna Soubry, a Conservative lawmaker, said Mrs. May must think about her position as prime minister after running \u201ca pretty dreadful campaign.\u201d\u201cShe is in a very difficult place,\u201d Ms. Soubry told the British Broadcasting Corp. early Friday.Fending off calls for her resignation, Mrs. May turned to the DUP, a small socially conservative Northern Irish party formed by firebrand preacher Ian Paisley in the 1970s, to give her the right to govern. The party\u2019s 10 seats are enough to give the Conservatives, who won 318 seats with one district still to declare, a majority in Britain\u2019s 650-seat Parliament.\u201cThis will allow us to come together as a country and channel our energies towards a successful Brexit deal,\u201d Mrs. May said in a sober-faced appearance outside her Downing Street residence after receiving permission from the Queen to form a government. She later told local broadcasters she was \u201csorry for all those colleagues who lost their seats who didn\u2019t deserve to lose.\u201dDUP leader       Arlene Foster       said her party would enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how to \u201cbring stability at this time of great challenge.\u201dThe precise terms of the Conservatives\u2019 arrangement with the DUP are still to be hammered out, but past minority governments have been backed on critical votes by smaller partners in return for policy concessions. The question is what the DUP, whose conservative views on gay marriage and abortion stand out in the U.K., will demand.The party has expressed support for Mrs. May\u2019s approach\u2014which includes leaving the EU\u2019s single market for goods and services to take full control over immigration\u2014but some of its positions suggest she will come under pressure not to make an abrupt break.The DUP has set out a Brexit wish-list that highlights demands aimed at protecting Northern Ireland\u2019s small economy that could influence the U.K.\u2019s overall strategy, including a call for agricultural subsidies for farmers after Brexit, ongoing access to EU development funds for poor regions and a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border with EU-member Ireland. Mindful of the economic risks, it is hostile to one of Mrs. May\u2019s signature pledges\u2014that no deal in Brexit talks is better than a bad deal.Speaking in Edinburgh, Scottish National Party leader       Nicola Sturgeon       said the election results show that \u201cthe reckless pursuit\u201d of a Brexit that takes the U.K. out of the single market must be abandoned. She accused the Conservatives of putting party interests before the country\u2019s.\u201cIn less than a year, they have caused chaos on an industrial scale,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said.The prime minister had pitched herself as the best person to lead the country through Brexit, in a campaign frequently overshadowed by domestic issues and security concerns after the U.K. was hit by three terrorist attacks in three months.Mr. Corbyn, her Labour opponent, energized some voters, hammering her party over austerity cuts, including to police spending, and called for nationalizing the railroads and raising taxes on high earners.Young people appeared to have turned out in larger numbers than in recent election. University towns and districts with a higher proportion of younger voters saw jumps in Labour\u2019s share of the votes in the double digits.Both the Conservatives and Labour increased their share of the vote at the expense of smaller parties, attracting 82.4% of votes cast\u2014the highest combined share in nearly 50 years.Because Britain\u2019s exit polls lack the deep detail of their U.S. equivalents it is hard to say exactly what motivated voters. But it is clear they were motivated: Turnout hit 68.7%, its highest level since 1997.Canterbury, a Conservative stronghold, switched hands to Labour for the first time since 1918, in a shift that appears to have been driven by the city\u2019s large student population, among whom Labour\u2019s pledge to abolish tuition fees also proved popular. Turnout rose to 72.7% from 64%.A survey of 14,000 people who voted Thursday, commissioned by Michael Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, found that 67% of those aged 18 to 24 who voted went for Labour. The Conservative Party was supported by 59% of those aged 65 and over.The Conservatives had also hoped that voters would abandon the UK Independence Party, which had long sought Brexit, but has struggled to find a further purpose. UKIP\u2019s vote fell by almost 11% compared with 2015, but not entirely to the Conservative Party\u2019s advantage. As a result, the party failed to win seats it had hoped to gain from Labour in the northeast of England.\u201cIt looks like it was far more evenly spread, and far more of that UKIP vote went back to Labour,\u201d Mr. Wells said.\u2014Jenny Gross contributed to this article.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'After Upset, U.K. Leader Seeks Ally to Retain Power.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 19:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-theresa-may-looks-to-smaller-party-to-form-government-1497003906", "news_title": "Battered at Polls, U.K.\u2019s May Seeks to Retain Power ", "keywords": " brexit, may, theresa may,uk election,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "CHICAGO\u2014Ratings firm             Moody\u2019s Corp.      \u00a0on Friday\u00a0downgraded the credit ratings of seven public universities in Illinois over concerns about the state\u2019s nearly two-year budget impasse.The universities were downgraded because of their reliance on the state of Illinois for payments and appropriations, according to Moody\u2019s. Of the seven universities, five of them\u2014Southern Illinois University, Northern Illinois University, Governors State University, Northeastern Illinois University and Eastern Illinois University\u2014now have junk status.Illinois has been without a budget for two years due to a standoff between the state\u2019s Republican governor and Democratic legislature. While tax revenue is still flowing in, the state has fallen more than $14 billion behind on paying its bills, leaving many schools with significant financial gaps.The Illinois legislature has introduced stopgap measures to provide schools with state funding, but these measures provided only 30% of funding in the 2016 fiscal year compared with the year before, and about half of that this year.In one example, Eastern Illinois University only received $16 million from the state in the 2016 fiscal year, compared with $52 million in the 2015 fiscal year.Moody\u2019s downgrade marks the end of a 90-day credit review rating for these seven universities.It also follows a move by both S&P Global and Moody\u2019s to downgrade state of Illinois bond ratings earlier this month. Ratings firms have warned that the state can be downgrade to junk status next month if the partisan gridlock isn\u2019t solved, which would make Illinois the first state with such a rating.Gov.       Bruce Rauner       and the state\u2019s Democratic House speaker, Michael Madigan, have been deadlocked over taxes and spending since Mr. Rauner took office in 2015. State lawmakers can continue to work toward a budget in the coming weeks, but they will need more votes.After the regular session of the General Assembly ended last week, three-fifths of both houses must support the budget, instead of a simple majority.Of the seven universities, the University of Illinois system has the healthiest rating. Moody\u2019s says that the system continues to have excellent liquidity with $2.3 billion cash in hand, a healthy student population and millions in research awards that have kept the school financially healthy despite slowing funds from the state.Still, the University of Illinois\u2019 outlook remains negative, a reflection of its \u201cmaterial reliance on the State of Illinois for operations,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.Write to Shibani Mahtani at shibani.mahtani@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Eastern Illinois University received $16 million from the state in the 2016 fiscal year, compared with $52 million in the 2015 fiscal year.

Success applied to run pre-K programs under the city\u2019s initiative, which is open to charters and other public schools. But the local Education Department refused to supply the money unless Success signed an invasive contract.This contract micromanaged: field trips (limited to three a school year); how long students can be exposed to digital devices (15 minutes a day); curriculum; meals; staff training; and more, as Thursday\u2019s decision details. State law says that pre-K offerings should \u201cencourage program creativity through competition,\u201d not create a central command for how much time a 4-year-old can spend finger painting.Success and a group of parents alleged that under state law charters are held accountable by authorizers such as the state university, and charters can by law manage their own operations and compete with traditional public schools.

Their spin is that because the vote reverses Mr. Brownback\u2019s tax cuts in a Republican state that Donald Trump carried by more than 20 points, Republicans everywhere should stop cutting taxes.The reality is more prosaic\u2014and politically cynical. The press accounts gleefully talk of how \u201cmoderate Republicans\u201d joined with Democrats to raise taxes to address exploding state deficits. But substitute \u201cRepublicans backed by teachers unions\u201d for moderate Republicans, and the real picture comes into focus. At bottom the Kansas tax vote was as much about unions getting even with the Governor over his education reforms, which included making it easier to fire bad teachers.The Kansas economy has struggled even after the 2012 tax cuts that reduced the top rate on personal income taxes to 4.9% from 6.45% and eliminated income tax for small businesses filing as individuals. Mr. Brownback was unlucky in his timing, given the hits to the agricultural and energy industries that count for much of the state economy.But unemployment is still low at 3.7%, and the state has had considerable small-business formation every year since the tax cuts were enacted. The tax competition across the Kansas-Missouri border around Kansas City is one reason Missouri cut its top individual tax rate in 2014.Mr. Brownback\u2019s reform mistake was that in eliminating taxes on \u201cpass-through\u201d small businesses, the Governor created a loophole that allowed law firms, accounting agencies, consultants and many others to declare wage income to be business profit and pay little or nothing. This caused lower tax revenues than Mr. Brownback predicted, and bigger deficits when the legislature refused to cut spending. What do you know: Tax rates affect taxpayer behavior.A good part of this tax increase is also personal payback. In 2012 Mr. Brownback campaigned against eight Republican incumbents who lost to more conservative GOP challengers. The losers had their revenge in last summer\u2019s primaries, when the conservatives were ousted by Republicans backed by the teachers union. Because the GOP dominates Kansas politics, the big policy disputes occur among Republicans, and public unions support the state GOP\u2019s liberal wing.The upshot is that supposedly conservative Kansas will now have a higher top marginal individual income-tax rate (5.7%) than Massachusetts (5.1%). And the unions will be back for another increase as spending rises to meet the new greater revenues. This is the eternal lesson of tax increases, as Illinois and Connecticut prove.Democrats would love Republicans to abandon rate-cutting or reform. Then they can fight over whether to raise taxes on the rich. The one relevant Kansas lesson is that Republicans in Washington need to be careful how they write any tax reform for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses. One way to do that is to avoid letting pass-through tax rates get too much lower than rates on wage and salary income.

Since the company\u2019s stock recovered, Mr. Glasenberg has engineered the purchase of a stake in Russian state oil company PAO Rosneft, taken full control of a Congolese mine and made an offer to take over agricultural trader             Bunge Ltd.In Australia, Mr. Glasenberg is targeting Rio Tinto coal assets that the company has long coveted. And he is inserting himself into a deal already thought sealed by Rio Tinto, the British-Australian company Mr. Glasenberg launched talks to buy in 2014.Glencore said Friday its offer was $100 million richer than the amount Rio Tinto agreed on in January with             Yancoal Australia Ltd.       for Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. Coal & Allied has significant operations in Australia\u2019s Hunter Valley, where Glencore also has a big coal business, offering the potential for two of the world\u2019s largest mining companies to marry operations and save money.Glencore said its offer was already fully financed and could be considered by Rio Tinto under the terms of its deal with Yancoal, which hadn\u2019t obtained financing at the time the Rio deal was announced. Glencore\u2019s offer expires on June 26, a day before Rio Tinto has scheduled an extraordinary general meeting to vote on the deal with Yancoal.Rio Tinto said Friday that it had received Glencore\u2019s proposal and would respond after giving it \u201cappropriate consideration.\u201d Yancoal couldn\u2019t be reached.The interest in Rio Tinto\u2019s coal assets comes amid a volatile period for the commodity, in this case, thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity.Its price shot up in 2016 as demand from China heated up. The market has cooled this year, and analysts expect thermal-coal prices to remain subdued as countries switch to cleaner-burning fuels.In all, the operations that Glencore wants to buy account for about 60% of Rio Tinto\u2019s coal production. The sale would rid Rio of nearly all of its thermal coal, though it still produces significant amounts of metallurgical coal, an ingredient in steel.Glencore emphasized on Friday that it was conscious of the strain this deal could put on debt levels that Mr. Glasenberg scrambled to lower over the past two years.If successful in buying Coal & Allied from Rio Tinto, Glencore said it would explore selling up to a 50% stake in the business and look to sell other coal assets so that its total financial commitment wouldn\u2019t exceed $2 billion.If Rio accepts the offer, Glencore said it would also buy out Japanese trader Mitsubishi\u2019s interest in Australian joint ventures for $920 million.Much of Coal & Allied\u2019s production goes to Japan, giving Glencore less exposure to Chinese demand fluctuations.

The office said authorities seized 50 kilograms of what they believe is the fentanyl precursor chemical N-Phenethyl-4-piperidinone, also known as NPP, from a storage facility in Northborough, Mass.A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment on whether there were any arrests associated with the chemical seizure, which occurred on May 25.A large NPP seizure in New England is unusual because there are few recent instances of fentanyl-making clandestine laboratories within the U.S. Instead, law-enforcement authorities believe most illicit fentanyl is made in China, or in Mexico with precursor chemicals from China, and then shipped to the U.S. as a finished product.There have also been seizures of fentanyl precursor chemicals in southern California, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said. The agency believes traffickers are smuggling the precursors south to Mexico to make fentanyl in bulk.While far from the southern border, New England is a hot spot for the U.S. opioid crisis. Fentanyl is a major factor behind a rising tide of overdose fatalities in the region.\u201cThe fact that this happened in the Northeast should surprise nobody because that\u2019s where the cartels, these traffickers, have aggressively marketed the product,\u201d DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said.The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office did not say where they believe the NPP came from.NPP is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning any U.S. entity making, distributing, importing or exporting the chemical must register with the DEA and report specific transactions.At the urging of the U.S., a United Nations commission in March voted to put new regulatory controls on NPP and ANPP, another chemical used to make illicit fentanyl.Authorities have also aggressively pursued alleged opioid traffickers to try and slow the fentanyl crisis. On May 30, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Massachusetts announced charges against more than 30 people following a sweep aimed at the heroin and fentanyl problem in Lawrence, Mass. That city is a well-known trafficking hub for drugs that flow into hard-hit New Hampshire, according to authorities.More than 100 alleged traffickers were indicted in New York state in early June.Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 18:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-authorities-seize-chemical-used-for-powerful-opioid-1497048636", "news_title": "Federal Authorities Seize Chemical Used for Powerful Opioid ", "keywords": " dea, drug enforcement administraion,fentanyl, northborough, n-phenethyl-4-piperidinone, npp, npp seizure, opioids, synthetic opioids, us attorney's office,U.S. Attorney's office,Drug Enforcement Agency,chemicals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Executives from around the world agreed on one big takeaway from the Conservative Party\u2019s failure to win a majority in the U.K. parliament: anything they thought they knew about Brexit was out the window.\u201cNobody knows what this means for Brexit,\u201d said       Richard Carter,        U.K. head of             BASF AG      , who was attending a dinner in London for the German Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, as exit polls indicated a so-called hung parliament. \u201cThis will have huge implications.\u201dTheresa May\u2019s       Conservatives still hold more seats than any other party after the election, but the prime minister's failure to secure a majority\u2014and the strong showing by Labour and the Liberal Democrats\u2014scramble British politics just ahead of the start of negotiations over the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.Mrs. May said Friday she wouldn\u2019t step down as head of her party and would attempt to form a minority government, relying on other parliamentary parties to pass legislation. Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       has instead called for her resignation and said he would try to form a government\u2014but Mrs. May has the first crack at doing so.For businesses around the world, Brexit had presented plenty of uncertainty already.Mrs. May called the election to bolster her thin majority and strengthen her hand in negotiations with Brussels over the terms of the EU divorce. Those talks are slated to start in June and Mrs. May has telegraphed she is prepared for a clean break, even if that meant exiting free trade and other agreements that have made cross-channel business easier.That \u201chard\u201d Brexit stance has spooked investors and many executives. Mrs. May\u2019s disappointing showing on Thursday could soften her position, raising hope among business leaders her stance may soften.Ulrich Hoppe,        director general of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce in the U.K., said he hoped the vote would \u201clead to the country reassessing its position on Brexit.\u201dThe U.K. could become more open to compromise under a different government, Mr. Hoppe said.The chief marketing officer of             Ryanair                   Group PLC expressed similar hopes regarding Brexit on Friday. The airline, Europe\u2019s largest by passenger numbers, has been an outspoken supporter of the U.K. remaining in the EU.\u201cThe U.K. election result shows that some people have changed their mind on Brexit. I would love to see a soft Brexit back on the agenda,\u201d tweeted Ryanair\u2019s       Kenny Jacobs.Some companies had already made concrete moves to protect themselves from Mrs. May\u2019s vision of Brexit.             Whirlpool Corp.      , for instance, has said it would keep an English dryer factory open amid a wider European restructuring, so that it can continue supplying British consumers without having to worry about new tariffs or currency swings related to Brexit. Whirlpool Chief Operating Officer       Marc Bitzer       called it \u201cindustrial hedging\u201d in an interview in May.Now, that move might seem hasty, if the Conservatives are forced to water down their \u201chard\u201d Brexit stance. A Whirlpool spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.The       pound       fell Friday, continuing a decline from late Thursday after exit polls indicated the likely election results.The       FTSE 100       index of blue chip companies rose Friday.

Airbus, which makes the wings for all its planes in the U.K., said it was taking a long view, rather than focusing on short-term currency fluctuations or even election outcomes.\u201cWe will have to look at the long-term consequences of Brexit.

Instead the Prime Minister looked weak, and British voters on Thursday chose a period of instability by electing a hung Parliament. This is what happens to parties of the right when they abandon growth economics.Mrs. May said Friday she\u2019ll try to form a minority government with the help of the Northern Irish unionists, but this makes her humiliation only somewhat less severe. The Tories lost 12 seats in the House of Commons compared to their 2015 win under       David Cameron       and at 318 fell short of the 326 needed for a majority. Mrs. May didn\u2019t have to call an election until 2020 but did so to capitalize on Labour Party disarray under leader       Jeremy Corbyn.       Instead she squandered a 20-point lead, and the recent terror attacks weren\u2019t politically decisive.Much of the blame goes to campaign malpractice. Mrs. May ducked televised debates and issued a policy manifesto that offered little for voters. She should have known better. Surprise victories for the British exit from the European Union and       Donald Trump       last year demonstrated that voters across the West are rebelling against politicians who take support for granted.The outcome is also a rebuke to Mrs. May\u2019s wing of the Conservative Party. This contingent argues the Tories need to shed the \u201cright-wing ideology\u201d of the       Margaret Thatcher       era. Mrs. May embraced ideas like a cap on household energy prices that were lifted from old Labour manifestos, railed against business, and delivered speeches about \u201cthe good that government can do.\u201dDespite his own ideological malleability, Mr. Cameron and his Chancellor       George Osborne       rebuilt a Tory majority by lifting the economy from its post-financial crisis mess. They cut tax rates to boost growth and moved toward a balanced budget. Mrs. May temporized about raising taxes. The strategy was to break into traditional Labour strongholds, but that failed as young people came out in big numbers for Mr. Corbyn\u2019s promise of free tuition.Mrs. May has now succeeded in entrenching the radical Mr. Corbyn as opposition leader. Moderate Labourites\u2019 best hope for dislodging him was a thumping defeat, but his brand of socialism will be around at least through the next election.Mrs. May\u2019s defenders say her 42% share of the vote is larger than Mr. Cameron\u2019s 37%, which is true but ignores that Britain is returning to two-party dominance. The centrist Liberal-Democrats lost votes even as they gained some seats, and the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) was all but wiped out. The Tories made gains against the Scottish Nationalist Party, mainly by opposing a new independence referendum. The warning for Tories\u2014and America\u2019s \u201creformacon\u201d Republicans\u2014is that welfare-state conservatism struggles to build an electoral coalition that can win a two-party race.One question is whether Mrs. May can continue to govern for long, and the Tories will certainly want a better leader for the next election.       Boris Johnson,        the former mayor of London, is one front-runner. He\u2019d bring a dose of charisma, though he\u2019s not obviously a Thatcherite on economics. Home Secretary       Amber Rudd       performed well in the campaign but is a mystery on economics and has shown an antipathy to immigration in her current role.The best option would be to recall Mr. Osborne, who chose not to run in this election but knows the policies needed to make Britain grow amid the uncertainty of Brexit negotiations. Another near-term election is possible, but without an economic agenda another vote would create more openings for Mr. Corbyn.Britain may now ask the EU to extend the two-year deadline for Brexit talks to account for a hung parliament, and Brussels should consent. The EU has an interest in negotiating a deal that works for both sides. But the striking feature of this election is how little Brexit seemed to matter. Mrs. May pitched a tough \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d negotiating strategy, while Mr. Corbyn accepted Brexit while focusing more on British well-being.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s policy solutions are wrong, but he did realize better than Mrs. May that voters are worried about the economic squeeze created by 3% inflation (caused in part by the falling British pound), slow wage growth and failing public services. With Mr. Corbyn\u2019s political influence growing, the Tories urgently need an economic strategy that can attract voters who otherwise might choose socialism by default.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britains-lesson-for-conservatives-1497027901", "news_title": "Britain\u2019s Lesson for Conservatives", "keywords": "Theresa May,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,elections,presidential elections,editorials"}, {"content": "Crude-oil prices have declined almost 9% in the past three weeks, moving decisively below $50 a barrel and forcing investors to reassess whether supply and demand will reach a more balanced state that can support higher prices.Earlier this year, analysts and traders had projected cutbacks from global exporters would clean up a supply glut and raise prices. Their confidence held up for the first months of 2017, when oil was comfortably ensconced in a range between $50 a barrel and $55.But crude prices have fallen 15% since the start of the year, as U.S. producers rushed to fill the gap left by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Major selloffs have become almost routine\u2014with four one-day drops of more than 4.5% since March.Crude prices rose 19 cents on Friday but dropped 3.8% this past week.Coming into the year, \u201cwe had a strong view that prices were going to rally,\u201d said Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. But around March, she said, her view started to shift. U.S. producers were ramping up more quickly than anyone expected. Expectations for strong demand growth were dimming. The bloated storage levels that OPEC aimed to drain remained full.Now, Ms. Kemery expects prices to be even lower in 2018 than today, unless OPEC takes more drastic action. \u201cThe OPEC cut\u2014it\u2019s almost like we need it just to stand still,\u201d Ms. Kemery said.And standing still may be difficult. OPEC and other major producers, including Russia, announced last month that they would continue their output cut of 1.8 million barrels a day through the first quarter of next year. Prices dropped sharply that day and have only continued to slide, reflecting disappointment among investors who had hoped that the group would agree to even deeper cuts or would articulate a strategy on ending cuts next year that would avoid flooding the market again.Without those assurances, investors have become increasingly jittery, heading for the exits at any sign that global stockpiles aren\u2019t shrinking. U.S. crude prices have languished below $50 since.When government data showed this week that the amount of oil in U.S. storage tanks increased for the first time in nine weeks, crude prices fell more than 5% Wednesday.\u201cPeople are starting to doubt it now. They look at the cuts and say, \u2018Who cares?\u2019 \u201d said Ernest Scalamandre, managing member at AC Investment Management LLC, which manages about $750 million in assets, primarily investments in commodity hedge funds.U.S. production has also come back more quickly than many anticipated. The number of rigs punching new wells in U.S. oilfields has climbed for 21 straight weeks. Some analysts now predict that U.S. output will end the year as much as 1 million barrels a day higher. That\u2019s a stark change from late last year year when banks such as             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch were expecting U.S. output to rise more modestly, by some 660,000 barrels a day by the fourth quarter. Bank of America now expects U.S. shale output to rise by 800,000 barrels a day during the same period.Some were expecting that shale-oil producers would be constrained by rising costs, such as hiring back workers who were laid off and expenses tied to repairing neglected equipment. Meanwhile, such companies as             Halliburton Co.       and             Schlumberger Ltd.       that do the work of drilling and fracking wells slashed prices in the two-year downturn and have been looking for opportunities to raise them.But these factors don\u2019t seem to be holding producers back, especially in places like west Texas\u2019s Permian basin.\u201cPeople generally know where it is. Once prices are at levels that can support the expense of actually drilling the well and getting the rig and starting production, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said       Jason Thomas,        director of research at the             Carlyle Group.Some say that the market has become irrationally negative. They say that investors are ignoring signs that the glut is eroding\u2014pointing to eight straight weeks of declining stockpiles prior to the surprise increase reported this week. If oil prices do drop significantly below $45, even the most resilient U.S. producers could struggle to be profitable.\u201cIt might just be a knee-jerk reaction,\u201d said John Groton, director of equity research at Thrivent Financial. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a view on where marginal costs need to go and where OPEC countries need prices to be. That number does not start with a 4.\u201dStill, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. At the beginning of the year, analysts said OPEC\u2019s agreement to cut production would cause oil supplies to tighten quickly. OPEC and shale producers looked like they had found a way to peacefully coexist after years of battling for market share.Now they are back to being locked in a stare-down and nobody is blinking.Even with prices down this year, U.S. oil producers appear committed to the growth they budgeted for going into the year, said Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Executives at the bank\u2019s energy conference in New York this week said they had locked in high enough prices for their output in the futures market, and that their balance sheets were healthy enough to weather U.S. oil prices between $45 and $50, Mr. Hanold said.That isn\u2019t a happy story for investors. Energy companies are the S&P 500\u2019s worst performers this year. Shares are down 12.3% in 2017, one of only two sectors in the red while the broader index has gained 8.6%. Telecommunications companies are down 9.45% this year.\u201cSentiment is now to the point where it seems like many are ready to give up,\u201d Mr. Hanold said.Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Oil Investors\u2019 Early Faith In a Rally Begins to Wane.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-oil-investors-early-faith-in-a-rally-begins-to-wane-1497048280", "news_title": "For Oil Investors, Early Faith in a Rally Begins to Wane ", "keywords": "crude prices,halliburton,oil markets,oil prices,opec,schlumberger,J.P.

But shortly after that announcement, Mr. Trump publicly criticized Qatar, accusing its leaders of funding terrorism at \u201ca very high level.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Egypt and their Arab allies on Monday cut diplomatic ties with Qatar as well as closed their land borders and sea and air routes with the gas-rich Persian Gulf country. These Arab states charge Qatar\u2019s monarchs of providing funding for terrorist organizations in the region and promoting extremism through its Al Jazeera television network. Qatar has denied these charges.The mixed messages out of Washington confused Arab and European officials. But Qatar\u2019s foes jumped on Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to back up their actions.\u201cThe U.A.E. welcomes President Trump\u2019s leadership in challenging Qatar\u2019s troubling support for extremism,\u201d Abu Dhabi\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Al Otaiba, said Friday. \u201cThe next step is for Qatar to acknowledge these concerns and commit to re-examine its regional policies. This will provide the necessary basis for any discussions.\u201dMr. Trump said in the Rose Garden: \u201cThe nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\u201dWhite House officials said that in a string of phone calls with Arab leaders this week, Mr. Trump recognized the need for Qatar to be pressured to end any support for extremist groups. He also said this pressure shouldn\u2019t cause humanitarian problems for the people of Qatar, who are almost wholly dependent on food imports.Mr. Tillerson\u200b earlier on Friday said the embargo on Qatar, which hosts a large U.S. military base, was beginning to interfere in a U.S.-led military campaign against the terrorist organization, Islamic State.\u201cThe blockade is hindering U.S. military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department. He said the blockade presented humanitarian challenges and harmed American business interests in the Persian Gulf.\u200bThe Pentagon said afterward that the blockade could affect the coalition\u2019s ability to make long-term plans but hasn\u2019t harmed any current operations.Qatar is home to Al Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military base in the region.Senior Arab officials said they didn\u2019t believe Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. would heed Mr. Tillerson\u2019s request to reduce their economic pressure on Qatar. They would, however, make sure supplies made their way to Al Udeid.Qatar, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a key ally of Washington\u2019s in its efforts to constrain both Islamic State and Iran.Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. backs a formal mediation between the countries, which is being led by the emir of Kuwait. The chief U.S. diplomat tried to evenly cast blame on the countries for the crisis days after Mr. Trump weighed in publicly against Qatar, and then repeated that assessment again Friday.Mr. Trump on Friday said he called on all nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism, though declined to name other countries.\u200bMr. Tillerson also urged Qatar to be \u201cresponsive to the concerns of its neighbors\u201d and said all sides should cease escalating tensions further.He said Qatar has made progress in halting financial support to terrorist groups as well as expelling terrorist groups from the country, but said the country\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani \u201cmust do more quickly.\u201dSaudi Arabia, U.A.E. and their allies have been drawing up demands Qatar must meet to return to normal diplomatic and economic relations, including steps to significantly scale back the Al Jazeera media network. They are also seeking guarantees that Qatar\u2019s government will stop its alleged financing of Middle East extremist groups and sever relations with the political leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, a global Islamist movement.Mr. Trump has talked to the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. in recent days in a bid to ease the crisis, said senior U.S. officials.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus and Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Sends Mixed Signals on Qatar.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 18:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/secretary-of-state-tillerson-calls-on-arab-states-to-ease-blockade-on-qatar-1497033926", "news_title": "Trump Administration Sends Mixed Signals on Qatar Crisis ", "keywords": "conflict,qatar,saudi,tillerson,U.S. State Department,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       on Friday disputed his former Federal Bureau of Investigation director\u2019s statements about their conversation regarding the agency\u2019s probe of former National Security Adviser       Mike Flynn,        laying the groundwork for a potential legal clash that could have far-reaching consequences.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, a day after former FBI Director       James Comey       testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had urged him to ease off the agency\u2019s probe of Mr. Flynn, Mr. Trump said he would be willing to similarly testify under oath that he didn\u2019t do so.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I will tell you I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. \u201cAnd there\u2019d be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everything I\u2019ve read today.\u201d He said he would be \u201c100%\u201d willing to testify under oath to that effect and that he would also consent to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were part of a broader counterattack launched Friday by the president and his allies against Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.The president broke his Twitter silence Friday to call that testimony a \u201ctotal and complete vindication\u201d of him on the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation because Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t under personal investigation. His allies also sought to raise questions about Mr. Comey\u2019s credibility.Mr. Trump\u2019s private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, plans to file a complaint early next week with the Justice Department inspector general and to send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, a person close to the president\u2019s legal team said, following Mr. Comey\u2019s acknowledgment Thursday that he passed his notes about his conversations with the president to a friend after his firing and authorized that friend to release them to a reporter.But the intensifying showdown between Mr. Comey and Mr. Trump carries steep risks as it is providing new leads for the investigators inside the FBI and on Capitol Hill.The House Intelligence Committee on Friday asked the White House counsel to detail whether any tapes existed of conversations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey in the White House\u2014something that Mr. Trump alleged in a tweet earlier this year.White House press secretary       Sean Spicer,        asked when the president might comment on whether tapes exist, shook his head and said: \u201cWhen he\u2019s ready.\u201dAt the news conference, Mr. Trump said he would comment in the \u201cnear future\u201d on the existence of any recordings of his private conversations.Pressed whether he was hinting that there were in fact tapes, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cI\u2019m not hinting anything. I\u2019ll tell you about it over a very short period of time.\u201d He added: \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don\u2019t worry.\u201dMr. Comey said in his testimony Thursday, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201dThe House Intelligence Committee asked Mr. Comey in a Friday letter to turn over any notes or memorandums concerning his discussions with the president. A bipartisan group of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee also asked Columbia University professor Daniel Richman to turn over any copies of memos in his possession. Mr. Comey testified this week that he gave his memos to a friend, who was later identified as Mr. Richman, as a way to leak them to the media.And       Jared Kushner,        a senior White House adviser and the president\u2019s son-in-law, is expected to meet privately with Senate Intelligence Committee staff this summer to answer questions related to the committee\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a White House official said Friday.Mr. Kushner is in talks with the committee about a specific date, the official said.The stream of new developments and the president\u2019s denials and comments only heightened attention on the investigation that White House aides have been trying to drive out of the headlines.The Rose Garden event was intended to showcase Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Europe, which the president did, but that theme was smothered by the discussion about the Russia probe.In addition to denying any attempt to block the Flynn investigation, Mr. Trump also said he hadn\u2019t told Mr. Comey that he expected his loyalty, as the former FBI director testified Thursday. \u201cI hardly know the man. I\u2019m not going to say, \u2018I want you to pledge allegiance,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt hardly makes sense.\u201dMr. Trump also reiterated comments he made on             Twitter                   earlier Friday that Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony had \u201cvindicated\u201d him, saying it showed that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between him and Russia and \u201cno obstruction.\u201d He added: \u201cJames Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren\u2019t true.\u201dIn his testimony, Mr. Comey confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that he had, during his time as FBI director, told the president he wasn\u2019t personally the subject of the FBI investigation. However, he said that knowledge extended only to May 9, the day the president fired him.Lawyers and members of Congress have expressed skepticism that Mr. Comey, now a private citizen, could be prosecuted for leaking. Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), asked about the prospect on Thursday, said of Mr. Comey: \u201cOnce you\u2019re no longer working for the government, I mean, I suspect that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201dJohn Dean, former White House counsel under President       Richard Nixon,        said in a CNN interview Thursday that there are no restrictions on private citizens discussing meetings they have held with the president.Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction reflects the mixed nature of Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony. Mr. Comey made clear that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t a target of the Russia probe, backing Mr. Trump\u2019s statements to that effect. But Mr. Comey also recounted several occasions where he said he felt Mr. Trump was trying to pressure him on the investigation or threaten his independence.In his testimony, Mr. Comey declined to offer his opinion on whether he thought Mr. Trump was trying to obstruct justice, but he said that issue is something that the recently appointed special counsel would examine.Mr. Comey\u2019s public testimony lasted more than 2 1/2 hours and allowed the former FBI chief to speak publicly on a range of topics surrounding his interactions with the president, including his decision to document all conversations with the president because he believed Mr. Trump \u201cmight lie\u201d about them later.Thursday\u2019s hearing made clear Mr. Comey believed the president had actively tried to influence the course of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Mr. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, who was forced to resign after making false statements about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But because the most damning accounts involved one-on-one encounters with the president\u2014and Mr. Trump disputes Mr. Comey\u2019s version\u2014investigators face a challenge as they examine the matter.\u201cIt\u2019s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,\u201d Mr. Comey said.Following his remarks in the Rose Garden Friday, Mr. Trump boarded Marine One to head to his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend, ignoring shouted questions about the alleged Oval Office tapes.\u2014Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Carol E.

Responding to a newly adventurous Saudi foreign policy, Mr. Trump has abandoned America\u2019s historic practice of tamping down tensions in the Middle East and lined up behind Iran\u2019s main rivals, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies. But there are dangers in this shift, which threatens to destabilize the region, worsen sectarian rifts and drag the U.S. further into futile fights.On Mr. Trump\u2019s recent trip to the Middle East, he signaled unqualified support for Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab friends in their rivalry with Iran, the region\u2019s Shiite power. The longtime competition between the two big Muslim powers has intensified since civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, pitting that now-wrecked country\u2019s Iranian-backed regime against a Sunni majority. In Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in Riyadh, he blamed Iran \u201cfor so much instability in the region.\u201dThe president waded in deeper this week, threatening to end the longstanding U.S. partnership with Qatar (the lone Gulf Arab state with significant ties to Iran) and issuing a White House statement strikingly lacking in empathy after Islamic State claimed credit for a double terrorist attack in Tehran\u2014a departure from Washington\u2019s practice of condemning terrorism no matter the victim. Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent criticisms of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and his support for more U.S. sanctions against Tehran suggest that the White House is now adopting a more hostile posture than previous administrations.All of this amounts to a perilous change of course. The U.S. has been a staunch Saudi ally since 1945 and an implacable foe of Iran since its 1979 revolution, but under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the longstanding policy has been to avoid fanning Sunni-Shiite strains and inflaming regional tensions.The consequences of Mr. Trump\u2019s new tilt were on stark display this week. For decades, Saudi Arabia has had a tense relationship with its wealthy, activist neighbor Qatar, but the dramatic severing of diplomatic ties with Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others was a jolt to the region. Most see the breach as having been sparked partly by Qatar\u2019s amicable ties with Iran\u2014and having at least the tacit support of Mr. Trump, who tweeted critically of Qatar on Tuesday. U.S. diplomats are now scrambling to patch things up, not least because Qatar hosts more than 10,000 U.S. service members at the main American base in the region.It is no surprise that Mr. Trump is seeking to improve ties with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arabs, who complained endlessly about President       Barack Obama\u2019s       supposed fecklessness and slant toward Iran. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in particular are longtime U.S. partners, with close intelligence relationships that are essential for combating terrorism.But Saudi and Emirati interests are not necessarily identical with those of the U.S. The Saudis and the Emiratis, for example, are both cool to the Iran nuclear deal, even though most members of the American and Israeli security establishments have come to see it as a significant boost for regional stability.The heightened tensions may push the Iranians to abandon the agreement. If Iran were to do that and resume its race to acquire a nuclear option, the U.S. could soon face difficult choices, including the possibility of a bombing campaign to deal with the threat. Few Americans, least of all Trump voters, are ready for such further misadventures in the Middle East.Mr. Trump\u2019s uncritical embrace of the Saudis will also worsen another major problem. The U.S. is already too closely tied to the Saudi quagmire in Yemen, an unsuccessful intervention in a civil war that has caused widespread suffering and chaos. The Saudis\u2019 escalation helped to create conditions in which al Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, probably the most capable of all al Qaeda branches, has grown dramatically.The Saudis have made a Vietnam-like blunder, seeing Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels as stalking horses for Iran rather than acknowledging that internal political jockeying has been the main driver of the Yemeni conflict. Iran has supplied the Houthis with some arms, but mostly to tie down Saudi forces; the U.S. has given the Saudis weapons and intelligence. Instead of plunging further in, we should be persuading the Saudis to cut their losses.Another reason for Mr. Trump to reconsider his shift is that Iran may be changing. The recent reelection of President       Hassan Rouhani       was a sharp setback for the country\u2019s hard-line ayatollahs. Mr. Rouhani is no Jeffersonian democrat and has done ruthless things in his career, but he is also a pragmatist and advocate of reform, economic growth and re-engagement with the outside world. His conservative opponent, Ebrahim Raisi, was roundly rejected at the ballot box, and the clerical establishment didn\u2019t dare to falsify the outcome, as it has done before. Iran-watchers took note of YouTube videos of postelection celebrations with hitherto forbidden music and dancing in such hard-line strongholds as the northeastern city of Mashhad.Given the possibility of reform in Iran, the U.S. needs to think strategically about the country\u2019s future once its repressive, ailing, 77-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah       Ali Khamenei,        leaves the scene. Such hopes have been disappointed before, but this time reformers may well have a chance to alter the country\u2019s course.While the U.S. continues to fulfill its alliance responsibilities to the Saudis, it should also be a steadying hand in the region. Though we should never give the Iranians a pass on bad behavior\u2014supporting anti-Israel terrorism, arming Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, backing the murderous Syrian regime of       Bashar al-Assad      \u2014we also should avoid playing into the hands of Iran\u2019s hard-line clerics by disrupting the re-engagement with the global economy that the reformers are banking on.The Iranians are the source of many evils in the Middle East but hardly all of them. There are few governments in the region for the U.S. to admire or support uncritically\u2014and that definitely includes the Saudis, despite the assiduous courting of Mr. Trump by the young Saudi deputy crown prince,       Mohammed bin Salman.As the clash with our longtime partner Qatar shows, things in the Middle East can fall apart fast. That hardly means that the U.S. should be evenhanded between Iran and Saudi Arabia: We have a 70-year partnership with the Saudis and will continue to need their oil, intelligence cooperation and financial investments. But Mr. Trump should insist on a policy that puts American interests first.\u2014Mr. Benjamin, the State Department\u2019s coordinator for counterterrorism from 2009-12, is director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College.

The Reg A+ provision allows companies to raise up to $50 million by pitching their IPOs to all investors\u2014not just those with a certain net worth or income\u2014in shortcut deals that require less regulatory paperwork than a traditional IPO.Myomo\u2019s IPO is an encouraging sign for small companies trying to go public via Reg A+. But the amount Myomo raised fell short of the $15 million it targeted in a regulatory filing when it launched its offering, highlighting the challenges these small companies face in raising money in public markets. Last year, 18 companies completed IPOs in which each raised less than $50 million, according to Dealogic, compared with 557 such deals in 1996.Reg A+ removes some hurdles and regulatory requirements for small companies aiming to raise money and list shares, but that has the potential to open up investors to more risk, some analysts say.So far only one company,             Elio Motors Inc.,       has listed shares via Reg A+.

It seems that not one of his four children who attend local public schools had heard a single word about D-Day. Tuesday was the 73rd anniversary of the Allied landings at Normandy that began the liberation of Europe. Unfortunately, the experience of his family is hardly unique.According to the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a full 30% of recent college graduates don\u2019t know that D-Day occurred during World War II. Looking at U.S. history in general, the most recent results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2014 found that just 18% of U.S. eighth-graders were graded as \u201cproficient\u201d or above.While professional educators certainly deserve much of the blame, the journalistic profession could also do better. To its credit, yesterday the Las Vegas Review-Journal published the following letter from reader Donald Anderson:Mr. Anderson could just as easily have sent an even stronger complaint to your humble correspondent. Lacking an Almanac section, this column failed entirely to mention the anniversary. Fortunately readers compensated for your correspondent\u2019s oversight by appropriately marking the occasion in the comments section.As for the news blackout that seems to have occurred in certain schools on Tuesday, the possible silver lining there is that a contemporary progressive educator\u2019s rendering of World War II might leave parents wishing for complete silence on the subject.In any case, this job seems to have fallen to non-professional educators, and perhaps a good place to start is by encouraging the youngsters in our households to see what they can learn about the two men pictured at the top of this page. They served as combat medics attached to Easy Company, 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division during World War II. The group is better known as the 'Band of Brothers' of book and television fame.Speaking of the Army, this week the service tells the story of several D-Day veterans who gathered to share their experiences:Further east from where Mr. Zeitchik came ashore was the furious fighting at Omaha Beach. That\u2019s where then-Pvt. Arnald Gabriel waded ashore in water that was surprisingly cold, even in June. \u201cWith the Air Force overhead, the Navy shelling [enemy positions], the enemy firing at you and we\u2019re firing at them, it was just total chaos,\u201d he recalls. The memories would haunt him, according to the Army:Students wishing to understand D-Day might also wish to read or view the two remarkable speeches that President Reagan gave on the 40th anniversary in 1984.

It was a high-water mark for public optimism regarding the prospects for the unconditional surrender of Japan and the return, at last, of peace.That month, a U.S. government bureau forecast that an economy shackled by the restrictions of war production would make a smooth transition to normalcy. Although unpopular controls such as the curfew on nightclubs and bans on horse racing would soon be lifted, industrialists and labor unions alike were pushing back against the Army\u2019s voracious needs and the government\u2019s far-reaching management of the economy. President       Harry Truman       dared hope that Japan could be forced to quit before the home front finally turned on him, imperiling the yearslong struggle to defeat Japan on terms set long ago by       Franklin D. Roosevelt       and his Joint Chiefs of Staff.Then Germany surrendered, and the Japanese emperor\u2019s Okinawa garrison showed its teeth. Those two developments threatened to change everything.This startling, nearly forgotten story is well documented in \u201cImplacable Foes,\u201d a valuable and revealing study by       Waldo Heinrichs       and       Marc Gallicchio,        historians at San Diego State and Villanova, respectively. The authors remind us how public weariness with the war and the difficulty of redeploying armies world-wide for a reckoning with Tokyo imperiled Truman\u2019s plan to defeat Japan and avoid the type of economic disruptions that tested the nation after World War I.Though the military campaigns carried out by the forces under Gen.       Douglas MacArthur       and Adm.       Chester Nimitz       from February 1944 forward are covered in this book, those oft-told tales are not the main event. The authors\u2019 major contribution lies in bringing to life the turmoil of a home front \u201cgoing sour,\u201d as Secretary of War       Henry Stimson       put it, which pushed the finale of the Pacific campaign toward the precipice of possible failure or abandonment. Though that outcome was never in actual view, war planners did fear, as casualties mounted, what the authors call \u201ca public psychology of complacency, slackening effort, and a drift of labor away from war work.\u201d The special military advisor to the president, Adm.       William D. Leahy,        believed that at some point the clamor to bring the boys home could become irresistible.From day one, Iwo Jima was a meat grinder. In late 1944 the volcanic isle had been so lightly defended that it could have been taken by a regiment. But by D-Day, Feb. 19, 1945, it had become a hive of stone. The Marines suffered more than 25,000 casualties in taking it. Though MacArthur used his well-cultivated relationships in the press to lobby otherwise, his own campaigns were equally costly.That winter, MacArthur\u2019s army in the Philippines was in the grip of crisis. The 32nd Division, having served there since November 1944, teetered at half-strength. By June, the larger Sixth Army\u2019s \u201cnon-battle\u201d losses from fatigue and illness would surpass its combat casualties, more than 93,000 overall. Said a veteran sergeant, \u201cHow much of this is flesh and blood expected to stand?\u201dIn Washington, political leaders were having similar concerns. It was not at all clear that the climactic invasion of Japan could be successfully staged. High casualties made it critical to sustain an influx of replacement troops, but the shortage became acute as MacArthur prepared to liberate Manila. The Army was surging newly trained soldiers to Europe to replace losses suffered in the Ardennes. The Battle of the Bulge dented the order of battle drawn up for the invasion of Japan as deeply as the campaigns in the western Pacific did.It may seem counterintuitive, but victory in Europe did no favors to commanders looking to drive the costly effort against Japan. After V-E Day, Army Chief of Staff Gen.       George Marshall       was alive to the need to crush Tokyo swiftly, for delay threatened the essential perishable commodities of momentum and national morale. But maintaining a fast pace exhausted soldiers, and the losses they suffered tended to dampen domestic political support.By Waldo Heinrichs and Marc GallicchioOxford, 711 pages, $34.95Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.The battle for Okinawa turned for the worse shortly after the first reports of unopposed landings hit the papers. It was secured in June for a price of more than 49,000 U.S. killed, missing and wounded, a 35% casualty rate. On June 18, Truman approved Operation Olympic, as the landings in Kyushu (Japan\u2019s southern-most home island) were known, and implicitly rejected the strategy of prolonged blockade and siege. At the same time, the political pressure to discharge veteran troops after V-E Day finally had its effect. Marshall developed a plan to bring some of the boys home.A points system determined eligibility for discharge. As it was going into effect, another complex scheme was under way to redeploy three million troops from Europe to the Pacific to undertake the second phase of the invasion of Japan. With experienced troops going home, units were bled of critical know-how just as they were arraying for another massive task. A shipping shortage helped produce what Marshall would call \u201cthe greatest administrative and logistical problem in the history of the world.\u201d The massive movement of troops over three continents, the authors note, relied on \u201ca Rube Goldberg\u2013like system of ships, planes and trains crisscrossing the globe, operating on tight schedules with almost no allowance for delay.\u201d The system teetered under the combined weight of war and peace. Manila was a mess, so thoroughly destroyed by its Japanese occupiers during the vicious fight for its liberation that its harbor could not unload at the rate that the timetables required. Running a war from the midst of this ruin, MacArthur hoarded cargo ships in the Philippines for use as floating warehouses. Postponements spilled through the schedule of operations, giving Japan the gift of time in which to reinforce.\u201cBy early August, the Army\u2019s plans were strained to the breaking point,\u201d Messrs. Heinrichs and Gallicchio write. On Aug. 4, as Adms.       Ernest King       and Nimitz discussed their doubts about the feasibility of invading Kyushu, the Joint War Plans Committee recommended a re-examination of the objectives. Day by day, Tokyo\u2019s strategy of bleeding America to the bargaining table seemed to become more plausible.The authors have profitably plumbed official correspondence, studies of logistics and industrial policy, congressional records, and daily journalism to track the public mood and trace its effect on the way in which the final act of the war was planned, staged and fought. \u201cImplacable Foes\u201d is stronger on plans and policy than on combat operations and covers the Army more authoritatively than the Navy. But its novelty and freshness emerges in the interstices of the actual fighting. For readers familiar with the military campaigns, the book is essential reading for its lucid treatment of the pressures that imperiled critical operations in a truly global war.As the tale proceeds to the familiar end, two heroes emerge. One is George Marshall. The native of Uniontown, Pa., graduated from Virginia Military Institute in 1901 in time to serve notably in World War I. As Army chief of staff he had a \u201cpowerful and perpetually inquisitive mind and an awareness beyond the garrison, of things in time, changing and unchanging. His soldierly skills operated within this worldly context,\u201d the authors write. He was alive both to domestic politics and to the war\u2019s needs and respected the principle of civilian authority during wartime. His temper remained a servant to his pragmatism. Though he stood aghast when MacArthur dallied self-indulgently in the Philippines, clearing southern areas at a time when prudence required a shift of resources toward Japan, Marshall tolerated the strategy because it promised to open badly needed ports. He acquiesced to the rickety divided command setup between MacArthur and Nimitz because it kept American forces moving west in a way that impressed a fickle public and promised the quickest end to the fighting. George Marshall was the adult in the room at all times.The other hero is Truman. War\u2019s end, through his administration\u2019s careful work, produced \u201cno sudden shock to the system, in large part because there would be a gradual drawdown in forces matched by equally measured cutbacks in procurement,\u201d the authors observe. A well-managed transition to peace became possible because of the competence of his administration\u2019s planners and bureaucrats\u2014and no small amount of political courage from the commander in chief. Gallup polls showed that more than 60% of Americans wanted to try       Hirohito       for war crimes (though few even knew the emperor\u2019s name), and old hands at the State Department such as       Dean Acheson       and       Cordell Hull       regarded leaving him in power as a form of appeasement. But to achieve peace, Truman dared to preserve him on the throne.The contribution of this vital book is its portrait of history as lived desperately in the moment; of the varied troubles that beset planners and commanders in the war\u2019s horrific last year; and of the mettle and vision of an American president whom history should underrate no longer. \u201cImplacable Foes\u201d shows war operations as a human ordeal even at the highest level, fueled by the exhaustible human spirit.In the heat of August, salvation came from on high, when the Fat Man\u2019s core of enriched plutonium compressed over Nagasaki just as Dr. Oppenheimer intended, ending the calamity of the war in a flash. Afterward, Japan, like Western Europe, did not turn communist. The void created by its collapse was filled partly by Chinese and Soviet communism but also by robust American power, deployed forward for decades and even to this day, in the land of the Rising Sun. By defying the polls, Truman secured a very conditional surrender, delivering victory fast enough to bring a winnable peace.\u2014Mr. Hornfischer is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Fleet at Flood Tide: America at Total War in the Pacific, 1944\u20131945.\u201dAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Endgame in the Paci\ufb01c.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/endgame-in-the-pacific-1497043755", "news_title": "Endgame in the Pacific", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,national,public security,arts,entertainment,risk news,reviews"}, {"content": "A student of mine once had a character say, \u201cI always thought of sex as a hot meaty thing, not something all frippered up with talk.\u201d The line struck me as what I have heard called in boxing \u201ca perfect opinion.\u201d I like it so much I believe I may have used it elsewhere, I hope giving the author, Kimberly Palmer, credit. I lost touch with Ms. Palmer or I\u2019d have offered her $20 for it, my going rate for one-line appropriations.To transfer the aptness of Ms. Palmer\u2019s character\u2019s observation from sex to food does not require labor. Often hot, often meaty, sometimes not hot, sometimes not meaty, food, one would think, does not want frippering up with talk. But a frippering up it gets, buddyro. It gets more frippering up with talk, and with writing, that is to say food writing, and writing about food writing\u2014we might say food writing to the second power\u2014food gets more frippering up with talk than we ever thought about frippering up sex, half of literature, most of Hollywood and all of the porn industry notwithstanding. Food writing and food-writing writing is pandemic (sourced globally, in food-writing parlance) and arrives constantly. This spring, a friend, hearing I was headed to South Carolina, sent me       Lauren Collins\u2019s       recent Letter From South Carolina in the New Yorker, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Political Food,\u201d which turns out to be barbecue. Ms. Collins writes about another food writer, food editor       Kathleen Purvis,        who pitches yet another editor a food-piece idea: \u201cMen are the new carpetbaggers of Southern food writing.\u201d The pitched editor accepts the pitch. \u201cThe resulting essay argues,\u201d Ms. Collins reports of Ms. Purvis\u2019s piece, \u201cthat \u2018the Southern food-writing world has been unduly influenced, usurped, yes, even invaded, by a barbecue-entranced, bourbon-preoccupied and pork belly-obsessed horde of mostly testosterone-fueled scribes,\u2019 who dwell on hackneyed tales of Southern eccentricity without developing \u2018the clear-eyed vision\u2019 to see them in a contemporary light. The piece generated controversy, though not as much as Purvis\u2019s investigation into the racial dimensions of the practice of putting sugar in corn bread. \u2018Honest to God, I really hate that hokey-jokey Hey-us-Southerners-aren\u2019t-we-cute stuff,\u2019 she told me. \u2018I\u2019ve always said that my beat is food and the meaning of life.\u2019 \u201d I hear in Ms. Purvis\u2019s \u201cmy beat is food and the meaning of life\u201d something encouragingly close to, or at least not discouragingly far from, Ms. Palmer\u2019s hot meaty thing not all frippered up with talk. Hold this thought.Within days of getting this Letter From South Carolina, a letter from Mississippi comes in over the email transom. It is from the Southern Foodways Alliance, run by       John T. Edge       (with       Catarina Passidomo,        Professor of Foodways at Ole Miss):By John T. EdgePenguin Press, 370 pages, $28Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.Through May 5, we are accepting proposals for papers, multimedia projects, and short documentaries that engage with the broad topic of social justice through the lens of Southern foodways or agriculture. We invite graduate students from a range of disciplines to exchange knowledge, experience, and scholarship in a constructive and synergistic environment that has garnered praise from past participants:\u201cI was most struck by the tone set right away by the conference hosts. Dr. Passidomo and Mr. Edge established immediately a truly welcoming and collaborative community within which grad students could feel at ease and able to communicate with their hosts and with one another organically.\u201d\u201cThis was a supremely well organized and orchestrated conference that was perfectly designed to provide graduate students with the opportunity to share their research and network with peers within a warm, mentoring, and intellectually invested organization.\u201dI hear food in Foodways, but then what one sees is social justice, synergistic environment, welcoming community, organic communicating and warm mentoring, intellectually invested. I do not think Ms. Palmer\u2019s character was capable of so adroit a condensing of what might constitute the quintessential frippering up of food.Within hours of these two letters I heard a British voice on NPR say that barbecue once connoted cannibalism and then \u201call forms of racism.\u201d I don\u2019t know it but I am fully primed to receive John T. Edge\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Potlikker Papers: A Food History of the Modern South.\u201d Which is to say, I am apprehending what a wrong audience I am for food writing to the 10th power. The titular Potlikker Papers refers to an exchange among       Julian Harris       and       Huey Long       and       Franklin Delano Roosevelt       that in 1931 inspired a national debate as to whether corn bread should be crumbled in pot liquor or dunked.When I met John T. Edge I thought people were calling him Jaunty, because he is. Thinking him a food writer to the first power, I gave him a tip on the best barbecue place in South Carolina, because this is what barbecue people always must do (know the best, loudly assert it). The next time I met him it was apparent he had not checked out Cain\u2019s in Florence, and I thought less of Jaunty Edge. The next time I met him I had been back to Cain\u2019s myself after 20 years\u2019 absence and found it in decline and had a respect for Jaunty Edge\u2019s not hewing to the whim of every barbecue idiot on Earth. What was almost coming into focus was that he had not gone not because he had the sense to eschew the advice of idiots but because he was not a food writer to the first power. \u201cThe Potlikker Papers\u201d in hand tells you this right away and undoes the huge na\u00efvet\u00e9 of thinking its author a food writer.To disabuse myself of other delusions, I asked my informant in Oxford, Miss., where Mr. Edge lives, about the Jaunty. Good Southerners operate by having good informants, and Oxford is a ground-zero. \u201cyes, he goes by the cute name of John T. he\u2019s a good guy who works on a lot of good causes around here, and works tirelessly at this food stuff. has a little fyce named Lurleen, who recently wore a feathered boa in our Gay Pride Parade. has a poet wife. and a son. all nice ppl and more importantly around here, white democrats.\u201d As       Trump       might write: Valuable! Mr. Edge is cutting-edge political (\u201con the right side of history\u201d in the lovely inane popular phrase), and his bag is \u201cfood stuff.\u201d \u201cStuff\u201d contains in one unfrippered word the whole idea: Mr. Edge is writing about the political world\u2014and people in the political world, whether they are protesting or acquiescing, winning or being beaten down, are eating. If something has happened on the plain of history, specifically Southern U.S. history in roughly the last 60 years, though these limits feel false, and food has been even tangential to the moment\u2014we might say if there is a redolence of food, large (means of production) or small (Georgia Gilmore\u2019s pork chops given       Martin Luther King       at a Montgomery table planning the boycotting of buses)\u2014John T. Edge has either heard about it, read about it, or been there. It\u2019s impressive. \u201cWorks tirelessly at this food stuff\u201d comically understates the matter. One thinks of       Calvin Trillin,        whom Mr. Edge calls a \u201ccultural spelunker,\u201d calmly and wisely and wittily working a cave while Mr. Edge rides historical miles and miles, like a cavalry officer with the slight air of a jaunty Musketeer, around the cave. He writes lyric passages of sweeping movement, abstractions constituting mythology, which is what this is, and smaller, nuggety moments of what happened and where the food was and what the food was when it happened. The infrastructure to this history is not the means of production, it\u2019s what people ate. It\u2019s what they ate beginning in the civil-rights bootstrapping of the 1950s through the back-to-the-land hippie communing of the \u201970s into what Mr. Edge calls Gentrification and New Respect (apotheosizing grits and elevating cooks to artisans) and into what is happening now, the latest New South, appropriately called Nuevo Sud.My idea of an acceptable level of frippering up food with talk, before I saw the vision of Mr. Edge, was       Julia Child       and       Jacques P\u00e9pin\u2019s       snipping at each other over white versus black pepper. Julia, the American wanting to be properly French, calls for white pepper, as do the French, and Jacques, the Frenchman, calls for black pepper, wanting the thing to taste good, as do the French. You\u2019d not expect politics in Monsieur P\u00e9pin. Mr. Edge tells us that Jacques P\u00e9pin arriving in the U.S. discovered the serious chefs in America to be black, realized that they made the salient contributions to Creole cooking generally credited to only the French and Spanish, and was surprised that they were not celebrated. \u201cP\u00e9pin expected those black men to emerge as the stars, and was surprised when they did not ascend to the firmament during the American culinary renaissance of the late twentieth century. He didn\u2019t understand why they failed to get their due. As the years advanced and Southern food gentrified, his question would linger in the air, nagging and unresolved.\u201d       Jack Hitt,        rather suavely getting at the matter of food writing that is not food writing that I have by now so overwrought, says on the jacket, \u201cEdge\u2019s book means to be about food, but quickly veers into a close examination of the Deep South, before revealing itself as the smartest history of race in America in a generation.\u201dOne does not expect politics of Tennessee Williams either, but Mr. Edge finds him on the plain of history that is food, food that is history. Williams, culinarily speaking, was last seen so discombobulated by fame and fortune that he poured chocolate sauce, mistaking it for gravy, on his fancy-hotel room-service steak. And where does Mr. Edge find Tennessee Williams on the fruited plain of racial history? \u201cBreaking the color line\u201d by going to Dooky Chase\u2019s, the black restaurant that       Ray Charles       and       Lena Horne       and       Sarah Vaughan       visited. \u201cPlaywright Tennessee Williams,\u201d Mr. Edge tells us, \u201ctaxied down Orleans Avenue to eat lemon ice-box pie.\u201d Late in his career, and early too for that matter, Williams had a penchant for styling his plays after small, fond, found phrases, like \u201cSmall Craft Warnings.\u201d If he wrote one called \u201cLemon Ice-box Pie,\u201d yet undiscovered, Mr. Edge will be the first to find it.We\u2019ve been holding the thought, or we were instructed to hold it (though I confess I forgot to hold it my ownself, and I gave the instruction, way back up there in the early disquisition about food frippering), that \u201c \u2018the Southern food-writing world has been unduly influenced [by] testosterone-fueled scribes\u2019 who dwell on hackneyed tales of Southern eccentricity without developing \u2018the clear-eyed vision\u2019 to see them in a contemporary light.\u201d John T. Edge brings, indefatigably, the wanting clear-eyed, contemporary vision. He marched in the recent Oxford, Miss., gay-pride parade with his dog Lurleen, should that help us gauge his testosterone fueling.\u2014Mr. Powell\u2019s most recent book is \u201cCries for Help, Various,\u201d a collection of short stories.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/southern-fried-baloney-1497043707", "news_title": "Southern-Fried Baloney", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,recommended books,John T.

Mike Rapport\u2019s       \u201cThe Unruly City\u201d\u2014his account of the experiences of Paris, New York and London during the Revolutionary Era of the late 18th century\u2014runs the gamut. Throughout this highly readable book, the author interweaves the histories of the three cities from roughly the close of the Seven Years\u2019 War in 1763 through the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794, when the French Revolution turned against the Terror.Compared to their current incarnations, all three were small and relatively compact. Yet they remained very much cities, with all their closeness and density, and their fusing of politics and commerce and industry made them \u201cplaces of conflict\u201d and crucibles of revolution, in Mr. Rapport\u2019s telling.That said, there is an undeniable asymmetry in Mr. Rapport\u2019s scheme. Of the three cities, one, London, did not in fact undergo a revolution. Another, New York, was only briefly a capital, from 1785 to 1790. And though after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution it was the most populous city in America, New York\u2019s population was still not much over 30,000\u2014an order of magnitude smaller than either Paris or London. Moreover, its revolutionary significance was at least rivaled by Boston and Philadelphia. By contrast, neither Paris nor London faced any domestic competitors for their titles.By Mike RapportBasic, 363 pages, $32Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.Given the tenuousness of this overarching narrative, the individual chapters tend to stand or fall on their own merits. In his fifth chapter, \u201cLondon Burns,\u201d Mr. Rapport cleverly traces the ways that the colonial revolution in America reverberated back against the metropole, with British reformers both inspired by and disdainful of the rebellious colonists. That revolution\u2019s national significance had particularly uneasy implications for the British Isles ruled by a (German) Hanoverian crown.Mr. Rapport\u2019s accounts of the political and philosophical struggles in ancien r\u00e9gime France are also very good, in the vein of       Simon Schama\u2019s       magisterial \u201cCitizens\u201d (1989). He paints a deft portrait of Parlement (a judicial body, not a legislative one) and its ambiguous status as an agent of both progress and reaction, in one moment pushing back against the overweening ambition of an absolute monarchy, in the next upholding a gruesome capital punishment for the crime of blasphemy. Above all, Mr. Rapport homes in on what would become the central question in pre-Revolutionary France (and not only there): Who actually represents the people and the nation, the king or the magistrates?Other chapters do not justify themselves as well. While Mr. Rapport\u2019s depiction of the social and intellectual effects of the French Revolution on New York life is engaging, I\u2019m not sure he presents anything to match the drama of its impact on, say, the friendship of       John Adams       and       Thomas Jefferson.An old saw holds that political scientists can\u2019t write and historians can\u2019t think. Mr. Rapport can certainly do both, but one notes that the skillfulness of his fluid prose outclasses his conceptual scheme. He has an excellent eye for the arresting anecdote or apt quotation, as when describing the festivities that accompanied the arrival of the French warship Embuscade in New York Bay in 1793, which included a dockside crowd of New Yorkers \u201cbellowing out the Marseillaise and . . . greeting the French crew with tricolour cockades,\u201d or recording novelist       Daniel Defoe\u2019s       exclamations of horror at London\u2019s expansion during the 18th century.He also excels at literary portraiture, painting quick but vivid sketches of well-known figures from       Mary Wollstonecraft       to       Maximilien Robespierre.       But he is even better at bringing to light courageous lesser-known figures like       John Wilkes,        the London journalist, and the Scottish lawyer       Thomas Erskine,        who successfully defended radical reformers against charges of treason. And the dramatic set pieces mostly come to life; not just the obvious rousers like Paris during the Terror but smaller numbers like the pathetic fate of the pregnant wife of a London reformist, losing both her child and her life in the wake of a mob\u2019s assault. In these and other moments, Mr. Rapport makes good on his promise to record the \u201clived experience\u201d of those years.Near the outset of the book, he declares that the cities themselves will take center stage, even as they jostle with teeming humanity for the limelight. As the title would indicate, Mr. Rapport wants to demonstrate that revolution is in some crucial way a distinctly urban phenomenon. His book is too focused, however, to chase a macrohistorical thesis about the importance of cities, like       Lewis Mumford\u2019s       seminal \u201cThe City in History\u201d (1961). At the same time, it lacks the theoretical ambition of pathbreaking works like \u201cNature\u2019s Metropolis\u201d (1991),       William Cronon\u2019s       ecological history of Chicago, or       Saskia Sassen\u2019s       similarly named \u201cThe Global City\u201d (1991), which overlaps with two of Mr. Rapport\u2019s cities. Similarly, despite Mr. Rapport\u2019s occasional reference to the importance of \u201cspaces,\u201d the reader never quite gets a sense of the geography and topography of the three cities.Indeed, though the cities are hardly absent, with their wharves and markets and taverns, they never do quite take center stage. Mr. Rapport is simply too interested in particular humans, in all their messy, strutting individuality. Perhaps the title was the problem.

National security adviser Gen. H.R.

Last July, Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked the Baltic States, which are NATO members, he would decide whether to defend them only after reviewing \u201cif they have fulfilled their obligations to us.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly said NATO allies \u201cowed massive amounts of money\u201d for past years and that members don\u2019t pay their fair share in the alliance, which has set a goal for all members to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. The Obama administration similarly urged European member states to spend more on defense, but it didn\u2019t tie U.S. common-defense commitments to the payment issue.NATO has invoked Article 5 only one time in its history\u2014in defense of the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.On Friday, Mr. Trump thanked\u00a0NATO\u00a0allies and Romania for increasing their defense budgets and said the U.S.-Romania relationship was getting stronger.

The meetings followed a visit by U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       to Moscow in April.\u00a0Another meeting scheduled in Amman for this week was canceled because of scheduling conflicts, and a new date hasn\u2019t been set, a U.S. official said.\u200b\u200bThe talks signal a gambit by the White House to attempt some kind of cooperation with Moscow even as President Donald Trump is under fire for being too close to President       Vladimir Putin       of Russia, and investigators in the U.S. continue to probe alleged Russian interference in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election and possible connections between Trump associates and Russians. Russia has denied the allegation.The officials familiar with the talks said they are also threatened by continued tensions in southern Syria between the U.S. and forces allied with Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.       Russia has provided military support for the Syrian regime.The Pentagon has long opposed de-escalation zones because military officials are wary of coordinating with the Russians and fear that the costs of safeguarding the borders of the zones is costly and could significantly deepen the U.S. involvement in the conflict.But officials say they hope to find a way to work with Russia in destroying the Islamic State. If the de-escalation zone is successful, the U.S. and Russia would look to set up other sites, the people familiar with the situation said.Brett McGurk,        the U.S. special envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, and       Michael Ratney,        the U.S. special envoy for Syria, are leading the talks on the U.S. side.Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.A State Department official said the U.S. has \u201cnothing to announce regarding reports of discussions about southern Syria,\u201d but said the U.S. remains committed to a diplomatic solution in Syria. \u201cWe have long said there is no military solution to the crisis in Syria and have worked tirelessly to achieve a de-escalation of violence and a defeat of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorists.\u201dThe U.S. and its allies are operating out of a base near the Syrian town of Al Tanf near the Iraqi border, and after beefing up its forces in the area, the U.S. military has warned Mr. Assad and his allies to steer clear of the base and stay out of a 33-mile zone around the base.The U.S. has alerted the Russian government that it seeks to avoid mishaps in this area, but will take defensive action as needed. That includes the U.S. shooting down Thursday of a \u201cpro-regime\u201d drone which dropped a \u201cdud munition\u201d on forces the U.S. is working with inside the area. The coalition also hit two armored vehicles inside the area after they were being used in connection with pro-regime forces who were setting up a camp there.Pentagon officials insist the U.S. isn\u2019t seeking conflict with the Syrian regime or any of its backers, including Iran.\u201cWe are in Syria to defeat ISIS, full-stop,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Capt.       Jeff Davis.       \u201cAnything else we do there is in self-defense only. We do no seek conflict with the Syrian regime or these pro-regime militias or pro-Iranian proxy forces.\u201d\u200bSome officials familiar with the talks fear that recent flare-ups suggest that Russia cannot control its allies in the area, and that Iran may have some role in the fighting as well.\u00a0Capt. Davis said Russia has been \u201chelpful\u201d in trying to discourage regime and other forces operating in the area to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and prevent them from taking destabilizing actions like using the drone in the area.As the U.S. and Russia have deepened their involvement in Syria, both sides have maintained contact to avoid conflict between the battlefield elements, Pentagon officials have said. But previous diplomatic efforts have foundered at establishing de-escalation zones, including talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. The U.S. is skeptical of the success of the Turkey, Iran and Russia backed-discussions, which suggest de-escalation zones elsewhere in Syria, especially because of Iran\u2019s involvement in the talksMr. Tillerson is likely to face questions about efforts to work with Russia on Syria in budget testimony next week. The Senate is discussing toughened sanctions against Russia, which Mr. Tillerson asked senators to delay so the U.S. could try to work with Russia on Syria.\u201cBecause of the situation in Syria right now, Secretary Tillerson talked to me several weeks ago about the fact that he would like at least to have an opportunity, a short window of opportunity, to see if there is any way to change the trajectory in our relationship with Russia,\u201d Mr. Corker said in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting in late May.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-in-talks-with-moscow-on-syria-safe-zone-1497043492", "news_title": "U.S. in Talks With Moscow on Syria Safe Zone ", "keywords": "moscow,russia,safe zones,syrian civil war,tillerson,trump,U.S. State Department,political,general news,international relations,politics"}, {"content": "Tera W. Hunter\u2019s remarkable book \u201cBound in Wedlock: Slave and Free Black Marriage in the Nineteenth Century\u201d tells a story both professional and personal. Ms. Hunter, a professor of history and African-American studies at Princeton University, is descended from enslaved and free African-Americans with a complicated marital history. Her powerful, meticulously researched book describes how the grinding demands of slavery, white standards of marriage and the steady retreat from the qualified gains of the Civil War not only posed abiding challenges to African-American families but also inspired in them a tenacious commitment to marriage.In the 19th century, Christian rites held enormous sway over American views of marriage, but the enslaved could not fully embrace them. In place of \u201cTo have and to hold, in sickness and in health . . . till death do you part,\u201d southern slaves found their vows binding only \u201cuntil death or distance do you part,\u201d as one white minister put it. The problem was that the master\u2014the \u201cthird flesh,\u201d as Ms. Hunter terms it\u2014could create distance at will.By Tera W. HunterH arvard, 404 pages, $29.95Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.In no way were slave marriages akin to those of whites, even poor ones. Whites of all classes enjoyed the protection of common law; black people, free and slave, did not. This led African-Americans to ponder questions of intimacy, commitment and marriage in uniquely poignant ways. \u201cWhy,\u201d asked former slave Harriet Jacobs, \u201cdoes the slave ever love? Why allow the tendrils of the heart to twine around objects which may at any moment be wrenched away by the hand of violence?\u201dProperly resisting the temptation to analyze the black family through the lens of either \u201cpathology\u201d (per the 1965 Moynihan Report) or white family ideals, Ms. Hunter prefers to examine how the black family was shaped by this particular historical moment. The relentless economic imperatives of the westward-moving cotton economy and its sinister handmaiden, the internal slave trade, splintered one third of first slave marriages, with countless more shattered by the long-term hiring out of individual slaves. Even free black married couples were afforded no legal protection and often found their marriages broken up by southern courts nervous about the further growth of a free African-American community. Heartbreakingly, some free black men and women spared their marriages by voluntarily re-enslaving themselves.African-Americans responded to these oppressive forces nimbly, embracing a range of meaningful alternative domestic arrangements. These included matrifocal, monogamous, bigamous and single-parent families, as well as the very common \u201cabroad\u201d relationships in which slaves married spouses on neighboring plantations.Legally fragile slave marriages gave way to regularized marriages during and after the Civil War. All former slaves were granted the right to make contracts in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, including the contract of marriage. Between 1865 and 1866, most states passed laws not only recognizing pre-war marriages but also legitimizing the offspring from those marriages. In this context, marriage became tethered to the idea of freedom itself. As one black soldier immediately after the war insisted, \u201cthe Marriage Covenant is at the foundation of all our rights.\u201dFreedom offered its own challenges, courtesy of prevailing Victorian mores about marriage and a class of importunate Southern planters anxious to re-institute control over black men and women. \u201cThe multiple partners that many men and women had as a result of forced separations and the unknown whereabouts of spouses,\u201d Ms. Hunter writes, suddenly constituted bigamy. And \u201cwhereas sex outside of marriage was required and expected of the enslaved,\u201d she points out, \u201cunder the new system it could be condemned as criminal fornication and adultery.\u201d Perversely, for many African-Americans, writes Ms. Hunter, \u201cthe right to marry became not the source of empowerment they had yearned for but a form of punishment.\u201dThrough careful use of difficult legal sources and close reading of slave narratives, ex-slave interviews, government agency reports, congressional debates, pension records and church minutes, Ms. Hunter gives resonant voice to the often illiterate people she studies. While the bulk of her evidence is drawn from the 19th century, she does not shy away from exploring the longer-term implications of her findings. She attributes the steady divergence in marriage rates by race since 1900\u2014in 2008, 32% of blacks over 18 were married, compared to 56% of whites\u2014not to slavery but to \u201cthe impact of racism on the social, economic, and political conditions that have shaped family formation in the intervening decades long after slavery ended.\u201d Her larger argument is that all groups who have historically been deprived of equal marriage rights discover, upon achieving them, \u201cthat they need to be supported by economic and social equality in order to truly afford the dignity and the choice intended.\u201dMs. Hunter has harvested stories of human resilience from the cruelest of soils. \u201cBound in Wedlock\u201d is an impeccably crafted testament to the African-Americans whose ingenuity, steadfast love and hard-nosed determination protected black family life under the most trying of circumstances.\u2014Mr. Smith, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina,  is the author of \u201cThe Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege: A Sensory History of the Civil War.\u201dAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/till-death-or-distance-do-us-part-1497043471", "news_title": "Till Death or Distance Do Us Part", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,human rights,civil liberties,reviews"}, {"content": "JOHANNESBURG\u2014Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Friday cut South Africa\u2019s credit rating to Baa3, one notch above junk, and gave it a negative outlook.The downgrade follows cuts to the country\u2019s creditworthiness by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings in April, in the wake of President       Jacob Zuma\u2019s       shock dismissal of his finance minister and several other cabinet members.\u201cRecent political developments suggest a weakening of the country\u2019s institutional strength,\u201d Moody\u2019s said, pointing to the cabinet reshuffle among other developments.Those, it warned, would make it harder for Africa\u2019s most developed economy to start growing again and to stabilize its debt levels.Earlier this week, South Africa\u2019s statistics agency said the country entered a technical recession in the first quarter.Write to Gabriele Steinhauser at gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moodys-cuts-south-africas-credit-rating-1497043109", "news_title": "Moody\u2019s Cuts South Africa\u2019s Credit Rating ", "keywords": "baa3,moody's,south africa,Jacob Zuma,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "While serving as attorney general,       Robert Kennedy       wore his hair close-cropped in the style of the early 1960s. After a trip to the barber it could almost resemble a crew cut. But after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination, he began growing it out. By the time he became a candidate for president in 1968, he had an unruly mop. Shrieking teenagers mobbed him like a Beatle, and his many enemies found an easy target. \u201cAll hair no brains,\u201d read one hostile protester\u2019s sign. Kennedy\u2019s hair grew at the same rate as his radicalism. The more he spoke with fervent vagueness about revolution, the more he had to hand-comb it off his forehead, in the eerily familiar manner of his late brother.It may seem like a trivial detail, but as John R. Bohrer shows in \u201cThe Revolution of Robert Kennedy,\u201d Bobby\u2019s evolving look reflected a persona in flux. With       JFK\u2019s       death, he no longer stood on anyone\u2019s shoulders. As the 1960s wore on, Kennedy harnessed the most dynamic political force of his generation: the country\u2019s youth. He not only spoke their language and addressed their concerns but looked like them. And he offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible.By John R. BohrerBloomsbury, 372 pages, $30Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.It was an improbable reinvention. In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family\u2019s attack dog. He was a hostile cross-examiner on       Joseph McCarthy\u2019s       Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK\u2019s campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat\u2014his father\u2019s son right down to       Joseph Kennedy\u2019s       purported observation that \u201che hates like me.\u201d Yet Bobby somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society from the left.The bookshelves already groan with Kennedy titles, but Mr. Bohrer makes a worthy contribution by examining a critical chapter in Robert Kennedy\u2019s public life, the period from 1963 to 1966. These were years in the wilderness, after his brother\u2019s assassination and before his own storied campaign for president. During this time RFK learned who he was and decided who he wanted to be.Mr. Bohrer ably captures Kennedy at his lowest moment, far from Camelot, as he traveled the world, took public-speaking lessons, overcame his fear of crowds and grappled with JFK\u2019s legacy. The loss of his brother nearly overwhelmed him. For months after the assassination he was prone to sudden tears and wore only black neckties. He showed a fierce devotion to the president\u2019s widow and had an understanding with the guards at Arlington National Cemetery, who let him hop the fence and visit JFK\u2019s grave after hours.Never the most urgent voice on civil rights, Kennedy had taken his lumps from       James Baldwin       and other black radicals in a Manhattan apartment in May 1963. Kennedy had requested the meeting in order to better understand growing racial tensions. What he got was a three-hour scolding on the daily insults of black life in America. Mr. Bohrer writes that Kennedy \u201cdidn\u2019t let his pride overtake the lesson he learned that day\u201d and that the word \u201cinsult\u201d began appearing in his public remarks about race. Another mistake was Vietnam, a war Kennedy had helped engineer in his brother\u2019s administration. Uneasy with Johnson\u2019s escalation of the war, he nevertheless felt a certain ownership of the quagmire and was reluctant to criticize the new president. At first.Devastated or not, Kennedy was canny and opportunistic. He flirted with seeking the vice presidency in a de facto challenge to Johnson, only to run for Senate in 1964 instead, in New York and not Massachusetts (\u201cTeddy\u2019s there,\u201d he explained). \u201cIs this the East River?\u201d he asked his driver during a ride in New York City. His campaign was heavier on machine politics and screaming fans than substance. Emerging from crowds, he found himself covered in scratches, his pockets stuffed with notes.As a senator, Kennedy began to merge his old and new personas. The old Bobby had no patience for parliamentary decorum, speaking up sooner than a freshman should and leaving the chamber as his colleagues jawboned. Yet he also showed a substantive streak on matters of consumer safety, grilling auto- and tobacco-industry executives. In 1965, he defended the rioters in Watts and urged a massive influx of anti-poverty spending. But always he heard the distant thud of bombs far to the southeast and saw the flag-draped coffins returning. Vietnam gnawed at Kennedy with a special guilt until he finally broke with the administration, earning widespread condemnation from the press and the foreign-policy establishment. Mr. Bohrer writes: \u201cFor all Bobby\u2019s ruthlessness and calculation, real and imagined, he showed tremendous courage on issues of right and wrong\u2014along with hazardous abandon.\u201dThroughout these years, Kennedy kept a wary eye on Lyndon Johnson, a rival and adversary. Their feud has been described in Shakespearean terms, but Mr. Bohrer portrays it as a kind of slow boil, characterized by distrust, suspicion and misunderstanding. In 1964, Johnson embarrassed Kennedy by making him wait to receive an honorary pen at the signing of the Civil Rights Act. After winning his Senate seat, Kennedy seemed to thank everyone but the president. They praised each other in florid but hollow terms. The transcripts from Johnson\u2019s White House phone calls capture the awkward embrace of two men dancing with knives in both hands. \u201cLet\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s stay as close together as he\u2019d want us to,\u201d Johnson says to Kennedy, invoking JFK. \u201cThat\u2019d be fine,\u201d replies Bobby stiffly.You needn\u2019t think that Robert Kennedy would have saved the world to recognize him as a fascinating politician of unfulfilled promise. His transition from thug to dove is as striking a reinvention as can be found in modern politics. Surly but vulnerable, entitled but idealistic, more passionate than his brother yet less elegant, he was a complicated statesman. No one could have achieved all that his fans believed possible of him. Yet it is a shame he did not get a chance to try.\u2014Mr. O\u2019Donnell is a lawyer in the Chicago area.

One is a normal building open to visitors in which he makes paintings to hang in galleries and sell to collectors. The other is a barn whose windows are covered and whose door is padlocked. Here he works on a single canvas that no one\u2014not even his family\u2014has ever seen. He has made provisions to ensure that, in the case of his death, the studio be destroyed before anyone can go inside.If the premise rings a bell, that\u2019s because Mr. Everett has taken it from       Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s       1987 novel \u201cBluebeard,\u201d about a little-known Abstract Expressionist who keeps hidden in a shed a secret canvas that holds the key to all his themes and fixations. And though Mr. Everett departs in many ways from Vonnegut\u2019s art-world satire\u2014his book is melancholy rather than manic and scathing\u2014he affectingly carries on his predecessor\u2019s inquiry into the troubled sources of creative inspiration.Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.The painter in \u201cSo Much Blue\u201d is 56 and drifting, sober after years of heavy drinking but emotionally distant from his wife and teenage children\u2014\u201ccamped out,\u201d Pace says, \u201con an uncharted island in the middle of myself.\u201d Two extended incidents that layer the narrative shed light on his alienation. Ten years earlier, during an exhibition of his work in Paris, Pace had a brief but uncharacteristically passionate affair with a younger woman. Decades before that, when he was a student, his best friend persuaded him to travel to El Salvador to help track down a brother in trouble with drugs. Unwittingly, the men rushed headlong into the country\u2019s burgeoning civil war.Proceeding at a steady, entrancing pace, Mr. Everett pays out the lines of his story until he reaches the twin traumatic secrets at the core of Pace\u2019s personality. Thus \u201cSo Much Blue\u201d potently explores the Faustian bargain by which artists fertilize their guilt and estrangement for the sake of their creations. \u201cMy depression actually fed my work, made my art better, gave it a gravity, a depth that it hadn\u2019t had before,\u201d Pace forlornly confesses.Mr. Everett is a writer of staggering range, the author of reworked Greek mythology (\u201cFrenzy\u201d), racial satire (\u201cErasure\u201d), postmodern detective stories (\u201cAssumption\u201d) and, most recently, a brilliant experimental meta-fiction (\u201cPercival Everett by       Virgil Russell      \u201d). \u201cSo Much Blue\u201d is a comparatively accessible work yet still displays his narrative prowess, erudition and sense of enigma. It is, in short, an ideal place to start with this great but neglected novelist.The melancholy artist in       Don Lee\u2019s       \u201cLonesome Lies Before Us\u201d (Norton, 335 pages, $26.95) is Yadin Park, an alt-country singer-songwriter who put out a few cult-favorite records before an inner ear disorder ended his music career. At 46 he\u2019s managed to stabilize his hearing loss, find work in a small California town laying carpet and take up with a woman named Jeanette, a housekeeper at a nearby luxury hotel. Since he and Jeanette have never quite recovered from youthful heartbreak, theirs is a caring but cool relationship. \u201cThey might have been together more out of attrition than anything resembling ardor,\u201d she privately admits. Their arrangement is further strained when the old songwriting impulse revisits Yadin and he determines to sink his savings into recording and self-releasing one final album.The story moves neatly between the points of view of Yadin and Jeanette, accelerating at the appearance of Yadin\u2019s first love, Mallory, who rose to short-lived country-music stardom on the strength of some of Yadin\u2019s songs and now wants to take part in his comeback record. Mr. Lee plucks familiar chords with a sure hand, glancing on themes of grief, jealousy and second chances.But what really stamps this book on the heart is Yadin\u2019s vulnerable spiritual journey from loneliness toward something like grace. He seeks \u201ca connection to the numinous\u201d in love, at church\u2014even through poetry, after a librarian friend introduces him to       Gerard Manley Hopkins.       It\u2019s music, though, that keeps calling him back, giving him a way to transform his sorrows in spite of his disability. Yadin recalls a quote from his songwriting hero       Townes Van Zandt      : \u201cThere\u2019s only two kinds of music: the blues, and zippity-doo-dah.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt about which kind Mr. Lee is playing.\u201cOne of the real problems with the breakdown of interpersonal relations in the digital age is that people don\u2019t know how to be intimate anymore,\u201d says Sloane Jacobsen, the central character of       Courtney Maum\u2019s       office comedy \u201cTouch\u201d (Putnam, 306 pages, $26). \u201cIf we think about our youngest generation, they\u2019re exposed to screens and swipes and scrolling before sticks and mud and dirt.\u201d What we\u2019re raising, she says, summing up her diagnosis of contemporary loneliness, \u201cis an entire generation of humans who are tactilely bereft.\u201dSloane is what the corporate world calls a trend forecaster, and she\u2019s been hired by the tech giant Mammoth to consult on new products that will anticipate the subconscious desires of the consumer class, particularly the growing demographic who, like her, have chosen not to have children. To her surprise, her premonitions are leading her to the field of outsourced physical contact\u2014hugging salons, rental relatives, handwriting classes to bring back the lost art of snail mail. A \u201cslow friendship\u201d movement resembling the slow food craze. Uber, but for companionship.The foils to this irresistible set-up are Sloane\u2019s boss, Dax, who sees trends away from electronics as threats to his bottom line, and her longtime partner, Roman, a French thought leader who calls himself a \u201cneo-sensualist.\u201d Roman becomes a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre by going out in public in an eyeless Lycra bodysuit and espousing a movement to abandon actual sex for virtual forms of stimulation. It\u2019s not what you want to hear from the person who shares your bed.Ms. Maum\u2019s appealing debut, \u201cI Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You,\u201d followed a husband\u2019s efforts to win back the love of his wife after being caught in an affair. Like that book, \u201cTouch\u201d uses antic humor to mask its rather stern traditional message about the importance of nuclear families and the magic of baby-making. The author\u2019s conservative streak occasionally dampens her storytelling. The book\u2019s settings, drably confined to conference rooms and the company car, could have used shaking up, and its ending is too easy to forecast. But it\u2019s impressive that Ms. Maum has managed to make a return to old-fashioned family values\u2014and even commonplace acts of physical intimacy\u2014seem daring and subversive.

That will reduce AmTrust\u2019s stake in National General to about 1.5% from its current 11.5%.AmTrust, which is one of the nation\u2019s biggest sellers of workers\u2019 compensation coverage to employers, said it was selling the shares to simplify its balance sheet and the composition of its investment portfolio. The sale will also reduce the company\u2019s need to report a related-party relationship with National General\u2014the Karfunkel family that controls AmTrust also owns a large stake in National General.AmTrust will record a pretax gain of about $76 million on the sale.AmTrust stock has lost about half its value since February, in the wake of an earnings restatement, a delay in filing its annual report as Big Four accounting firm KPMG LLP took over the auditing from a smaller firm, pressure from short sellers and an April report by The Wall Street Journal that AmTrust is the subject of a\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over its accounting practices.The sale of the shares follows AmTrust\u2019s naming of a new chief financial officer earlier this week.       Adam Karkowsky,        an executive with the company since 2011, replaced longtime finance chief       Ronald Pipoly Jr.      , who is staying with AmTrust in strategic and advisory roles.Last month, the company said the Karfunkel family would invest an additional $300 million in AmTrust to strengthen the capital base and display their continued support for the company.Chaya Cooperberg,        a spokeswoman for AmTrust, said that by reducing the position in National General to about 1.5%, the company becomes an ordinary investment.\u00a0The sale \u201cwill simplify disclosure and will reduce related-party relationships,\u201d she said, signaling \u201cour commitment to continuing to simplify and look more like our peers.\u201dThe move also allows AmTrust to diversify its investments and attain more predictable returns not tied to the performance of one specific company, Ms. Cooperberg said.Barry Zyskind,        AmTrust\u2019s chief executive, will remain National General\u2019s chairman after the sale of the stake. Mr. Zyskind is the son-in-law of the late       Michael Karfunkel,        who was a co-founder of AmTrust along with his brother       George Karfunkel,        who is an AmTrust director.\u200bAmTrust\u2019s Nasdaq-traded shares fell 5.1% Friday to close at $13.36.Write to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com and Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amtrust-to-sell-most-of-stake-in-national-general-holdings-for-211-7-million-1497018561", "news_title": "AmTrust to Sell Most of Stake in National General Holdings for $211.7 Million   ", "keywords": "amtrust financial services inc.,barry zyskind,insurance,karfunkel,national general holdings corp.,AmTrust Financial Services,AFSI,National General Holdings,NGHC,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,earnings restatements,non-life insurance,vehicle insurance,property,casualty insurance,financial services,mortgage insurance,transport,freight insurance"}, {"content": "When, in 1980,       Czeslaw Milosz       won the Nobel Prize for Literature, his colleagues at the University of California were shocked. Students knew the 69-year-old professor for his popular course on       Dostoevsky,        but only a handful of members of the Berkeley community knew the importance of his poems, most of which were then available only in Polish.At a press conference with the university\u2019s chancellor shortly after the Swedish Academy\u2019s announcement, Milosz read \u201cA Magic Mountain,\u201d a recent poem about the isolation and apparent impotence of a political exile living in the strange eternal spring of San Francisco Bay and continuing to write in his native tongue. Why bother to write when \u201cI won\u2019t have power, won\u2019t save the world?\u201d the poet asks. \u201cDid I then train myself, myself the Unique, / To compose stanzas for gulls and sea haze?\u201d The answer is typical Milosz: \u201cOne murky island with its barking seals / Or a parched desert is enough / To make us say: yes, oui, si. / . . . Endurance comes only from enduring. / With a flick of the wrist I fashioned an invisible rope, / And climbed it and it held me.\u201dAndrzej Franaszek\u2019s       award-winning 2011 biography of Milosz, now translated into English by Aleksandra and       Michael Parker,        is an enthralling account of the poet\u2019s work as well as the events he endured to create it. A reluctant defector whose poems were proscribed by the Polish People\u2019s Republic, he wrote for decades without a country or an audience\u2014or so it seemed to him. In Communist Poland, however, to a degree unknown to Milosz, his verse secretly shaped an entire generation. In the wake of the Nobel Prize, it has become recognized world-wide as a testament to the power of art.By Andrzej FranaszekHarvard, 515 pages, $35Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.Long chapters, each covering anywhere from five to 20-odd years, give Mr. Franaszek the flexibility to handle tumultuous periods of Milosz\u2019s life in detail and depth. Aside from a childhood idyll on his maternal grandparents\u2019 estate in Lithuania, the poet\u2019s life was marked by displacement from the beginning.In 1913, two years after Milosz was born in Szetejnie, Lithuania, the family moved to Siberia, where his father, the engineer       Aleksander Milosz,        built bridges and railroads for the Czarist government. When war broke out in 1914, the family returned briefly to Lithuania before following Aleksander to the front in a carriage. After the war, they moved to the capital, Wilno (Vilnius), where Milosz began his formal education. He excelled in reading and writing, and the focus on clarity in his Latin classes made a lasting mark. He studied law at the local university and spent his free time discussing poetry in various student clubs.A trip to Paris in 1931 to visit his uncle, the poet and Christian mystic       Oskar Milosz,        proved pivotal, sparking in him a religious awakening and confirming his literary calling. It is in part because of his uncle that Milosz came to believe that the true artist is always on the side of the particular, the individual. He wrote frequently against abstraction in art, which transforms artists into tools of propaganda, and argued for verbal simplicity and concreteness. For Milosz, poetry was \u201cplain speech in the mother tongue.\u201d This specificity is the source of poetry\u2019s poetry. \u201cHearing it you should be able to see,\u201d he writes in his \u201cTreatise on Poetry\u201d (1956), \u201cAs if in a flash of summer lightning, / Apple trees, a river, the bend of a road. / . . . One clear stanza can take more weight / Than a whole wagon of elaborate prose.\u201d\u201cWhat is poetry,\u201d Milosz asks in \u201cDedication\u201d (1945), \u201cwhich does not save / Nations or people?\u201d His relationship to his own people, however, was complex, and Mr. Franaszek\u2019s meticulously researched account of the two decades bookending Milosz\u2019s 1951 defection to the West is particularly revelatory.Politically, Milosz was a man of the left and wrote strongly against rising Polish fascism before World War II, but unlike many of his friends, he didn\u2019t throw his weight behind communism. Instead, he kept his head down and wrote poems that, if not apolitical, avoided calls to political action. It could make him look like a self-absorbed aesthete. For Milosz, however, the artist is at his most political when he avoids politics and aims at purity of expression.In 1945, shortly after joining Poland\u2019s diplomatic service, Milosz, then enjoying a reputation as one of the state\u2019s emerging poets, was named cultural attach\u00e9 to the embassy in New York City. When, in 1950, he was relocated from Washington, D.C., to Paris, he left his pregnant wife and their 3-year-old son behind. Because he had family in America, and because he had never joined the Party, his loyalty to Poland was doubted by the Communist regime. During a visit to Warsaw, his passport was confiscated, and it was then that he defected to France. Separated from his wife, son, and now an infant boy whom he had never seen, the poet was alone, depressed, and secretly living in a small room in the Paris office of the Polish-language magazine Kultura. When he failed (according to certain influential Polish emigrants) to denounce communism with appropriate vehemence, his application for an American visa was rejected. He briefly contemplated suicide before finding solace in the encouragement of friends including       Albert Camus       and the Trappist monk and poet       Thomas Merton.Soon after he defected, he wrote openly, eloquently and damningly about the effects of totalitarianism on the individual psyche in his major prose work, \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d (1953). Unlike most other defectors, however, he refused to write for the American-funded Radio Free Europe and cast a jaundiced eye on Western consumerism.His family eventually joined him in France, and in 1960 they moved to America when Milosz accepted a teaching position in the Slavic department at Berkeley. Milosz excelled in the classroom, but he occasionally found it difficult to write in a vacuum. In 1961, he complained to his Polish editor       Jerzy Giedroyc,        \u201cNo one writes to me. It is as if I ceased to exist.\u201d Ten years later, he wrote Giedroyc again: \u201cI have just celebrated my sixtieth birthday. No one except those closest to me remembered it.\u201dMilosz died in 2004, more than a decade after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. In 1981, the year following his Nobel Prize, he visited Poland during a brief thaw in Soviet-Western relations. He was moved to tears to discover that, 30 years after his defection, many Poles knew his poems by heart. The translator       Richard Lourie       visited Poland the year before and saw a monument to murdered shipyard workers in Gdansk during the 1970 strikes with a line by Milosz on it. A worker told him: \u201cHe was banned, but we always knew Milosz.\u201d\u2014Mr. Mattix is an associate professor of English at Regent University and a contributing editor to the Weekly Standard.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-captive-and-the-free-1497042737", "news_title": "The Captive and the Free", "keywords": "book review,car0610,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "In the spring of 1989, a new board game was released amid modest media hoopla. It was called Trump: The Game, and it was sold by Milton Bradley Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more sophisticated game than Monopoly,\u201d Donald Trump boasted at the unveiling. Based on his 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d the game involved players amassing airlines, casinos and real estate, then cutting deals that would cut other players out.Trump: The Game sold fairly well, and then it didn\u2019t. Within a year sales sagged; the price was slashed at Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cThe word of mouth was that the complexity of the game hurt it,\u201d Mr. Trump told a reporter. Others suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s faltering business and collapsing marriage were to blame. \u201cThe Trump name is almost laughable,\u201d a Paine Webber analyst told New York\u2019s Daily News. \u201cIt has about as much value as the name \u2018Watergate\u2019 after the scandal.\u201dTrump: The Game merits a few scant paragraphs in       Tristan Donovan\u2019s       \u201cIt\u2019s All a Game: The History of Board Games from Monopoly to Settlers of Catan.\u201d This is both disappointing and a relief. Certainly the game didn\u2019t have all that much influence in the history of board games, which is the focus of the book. But Mr. Donovan deftly deploys this tale to show how swiftly an idea can move from concept to market. In this case, the creators had a notion, wangled a meeting with Mr. Trump, got his blessing after a 10 or 15 minute sit-down, then persuaded Milton Bradley to sign on.By Tristan DonovanThomas Dunne, 292 pages, $26.99Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.The game was meant to capture the spirit of the \u201980s. As Mr. Donovan tells it, the best-selling games do often capture the zeitgeist in miniature, whether it\u2019s Twister making a splash during the sexual revolution, Scrabble arising during the mania for crossword puzzles or Col. Mustard showing up as a character in Clue (originally Cluedo) in 1949, at a time when the English-speaking world couldn\u2019t get enough of crime novels in general and those set at British country houses in particular.The author suggests that, unlike high-tech videogames, which create parallel realities into which we can escape, board games began in the ancient world as a way to organize reality\u2014a simple throw of the dice was thought to aid in foreseeing the future. \u201cUsing games for spiritual guidance or to learn about the future might strike us as strange today,\u201d Mr. Donovan writes, \u201cbut it makes more sense when we understand that our brains have a serious aversion to the concept of randomness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s All a Game\u201d starts off in Egypt and Mesopotamia, touching on archaeological finds such as the Royal Game of Ur, which dates to about 2600 B.C. and was rediscovered in the 1920s. This game involved the movement of pawns around 20 squares, although the precise rules are unclear. Then it\u2019s on to the appearance of chess in ancient Persia and its evolution in both play and design after it hitched a ride to Europe with marauding troops in the eighth century. The queen became the most powerful piece on the board during the 15th and 16th centuries, reflecting (Mr. Donovan suggests) \u201chow female leaders were taking charge in kingdoms across Europe and showing they could rule as well as any man.\u201d Chess continued to evolve until relatively recently; not until 1849 did the board pieces finally ossify in the Staunton design familiar today, in which the shape of the pieces is inspired by the neoclassical architecture then in fashion.Chapter by chapter, \u201cIt\u2019s All a Game\u201d tracks the rise and fall of games both familiar and not. Backgammon (a likely descendant of the Royal Game of Ur) captivated Roman emperors and early American presidents alike. \u201c      Thomas Jefferson       played it while taking a break from writing the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Mr. Donovan says. Prince       Alexis Obolensky,        a Russian exile living in New York, served as the game\u2019s de facto emissary when he launched a splashy tournament at a posh resort in the Bahamas in 1964. The game caught fire, with high-stakes tournaments cropping up in Las Vegas and Monaco, attracting celebrities like       Hugh Hefner       and       Mick Jagger.       Eventually the stakes grew so high that the game was taken over by professionals. \u201cThe wealthy playboys, tycoons, and heiresses found backgammon wasn\u2019t fun anymore and stopped coming,\u201d Mr. Donovan writes. Backgammon\u2019s cachet cratered in certain circles.If there\u2019s any identifiable trend in the history of board games, it\u2019s the way they\u2019ve changed from enduring multigenerational pursuits to fleeting entertainments subject to whims and trends, becoming all the rage for a few years before edging toward the shadows. Think: The Game of Life, Mouse Trap, Operation.Many of Mr. Donovan\u2019s chapters center on a single game, but not all. Some set off on intriguing detours\u2014such as how military intelligence outfitted Monopoly boards with false compartments during World War II to ship to prisoners of war in Germany and provide them with escape maps; how computers eventually came to dominate chess; and how more modern games have rejected competition to focus on cooperation, such as Pandemic, released in 2007 in the shadow of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS: \u201cFour diseases have broken out in the world,\u201d as the manufacturer lays out the goal, \u201cand it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s All a Game\u201d is a timely book\u2014board games are proliferating again among millennials and hipsters, as are theories why. (I\u2019m going with the argument that they offer a corrective to too much phone time, too many videogames and not enough face-to-face contact.) Coffee shops and bars host board-game nights, and even the Game of Ur has enjoyed a modest revival: One online offer on Kickstarter promises an \u201cultra premium model which is hand painted by artisans in the UK with premium Vallejo paints.\u201d As of this writing it has raised nearly 10 times its initial target.One of Mr. Donovan\u2019s chapters focuses on the mega-hit Trivial Pursuit, which a pair of Canadian journalists invented after 45 minutes of brainstorming. The game shares certain characteristics with his book\u2014lots of throw-away facts and lore but not much of a dramatic arc. Mr. Donovan occasionally veers into padding: A history of uranium mining, for instance, is dutifully recounted to explain why the 1960 edition of Life had \u201cFind Uranium Deposit, Collect $100K.\u201d Many chapters begin with those soft leads once favored by newspapers but abandoned because readers found them irksome. The first sentence in the Trivial Pursuit chapter: \u201cThe afternoon air bit as       Chris Haney       walked through the streets of Montr\u00e9al.\u201dOverall, though, \u201cIt\u2019s All a Game\u201d provides a wonderfully entertaining trip around the board, through 4,000 years of game history. It will certainly get you thinking, quite possibly about how you might devise your own game and reap a fortune.At least it did for me. I\u2019ve been thinking about an update of Trump: The Game. Just add in some tweetstorms that force all players to reverse direction and a stack of \u201cheadline\u201d cards that ask you to determine if the news is fake or real; then set it all amid \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-style infighting. Can someone help me set up a meeting with the president?\u2014 Mr. Curtis is the author of, most recently, \u201cThe Last Great Walk: The True Story of a 1909 Walk From New York to San Francisco, and Why It Matters Today.\u201dAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-checkered-history-1497042601", "news_title": "A Checkered History", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"}, {"content": "Homo sapiens had been on its hind legs for tens of thousands of years before it understood the potentially huge amounts of energy stored in the cores of atoms\u2014in their nuclei. That was only little over a century ago. Since then, many people have tried to harness this energy in useful ways, and the attempts have ranged from the impressively efficient to the comically inept, as       James Mahaffey       describes in his rewarding book \u201cAtomic Adventures.\u201dThe first indication of the sheer amount of energy stored deep inside the atom followed the discovery of radioactivity near the end of the 19th century. In 1909, the chemist Frederick Soddy commented in a prominent lecture that the radioactive chemical element radium, first isolated about a decade before by Marie and       Pierre Curie,        \u201cgiv[es] out heat and light like Aladdin\u2019s lamp.\u201d He told his audience that the energy released in radioactivity could be \u201cemployed as an explosive incomparably more powerful in its activities than dynamite.\u201d Soddy\u2019s ideas stimulated       H.G. Wells       to write \u201cThe World Set Free\u201d shortly before World War I. In that slight but visionary volume, he predicted accurately that energy released in radioactivity would first be used to generate electrical power in 1953, coined the term \u201catomic bombs\u201d and even foresaw a nuclear war. Such a catastrophe would bring humanity to its senses, he believed, and lead it toward pursuing many of his favorite social policies.By James MahaffeyPegasus, 363 pages, $29.95Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.Wells would have been fascinated by \u201cAtomic Adventures,\u201d especially by the ways its cast of scientists\u2014who range from authentic experts to the shadiest of con artists\u2014have tried to make use of atomic energy in war and in peace. Mr. Mahaffey, a former research scientist at Georgia Tech, is a knowledgeable narrator who plainly loves his subject. He knows how to tell a good story and, no less important, has an eye for unfamiliar and revealing details.Mr. Mahaffey is at his best in his account of Japan\u2019s project to build a nuclear bomb during World War II. In common with the scientists working on the Manhattan Project, the Japanese wanted to build a bomb by harnessing the energy released when uranium nuclei split into smaller nuclei and other particles\u2014the process known as nuclear fission. Spies working for the Japanese infiltrated the American project, though the intelligence reports reaching Tokyo were evidently of poor quality, since they gave the impression that the Manhattan Project was proceeding slowly. The Japanese nuclear experts concluded that they could take their time. In this story\u2019s powerful conclusion, Mr. Mahaffey describes how, soon after 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, a Japanese naval captain saw his desktop light up briefly and felt the floor shake. Outside he saw \u201ca huge, gray cloud . . . forming up where Hiroshima should have been.\u201d \u201cThe world had just entered the Atomic Age,\u201d Mr. Mahaffey writes, \u201cand all that Japan had contributed was the target.\u201dAfter the war, nuclear technology was begging to be explored, with some visionaries convinced that it could supply electrical energy too cheap to meter. Argentine President       Juan Per\u00f3n       generously funded an ambitious nuclear project pitched to him by the Austrian-born German       Ronald Richter,        whom Mr. Mahaffey dismisses as a \u201cthird-tier scientist\u201d and \u201cnutcase.\u201d The idea was to harness atomic energy not by inducing heavy nuclei to undergo fission but by fusing nuclei that have only a small mass. This process of nuclear fusion promised to yield energy in huge quantities without nasty radioactive byproducts. In March 1951, Richter announced that he had engineered a controlled process of nuclear fusion. His claims did not stand up, though, and the entire venture folded in the following year. Per\u00f3n had bankrolled Richter to the tune of $300 million in today\u2019s money but generated nothing of lasting value, though some of the leftover apparatus proved useful to Argentine soldiers for target practice.Optimism about nuclear fusion soared in 1989 after a press conference by the chemists       Martin Fleischmann       and       Stanley Pons       at the University of Utah. They announced that they had engineered the process, not at the ultra-high temperatures assumed to be essential but in a simple laboratory experiment at room temperature. Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s reaction was similar to that of most other scientists: Fleischmann (who died in 2012) and Mr. Pons either \u201chad a lock on the Nobel Prize for physics or they were crazy.\u201d Mr. Mahaffey was one of the many investigators who plunged into cold-fusion research, but he and his colleagues, in common with many other experimenters, could not reproduce Fleischmann and Mr. Pons\u2019s observations. The cold-fusion dream was soon over. Elsewhere, international collaborations have continued to pursue conventional high-temperature fusion projects, but, as the cynics like to say, electrical power from nuclear fission always seems to be 40 years away.Of the other adventures that Mr. Mahaffey describes in his book, two of the most compelling concern attempts to find ways of propelling aircraft and spacecraft using nuclear fuel. Neither venture has been successful, but Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s accounts make for instructive reading\u2014a refreshing change from most popular presentations of research science, which too often play down failures, dead-ends and snafus. A slightly chilling chapter on \u201cdirty bombs\u201d makes one relieved that they have not become common. The danger from dirty bombs is more a lethal panic than direct mortality, so we should not be afraid of such weapons, Mr. Mahaffey counsels us, unconvincingly.Even if \u201cAtomic Adventures\u201d is sometimes a tad dense with nerdy details, it is an enlightening read, and I\u2019m sure it would have been an education for H.G. Wells. He lived about a year beyond the dropping of nuclear weapons on Japan but was apparently too frail to publish his reflections on the events. He would probably have been surprised to read in Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s book that progress has been slower than he envisaged in \u201cThe World Set Free.\u201d For sure, progress in nuclear energy has not set the world free but has made it a rather more frightening place for Homo sapiens to live.\u2014Mr. Farmelo is the author of \u201c      Churchill\u2019s       Bomb\u201d and \u201cThe Strangest Man.\u201dAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fumbling-with-pandoras-box-1497042423", "news_title": "Fumbling With Pandora\u2019s Box", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,energy"}, {"content": "A rise in shares of             Facebook,        FB 0.79%Amazon.com,        AMZN 0.24%Netflix        NFLX 0.14%       and Google-parent Alphabet, commonly known by the acronym FANG, has propelled the broader market rally since the beginning of the year.

An increase of that magnitude should typically be underpinned by a big improvement in their earnings outlooks. Earnings expectations at Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet have risen year to date.

At these levels, the stocks are vulnerable to an outsize reaction if earnings fall short or growth slows unexpectedly.Even separately, the stock prices and earnings estimates don\u2019t match. Earnings estimates for Facebook for this year and next are up 18% and 10%, respectively, since the beginning of this year. The company\u2019s shares are up an even greater 30%. Similarly, the 28% rise in Netflix\u2019s stock price exceeds its respective 11% and 2% gains in earnings estimates for this year and next. Expectations for Alphabet\u2019s earnings for the two years have climbed only 3% and 4% over the period as its shares have climbed 22%.For Amazon, where investors tend to focus more on cash flow than earnings, shares have shot upward even as earnings estimates have fallen by a quarter. The gains suggest momentum, rather than fundamentals, has increasingly been fueling the rise of the companies.

As heroes go, there is nothing very heroic about Pip Pirrip, who narrates Dickens\u2019s 13th novel. Brought up as an orphan in the marshlands of Kent, he becomes nothing less than a mean-spirited snob once he has inherited his mysterious fortune. It is perhaps the genius of the book that we never dislike him. But Pip is a victim himself, manipulated by the depraved Miss Havisham, who is taking revenge on all mankind after being jilted on her wedding day, her weapon being her beautiful adopted daughter, Estella. The original ending could hardly be more bleak, as Pip glimpses his lost love riding past in a carriage. When she stops to greet him, he takes solace \u201cfor, in her face and in her voice, and in her touch, she gave me assurance that suffering had been stronger than Miss Havisham\u2019s teaching and had given her a heart to understand what my heart used to be.\u201d Later, Dickens was persuaded to soften this. Pip and Estella meet again in the ruins of Miss Havisham\u2019s old manor house and may even have a future. But the mists are still there, rising all around them.By       Ian Fleming       (1955)2. A great many of Fleming\u2019s villains are motivated by revenge, but few of them launch quite such grandiose schemes as Graf Hugo von der Drache, also know as Hugo Drax, an ex-Nazi commander who plans to incinerate London with a nuclear warhead supplied by the Soviets. As if losing World War II wasn\u2019t bad enough, he had also suffered the indignity of an English education. \u201cBond could imagine that the hulking body with the ogre\u2019s teeth had not been very welcome at an English private school. And being a foreign count with a mouthful of names would not have helped much.\u201d For all that, the book is strangely believable, with the malfunctioning Shell advertisement that flashes HELL IS HERE and a Bond girl, Gala Brand, who for once does not end up in Bond\u2019s bed. To No\u00ebl Coward, it was \u201cthe best thing he has done yet,\u201d although many critics accused Fleming of self-parody. They should have seen the 1979 film!Endgame in the Pacific; how to eat Southern; when RFK turned dove; a checkered history of board games; Percival Everett\u2019s new novel; remembering Czeslaw Milosz; how slavery shattered families; and much more.By       Agatha Christie       (1962)3. Long before  Midsomer became the go-to place to be killed, St. Mary Mead, the home of Miss Marple, was also a surprisingly dangerous location. In this book, which begins with the arrival of Marina Gregg, a famous American film actress who has bought a local mansion, there are no fewer than three deaths, starting with that old Christie standby, the poisoned cocktail. Revenge, of course, is a motif that can be found throughout Christie\u2019s work, but what makes this novel so peculiarly satisfying is the sympathy we feel for the killer, whose crime is, at the end of the day, understandable and who is finally allowed to escape justice. Generally, the Miss Marple stories are less clue-driven and perhaps more character-based than Christie\u2019s Poirot investigations. Miss Marple denies that she is even a detective. \u201cIt is simply that I have a certain knowledge of human nature\u2014that is only natural after having lived in a small village all my life.\u201d In that sentence is the reason why English villages have always proved to be such a gift to writers of whodunits.By       \u00c9mile Zola       (1867)4. \u201cThe critics  greeted this book with a churlish and horrified outcry,\u201d Zola wrote in his preface to the second edition. \u201cEven the minor literary reviews . . . held their noses and talked of filth and stench.\u201d Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and her lover, the would-be artist Laurent, seem to have gotten away with the murder of her feeble husband, Camille, but there is never any doubt that there will be no happy ending as guilt, madness and retribution close in on the increasingly wretched pair. These take the tangible form of a suppurating wound\u2014Camille had bitten Laurent as he was being drowned. But the most horrible part of the story is surely the fate of old Mme. Raquin, aware of what has happened but struck down by a stroke and unable to denounce her son\u2019s killers: \u201cShe was held rigid by the inertia of a corpse.\u201d She is there, an immobile witness to the inevitable tragic end.By       Arthur Conan Doyle       (1887)5. A dead body  has been found in an abandoned house in Lauriston Gardens, London. \u201cOn his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and, as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features,\u201d the narrator tells us. There is a clue. A single word has been scrawled on the wall in blood red letters: RACHE. The hapless police inspector is certain that someone was trying to write \u201cRachel\u201d but was disturbed before they could finish\u2014and it is left to the consulting detective who has been called to the scene to point out that Rache is the German word for revenge. So begins a crime story that might seem unremarkable and poorly structured. Much of the second part is set in Utah and feels oddly disjointed. But the detective is Sherlock Holmes, the narrator is Dr. Watson, and this of course is the book that introduced them to each other. It is the first modern detective story. \u201cI know well that I have it in me to make my name famous,\u201d Holmes tells Watson. He is very quickly proved right.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 17:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthony-horowitz-1497042110", "news_title": "Anthony Horowitz", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,books,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The shock results from the British election reverberated around Europe on Friday. Instead of facing a strengthened British prime minister in negotiations over Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union as senior EU officials expected, the bloc\u2019s leaders will now be confronting a lesser figure.Mrs. May called an election by choice and lost seats. She ended up in charge of a minority government, depending on a small party from Northern Ireland to stay in power. If before the election her cabinet served at her pleasure, now she serves at theirs.Her ability to shape events has been sharply reduced. Her standing has been diminished in her party, among voters, and among the European governments with which she must now negotiate.\u201cOne won\u2019t be able to avoid the question, \u2018Whom is she actually speaking for?\u2019 \u201d a senior German official said.She now has less than two years to negotiate Brexit. Mrs. May said Friday she was ready to begin talks with the EU as scheduled on June 19. But if she proceeds\u2014assuming her minority government doesn\u2019t fall and her own party doesn\u2019t unseat her\u2014she will be seen as a less-reliable interlocutor.That increases the risk that talks could break down with no deal at all, a chaotic prospect that would jeopardize much of the economic interchange between the U.K. and EU.There are other constraints on Mrs. May\u2019s ability to pursue the kind of Brexit laid out in her Conservative Party\u2019s manifesto, which anticipated a fundamental break with EU structures.The party\u2019s promises included pulling the U.K. out of the EU\u2019s single market and its customs union. It pledged that a Conservative government would stop free movement of EU workers to the U.K. and end the jurisdiction of the EU\u2019s top court. It also said that no Brexit deal with the EU \u201cis better than a bad deal.\u201dHad she won, those pledges would have driven London\u2019s approach to the Brexit talks. They would also have forced, by British convention, the House of Lords, Britain\u2019s unelected upper chamber, to fall into line. But she didn\u2019t win.A debate is already under way in the Conservative Party over whether those pledges now have any force. Even if the Tories decide they still apply, no one else has to take any notice.\u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal\u201d no longer appears to be official British policy.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the approach doesn\u2019t change from the manifesto,\u201d said Lucy Thomas, head of Brexit advice at the Edelman consultancy and a former deputy director of the Stronger In campaign in last year\u2019s Brexit referendum.Ms. Thomas said the fact that the Conservatives can only get to a thin majority with the help of the 10-seat Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland also potentially imperils a plank of the government\u2019s strategy for Brexit: the Great Repeal Bill. This mammoth piece of legislation is meant to transpose EU law into U.K. law to prevent the emergence of legal vacuums after Brexit. Aspects of it may now fall prey to political opposition.There is a further constraint on Mrs. May and any successor: the concessions likely to be extracted by the pro-British DUP as the price for supporting the government.The party favored Brexit and its manifesto called for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland and a comprehensive free trade and customs deal with the EU.Critically though, DUP leaders have said these objectives shouldn\u2019t be achieved by giving Northern Ireland a special status in the U.K., reasoning that could set the province on a slippery slope toward unity with the republic.If there is no special deal, the DUP\u2019s objectives for a \u201cfrictionless\u201d Irish border may only be achievable if the U.K. stays inside the EU customs union. A \u201cno deal\u201d option would be ruled out, because one consequence of that would be that tariff barriers would be erected between north and south.In all likelihood, Brexit will still mean Brexit, as Mrs. May has repeatedly suggested since becoming prime minister last July in the aftermath of the referendum. But the radical break with the EU in prospect before the election now looks much less likely.\u2014Anton Troianovski in Berlin contributed to this article.Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Hobbled Leader Faces Brexit Talks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 16:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vote-puts-diminished-u-k-leader-in-brexit-talks-1497041725", "news_title": "Vote Puts Diminished U.K. Leader in Brexit Talks", "keywords": "brexit,british election,tories,u.k. conservatives,u.k. election,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Exxon Mobil Corp.        XOM 0.31%       pushed back on Friday\u00a0against accusations that it misled investors on how it accounts for climate-change risks,\u00a0saying in a legal filing that the\u00a0claims by New York\u2019s\u00a0attorney general are \u201cinflammatory, reckless and false.\u201dThe oil giant was responding to a motion filed by\u00a0New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u00a0in state court last week that seeks to force Exxon to turn over reams of additional documents to aid the state\u2019s ongoing probe of the company.\u00a0As part of that motion, Mr.\u00a0Schneiderman\u00a0said he had found evidence suggesting that the way Exxon evaluates the impact of future climate regulations on its business was a \u201csham.\u201dMr. Schneiderman\u00a0claimed\u00a0Exxon has used two sets of estimates for potential future carbon prices\u2014a public number given to investors, and another internal figure used privately for decision-making.\u00a0That\u00a0could mislead investors by making Exxon seem more resilient to potential climate risks than it really is, he argued.In its response Friday,\u00a0Exxon acknowledged that it has used\u00a0varying carbon\u00a0price figures in the past, but said the numbers\u00a0were used for different purposes. One process,\u00a0the one used in an oil outlook shared publicly, involved\u00a0estimates of potential future carbon costs to assess energy demand and future prices,\u00a0while another, the one used internally, related to gauging\u00a0the profitability of specific oil and gas projects.\u201cExxonMobil\u2019s use of different metrics, in different circumstances, to accomplish different goals evinces prudent financial stewardship, applying appropriate assumptions in appropriate cases,\u201d\u00a0Exxon\u2019s lead lawyer, Ted Wells of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, wrote in the brief. \u201cThere is nothing untoward or surprising about any of this.\u201dMr. Wells reiterated Exxon\u2019s claim that the investigation by the attorney general, a Democrat, is\u00a0politically motivated, saying he has been \u201cworking backwards from an assumption of Exxon Mobil\u2019s guilt, searching in vain for some theory to support his prejudgment.\u201dThe state \u201chas a substantial basis to suspect that Exxon\u2019s proxy cost analysis may have been a sham,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman. \u201cThis office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously.\u201dExxon\u2019s arguments underscore the challenge New York\u2019s top prosecutor may face in asserting that the company is guilty of fraud in how it has accounted for climate risks.Regulations on such disclosure are in the early stages of being developed, and many oil-and-gas companies have been slow to make changes or meet increasing investor demands for transparency on the subject.Exxon and Mr. Schneiderman have repeatedly crossed swords over how Exxon has complied with the investigation\u2019s subpoenas. Mr. Schneiderman has alleged that Exxon\u00a0is attempting to stall and delay the progress of the probe.He has argued that,\u00a0despite a subpoena issued in late 2015 when the investigation started, Exxon appears to have permanently deleted emails used by former Chief Executive       Rex Tillerson       under the alias \u201cWayne Tracker.\u201dNew Chief Executive       Darren Woods       also had an alias account under the name \u201cJ.E. Gray,\u201d although he doesn\u2019t appear to have used it, documents in the investigation show.Exxon has acknowledged that several months of emails from the alias account of Mr. Tillerson, now U.S. secretary of state, were inadvertently deleted, but said it was able to recover most of the requested documents.The company has submitted nearly 3 million pages of documents for the investigation and asked the New York court to reject Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s pursuit of additional documents and information.Write to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 16:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-rebuts-allegations-it-misled-investors-on-climate-1497038189", "news_title": "Exxon Rebuts Allegations it Misled Investors on Climate ", "keywords": "climate change,eric schneiderman,exxon,exxonmobil,exxon mobil,new york attorney general,oil,Exxon Mobil,XOM,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,natural environment,global,world issues,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Your editorial \u201cAbout That \u2018Gutting the Safety Net\u2019\u201d (May 30) insults people with disabilities and their families. I authored the Americans with Disabilities Act. The irony is we agree there exist systemic barriers to our employment. We disagree with the unfounded stereotype that people with disabilities are lazy and don\u2019t want to work.In the real world, people with disabilities fight for policies that remove systemic barriers to employment without impoverishing families by overcoming disability-based discrimination and lack of accessibility. The prior administration understood and started a Disability Employment Initiative supporting job-driven approaches to equip people with disabilities to obtain in-demand jobs, increase earnings and advance their careers while supporting accessibility.The Trump budget is a leap backward. Cutting the budget for civil-rights enforcement across agencies like the Education and Labor departments only enhances the risk of discrimination and barriers to employment. We should focus on policies that support the transition of people with disabilities from school to a job, abolish the subminimum wage and provide everyone a living wage.Policies that perpetuate inequity go beyond dysfunctional\u2014they are immoral.Tony CoelhoDoylestown, Pa.I applaud the White House for prioritizing the need to reform and reduce the funding of the federal disability program. It has been my experience that the system has often been manipulated and abused. I have practiced medicine since before the 1980s. Over time I saw a marked increase in the number of people on disability and came to believe that at least half of them weren\u2019t entitled to the benefits. I strongly believe that everyone with a disability that is not obvious or overwhelming should be re-examined yearly to justify the continuance of benefits. I also believe evaluations shouldn\u2019t be done by applicants\u2019 private physicians due to the potential for unintended bias. I have great respect for primary-care physicians, but I know they are human and might slant their findings and opinions in favor of their patient out of loyalty, or to stop them from making frequent and/or harassing visits.Ryan Searle, M.D., ABEMNewburyport, Mass.Your editorial might have stressed an alternate route: switching in part to a system of transitional benefits. Currently, a claimant is deemed either healthy or disabled, and those determined disabled presumptively are entitled to benefits throughout their lives including, as the piece relates, Medicare eligibility after a two-year wait. The Social Security Administration conducts Continuing Disability Reviews, but generally only after three years, and under law the disability determination can be reversed only upon a showing of substantial evidence.What if instead the SSA were to award transitional benefits to those who, based on medical evidence, were likely to improve to the point of being able to re-enter the workforce? Those in car crashes, those suffering heart attacks and even those with cancer often recover. As you note, the longer one is out of the workforce, the more difficult it is to re-enter.Shifting to a transitional benefit system for some claimants not only would shore up the trust fund, it would improve the lives of many who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able or willing to rejoin the workforce. We need reform of the very concept of disability.Prof. Harold J. KrentIIT Chicago-Kent College of LawChicagoThis abuse of society\u2019s good intentions has gone on far too long.

However, religionists who reject such dogma (such as those with Judeo-Christian values) don\u2019t pose problems for nationhood, and secular totalitarian countries violate his case. The key for the sovereignty of the people is in their free exercise of conscience and the dignity of the individual, which are threatened by subordination to the state.Allen WeingartenMonroe Twp., N.J.Communication hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed politics and governmental philosophies. Instead, the same fundamental principles established in Athens exist today where democracy depends on citizens willing to acquire the requisite knowledge to fulfill their responsibility as competent voters. The rise of Donald Trump or Marine Le Pen isn\u2019t a phenomenon based on nationalism or antiglobalization. These candidates are the result of the inadequacies of the voting public to consider the policies of the candidates. Instead, the electorate is being swayed by sound bites. The danger if this continues is to democracy itself.Joel A. RobinsonPeekskill, N.Y.The only conceivable means to world peace is world government. While even the idealist must admit that the emergence of such a government is unlikely, there is in fact a historical example of states surrendering some portion of their sovereignty in the interest of achieving a higher good. I refer, of course, to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, and one could do worse than to look to it as a model. It is most certainly superior to the half-baked approach being taken by the European Union.Jim ReardonSan DiegoAs the co-authors of a book examining the relationship between the nation-state and globalization, we agree with Mr. Scruton but are compelled to add that his analysis mischaracterizes the \u201cstate\u201d side of the nation-state equation. Globalization presupposes a state that is sovereign and has the capacity and commitment to provide its people with social and economic security. The Western nation-state achieved that goal as long as it could rely on a base of corporate employers providing a massive supply of stable careers in manufacturing, services and other jobs. The Western nation-state is now in crisis because manufacturing and retail jobs were traded away to emerging economies, automation and the platform \u201cgig\u201d economy which eroded the career-based model of work. The government hasn\u2019t reformed itself to address the new economic and social conditions. The problem isn\u2019t that \u201curban elites\u201d build identities across borders rather than nationally.

As an infant, young Rudy had slipped with his mother into an icy chasm.

Several times I had to put the book down to recover from his exquisite descriptions of the Swiss landscape, such as this evocation of an Alpine sunset: \u201cThe spruce forests on the mountains acquired a mauve appearance, very much like heather in bloom, and where the trees left off and the rock protruded, it was glowing as if the mountain were transparent. The clouds in the sky were like red fire, the entire lake suggested a fresh, blushing rose-petal.

Nothing in this tale makes it inappropriate for younger readers\u2014there\u2019s no bodice ripping or gory details\u2014but older ones are likelier to find resonance in Andersen\u2019s ambiguous, sophisticated vision.Joe Todd-Stanton situates the familiar idea of a gentle giant, misunderstood, in off-shore fishing grounds in \u201cThe Secret of Black Rock\u201d (Flying Eye, 32 pages, $16.95). The front cover, it must be said, resembles that of a famous Tintin story with a similar name, \u201cThe Black Island.\u201d In both illustrations, a stalwart blond person in a small boat, with a dog, crosses choppy seas to a forbidding destination. Here the similarities end, though, for while Tintin reaches his island and finds a gang of counterfeiters, our young heroine, Erin Pike, finds no island at all. The massive moving object feared by local fisher folk on account of its boat-wrecking properties means no harm to anyone. Mr. Todd-Stanton\u2019s pictures (see above) are briny and glorious: In one breathless underwater image, Erin hangs suspended, her yellow mackintosh billowing and her pale hair floating like a sea creature as she takes in the true nature of the black rock. If 3- to 8-year-olds get an environmental message, it\u2019s one of amiable co-existence rather than of humankind\u2019s inveterate villainy.Small children of a compliant nature will find a kindred spirit in the mouse-hero of       Kate Messner\u2019s       entertaining easy-reader \u201cFergus and Zeke\u201d (Candlewick, 52 pages, $14.99). A dapper fellow with lavender fur, Fergus loves following the rules of Miss Maxwell\u2019s class. \u201cWhen the students solved math problems, Fergus solved them, too,\u201d we read; \u201che always kept his eyes on his own work.\u201d But when teacher and children prepare to visit the natural-history museum without him, Fergus embraces his inner outlaw and stows away in a backpack. He soon falls in with Zeke, a gray mouse of insouciant temperament who scoffs at the idea of following \u201cpeople rules.\u201d Cheery illustrations by Heather Ross add zip to this educational excursion for 5- to 8-year-olds.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Into an Icy Chasm.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 16:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-new-childrens-books-1497040916", "news_title": "The Best New Children\u2019s Books", "keywords": "bookcar0610,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Oil futures edged up on Friday but still ended the week lower, after rising U.S. stocks raised doubts that production cuts are achieving their goal of draining global inventory.U.S. crude futures rose 19 cents, or 0.42%, at $45.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 29 cents, or 0.61%, to $48.15 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.Prices ticked upward Friday as bargain buyers and profit takers bet that a selloff earlier this week has lost momentum. But oil markets ended the week down around 3.84% lower after falling sharply on Wednesday when the U.S. Energy Information Administration published a surprise increase in crude stocks in its weekly data. It was the third straight week of declines.\u201cThe inventory surplus in the U.S. and across much of the globe seems to be the black cloud that shows up to rain on the bulls parade whenever a rally gets going, and until real progress is made on that front, it may be difficult to see a reversal of this negative trend,\u201d said analysts at TAC Energy.The unexpected increase in U.S. stocks undermined confidence in whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would meet its goal of reducing global stocks to their five-year average. The cartel, along with other major producers including Russia, last month agreed to extend production cuts until March.\u201cThe very slow decline in U.S. crude inventories, despite all the cuts being implemented by OPEC and Russia, has the market questioning if OPEC can really succeed to bring down inventories to average levels,\u201d said       Giovanni Staunovo,        an analyst at UBS.The increase reported Wednesday came after eight straight weeks of falling stockpiles, and some analysts said the market\u2019s sharp selloff could prove to be an overreaction.\u201cI still believe that the weekly data was a one off and now it\u2019s time to wait for next Wednesday to see if it was an anomaly or if it was a change in the trend,\u201d Mr. Staunovo said.Energy Aspects says the cartel must also cut exports, in addition to output, to reduce the global glut amid record U.S. exports. Recovering production out of Nigeria and Libya, the two OPEC members exempt from the cutback deal, is also a negative.Still, many see U.S. shale producers as the main culprit for keeping the oil market oversupplied. The number of active U.S. oil-drilling rigs there have risen for 21 straight weeks, according to oilfield-service company         Baker Hughes.       Its weekly report is due later Friday.But some market watchers say last week\u2019s slight decrease in average daily U.S. oil output could be an indication that some high-cost producers are feeling the heat as prices have averaged below $50 a barrel since April. \u201cThe decreased production shows we are probably closer to a floor,\u201d said       Michael McCarthy,        a CMC Markets analyst.One supportive factor for the market has been Asian demand, in particular China. Crude imports by the world\u2019s second biggest economy notched their second-highest level on record in May. Meanwhile, India\u2019s oil demand for April was the highest since November.Gasoline prices rose 0.98 cent, or 0.66% to $1.5017 a gallon.

Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. to             Bank of America Corp.        BAC 0.67%       and other large banks the agency oversees.Mr. Noreika is leading the comptroller\u2019s office until Mr. Trump\u2019s permanent nominee for the job, former banker Joseph Otting, is confirmed by the Senate. That process could take months. Mr. Otting\u2019s name was sent to the Senate earlier this week.Meanwhile, the ethics documents show Mr. Noreika will be recused from decisions affecting many firms, from financial companies to law firms such as his former employers, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Covington & Burling LLP.The timing of the recusals varies. Mr. Noreika was recused from matters involving             Wells Fargo                   & Co. through May 18, covering his first weeks on the job. He will be recused from matters involving Bank of America until July 26 and J.P. Morgan until March 23, 2018. About a fifth of the 80 entities on the recusal list are banks regulated by the comptroller\u2019s office or holding companies that own such banks, an OCC spokesman said.Senate Democrats have criticized the choice of Mr. Noreika to lead the agency, saying he has a conflict of interest because he once represented the banks he now oversees.They have questioned why he hasn\u2019t signed on to an ethics pledge that other Trump officials have signed, promising not to lobby agencies where they work for five years after the end of their government service.\u201cMr. Noreika has recused himself from virtually all of the major banks that the OCC regulates... how can he possibly do his job?,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) said in a statement Friday. He added that Mr. Noreika \u201cstands to profit from all of these relationships the moment he finishes his work at the OCC because he hasn\u2019t signed President Trump\u2019s ethics pledge.\u201dA spokesman for the comptroller\u2019s office noted that under ethics rules, Mr. Noreika \u201cwill be permanently barred from communicating with or appearing before any executive or judicial branch employee\u201d concerning matters that he participated in while working for the government, as well as barred for two years from working on matters that were \u201cpending under his official responsibility during the last year of his federal service.\u201dTreasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        who tapped Mr. Noreika to lead the agency, has said his banking experience would be a positive for the regulator. \u201cHe has deep experience in helping banks operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services, and provide credit needed for business expansion and job growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin wrote in a May 17 letter to Mr. Van Hollen and others.Mr. Mnuchin said the administration\u2019s ethics pledge doesn\u2019t apply to Mr. Noreika because he is a temporary appointee. Mr. Noreika\u2019s status as a temporary employee could change if he serves for more than 130 days.\u201cMr. Noreika will observe a recusal from particular matters involving specific parties in which he knows one of the entities on the attached list is a party or represents a party in the matter,\u201d the OCC\u2019s ethics counsel said in a May 24 memorandum on the recusals.The memo says \u201cparticular matters\u201d include bank examinations and enforcement actions, among other things.\u00a0Mr. Noreika can receive status reports on the matters but won\u2019t discuss recommendations or decisions, it says.Mr. Noreika won\u2019t be precluded from considering broadly \u201cpolicies, regulations, or legislation concerning the banking industry,\u201d according to the memo.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 16:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/acting-u-s-banking-regulator-is-recused-from-decisions-on-many-banks-1497030389", "news_title": "Acting U.S. Banking Regulator Is Recused From Decisions on Many Banks ", "keywords": "banking oversight,bank regulator,confilct of interest,ethics pledge,occ,trump administratoin,J.P.

He will get too injured, or too old, and the recoveries and comebacks he\u2019s made from earlier career crossroads will no longer be possible. Nadal will go from being a great champion who can still rule this event, to a great champion who is finally\u2014and to his opponents, mercifully\u2014in sunset.At least I presume so. The way Nadal looked early Friday evening during his 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 semifinal rout of up-and-comer Dominic Thiem, who really knows? Another Sunday final in Paris is coming, and after a two-year hiatus interrupted by injuries and renewed rumors of decline, the 31-year-old left-hander from Spain will once more play on the last day of the clay-court major he\u2019s won a staggering nine times in his career.Nine times. It\u2019s just silly. For contrast: In Saturday\u2019s women\u2019s final, Simona Halep and Jelena Ostapenko will meet for a chance at each\u2019s first-ever Grand Slam title of any kind. The next day at Roland Garros, Nadal will go for his tenth French, which would be a record for any singles player in tennis\u2019s Open era (Nadal\u2019s nine French titles matches Martina Navratilova\u2019s nine at Wimbledon.) A win on Sunday would also be Nadal\u2019s 15th overall men\u2019s singles Slam, which would vault him over Pete Sampras as second only to       Roger Federer\u2019s       18.Fed wins Australia and Indian Wells, now Rafa\u2019s on the verge in Paris\u2014 2017 is shaping up to be a tennis geezer spectacular! Roland Garros has long been a Nadal HQ, of course. He\u2019s lost only twice here, period\u2014in 2009 in the fourth round to Robin Soderling, and in 2015, to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. At 31, he may not be the mortal lock on clay he was in the racket-lashing Capri-pants prime of his twenties, but the brick-colored limestone continues to suit his game.On Friday, the three-time French winner Gustavo \u201cGuga\u201d Kuerten theorized that before he retired, Nadal could win as many as 15.Yeah: That\u2019s just Guga talking. For Nadal, Number 10\u2019s not going to be easy. To get it, he will have to prevail over Stan Wawrinka, a late-blooming shot-maker who himself has won a French, hasn\u2019t lost any of the three majors finals he\u2019s appeared in, and, when he\u2019s rolling, is more trouble than a garbage bag full of angry bees. Earlier Friday the fourth-seeded Wawrinka prevailed over No. 1 Andy Murray in a zesty, four-and-a-half hour 6-7, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6, 6-1 five-setter in which he twice recovered from being down a set.Wawrinka will be an underdog with bite. Last fall, he took a U.S. Open title to go along with his 2014 Australian and 2015 French titles, and at 32, he\u2019s perhaps the most aggressively weaponized player in the game, with a dazzling array of shots, and a confidence to boot. Versus Murray he had 87 winners against 77 unforced errors.That\u2019s not timid tennis. Stan plays like a paintball gun firing off the back of a pick-up truck.\u201cA very dangerous player,\u201d said a respectful Nadal late Friday. \u201cHe can hit the ball very hard.\u201dIf you just consider the past few months of tennis, Nadal reaching this final isn\u2019t a mega-shocker. In late January, he nearly won that Australian final versus Federer. He\u2019s been dominant through tennis\u2019s clay court-season, losing only once, in Rome, to Thiem. He\u2019s surrendered just 29 games in his march so far in Paris, a bit of trivia he dismissed as unimportant, and he hasn\u2019t lost a set.The bigger picture, however, is that it\u2019s another stunning comeback for a player who\u2019s regularly battled injuries that have threatened to derail his career. Nadal now says he \u201calmost destroyed\u201d his left wrist at last year\u2019s French. After a layoff that also took him out of Wimbledon, he spent the remainder of the year clawing through the tour with a forehand he knew wasn\u2019t up to Rafa standards.He now looks far more like himself. He\u2019ll surely have the crowd on his side for the final.\u201cSunday will be a difficult one,\u201d Nadal said.Bring it on, says Stan.\u201cTo play Rafa on clay in the French Open is probably the biggest challenge you can have in tennis,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cBut [at] the end of the day, it\u2019s the final. The pressure is on both players.\u201dCan\u2019t wait. Another Sunday in Paris with Rafa.

Yields rise as bond prices fall.Demand for Treasurys was hurt by a couple of factors, including the lifting of political uncertainty related to the U.K. general elections and testimony from former FBI Director       James Comey.Investors also were preparing for an influx of new Treasury debt early next week.

That will be followed by the conclusion the two-day Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday.Investors widely expect the central bank to raise short-term interest-rates at the meeting. But there is a risk that officials could use the event to raise expectations about future rate increases, which have ebbed in the wake of soft economic data.The market is \u201cpricing in a June rate hike and nothing else beyond that, so risks, in my view, are significantly skewed toward some hawkish repricing of expectations,\u201d said       Bruno Braizinha,        senior interest rate strategist at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA      .Treasurys began Friday\u2019s session in worse shape than how they ended it.

But it ultimately had little impact on the bond market.Written testimony released Wednesday removed some of the drama from the event and was generally seen by investors as not damaging enough to threaten Mr. Trump\u2019s position in the White House.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 15:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bonds-pull-back-as-focus-shifts-to-auctions-fed-meeting-1497019445", "news_title": "U.S. Bonds Move Lower as Focus Shifts to Auctions, Fed Meeting", "keywords": "bond yields,interest rates,treasury auctions,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,James Comey,monetary policy,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary"}, {"content": "New YorkWhat\u2019s the greatest threat to liberty in America? Liberals rail at       Donald Trump\u2019s       executive orders on immigration and his hostility toward the press, while conservatives vow to reverse       Barack Obama\u2019s       regulatory assault on religion, education and business.       Philip Hamburger       says both sides are thinking too small.Like the blind men in the fable who try to describe an elephant by feeling different parts of its body, they\u2019re not perceiving the whole problem: the enormous rogue beast known as the administrative state.Sometimes called the regulatory state or the deep state, it is a government within the government, run by the president and the dozens of federal agencies that assume powers once claimed only by kings. In place of royal decrees, they issue rules and send out \u201cguidance\u201d letters like the one from an Education Department official in 2011 that stripped college students of due process when accused of sexual misconduct.Unelected bureaucrats not only write their own laws, they also interpret these laws and enforce them in their own courts with their own judges. All this is in blatant violation of the Constitution, says Mr. Hamburger, 60, a constitutional scholar and winner of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s       Hayek       Prize last year for his scholarly 2014 book, \u201cIs Administrative Law Unlawful?\u201d (Spoiler alert: Yes.)\u201cEssentially, much of the Bill of Rights has been gutted,\u201d he says, sitting in his office at Columbia Law School. \u201cThe government can choose to proceed against you in a trial in court with constitutional processes, or it can use an administrative proceeding where you don\u2019t have the right to be heard by a real judge or a jury and you don\u2019t have the full due process of law. Our fundamental procedural freedoms, which once were guarantees, have become mere options.\u201d \u200bIn volume and complexity, the edicts from federal agencies exceed the laws passed by Congress by orders of magnitude. \u201cThe administrative state has become the government\u2019s predominant mode of contact with citizens,\u201d Mr. Hamburger says. \u201cUltimately this is not about the politics of left or right. Unlawful government power should worry everybody.\u201dDefenders of agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Environmental Protection Agency often describe them as the only practical way to regulate today\u2019s complex world. The Founding Fathers, they argue, could not have imagined the challenges that face a large and technologically advanced society, so Congress and the judiciary have wisely delegated their duties by giving new powers to experts in executive-branch agencies.Mr. Hamburger doesn\u2019t buy it. In his view, not only is such delegation unconstitutional, it\u2019s nothing new. The founders, far from being naive about the need for expert guidance, limited executive powers precisely because of the abuses of 17th-century kings like James I.James, who reigned in England from 1603 through 1625, claimed that divinely granted \u201cabsolute power\u201d authorized him to suspend laws enacted by Parliament or dispense with them for any favored person. Mr. Hamburger likens this royal \u201cdispensing\u201d power to modern agency \u201cwaivers,\u201d like the ones from the Obama administration exempting             McDonald\u2019s                   and other corporations from complying with provisions of the Affordable Care Act.James also made his own laws, bypassing Parliament and the courts by issuing proclamations and using his \u201croyal prerogative\u201d to establish commissions and tribunals. He exploited the infamous Star Chamber, a court that got its name from the gilded stars on its ceiling.\u201cThe Hollywood version of the Star Chamber is a torture chamber where the walls were speckled with blood,\u201d Mr. Hamburger says. \u201cBut torture was a very minor part of its business. It was very bureaucratic. Like modern administrative agencies, it commissioned expert reports, issued decrees and enforced them. It had regulations controlling the press, and it issued rules for urban development, environmental matters and various industries.\u201dJames\u2019s claims were rebuffed by England\u2019s chief justice,       Edward Coke,        who in 1610 declared that the king \u201cby his proclamation cannot create any offense which was not an offense before.\u201d The king eventually dismissed Coke, and expansive royal powers continued to be exercised by James and his successor, Charles I. The angry backlash ultimately prompted Parliament to abolish the Star Chamber and helped provoke a civil war that ended with the beheading of Charles in 1649.A subsequent king,       James II,        took the throne in 1685 and tried to reassert the prerogative power. But he was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which was followed by Parliament\u2019s adoption of a bill of rights limiting the monarch and reasserting the primacy of Parliament and the courts. That history inspired the American Constitution\u2019s limits on the executive branch, which       James Madison       explained as a protection against \u201cthe danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate.\u201d\u201cThe framers of the Constitution were very clear about this,\u201d Mr. Hamburger says, rummaging in a drawer for a pocket edition. He opens to the first page, featuring the Preamble and Article 1, which begins: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.\u201d\u201cThat first word is crucial,\u201d he says. \u201cThe very first substantive word of the Constitution is \u2018all.\u2019 That makes it an exclusive vesting of the legislative powers in an elected legislature. Congress cannot delegate the legislative powers to an agency, just as judges cannot delegate their power to an agency.\u201dThose restrictions on executive power have been disappearing since the late 19th century, starting with the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. Centralized power appealed to big business\u2014railroads found commissioners easier to manipulate than legislators\u2014as well as to American intellectuals who\u2019d studied public policy at German universities. Unlike Britain, Germany had rejected constitutional restraints in favor of a Prussian model that gave administrative agencies the prerogative powers of the king.Mr. Hamburger believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the growth of America\u2019s administrative state coincided with the addition to the electorate of Catholic immigrants, blacks and other minorities. WASP progressives like       Woodrow Wilson       considered these groups an obstacle to reform.\u201cThe bulk of mankind is rigidly unphilosophical, and nowadays the bulk of mankind votes,\u201d Wilson complained, noting in particular the difficulty of winning over the minds \u201cof Irishmen, of Germans, of Negroes.\u201d His solution was to push his agenda using federal agencies staffed by experts of his own caste\u2014what Mr. Hamburger calls the \u201cknowledge class.\u201d Wilson was the only president ever to hold a doctorate.\u201cThere\u2019s been something of a bait and switch,\u201d Mr. Hamburger says. \u201cWe talk about the importance of expanding voting rights, but behind the scenes there\u2019s been a transfer of power from voters to members of the knowledge class. A large part of the knowledge class, Republicans as well as Democrats, went out of their way to make the administrative state work.\u201dMr. Hamburger was born into the knowledge class. He grew up in a book-filled house near New Haven, Conn. His father was a Yale law professor and his mother a researcher in economics and intellectual history. During his father\u2019s sabbaticals in London, Philip acquired a passion for 17th-century English history and spent long hours studying manuscripts at the British Museum. That\u2019s where he learned about the royal prerogative.He went to Princeton and then Yale Law School, where he avoided courses on administrative law, which struck him as \u201ctedious beyond belief.\u201d He became slightly more interested during a stint as a corporate lawyer specializing in taxes\u2014he could see the sweeping powers wielded by the Internal Revenue Service\u2014but the topic didn\u2019t engage him until midway through his academic career.While at the University of Chicago, he heard of a colleague\u2019s inability to publish a research paper because the study had not been approved ahead of time by a federally mandated institutional review board. That sounded like an unconstitutional suppression of free speech, and it reminded Mr. Hamburger of those manuscripts at the British Museum.Why the return of the royal prerogative? \u201cThe answer rests ultimately on human nature,\u201d Mr. Hamburger writes in \u201cThe Administrative Threat,\u201d a new short book aimed at a general readership. \u201cEver tempted to exert more power with less effort, rulers are rarely content to govern merely through the law.\u201dInstead, presidents govern by interpreting statutes in ways lawmakers never imagined. Barack Obama openly boasted of his intention to bypass Congress: \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d Unable to persuade a Congress controlled by his own party to regulate carbon dioxide, Mr. Obama did it himself in 2009 by having the EPA declare it a pollutant covered by a decades-old law. (In 2007 the Supreme Court had affirmed the EPA\u2019s authority to do so.)Similarly, the Title IX legislation passed in 1972 was intended mainly to protect women in higher education from employment discrimination. Under Mr. Obama, Education Department bureaucrats used it to issue orders about bathrooms for transgender students at public schools and to mandate campus tribunals to adjudicate sexual misconduct\u2014including \u201cverbal misconduct,\u201d or speech\u2014that are in many ways less fair to the accused than the Star Chamber.At this point, the idea of restraining the executive branch may seem quixotic, but Mr. Hamburger says there are practical ways to do so. One would be to make government officials financially accountable for their excesses, as they were in the 18th and 19th centuries, when they could be sued individually for damages. Today they\u2019re protected thanks to \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d a doctrine Mr. Hamburger thinks should be narrowed.\u201cOne does have to worry about frivolous lawsuits against government officers who have to make quick decisions in the field, like police officers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut someone sitting behind a desk at the EPA or the SEC has plenty of time to consult lawyers before acting. There\u2019s no reason to give them qualified immunity. They\u2019ll be more careful not to exceed their constitutional authority if they have to weigh the risk of losing their own money.\u201dAnother way of restraining agencies\u2014one President Trump could adopt on his own\u2014would be to require them to submit new rules to Congress for approval instead of imposing them by fiat. The president could also order at least some agencies to resolve disputes in regular courts instead of using administrative judges, who are departmental employees. Meanwhile, Congress could reclaim its legislative power by going through regulations, agency by agency, and deciding which ones to enact into law.Mr. Hamburger\u2019s chief hope for reform lies in the courts, which in earlier eras rebuffed the executive branch\u2019s power grabs. Those rulings so frustrated both       Theodore Roosevelt       and       Franklin D. Roosevelt       that they threatened retaliation\u2014such as       FDR\u2019s       plan to pack the Supreme Court by expanding its size. Eventually judges surrendered and validated sweeping executive powers. Mr. Hamburger calls it \u201cone of the most shameful episodes in the history of the federal judiciary.\u201dThe Supreme Court capitulated further in decisions like Chevron                   v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984), which requires judges to defer to any \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of an ambiguous statute by a federal agency. \u201cChevron deference should be called Chevron bias,\u201d Mr. Hamburger says. \u201cIt requires judges to abandon due process and independent judgment. The courts have corrupted their processes by saying that when the government is a party in case, they will be systematically biased\u2014they will favor the more powerful party.\u201dMr. Hamburger sees a good chance that the high court will limit and eventually abandon the Chevron doctrine, and he expects other litigation giving the judiciary a chance to reassert its powers and protect constitutional rights. \u201cSlowly, step by step, we can persuade judges to recognize the risks of what they\u2019ve done so far and to grapple with this very dangerous type of power,\u201d he says. The judiciary, like academia, has many liberals who have been sympathetic to the growth of executive power, but their perspective may be changing.\u201cAdministrative power is like off-road driving,\u201d Mr. Hamburger continues. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating to operate off-road when you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat, but it\u2019s a little unnerving for everyone else.\u201dHe says he observed this effect during a recent conversation with a prominent legal scholar. The colleague, a longtime defender of administrative law, was discussing the topic shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.The colleague told Mr. Hamburger: \u201cI am beginning to see the merit of your ideas.\u201dMr. Tierney is a contributing editor of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 15:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tyranny-of-the-administrative-state-1497037492", "news_title": "The Tyranny of the Administrative State", "keywords": "administrative state,deep state,john tierney,manhattan institute,philip hamburger,regulatory state,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,commentaries,opinions,interviews"}, {"content": "York Springs, Pa.President       Trump       has had a difficult time getting much of his agenda off the ground. But one thing I\u2019ve already seen change under his administration: Immigration law is being enforced more aggressively. Out in rural Pennsylvania, in a county Donald Trump carried with 66% of the vote, this is already having a devastating effect on the economy and culture.I live in York Springs, a no-stoplight town near Gettysburg, in the middle of what\u2019s known as the South Mountain Fruit Belt. Adams County grows more apples than any other in Pennsylvania and is fourth-highest producer in the nation. The fruit belt is not the Rust Belt, but the biggest employers are canning plants:       Knouse,        Rice and       Mott\u2019s      . Down the road in Biglerville, they call the high-school teams the Canners.York Springs, known locally as \u201cLittle Mexico\u201d or \u201cRednexico,\u201d has a population of 800 or so, 46% Hispanic, according to the 2010 census. This, I daresay, is now inaccurate: If you made the population 1,100 and 70% Hispanic, you\u2019d be nearer the mark. Many people came to Adams County as seasonal apple pickers, and orchards need tending year round, so they stayed. Some became orchard managers, and some started businesses: hair salons and restaurants, grocery stores and landscaping companies.The mix is a remarkable thing: Oaxaca in a Wyeth painting. With its red barns, rolling hills and blossoming trees, living in this part of rural America is like being in a calendar. It has rural American values too, which are instinctively traditional and oriented toward family and hard work. It\u2019s just that a lot of the folks living by these values today have brownish skin and speak Spanish. Some are citizens, some are not, often both within the same family.Beautiful as it is, York Springs is the sort of place people leave after they finish high school. When I moved here in 2012, real estate was cheap and abandoned houses dotted the back roads. The town was aging and dying, though Mexican newcomers were already bringing green shoots. Over the past five years I\u2019ve seen a steady renewal. Townspeople have fixed up many old houses and are raising families.There has been a little tension, but York Springs in recent years has developed a vibrant, intersectional culture, insofar as that\u2019s possible in such a sparsely populated place. Almost anyone might hire Renta Fiestas for a party. There was, until recently, even street life of sorts popping up: a Mexican food truck, children playing f\u00fatbol, the occasional interethnic teen couple holding hands at Griest Park.Now, however, York Springs has become a target for immigration enforcement. Statistics by locality are hard to come by, but an attorney speaking at a community forum last month at the Adams County Agricultural Center said there were at least 15 actions in York Springs during February and March, with many more since, including street arrests and traffic stops that have resulted in detentions. People are held at the prison in the city of York, 25 miles down the road, and the phrase \u201cthey took her to York\u201d has become the expression for someone who\u2019s been taken into the immigration system.This is separating families, and people are living in fear. Children aren\u2019t playing out in the yard any longer. Parents are afraid to leave their homes even to walk their children to the bus, according to immigrants who spoke at the forum. The food truck is gone, and it\u2019s been a while since I heard Mexican pop music.This stringent enforcement of immigration law is destroying a rich, new rural culture. It\u2019s likely to destroy the economy, too. The orchards generate over $500 million a year, and, one way or another, most of the jobs. But the local growers, many of whom have been operating the family orchards for generations, worry they won\u2019t have enough manpower this fall to harvest the crop.Sure, a lot of the white folk out here voted for Mr. Trump. Even then, many of them had reservations specifically about his immigration stance. I heard them expressed by Trump supporters in line to vote at the Latimore Township building. Now as we spiral into a local depression that is personal, cultural and economic, a lot of them are going to regret voting for him anyway.Mr. Sartwell teaches at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa.

Americans celebrate July 4 and commemorate Sept. 11. We remember Dec. 7 and honor June 6. On those four days, major events bore consequences that changed the world.But at no time in American history have there been three days like June 10-12, 1963, during which several unrelated events altered the nation\u2019s course as surely as had the attack on Pearl Harbor.June 10, 1963, began with President       John F. Kennedy\u2019s       signing the Equal Pay Act, which required that women who perform the same jobs as men earn the same as men. The following day, three Buddhist monks waded into a busy Saigon intersection. One of them,       Thich Quang Duc,        assumed the lotus position. The other two doused him with gasoline. He then lit himself on fire and allowed the flames to consume him.Hours later\u2014still June 11 in the U.S.\u2014Gov.       George Wallace       stood at a University of Alabama entrance and delivered his \u201cSchoolhouse Door\u201d speech in an attempt to prevent two black students from integrating the school. Assistant Attorney General       Nicholas Katzenbach       and a contingent of federal marshals compelled Wallace to stand aside, and the students were escorted in\u2014seven years after a court order had prohibited the public university from denying admission based on color.That night, Kennedy addressed the nation to explain the moral imperative behind the civil-rights bill he planned to send to Congress. \u201cToday we are committed to a world-wide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free,\u201d he said, citing Berlin and Vietnam. \u201cBut are we to say to the world and, much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes?\u201dThe elation African-Americans and all Americans of good will felt was short-lived. Early the next morning, June 12,       Medgar Evers,        a 37-year-old civil-rights activist, stepped onto his Jackson, Miss., driveway and was assassinated. A white supremacist, Byron De La Beckwith, fired the fatal shot from across the street with a deer rifle.As legislation, the origin of the Equal Pay Act could be traced to a 1944 bill introduced by Rep.       Winifred C. Stanley,        a Republican from upstate New York. That legislation was defeated, and versions of it were introduced in every subsequent Congress until 1963, when a compromise version\u2014a clause inserted into the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\u2014passed 362-9 (with Democrats casting all nine nays), and by voice vote in the Senate.The bill\u2019s overwhelming passage gave women their greatest victory since suffrage in 1920. In countless ways it boosted the movement that would be called \u201cwomen\u2019s lib\u201d before becoming known as \u201cfeminism.\u201dThe Evers assassination would become a catalytic moment for civil rights in ways similar to the 1955 torture lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till while he was visiting relatives in Mississippi. Till\u2019s mother, in Chicago, had opened her son\u2019s casket for all to see. She wanted mourners to be repelled by what her son had suffered at the hands of men who never paid the price legally. It was no coincidence that a year later came the successful Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott and the emergence of       Martin Luther King       as the leader of a movement that needed one.Now King speculated that Evers\u2019s martyrdom would \u201ccause all persons of goodwill to be aroused,\u201d and awaken blacks \u201cto rise up with righteous indignation.\u201dThich Quang Duc\u2019s protest suicide in Vietnam landed on American front pages and led the three network evening newscasts, thanks to the photo of the immolation shot by the Associated Press\u2019s       Malcolm Browne.       As       JFK       noted, \u201cNo news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one.\u201dIn the U.S., that emotion was primarily disgust. Americans wondered what could provoke a man to end his life in the most excruciating way possible. The answer was South Vietnam\u2019s longtime repression of Buddhists. Just a few weeks earlier, the brother of President       Ngo Dinh Diem       had ordered state security forces to fire into a parade celebrating Buddha\u2019s birthday. The celebrants\u2019 crime? Flying Buddhist flags.That South Vietnam was essentially an American client, and Diem presumably a puppet whom the Kennedy administration had been propping up for two years, made the sudden attention both domestically and geopolitically problematic. No longer was Vietnam out of sight and mind. Journalists had already begun claiming, and Kennedy had already begun denying, that the U.S. was stuck in a quagmire.Diem claimed that Communists were behind the protests and refused to comply with the Americans\u2019 reform demands. Violence escalated through the summer. Four more monks self-immolated, as did a nun. And when Diem declared martial law in August, Kennedy\u2019s men began plotting his overthrow.The Nov. 1 coup, with a select group of Vietnamese officers replacing Diem, was not supposed to result in his death. But the next day soldiers shot and killed him and his brother. Political chaos ensued, making it much more difficult for the U.S. to accomplish its military goals cleanly or exit Vietnam gracefully\u2014especially after JFK\u2019s assassination three weeks later made       Lyndon B. Johnson       the new commander in chief. Beloved by no one, LBJ was determined to avoid losing Vietnam to the Communists the way       Truman       had been blamed for losing China.June 10-12, 1963: otherwise ordinary days that deserve to live in glory and infamy.Mr. Engel is author, most recently, of \u201cL.A. \u201956: A Devil in the City of Angels.\u201dCorrection  An earlier version of this article misstated Malcolm Browne\u2019s employer in 1963.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 15:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-days-that-changed-the-world-not-that-the-world-noticed-1497037365", "news_title": "Three Days That Changed the World, Not That the World Noticed", "keywords": "1963,jfk,the sixties,vietnam war,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Ex-FBI chief       James Comey       played well to the audience he cares about in Thursday\u2019s hearing, the media and bicoastal elites.       Donald Trump       may well have scored a win among the audience he cares about, Trump\u2019s America.Much was made of Mr. Comey saying he didn\u2019t trust Mr. Trump not to \u201clie\u201d about what transpired in their private meetings. Yet despite our president\u2019s dubious relation with veracity, Mr. Trump was shown to be the source of important truths. Mr. Comey had indeed told him he was not under personal investigation in the Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d matter. As Sen.       Marco Rubio,        not a big Trump fan, noted, this fact was remarkable for also being widely known among Senate colleagues and yet the one fact that never leaked to the media.Mr. Comey made much of conflicting statements about why he was fired. But it was Mr. Trump who, belying his own White House flackery, stated candidly it was because of the \u201cRussia thing.\u201d Even a non-Trump fan listening to the hearing could readily gather that Mr. Trump had reason to be frustrated that his administration was being hobbled by insinuations of treason for which there is zero evidence.As a rule, when there is no evidence of a particular act, the FBI does not investigate. The FBI is investigating now only because Democrats and Trump opponents so filled the airwaves with unsubstantiated speculation.Now here\u2019s a secret: Most Democrats understand the hunt will come a cropper. If a Trump associate brushed shoulders with a Russian-looking individual on the way to the men\u2019s room, it has leaked. The U.S. government sucks up and archives vast gobs of communication data.Yet the earnestly desired evidence of collusion has not materialized, so Democrats have turned instead to charging \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d with many already baying for impeachment.Here\u2019s another secret: Such \u201cprocess\u201d crimes don\u2019t impress voters when there is no underlying crime. If Mr. Trump leaned on his intelligence officials to remove the Russian cloud, this was ill-advised on the part of a president whose specialty is the ill-advised. But his behavior will also increasingly appear in a new light if it turns out Washington\u2019s tail-chasing has been partly driven by Russian fabrications.The Washington Post and CNN reported late last month that the single most shattering series of events for the       Hillary Clinton       campaign\u2014the events that began with FBI chief Comey\u2019s intervention in the race\u2014were partly influenced by planted Russian fake intelligence.Likewise the dossier of repulsive Trump allegations, assembled by a retired British spy supposedly tapping his Russian intelligence sources, also appears to have been a Russian plant and yet may have played a role in justifying the       Obama       administration\u2019s decision to launch an intelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.Think about it: To the extent the fruitless hunt for collusion has been promoted by planted Russian intelligence, Russian fiddling is playing a bigger role in shaping our politics today than it did during the campaign.By the way, we\u2019re not alleging supercompetence on Russia\u2019s part. Planting fake information is routine intelligence work. The World War II battle of Midway was won partly with fake information about water filtration on Midway Island.Mr. Comey ducked questions on these subjects, saying he would address them only in classified briefings. President Obama\u2019s former national intelligence director,       James Clapper,        in Australia this week gave a speech that again put the question of Trump collusion, for which he admitted he had no evidence, at the center of investigation despite the multifarious ways Russia meddled for which there\u2019s actually evidence.No surprise here: The FBI, CIA and NSA are eager to pose as scrupulous, disinterested arbiters of Russian meddling. They are not eager to be seen as victims and patsies of Russian meddling. To use Mr. Comey\u2019s phrase, the performance of our national intelligence directorate is the one rock that hasn\u2019t been turned over.So here\u2019s a question for Special Counsel       Robert Mueller,        a former FBI chief himself. Will he accept the current framing that his Russia investigation is about everything exceptwhether his former agency was semi-wittingly duped into some of its interventions by Kremlin danglings\u2014there\u2019s nothing to see here, move along.Or will he have the courage to ask the requisite questions the FBI, CIA and NSA don\u2019t want asked about their own, perhaps, gullibility and overeagerness to play in domestic politics because of their dislike of Mr. Trump?Washington\u2019s desire to get to the bottom of Russian meddling is probably less than you imagine. If not, the places to start are the Trump dossier and the role of Russian disinformation in promoting Mr. Comey\u2019s intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 15:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-trump-wins-1497037343", "news_title": "Why Trump Wins", "keywords": " cia,comey, fbi,intelligence community, nsa,robert mueller,senate intelligence committee,trump,James Comey,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,espionage,elections,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "KIEV, Ukraine\u2014A botched assassination attempt in Kiev is providing a glimpse into what officials here say is a string of killings orchestrated by the Kremlin, exposing a deadly underside of Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.Ukrainian authorities have arrested a Russian citizen who they believe traveled on a phony passport to Ukraine and was posing as a French journalist when he allegedly pulled a gun out of a gift-wrapped box and shot a Kremlin opponent he had invited to an interview last week.The assassination attempt went awry when the victim\u2019s wife pulled a gun of her own and opened fire on the would-be killer, according to an interview with the husband and wife. Both men were hospitalized and survived.Ukraine has seen a spate of murders and attempted killings far from the front lines since Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and covert military interventions across its neighbor\u2019s eastern border.The Kremlin denies involvement; Russia\u2019s state-controlled media often portray the killings as evidence of Ukraine\u2019s lawlessness.In March, a former Russian parliamentarian who had fled to Kiev with his wife was shot dead on a sidewalk in the center of the capital, in what Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko called an act of \u201cstate terrorism.\u201d His assassin was killed by the victim\u2019s bodyguard. Other unsolved murders include those of a pro-Ukrainian and a pro-Russian journalist. In March, a senior regional counterintelligence official was killed in a car bombing.Anton Gerashchenko, a lawmaker and adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said Russia had sent waves of killers to Ukraine in an attempt to destabilize its neighbor.\u201cThis is only one of the links in a chain,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of Russia\u2019s hybrid war against Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s security service in January said it had prevented a Russian-led attempt on Mr. Gerashchenko\u2019s life. The Kremlin hasn\u2019t commented on that specific matter.The suspect in last week\u2019s shooting, Artur Denisultanov-Kurmakayev, has long moved in criminal circles inside Russia, Ukrainian law-enforcement officials allege. Austrian police say they deported him to Moscow in 2008 after receiving a complaint that he threatened a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 there who was later killed by men linked to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov.Mr. Kadyrov has said he has no link to the murder in Austria.Austrian police said they lost track of Mr. Kurmakayev. The following year, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 he allegedly threatened was gunned down outside a grocery store in Vienna. An Austrian court later convicted three ethnic Chechens in connection with that murder. A fourth suspect, believed to be the gunman, escaped.Mr. Kurmakayev, posing as a journalist with a leading French newspaper, met three times with the target of last week\u2019s alleged attack, Adam Osmayev, and his wife, Amina Okuyeva, filming interviews and telling them that his publication wanted to take them to France, they said in the interview.The husband and wife\u2014Chechens who paired up as a sniper team fighting in Ukraine\u2019s east alongside Ukrainian government forces\u2014said they welcomed the publicity for their cause. But they missed apparent hints of a trap, they said: The man\u2019s email address was from a popular Russian provider; an internet search revealed no articles in his name; he appeared to try to provoke them into criticizing Ukraine.At a fourth meeting, Mr. Kurmakayev told them he wanted to give them a present, Mr. Osmayev and Ms. Okuyeva recalled. He asked them to sit in the back seat of his car with him in the passenger seat and handed his phone to Mr. Osmayev to video the presentation. Ms. Okuyeva took the telephone and caught sight of a Glock pistol inside the gift box as Mr. Kurmakayev opened it, with the words: \u201cHere\u2019s your present.\u201dHe fired two shots that hit Mr. Osmayev in the chest and arm, according to Mr. Osmayev and his wife. As Mr. Osmayev, 36 years old, fought back and wrestled for control of the pistol, he shouted, \u201cShoot! Shoot!\u201d Ms. Okuyeva pulled her Soviet-era Makarov pistol, a gift from Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, and fired at the attacker, she said. Her pistol jammed after a few shots, so she attacked his face with her hands as he shouted, \u201cI surrender,\u201d apparently incapacitated after a bullet had lodged in his spine.\u201cHe was creative, a good actor,\u201d Mr. Osmayev said. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t very professional.\u201dA Ukrainian court Wednesday ordered Mr. Kurmakayev arrested for two months, while an investigation takes place. A lawyer representing him couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. A Ukrainian official who was in the court said the accused called the incident \u201ca regrettable accident.\u201dMr. Osmayev left a hospital\u00a0Thursday\u00a0wearing a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt and was invited to visit Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov with his wife.

Americans with less severe mental-health conditions found that their insurance companies \u201ccarved out\u201d mental-health benefits from basic coverage, and the benefits were skimpy compared with coverage for physical ailments.As for clinical practice, mental-health professionals were kept separate from physicians treating patients for other medical conditions and rarely interacted with them. The rationale for this division was to avoid the stigma of mental disorders, but it only served to reinforce the stigma. At the cancer center where I trained, we had scores of oncologists and thousands of cancer patients\u2014but just one psychiatrist.Thankfully, this long era of separation and indifference seems to be coming to an end. In the decades ahead, there is every reason to expect that treatment for mental health will finally become integrated into mainstream medicine.A key reason for the shift is the mounting evidence that depression, anxiety and substance abuse\u2014as well as more severe conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder\u2014often occur alongside other chronic illnesses. A 2011 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study suggests that some 30% of medical outpatients and patients admitted to general hospitals suffer from a range of mental illnesses, often undiagnosed and untreated.The failure to address these problems in a more comprehensive way is costly. According to researchers at the University of Washington, mental-health conditions account for some $200 billion a year of U.S. health-care spending. But they also add to other medical expenses. When depression, anxiety and other conditions afflict patients with chronic illnesses, the costs shoot up. Consider patients with congestive heart failure. Their average monthly health care amounts to $1,846, according to a 2008 Milliman research report, but when these patients also suffer from depression, the average cost shoots up to $2,567 a month. Even for relatively simple chronic conditions such as hypertension, depression increases costs from $550 a month to $960.These extra costs largely arise not from mental-health care but from extra dollars spent for medical services. Picture an anxious cancer patient, fearing some new twinge or bump, rushing to an emergency room or demanding a CT scan.\u2018Doctors can literally walk patients over to psychologists and get them same-day care if needed.\u2019Some innovators are already working to integrate mental health into general care. For years, the 16-physician group Central Medical Clinic in Honolulu routinely screened its patients for depression, anxiety and similar conditions\u2014but, like many small practices, it couldn\u2019t provide proper mental-health treatment. A few years ago, the clinic invited psychologists in a separate practice to share their office space. Doctors can literally walk patients over to psychologists and get them same-day care if needed.In Illinois, Advocate Health Care also uses \u201cco-location\u201d this way, employing 13 mental-health providers in eight of its busiest primary care practices in the Chicago area. Advocate now systematically screens all patients 65 and older who are in the emergency room or admitted to hospital for depression and anxiety. Those who screen positive are seen by behavioral-health specialists within 24 hours.Such consultations are increasingly done via telemedicine, since psychiatrists can be in short supply. At Kaiser Permanente\u2019s mid-Atlantic facilities, a psychotherapist is available 24/7 by video for patient consultations. This is especially useful for those needing urgent care for depression or suicidal thoughts.Other pioneers are using technology to link physicians, patients and mental-health specialists in what they call \u201cvirtual collaborative care.\u201d One young company, Manhattan-based Quartet Health, uses predictive modeling to review claims and other data to identify patients who might have undiagnosed or poorly managed mental-health issues, such as those who make frequent emergency room visits for chest pain without being admitted for heart attacks. Quartet then performs a comprehensive online mental-health assessment and offers tailored solutions, including virtual or in-person therapy.This shift in care remains a work in progress, but physicians and companies are remaking what was long an isolated, ignored area of medicine. Integrating mental health into routine care will make our health-care system more humane and affordable\u2014and make all of us healthier.\u2014Dr. Emanuel is a vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania and the chairman of its Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy.

It was released by the ethics group, CREW, on Friday.If Mr. Scavino violates the rule in the future, Ms. Galindo-Marrone wrote, \u201cwe will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law, which could result in further action.\u201dThe Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency charged with investigating whether federal employees violate laws.

This provision allows a surviving spouse to receive the unused portion of the partner\u2019s federal estate-tax exemption\u2014a move that can shelter millions extra in assets from tax.For example, the federal estate-tax exemption in 2017 is $5.49 million per individual on assets other than those left to a spouse, which are tax-free. If a wife dies this year and leaves $1 million to heirs other than her husband, then her executor can make a portability election and preserve her remaining $4.49 million exemption\u2014immediately lifting the husband\u2019s total exemption to $9.98 million.Congress passed the portability provision in 2010, enabling married couples to make tax-saving moves after the death of the first spouse. Before it was enacted, the unused exemption of the first-to-die was often lost if the couple didn\u2019t set up special trusts, and many people didn\u2019t.But the new provision came with its own hitch: The portability election had to be made within months of death on an estate-tax return. Many executors and advisers were unaware of the benefit, especially if the estate wasn\u2019t taxable. Very few estates have owed federal death duties since the exemption was raised to $5 million per person, plus inflation adjustments, beginning in 2011.Since the provision passed, the\u00a0IRS has received numerous requests for portability relief due to missed deadlines. Each request for relief has a fee of up to $10,000, plus adviser costs.The new procedure is much simpler.\u201cIt\u2019s a welcome announcement that benefits both estates and the IRS, freeing the agency to use resources on other issues,\u201d says       Beth Kaufman,        an attorney with Caplin & Drysdale in Washington.Now, executors for estates of people who died from 2011 to Jan. 2, 2016 have until\u00a0Jan. 2, 2018\u00a0to file an estate-tax return and make a portability election. Normally, the agency will accept it as long as the estate wasn\u2019t required to file a return and didn\u2019t file one.Executors for estates of people dying after Jan. 2, 2016 have two years from the date of death to file an estate-tax return and make the election.Executors who miss either of these new deadlines will need to request individual relief.Write to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 15:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-estate-tax-payers-just-got-a-reprieve-from-the-irs-1497035837", "news_title": "Many Estate-Tax Payers Just Got a Reprieve from the IRS ", "keywords": "estate tax,irs,tax deduction,tax exemption,wealth advisor,wealth manager,Internal Revenue Service,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,property taxes"}, {"content": "SUNDERLAND, England\u2014The biggest surprise in Thursday\u2019s U.K. parliamentary election was the ruling Conservative party\u2019s loss of its majority, but there was another upset: The city of Newcastle counted its votes faster than next-door Sunderland.Separated by a half-hour drive, bad blood between these two northeast cities runs back to the English Civil War of the 1600s. They faced off as shipbuilding centers in the latter part of the following century. Newcastle United and Sunderland are also bitter soccer foes\u2014a rivalry dating to the 1880s.But for the last 25 years, Sunderland held undisputed bragging rights in one contest; Its southern voting constituency has counted and reported its tallies faster than all of Britain\u2019s other 649 constituencies on parliamentary election nights.It did that by building a team of specially trained high schoolers, who sprint ballot boxes from delivery cars to a counting center. Off-duty bank tellers tally the votes. Over the years, Sunderland won national acclaim akin to Dixville Notch, N.H., which prides itself on reporting its vote count first on U.S. election nights.Unlike Dixville Notch, with just nine voters, the Sunderland district tallied 41,000 ballots Thursday. This time around, though, Newcastle\u2019s central constituency, with 37,000 votes, beat them.The coup was no accident. Newcastle election officials conducted practice runs of the drive from polling stations to the tallying center, figuring out ways to avoid snafus like road construction. They saved precious seconds by carrying their ballot boxes in the passenger seats of cars, rather than the trunks. That allowed volunteers\u2014sprightly students recruited from the local university\u2019s sports-science department\u2014to more quickly grab the votes and sprint them inside to waiting counters.Bill Crawford       is the mastermind behind Newcastle\u2019s quick-vote-counting plan. Until 2015, he was the brains behind Sunderland\u2019s two-decade-plus reign. After Mr. Crawford, 63 years old, retired, Newcastle\u2019s city council asked him to help improve its vote-counting operations.He doesn\u2019t feel like a turncoat. He has always lived in Newcastle, anyway, despite working in Sunderland.\u201cYou leave. People move on,\u201d he said. \u201cI retired from Sunderland, and the team I left there were hugely capable. I\u2019d handpicked everyone.\u201dA Sunderland spokesman said he wanted to \u201ccongratulate my opposites in Newcastle for ensuring their count was well run, efficient and accurate.\u201d He added, \u201cSunderland doesn\u2019t see electoral counts as races or competitions.\u201dSunderland\u2019s vote-counting run started in 1992, when Britain granted it official status as a city. That same year, Sunderland\u2019s soccer team made it to the championship game of England\u2019s top tournament. Mr. Crawford, the city\u2019s head of electoral services, wanted to further fuel all that publicity with a vote-counting effort that would turn heads nationally.British television now routinely shows footage of Sunderland high schoolers scurrying into the counting venue with boxes of votes, just minutes after polls close at 10 p.m.Sunderland had recently been feeling the pressure from its neighbor. Newcastle\u2019s central constituency reported 350th out of 650 in 2010. It jumped to fifth in 2015. Newcastle made headlines last year when it edged out Sunderland in the nationwide Brexit referendum. Thursday\u2019s poll, though, was the first shot at a general parliamentary election.Things didn\u2019t start out well for the challenger. The first ballot box arrived at Newcastle\u2019s counting center at 10:06 p.m. That was about three minutes slower than what Mr. Crawford was used to back in Sunderland.But then most boxes arrived within the next 15 minutes, easing his worry. At 11 p.m., an election official walked onstage in the tallying center to announce results, as per British tradition.The vote counting defeat came on the heels of another Newcastle triumph in the rivalry. Newcastle United last month was promoted to English soccer\u2019s top tier. Sunderland, meanwhile, was demoted from it. \u201cNewcastle have swapped places with Sunderland for the second time in a month,\u201d Gary Lineker, a soccer announcer and former star, tweeted late Thursday.Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 14:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-other-u-k-poll-upset-newcastle-counts-faster-than-sunderland-1497034579", "news_title": "The Other U.K. Poll Upset: Newcastle Counts Faster Than Sunderland ", "keywords": "uk elections, vote counting,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Before he began clicking through a PowerPoint presentation on Republican health-care options this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a private warning to his Senate Republicans: If they failed to pass legislation unwinding the Affordable Care Act, Democrats could regain power and establish a single-payer health-care system.Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) has been nearly as downcast in his public comments about Senate Republicans\u2019 chances of passing sweeping legislation to overhaul the country\u2019s health-care system. Unlike House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.), who maintained a sunny optimism as House Republicans feuded, Mr. McConnell has taken a measured tone on the health-care bill\u2019s prospects in his chamber while Republicans work to finish a draft bill as soon as early next week.\u201cWe\u2019re getting closer to having a proposal,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters this week, with characteristic reserve. Late last month, he said he didn\u2019t know how Senate Republicans would get the votes needed to clear the health-care bill.The majority leader\u2019s approach has left lawmakers and aides in both parties guessing as to whether Mr. McConnell\u2019s stance reflects the sheer difficulty of passing polarizing legislation without losing more than two GOP votes\u2014or whether a more complicated strategy is afoot.Playing down the Senate GOP\u2019s chances of passing a bill could trigger less opposition from champions of the Affordable Care Act, shielding Senate Republicans from some of the pressure that deluged the House before a GOP health bill narrowly won approval. Mr. McConnell, GOP aides said, is always playing chess when others are playing checkers.\u201cThere is always a wilier strategy where Mitch is concerned,\u201d said a fellow Kentuckian, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth.Known as one of the most skilled political and procedural operators on Capitol Hill, Mr. McConnell\u2019s private strategy on health care is known to few, even among Senate Republicans. Among the biggest questions is whether he would bring a bill up for a vote even if it didn\u2019t have enough support to pass.Such a step risks infuriating President       Donald Trump,        who has seen little of his legislative agenda enacted by Congress. But should the bill lack support, voting on it anyway could demonstrate that a health-care overhaul simply can\u2019t pass the Senate, enabling Republicans to move on to a rewrite of the tax code.Senior GOP senators have said they expect Mr. McConnell would hold a vote even if the bill were likely to fail, though other lawmakers and aides note that Mr. Ryan had pledged to do the same, right up until he pulled the bill in March. An altered version passed the House last month.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense at present we need to have a vote regardless,\u201d said Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.).Supporters of Obamacare have targeted centrist Republican senators in recent days in a bid to peel them away from supporting the GOP bill, arguing that the bill-writing process isn\u2019t transparent and that the bill would reduce the insurance coverage gains that have occurred under the ACA. Some of that campaign is playing out on Twitter under the hashtag #showusthebill.The campaign to save the 2010 health law has major backing from Democrats anxious to preserve the signature domestic achievement of the Obama administration, including MoveOn.org and Organizing for Action. Much of the work is being carried out by an organization staffed by many ex-Obama administration officials, Protect Our Care, and health-care industry groups and patient advocacy organizations have also thrown weight into the campaign.There are signs that Senate Republicans inched closer together this week as they hashed out some of the legislation\u2019s most vexing details. Leaders hope to send a draft of the bill early next week to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which will assess its cost and effect on health insurance coverage.The outlook is \u201cmore promising than before, but still problematic,\u201d said Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.).The Senate GOP\u2019s biggest sticking point has centered on the fate of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which divides red states almost down the middle.Republicans representing so-called expansion states, such as Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, are pressing for a longer phaseout of enhanced federal funding for the expansion. They are pushing for seven years, while Mr. McConnell has proposed three years, in a nod to budget hawks and the 32 GOP senators representing states that opted not to expand Medicaid. Lawmakers are also wrestling over how much to slow Medicaid\u2019s growth rate, a decision that determines the level of federal funding states receive.Another divisive issue is tax credits for people who don\u2019t get insurance from their jobs. Senate Republicans want the credits to be more generous than under the House-approved bill. They are debating how much more assistance to provide to low-income people or those in areas of the country with high-cost health care.Because beefing up the credits would require more funding, the Senate GOP bill is expected leave some ACA taxes in place, while others would be scrapped.Influential antiabortion groups have also been pushing lawmakers to insert provisions that would bar people from using tax credits and money put into health-savings accounts to pay for abortion and some contraceptive coverage, but those provisions have run into procedural problems, GOP aides said. Plans in the proposal to let states roll back some health benefits now mandated under the ACA already have inflamed consumer advocacy groups.Mr. McConnell has sought to bring reluctant senators on board by focusing on the fragile condition of the individual insurance markets in certain states, a tactic shared by White House strategists.\u00a0And he is expected to continue to minimize defections this month by helping to broker deals, such as more money for opioid addiction treatment, people tracking the discussions say.Many GOP strategists think Mr. McConnell is ultimately likely to lose GOP Sens.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, a libertarian-leaning conservative who frequently breaks from party leaders, and Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, a centrist with positions on Planned Parenthood and insurance regulation that are hard to bridge with those of others in her party.The other 50 senators, they calculate, could be brought around to support the bill, particularly if they see themselves as accountable for the outcome of the party\u2019s bid, and potentially in exchange for state-specific solutions tied to Medicaid or the individual insurance market.For example, one option would be to revise the tax credits to make them more closely pegged to an individual\u2019s income or cost of living. Several GOP senators from high-cost states such as Alaska, Maine, North Dakota and Pennsylvania could favor such a change.While most of the Capitol was mesmerized by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director       James Comey\u2019s       testimony Thursday, Mr. McConnell met at noon with a group of GOP senators focused on the Medicaid issue to continue their deliberations.\u201cEvery day it\u2019s three steps forward, two steps back,\u201d Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.) said of the Senate GOP\u2019s progress. Mr. McConnell, he said, is approaching the issue with clear-eyed pragmatism. \u201cIt\u2019s a really heavy lift, and he knows that.\u201d\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'McConnell Doesn\u2019t Show Cards on Health.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 14:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcconnells-reserved-approach-on-health-bill-leaves-lawmakers-guessing-1497034458", "news_title": "McConnell\u2019s Reserved Approach on Health Bill Leaves Lawmakers Guessing", "keywords": " aca,congress, donald trump, gop, health care,mitch mcconnell, republicans, senate,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A senior Republican senator has sharply criticized the Trump administration for not responding to requests for information from lawmakers other than committee chairs, defending the rights of his colleagues to get answers from federal agencies.In a blunt seven-page letter addressed directly to President Donald Trump, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) wrote that \u201call members need accurate information from the Executive Branch in order to carry out their Constitutional function.\u201dMr. Grassley\u2019s letter was prompted by an opinion rendered by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel concluding that the Trump administration had no obligation to turn over information to rank-and-file members of Congress\u2014an opinion Mr. Grassley labeled as \u201cnonsense.\u201d OLC concluded that it needed to cooperate only with requests from committee chairmen, who have the power to issue subpoenas.Republicans control the House and the Senate and chair all the committees, leaving Democrats fuming about their access to information from the new administration. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill have complained that routine requests for information have gone unanswered for months.A White House spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Grassley, whose panel has jurisdiction over Justice matters, said the OLC was mistaken in its analysis that the committee structure of Congress should play any role in determining whether information should be handed over to lawmakers.\u201cThe Constitution does not mention committees or committee chairmen at all. The committee structure in Congress is simply how the Legislative Branch has chosen to internally organize itself,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Grassley also criticized the OLC, writing that its memo showed a \u201cshocking lack of professionalism and objectivity\u201d and that the president was being \u201cill-served and ill-advised\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s attorneys in that office. The OLC is a unit of the Justice Department that helps the attorney general formulate responses to legal questions.\u201cImagine Congressional legal opinion instructing Members and staff to withhold all information about bills, nominations, or appropriations from most executive branch officials on the grounds that Congress has \u2018no constitutional obligation to accommodate information requests,\u2019\u201d he wrote, quoting a rationale from the OLC memo for the policy.\u201cMembers of Congress simply do not treat Executive Branch officials with such contempt and they do not deserve such treatment in return,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote.The frustration from Democratic lawmakers not receiving answers to inquiries from departments was visible on Wednesday as Transportation Secretary       Elaine Chao       testified before the Senate Commerce committee.Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) said he wrote to the department two months ago asking questions related to an infamous incident in which a doctor was dragged off a United Airlines flight. \u201cI\u2019ve received no response to my inquiry,\u201d he said.Ms. Chao, who also served as Labor Department secretary in the Bush administration, said it wasn\u2019t unusual for responses to be coordinated through the chairmen and ranking members of committees.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 14:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iowa-sen-grassley-criticizes-trump-over-access-to-information-1497034318", "news_title": "Iowa Sen.

The proposal will now be put to a vote by full IOC membership at a special meeting on\u00a0July 11 and 12. If approved, the host cities for both Games are expected to be named at the full IOC session in Lima, Peru, in September.IOC President       Thomas Bach       said initial reviews of candidacies of both Paris and Los Angeles, which are each bidding for the 2024 Games, presented the committee with \u201ca golden opportunity\u201d to award two Games to the two cities. He played down suggestions that the plan is to award 2024 to Paris and 2028 to Los Angeles, saying that \u201cboth cities are open to being approached by IOC after such a vote, and to discuss how to achieve a win-win-win situation.\u201dIn a statement, U.S. Olympic Committee chief executive       Scott Blackmun       said the Los Angeles bid for 2024 is \u201cnot only the most exceptional U.S. bid ever proposed, but is the exact right bid at the exact right time.\u201dThe Paris 2024 bid posted a statement on its official Twitter account that said, in part, \u201cwe continue to work hard to win the support of IOC Members and the broader sports family for a Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported last week\u00a0that Olympic leadership is moving toward a plan to award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles.

A person familiar with the USOC\u2019s thinking said its ultimate goal is to bring a Summer Olympics back to the U.S. and it feels this plan would achieve that.Mr. Garcetti and Los Angeles bid chairman       Casey Wasserman       said they welcomed the IOC board decision toward a 24/28 bid and added that they look forward to \u201cworking together to offer the best path forward for our city and the Olympic Movement\u2019s future.\u201dMr. Bach said the board is encouraged to move toward the 24/28 deal, as it is known, in part because both Paris and Los Angeles have put forth compelling bids at a time when other Western communities are growing skittish about hosting a Games. Of Olympic bids, he said, the public \u201cis getting suspicious.\u201d He added that many people feel that if powerful interests are uniting behind these projects, then those interests are likely lining their pockets. \u201cThis change in attitude, we could complain about it, but we should not ignore it,\u201d he said.Several prominent would-be Olympic hosts have seen their bids collapse or withdraw in recent years. An initial plan\u00a0to feature Boston as the U.S. candidate city for 2024 fell apart,\u00a0and a bid by\u00a0Rome\u00a0for 2024 was suspended last year, both amid broad public criticism for hosting the Games. Mr. Bach said the board is considering changes to future bid processes, including shortening the time of candidacy from two years to one.The board\u00a0on Friday\u00a0also finalized the program for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, which will feature several new events aimed at appealing to broader, younger audiences. Additions to the Tokyo program include 3-on-3 basketball and various mixed-gender events, including relays in track and field, swimming, and triathlon. In all, the 2020 Games will feature a net increase of 15 events over the 2016 Olympics while also reducing quotas for participating athletes by nearly 300.IOC Sport Director       Kit McConnell       said the changes were in effort to make the Olympics \u201cmore youthful, more urban, and more [equitable for] women].\u201d He added that the program changes aren\u2019t expected to increase the number of venues used in Tokyo.\u2014Matthew Futterman contributed to this article.Write to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 14:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/olympic-committee-to-name-2024-2028-host-cities-simultaneously-1497033662", "news_title": "Olympic Committee to Name 2024, 2028 Host Cities Simultaneously   ", "keywords": "2020 olympics,2020 summer games,2020 tokyo games,2024 olympics,2024 summer games,2028 olympics,2028 summer games,los angeles olympic bid,paris olympic bid,International Olympic Committee,olympics,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The reader\u2019s question: \u201cMy wife and I both work, and we\u2019re trying to figure out when each of us will retire.

And more moderate members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee\u2014including       Mike Kelly       of Pennsylvania,       Jim Renacci       of Ohio,       Erik Paulsen       of Minnesota and Pat Tiberi of Ohio\u2014are wary or outright opposed to border adjustment.\u201cThere\u2019s not consensus,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus leader from North Carolina, told reporters Friday, acknowledging divides within the Freedom Caucus. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re trying to kill it. It\u2019s just the political reality is that it\u2019s dead.\u201dRepublicans say they are still on track to pass a major tax bill this year and that they agree on 80% of the plan. But they haven\u2019t released a bill, and intraparty fractures over border adjustment and other revenue-raising provisions are proving challenging. Also, to move a tax bill through the Senate without Democratic votes, they first need to adopt a budget, and that is a task they are still struggling with because of divides over fiscal goals and spending priorities.Mr. Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman       Kevin Brady       released their tax plan nearly a year ago and the border-adjustment feature received little attention at the time. After       Donald Trump       won the presidential election, it became clear that Republicans would get a chance to shape the tax code the way they wanted, and the border adjustment started getting closer scrutiny.Retailers and conservative groups pounced, warning of devastating consequences. Enough GOP senators now oppose it to deny the plan a majority. Senate Finance Chairman       Orrin Hatch       of Utah said this week that he is still open to the idea and wants to hear more details. But he also said that any ideas that can\u2019t get a Senate majority are a \u201cwaste of time.\u201dMessrs. Brady and Ryan say they are working on proposals to soften the impact of the border adjustment, which opponents worry would drive up consumer prices, especially if currencies don\u2019t change in the way economists predict.\u201cHouse Republicans continue to work with our Senate colleagues and Trump administration officials, and we will coalesce around a unified Republican tax-reform plan,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan.The best remaining argument for border-adjustment advocates is that there is no clear Plan B.The border adjustment serves two important purposes in the Republican plan to lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and end taxes on U.S. companies\u2019 foreign earnings.By operating in effect like a tax on the trade deficit, it raises about $1 trillion over a decade to pay for the lower rate. And by basing taxation on the location of sales, not profits, it serves as a check on companies\u2019 ability to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad.Lower rates alone won\u2019t prevent companies from leaving the U.S., said Mr. Brady, a Texan.\u201cOthers, if they have solutions that can accomplish those goals, we will be open to working with them on those alternatives,\u201d he told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe invite anyone who has concerns with border adjustment to bring us their solutions.\u201dFreedom Caucus members are starting to pitch alternatives to the revenue gap, including making cuts in programs such as food stamps or letting tax reductions expire after nine years to try to comply with Senate rules forbidding expedited bills from adding to long-run budget deficits.Pairing cuts in safety-net programs with corporate and individual tax cuts could be politically toxic, especially in the Senate. Still, it is also the same formula as the House Republicans\u2019 health-care bill, which reduces Medicaid spending and lowers taxes on high-income households and health industries.Rep.       Chris Collins       (R., N.Y.), supports a border-adjusted tax, or BAT, but he declared it \u201cdead\u201d in an interview this week.\u201cThe Senate won\u2019t touch the BAT,\u201d said Mr. Collins, a member of the moderate Republicans known as the Tuesday Group. \u201cThe White House really seems ambivalent, at best, so I think you can assume there\u2019s no BAT coming forward.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-09 13:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-push-paul-ryan-to-back-off-border-tax-idea-1497030619", "news_title": "Republicans Push Paul Ryan to Back Off Border-Tax Idea ", "keywords": "border adjusted tax,border adjustment tax,congress,paul ryan,tax,Target,TGT,the Retail Industry Leaders Association,Freedom Caucus,The Senate,Ways and Means Committee,Paul Ryan,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,department stores"}, {"content": "The World Trade Organization\u00a0Friday\u00a0ruled the U.S. failed to adequately eliminate all illegal state subsidies to             Boeing Co.        BA 1.27%       in a move that could trigger retaliatory sanctions from the European Union next year.The ruling comes as the new U.S. administration reviews its participation in the multilateral trade group and Chicago-based Boeing presses a separate case against Canada over alleged predatory pricing of jetliners made by Montreal-based             Bombardier Inc.             that has strained relations between the countries.The WTO\u2019s verdict levels the score in the long-running spat between the U.S. and the EU over financial support for Boeing and         Airbus SE,       with the latter already criticized by the trade body last year for funding received from member states to develop new aircraft.Boeing and Airbus, which is based in Blagnac, France, compete fiercely for airliner orders and for years have accused one another of winning business through illegal government handouts benefiting programs such as the A380 superjumbo and 787 Dreamliner.The latest WTO decision opens the door for the EU to impose tariffs against a range of U.S. goods and services beyond aerospace. However, trade experts said this was unlikely because defendants can make small changes in their rules to avoid tariffs.Both Airbus and Boeing claimed victory in the case, arguing the ruling bolsters their cases that the other is unfairly benefiting from government handouts.Airbus Chief Executive       Tom Enders       called it \u201ca great victory\u201d that demonstrated \u201chow Boeing continues to seek the benefits from this extensive illegal support, at the great expense of a level playing field in the world-wide aviation industry.\u201dBoeing said Airbus and the EU had suffered \u201canother resounding defeat\u201d as the WTO said the European Union had failed to prove there was harm caused by the majority of the support provided to Boeing. These included state benefits and research and development funding provided by the Pentagon.\u201cThe WTO again categorically rejected Europe\u2019s and Airbus\u2019 claims,\u201d said Michael Luttig, Boeing\u2019s general counsel, echoing comments Friday from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Simon Lester, trade policy analyst at the Washington-based Cato Institute, said the ruling will likely be appealed, though the process could be protracted with the panel backed up on numerous cases.The decision follows a ruling last September when the WTO determined that the EU had failed to comply with a demand to remove subsidies or void their effect on Airbus.Aircraft-subsidy battles can take years to work their way through the regulatory process. The U.S.-European spat goes back 40 years. The two sides settled a previous dispute over subsidies in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage, and brought a case before the WTO.The EU soon-after filed a tit-for-tat complaint 12 years ago. The WTO in 2011 determined Boeing had benefited from state aid. The ruling was largely upheld a year later on appeal. In 2012, the U.S. said it had complied with the WTO\u2019s determination, which the EU challenged.The EU has a second complaint running against the U.S. over aid to Boeing from Washington state.Boeing also is challenging aid Bombardier has received. In April, the company filed a petition with the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission alleging Canadian state subsidies created an unfair competitive threat to its own 737 passenger jets.

This has long drawn the attention of scientists working to thwart counterfeiters.Now researchers at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and University of York have delved below the surface of the page to develop an authentication method that they say is cheap and tough to crack. Previous research has exploited surface variations in paper for similar aims, but the scientists in Britain went deeper because patterns within the paper are more complex than those on its surface\u2014and harder to tamper with.Sheets of paper are unique because of the way they are manufactured. Paper is typically made by pressing wood particles together (often along with whitening agents, dyes and coatings), a process that produces individual pages containing random and complex patterns. Those patterns, the scientists write, \u201care embedded within the bonded structure of the paper and hence are relatively well-protected against manual handling of paper.\u201dFor the new authentication technique to work, the scientists shine a light at a given piece of paper from behind and photograph it from the front, using an off-the-shelf digital camera and concentrating on a marked rectangle of roughly four square inches. The image is sent to a computer or smartphone, which uses software to translate data on the paper\u2019s texture into a QR code. That code is encrypted with a digital signature that assures its authenticity; otherwise, a malefactor might create a seemingly legitimate code matching the texture of a forged document.The process takes just 1.3 seconds, and it has worked flawlessly in laboratory experiments, the scientists say, accurately identifying real and fake documents. Authentication was even largely impervious to scribbling on the page, soaking it or heating it, although crumpling the page hurt the technique\u2019s accuracy.What might such a system look like in the real world? The scientists suggest imagining that every large bank note came with a digital \u201cfingerprint\u201d based on its unique beneath-the-surface pattern. A supermarket cashier receiving a $100 bill with this QR code printed on its face could run the bill through a low-cost reader that focuses on a marked area to ensure that the hidden texture there matched the one reported by the code\u2014and that the data was encrypted with the correct secret digital key. The scientists note that this approach is cheap and fast and would enable documents to be authenticated anywhere the necessary device was on hand.A second approach using the same technology could use the internet to refer to a central database of paper codes. Imagine an immigration officer encountering a traveler who presents a passport. The traveler\u2019s fingerprint could be taken to make sure the person matches the passport\u2014even as the passport\u2019s paper texture was read and compared with the texture recorded in a government repository. In this case, no QR code would be needed.As for producing a counterfeit\u2014a second piece of paper with precisely the same pattern as another\u2014the scientists say forget about it. The inner pattern of paper is hugely complex; the researchers note that their technique yields a digital fingerprint more detailed than those commonly used in iris-based recognition, a well-established means of identifying people. Said Feng Hao, one of the three scientists who worked on the project: \u201cWhat we have shown is that every piece of paper contains unique intrinsic features, just as every person has unique intrinsic biometric features.\u201d\u201cTexture to the Rescue: Practical Paper Fingerprinting Based on Texture Patterns,\u201d Ehsan Toreini, Siamak F.

At the Eurogroup meeting, they will also discuss ways to lighten the country\u2019s crushing debt burden.The measures were passed by a vote of 153 lawmakers from the ruling left-wing Syriza party and its junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, securing the majority in the 300-seat parliament.Among the measures voted on Friday was the extension of a freeze in pensions for one more year till 2022, the ability to bring tax cuts voted for 2020 forward by a year and concessions on labor rights for workers in the private sector until the end of the program in August 2018.If there is a deal on June 15, eurozone finance ministers will approve a bailout tranche of up to \u20ac11 billion ($12.33 billion), according to EU officials. Athens has to pay some \u20ac7 billion for bonds coming due in July and would be required to use the remaining tranche to pay up state arrears.The Eurogroup will also outline some debt relief measures that could be implemented after the end of Greece\u2019s current bailout program in August 2018, such as an extension of maturities on some bailout loans by up to 15 or 17 years, according to several officials.But these won\u2019t be sufficient for the International Monetary Fund to consider Greece\u2019s debt sustainable. As a result the Fund will only approve Greece\u2019s bailout \u201cin principle\u201d and its financing role will remain in limbo.

Now, northeast-based U.S. investors are playing a larger role and in many instances bringing dealmaking tactics from their day jobs to the track.Hedge-fund manager Solomon Kumin, who part-owned 2016 Preakness champ Exaggerator, is an active trader, regularly swapping stakes in horses, sometimes shortly before races and often in conjunction with partners. Kumin, 41 years old, recently bought a 33% stake in Twisted Tom, a thoroughbred currently listed as a 20-1 dark-horse contender in the Belmont.\u201cHe looks at each individual deal, kind of like it is a stock. \u2018Where are we buying it today? What can we afford to pay and what can we do with it?\u2019\u201d said Bradley Weisbord, who manages Kumin\u2019s portfolio of more than 50 horses.Weisbord said his client, founder of New York-based Folger Hill, doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert horseman.\u201cSol will tell you that he wouldn\u2019t know the difference between a 2 year old and a 4 year old\u201d horse, Weisbord said.Kumin\u2019s strategy, Weisbord says, is to largely focus on minority stakes in proven horses, allowing him to own a relatively wide collection of horses that have a chance to win races immediately.Klarman, the 60-year-old founder of Boston hedge fund Baupost Group, takes a more patient approach. A widely admired practitioner of so-called value investing, or making long-term bets on companies he hopes will appreciate, Klarman has spent tens of millions of dollars buying horses for more-than two decades, according to people in the industry. His focus is on buying yearlings, or unraced horses under two years old, at auction in hopes they will develop into top contenders for the sport\u2019s biggest races.While he once worked with a partner, he has slowly been ramping up his own purchases, including spending $640,000 on two colts at the Ocala Breeders\u2019 Sales Company\u2019s 2017 March sale. Cloud Computing, this year\u2019s Preakness winner, is 95% owned by Klarman, said two people familiar with the matter.After the Preakness win, the billionaire called the race \u201cthe culmination of 25 years of hard work and learning and trying to figure this game out.\u201dViola, founder and executive chairman of trading firm             Virtu Financial Inc.,       came to the sport after the financial crisis. Following the Derby win in May, the 61-year-old said when he made the decision to get back into racing after owning horses in the late 1990s, he called Anthony Bonomo, a childhood friend from Brooklyn, for advice and the two pals formed a partnership that later purchased Always Dreaming in 2015 for $350,000.First prize at the Kentucky Derby paid $1.635 million.Viola owns several dozen horses through his St. Elias Stable, and has been an active buyer at auctions in Keeneland and Saratoga. His experience shows the speculative risk inherent in the business: Viola spent $700,000 on Battalion Runner at the same sale in which he acquired Always Dreaming. So far, Battalion Runner has earned $200,000 in his four career races.Although Viola doesn\u2019t have a horse running in Saturday\u2019s Belmont, he does have a rooting interest. Weisbord said that Viola is one of several investors that purchased a share of Irish War Cry\u2019s future earnings at stud, in a deal that was finalized before the Kentucky Derby. Irish War Cry is the 7-2 favorite in Saturday\u2019s Belmont.Such stud deals can be lucrative, especially for a horse that has a Triple Crown victory on his resume. Nyquist, last year\u2019s Derby winner, currently stands at Darley Stud for $40,000. A stallion could cover about 150 mares or more in a year.The other Belmont horse linked to Wall Street is Senior Investment, which is owned by former Reebok CEO Paul Fireman, who now runs a Waltham, Mass., investment firm. The horse embodies its owner\u2019s value-based approach to the sport. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be throwing millions at yearlings or even proven horses, no matter how much money you have. Certainly buying value is important,\u201d says Senior Investment trainer Ken McPeek. \u201cThat\u2019s why he named his horse that.\u201dWall Street is hardly new to the racing game but the financiers\u2019 recent wins have brought \u201cmore public knowledge that they are involved,\u201d said Andy Serling, a former options trader who is currently a handicapper for the New York Racing Association.In the mid 1980s, billionaire       Carl Icahn       invested heavily in a breeding operation called Foxfield Thoroughbreds and at one point owned hundreds of horses. Icahn sold all his horses and shut down the breeding operation in 2004.Rob Whiteley, who was Foxfield\u2019s director of operations, said this week that the breeding business was profitable but Icahn\u2019s \u201cmany interests took him elsewhere.\u201dIcahn\u2019s focus on breeding and owning stables put him in direct competition with the deepest pockets in horse racing, belonging to royal families from the Middle East. The oil-rich royals, most notably Sheik Hamdan bin Rashid al Maktoum of Dubai, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on racing and breeding operations in recent decades.Even on Wall Street, few have the means to compete with the sheikhs, so investors tend to pick their spots more carefully.The winner of the Belmont Stakes will collect a purse of $800,000 but even that tidy sum likely wouldn\u2019t be enough to put owners in the black.For example, since 2000, horses co-owned by Klarman, who races under the name Klaravich Stables, and his partner William Lawrence have earned more than $29 million, according to Equibase. Of the 43 horses that have run for Klaravich Stables this year through Thursday, only eight have earned more than their purchase price, the Equibase data show. Klarman has told associates he doesn\u2019t see it as primarily a money-making venture.Many horse owners aren\u2019t particularly concerned with making money, their involvement rooted in either their love of the sport or, in some cases, a search for a tax write-off.\u201cI usually say to a newcomer in the game, 90% of the people lose money,\u201d says Weisbord.Write to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 13:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-money-managers-shoot-for-a-triple-crown-at-belmont-1497029095", "news_title": "Wall Street Money Managers Shoot for a Triple Crown at Belmont", "keywords": "horse racing,harness racing,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose by eight in the past week to 741, according to oil-field services company         Baker Hughes Inc.The U.S. oil-rig count typically is viewed as a proxy for activity in the sector.

The party, formed in the 1970s by firebrand preacher       Ian Paisley,        stands out in the U.K. for its socially conservative views on issues including gay marriage and abortion. Drawing its support overwhelmingly from Northern Ireland\u2019s pro-British community, which is mostly Protestant, the DUP has also set out a Brexit wish-list that highlights demands aimed at protecting Northern Ireland\u2019s small economy, positions that could now have increased influence on the U.K\u2019s overall Brexit strategy.In its manifesto, the DUP published a 30-point plan detailing its objectives for Brexit. Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. to share a land border with another European Union member\u2014Ireland\u2014and its economy is as closely entwined with its southern neighbor as it is with England, Scotland and Wales.Many of the DUP\u2019s demands chime with London\u2019s objectives in Brexit talks. The party said it wants a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border with Ireland and a comprehensive free-trade and customs deal with the EU. Mrs. May also wants a free-trade accord to replace the U.K.\u2019s membership in the EU\u2019s single market, which sets common rules for goods and services.In another point of agreement with the Conservatives, the DUP has called for maintaining the common travel area that for almost a century has allowed free movement of people between the U.K. and Ireland.But the Northern Irish party is hostile to one of Mrs. May\u2019s signature positions: that no deal in Brexit talks is better than a bad deal. Senior DUP lawmakers have expressed concern that no deal would be the bigger threat to Northern Ireland\u2019s vital trade and travel ties with Ireland. They have also said they don\u2019t want special status for Northern Ireland within the EU\u2014an idea floated by the Irish republican Sinn F\u00e9in party\u2014fearing that would inevitably weaken Northern Ireland\u2019s ties to the rest of the U.K.Analysts say these positions suggest Mrs. May could come under pressure from her new partner to deliver a Brexit deal on trade and not veer toward an abrupt break with the bloc, which until now had been her fallback strategy. The party is also likely to want assurances that agricultural subsidies and economic development funds will continue to flow to Belfast.Assuming it can get some assurances on such issues, the DUP won\u2019t offer much opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s plan for a clear break with the bloc, said John Springford, director of research in London for the Centre for European Reform.More straightforward demands for extra cash to pay for new infrastructure for Northern Ireland may also be forthcoming. Graham Walker, a politics professor at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, said a perennial DUP concern is security, a legacy of decades of bloody violence known as the Troubles that came to an end with a 1998 peace deal.\u201cThe DUP may press for extra funding for security and policing,\u201d he said, especially as one of the London Bridge attackers who killed eight and injured scores in a terror rampage Saturday had apparently lived for a time in Ireland.Mrs. May said Friday after seeking Queen Elizabeth\u2019s permission to form a new government that her administration would work with the DUP to deliver Brexit.\u201cOur two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom,\u201d Mrs. May said in an address outside her Downing Street residence.\u201cThis will allow us to come together as a country and channel our energies towards a successful Brexit deal,\u201d she added.Speaking in Belfast, DUP leader       Arlene Foster       said her party would enter discussions with the Conservatives \u201cto explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.\u201dWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 13:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-party-from-northern-ireland-plays-kingmaker-in-u-k-election-1497012405", "news_title": "Small Party From Northern Ireland Plays Kingmaker in U.K. Election ", "keywords": "brexit, democratic unionist party, dup, election, northern ireland, theresa may, uk election,European Union,Theresa May,Arlene Foster,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "PNC Investments LLC has begun offering mutual-fund share classes stripped of any distribution fees in its tax-qualified brokerage retirement accounts, a move that coincides with the deadline for initial implementation the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule.Such lower-cost shares are now being launched by many fund companies in part to help advisers and brokers comply with the new retirement-savings rule, which is aimed at curbing conflicted advice on retirement accounts. The rule will require that financial advisers who make recommendations on assets in individual retirement accounts receive compensation that doesn\u2019t offer them an incentive to choose one product over another for a client.The new \u201cclean shares\u201d offered by PNC Investments, the broker-dealer subsidiary of             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.,        PNC 0.66%       will charge only the fee to manage and operate the funds. The shares won\u2019t include any fees to compensate brokers for providing advice or 12b-1 fees, which pay for marketing, printing and prospectuses and other shareholder services.With the new shares, broker-dealers and other distributors will have to charge directly for their services, as PNC Investments plans to do, which will make it clear to investors how much they\u2019re paying to whom and for what. Firms that wish to continue to receive commissions can sell clean shares, then set their own commissions that are the same across products, as PNC Investments plans to do.\u201cCharging a direct commission helps to bring more transparency to the clients on what they are paying for,\u201d said       Robert Santillo,        PNC Investments\u2019 managing director of product management and research. The new share classes also remove complexity because one share class can be used rather than numerous different types, which can be confusing to investors, he says.PNC Investments plans to offer the new clean shares in its brokerage retirement accounts as well as to clients in its fee-based advisory business\u2014which charges a fee based on a client\u2019s assets under management. It has already converted more than half of the existing assets in its fee-based advisory business to the new shares, and it plans to convert the remaining assets to the shares by year\u2019s end.In the next few months, PNC Investments also plans to offer the clean shares in its taxable accounts.The fiduciary rule remains under review by the Trump administration, but should it be altered or rescinded, that will have no bearing on PNC Investments\u2019 use of the clean shares, Mr. Santillo said.PNC Investments services about $50 billion in client assets through its bank broker-dealer model, part of its investment and retirement businesses.

After some time out of the public eye, he is now in the U.S. to promote the other artistic mode in which he has expressed his relentlessly dark view of modern France: photography.His new show \u201cFrench Bashing,\u201d at the Venus art gallery in New York City, provides a bleak portrait of his home country, with photographs of highway toll booths, barbed wire fences, stark suburban housing sprawl and gaudy tourist areas. He wants to challenge the idea of France as a country of high culture, great architecture and fine food and wine; he sees it instead as a tourist destination and a place of rampant, ugly overdevelopment. The differences between France and America, he says, are diminishing, and he thinks it\u2019s particularly ironic to expose his own country from across the pond.Mr. Houellebecq (pronounced wel-beck), 61, has long been one of France\u2019s best-known\u2014and most notorious\u2014writers. He is dismissive of political correctness and has been accused of misogyny, anti-Muslim bigotry and (more generally) nihilism, based in large part on the vulgar, resentful, unhappy characters in his novels. His first U.S. hit, \u201cThe Elementary Particles\u201d (1998), featured a protagonist who is obsessed with sex. Mr. Houellebecq says that his fictions do not necessarily represent his own beliefs.\u201cSubmission\u201d came out in January 2015, on the same day that two terrorists claiming allegiance to al Qaeda\u2019s offshoot in Yemen killed 12 people in a massacre in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. That week, a caricature of Mr. Houellebecq happened to be on the magazine\u2019s cover.The author, who lost a friend in the attack, canceled his promotional book tour and went into police protection because of fears that he might be targeted as well. (In 2001, he had called Islam \u201cthe dumbest religion.\u201d) Some accused him of feeding into an anti-Muslim agenda with \u201cSubmission,\u201d in which university teachers have to convert to Islam to keep their jobs and polygamy is allowed and even encouraged. The book sold more than 100,000 copies in France that week.After spending time in Germany, his next big public appearance came in 2016, with a show of photography at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Mr. Houellebecq has been taking pictures for decades, but previously had only one small show in Paris in 2014. When asked why he decided to show his photographs, he only says, through a translator, \u201cI had the opportunity.\u201d\u201cFrench Bashing\u201d includes his own photographs as well as items repurposed as part of the exhibition. One room of the gallery features his shots of bleak industrial scenes under a dim glow. The pictures are mostly empty of people. \u201cHe uses his pen for portraits and his lens for landscapes,\u201d says Venus founder Adam Lindemann.In a second room, bright white light shines over images of kitschy tourist memorabilia from both France and elsewhere, such as photos of pastel beachside hotels and cheery signs and posters. Plastic place mats featuring different destinations cover the floor.Sitting in the gallery one recent afternoon, drinking a bottle of Beck\u2019s beer and smoking an electronic cigarette, Mr. Houellebecq says that he chose to photograph the industrial areas outside of Paris after noticing how much they had changed since he was young. He grew up north of Paris with his grandmother after his mother moved to Brazil to be with a boyfriend. Back then, the area was mostly farmland. Mr. Houellebecq earned a degree in agricultural engineering, but the career didn\u2019t suit him.In the years after he graduated in 1980, he was unemployed, got married, had a son, divorced and struggled with depression. He also began writing poetry. He went on to write six best-selling novels, including \u201cThe Map and the Territory\u201d (2010), which won France\u2019s prestigious Goncourt prize. He now lives alone in Paris.He has drawn criticism for his disparaging depictions of women and minorities in his books. He tends to brush it off. \u201cIt seems like there are thousands of sources of political correctness and thousands more sources every day,\u201d he says. In France, he adds, it\u2019s politically correct to be a vegetarian now, but \u201cin six months, it\u2019ll be something else.\u201dMr. Houellebecq says that he doesn\u2019t see Islam itself as a negative force, only extremism. He is interested in the idea of the \u201chomme \u00e9conomique,\u201d or economic man\u2014the notion that people are driven just by material incentives and make choices rationally. The idea, he says, is \u201cdestructive and weighs you down.\u201d That\u2019s why, he thinks, some people look to religion as a way to \u201cinfringe on their freedom and limit their freedom.\u201dLooking back to \u201cSubmission,\u201d Mr. Houellebecq says that the hardest parts to write were the sex scenes. \u201cLanguage isn\u2019t really made for descriptions of sensual physical experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dissolution of perceptions in sex which makes everything kind of blurry.\u201d Fear is clearer. \u201cWhen one is scared, we have a tendency to remember the event really well because the senses are really precise,\u201d he says.He won\u2019t say when he might return to writing. When asked what he plans to do next, he responds, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

But C\u00e9zanne\u2019s portraits have rarely gotten the attention of his still lifes and landscapes. Now they\u2019re the focus of a Parisian exhibition, coming to the U.S. next year, which asks whether he was more of a people person than previously thought.\u201cIt\u2019s true he wasn\u2019t a conventionally social person,\u201d says       Mary Morton       of Washington\u2019s National Gallery of Art, the show\u2019s American venue. C\u00e9zanne, she adds, probably didn\u2019t have \u201ca terribly warm and affectionate relationship with his wife.\u201dA few encounters with the elder C\u00e9zanne (1839\u20131906) led some people to speculate that he suffered from haphephobia, or a pathological fear of being touched.Whatever the psychological hurdles he faced, they did not keep the artist from portraiture. \u201cPortraits by C\u00e9zanne\u201d includes 60 paintings and a number of drawings. The show opens on June 13 at Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and runs through Sept. 24, before traveling to London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery (Oct. 26\u2013Feb. 11, 2018) and the National Gallery, starting March 25.Organizers say that the exhibition is the first museum show devoted to the whole of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s portraits, which will be grouped according to subject\u2014including the artist\u2019s wife, his uncle and Proven\u00e7al peasants. One category that\u2019s missing: commissioned portraits to please elegant strangers\u2014the bread and butter of many of the artist\u2019s contemporaries. C\u00e9zanne, born into a banker\u2019s family in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence, received a stipend from his father and never had to earn money that way.C\u00e9zanne was \u201cnot interested in creating pleasing likenesses,\u201d says       John Elderfield,        the show\u2019s chief curator and chief curator emeritus of New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. Rather, the artist focused \u201con giving a vivid sense of the presence of the person he painted.\u201d The show has been several years in the planning.The artist\u2019s refusal to be ingratiating, as Mr. Elderfield describes it, resulted in portraits that often seem to lack any emotional content whatsoever, leading more than one critic to compare C\u00e9zanne\u2019s often blank, masklike faces to his signature apples and pears.This apparent lack of emotion is most apparent in the many portraits of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s wife, Hortense. Four related portraits of her (1888-90) are displayed together in Paris. \u201cAll maintain the same blank look,\u201d says Mr. Elderfield, adding that in moving back and forth between them, \u201cthere is an odd sense that maybe they represent sisters rather than the same person.\u201dThe artist is \u201cplaying\u201d with conventional expectations, says the National Gallery\u2019s Ms. Morton. \u201cWe are trained to look for psychological character in the eyes and face, but C\u00e9zanne often displaces that to color and space,\u201d as he would do in his still lifes and landscapes.Besides friends and family, C\u00e9zanne painted art-world acquaintances\u2014and, especially, himself. The earliest work in the Paris show is a self-portrait (1862-64), on loan from a private New York collection. Based on a photograph, it has the burning, direct gaze suggestive, today, of a defiant mug shot.Mr. Elderfield says that C\u00e9zanne \u201cwas especially careful not to appear to flatter himself,\u201d from his first self-portrait to the last, \u201cSelf-Portrait With a Beret\u201d (1898-1900), on loan from Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts. The intense eyes of earlier self-portraits have disappeared, and a halo-like beret hangs over the artist\u2019s sunken stare.In his last decades, living in the south of France, C\u00e9zanne was painting peasants, using the signature blues and reds of his landscapes and still lifes. The standout element in \u201cMan in a Blue Smock,\u201d on loan from the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is the peasant\u2019s bright-red kerchief, which seems to shimmer red down to his hands.French curator       Xavier Rey,        who worked on the d\u2019Orsay version of the show, sees these depictions of what he calls \u201canonymous people\u201d as the artist\u2019s final abandonment of traditional portraiture \u201cto focus on questions of geometry and color.\u201d Mr. Rey adds, \u201cThere is a projection of the artist himself onto these peasants.\u201d In those last years, ill with diabetes, C\u00e9zanne spent much of his time apart from his wife and son, who lived separately from him, first in Paris then later nearby in Provence.C\u00e9zanne had \u201csome strong friendships as a young guy,\u201d says Ms. Morton, \u201cbut he ended up living more or less like a hermit.\u201d Though she thinks stories about his touch phobia \u201chave been overplayed,\u201d she believes that he largely achieved \u201cphysical intimacy through painting\u201d his portraits. He touched his sitters, she says, by applying brush to canvas.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 13:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/was-cezannea-people-person-1497028561", "news_title": "Was C\u00e9zanne\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ta \u2018People Person\u2019?", "keywords": " art, galleries,museums, national gallery of art, orsay, paris travel, portraits by cezanne, washington travel,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,calendar of events,routine general news,theaters,entertainment venues,historical sites,gardens,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "Standing before the painting known as the \u201cPiet\u00e0 of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon,\u201d visitors to the Louvre witness the heartbreaking moment when the bruised body of Jesus Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has been given to his mother.It is a common scene, rendered by hundreds of artists in thousands of ways over the centuries, with those by Giotto,       Michelangelo       and Annibale Carracci among the most renowned. This one, painted by Enguerrand Quarton (c. 1410-1466), would surely be as celebrated had it not been hidden in a dark, provincial chapel, its creator unknown and then disputed, for so long.Among many art historians, the \u201cPiet\u00e0 of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon\u201d (c. 1445) is considered the greatest artwork of 15th-century France. Original in many aspects, it conveys not just sorrow and spirituality but also, especially in Mary, acceptance of God\u2019s plan for his son and hers.The painting was discovered in 1834 by a young inspector of historical monuments named Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2014later the author of \u201cCarmen,\u201d the novella that inspired Bizet\u2019s opera. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e found it in a church in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, a little town on the Rhone opposite Avignon. Decades then passed before it was shown in Paris at the 1904 Exhibition of French Primitives, which featured some 700 works of medieval and early Renaissance art. The next year, it was purchased for the Louvre.More time would elapse before Quarton was credited. Born in Laon, in the north of France, he had moved to Provence by at least 1444 (and probably before), where he became a prominent painter and illuminator. Quarton, familiar with Italian and Flemish art as well as French Gothic style, is known for two documented paintings: \u201cThe Virgin of Mercy\u201d (1452) and \u201cThe Coronation of the Virgin\u201d (1453-54), both more colorful, exuberant, highly detailed works that on first glance may seem unlike the stark, somber \u201cPiet\u00e0.\u201dBut in 1959,       Charles Sterling,        a scholar of 15th-century French art who worked as a curator at the Louvre and then, part-time, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dated it and identified Quarton as the author. He noted resemblances in the facial bone structures and the long fingers of the figures in the three works, parallels in the drapery of their clothing, and other stylistic similarities, and he matched the portrayal of the patron in the \u201cPiet\u00e0\u201d with a similarly attired one in \u201cThe Coronation.\u201dQuarton\u2019s haunting \u201cPiet\u00e0\u201d places Mary at the center. She is, unusually, old and weary. Her face is wrinkled, her nearly closed eyes have bags and her skin is as pale as her dead son\u2019s. Rather than being held in her arms, as in so many other depictions, he rests on her knee.She is the voice for the Latin inscription from Lamentations on the painting\u2019s perimeter: \u201cOh, all you who pass on this road, look and see if there be any suffering like mine.\u201d Yet, with her hands folded in prayer, she is resigned to the sacrifice she has just witnessed and experienced. She aches in silence.Steps away from Mary\u2014one on either side\u2014are St. John the Evangelist and St. Mary Magdalene. Like her, they are encircled with golden halos stamped with their names. They are youthful; there is color in their cheeks. John stoically cradles Christ\u2019s head with one hand and gently removes the crown of thorns with the other\u2014an unusual sight. Over his shoulder, in the distance and against a gold background, lies the city of Jerusalem.Mary Magdalene, her red hair trailing down her back, is still crying. Wiping her tears on the sculpted golden folds of her mantle, whose sheen is matched by that of the white underside of Mary\u2019s cloak, she plays her traditional role of anointing the body with oil, drawing from a jar decorated with stars.Christ\u2019s thin, arched body, against the dark blue of Mary\u2019s mantle, heightens the painting\u2019s drama. Quarton has paid close attention to anatomy, as can been seen in Christ\u2019s scarred rib cage, knees and feet. A trickle of blood flows from the wound in his side, but none oozes from his head, which is ringed by golden rays signifying his divinity.Throughout the painting, there are rhythmic spatial interrelationships. Christ\u2019s right arm parallels the diagonal of his legs, which is echoed in the tilt of Mary\u2019s head and the slant of Mary Magdalene\u2019s body. Hands are angled to parallel Christ\u2019s body or point to Mary. The heads of the main figures form an arc that is reflected back in Mary\u2019s hem.

He was out and about, openly trying to draw others to his radical view.Near a carpet shop on a side street in east London, the Ummah Fitness Centre bills itself as a spot for devout Muslims to box and lift weights. Men and women exercise separately, there are prayer breaks, and sayings from the Quran line the walls.For Butt, the gym was a place to trumpet extremist opinions and, amid the punching bags and barbells, look for like-minded friends. According to a person who recalled Butt\u2019s presence, the gym until recently was operated by a man known for his\u200b association with a radical Islamist group.Butt would say \u201cvery surprising things,\u201d said       Fahad Khan,        a cousin of Butt\u2019s wife who frequents the gym. He would proclaim that \u201cISIS is doing a very good thing,\u201d Mr. Khan said. He would say that \u201cthey\u2019re doing a very good thing for the sake of humanity.\u201dThe Saturday-night assault and two others in the U.K. in under three months have exposed the difficulty authorities face in keeping tabs on the many real and potential threats. In the U.K., roughly 23\u200b,000 people have appeared on authorities\u2019 radar\u200bover terrorism fears. The attacks also raise questions about coordination among European security services, given that one of Saturday\u2019s attackers had been detained in Italy last year trying to go to Syria.Beyond challenges like these that greater manpower might address, the attacks pose a policy conundrum for governments that honor liberty and free speech: How should they fight on an amorphous battlefield where conservative religious beliefs can shade into fanatical rhetoric and ultimately into terrorism? When do a person\u2019s views become something he or she should be arrested for?In the wake of Saturday\u2019s killings, Prime Minister       Theresa May       said there had been \u201ctoo much tolerance of extremism\u201d in the U.K. She called for harsher penalties for extremist-related crimes and a crackdown on online propagators of radicalism.Butt, for one, made no secret of his radical ideology. He can be seen in a television documentary, \u201cThe Jihadis Next Door,\u201d praying with well-known Islamist preachers. He publicly confronted Muslim leaders he considered too moderate. He proselytized in parks.At the gray Elizabeth Fry apartment complex in the east London area called Barking where he lived, Butt sometimes handed out candy to children and organized table-tennis tournaments. \u201cHe told us you are not going to go to heaven if you are not a good Muslim,\u201d said       Suad Mohammed,        16, who lives in a yellow-brick house flanking the complex.Some who came into contact with Butt reported him to the police for expressing extremist views or, in one case, for trying to radicalize their child. Many others, in a place where conservative religious beliefs are commonplace, shrugged off his words.The partner of one neighbor who complained to the police about Butt thought she was overreacting and told her she had been watching too many American films, he said.Said Mr. Khan, the member of Butt\u2019s extended family: \u201cYou only know that he has some views. We never had concrete evidence that he would have done these things.\u201dU.K. police said Butt was known to them but they had no evidence he was plotting violence.The three attackers\u2014Butt, a 27-year-old Pakistan-born British citizen,       Youssef Zaghba,        a dual Italian-Moroccan national who was 22, and       Rachid Redouane,        a 30-year-old Libyan-Moroccan pastry chef\u2014spent their final months living outwardly humdrum lives within miles of each other in east London.Zaghba taught gymnastics to children at a sports center. In May, Butt and Redouane attended male-only swimming sessions at a public pool, where Butt sometimes verbally jousted with others, according to the organizer of the swim outings,       Akhtar Uzzaman.Days before the assault at London Bridge and a nearby market, the three attackers met outside the Ummah gym. Just after midnight, they conferred before embracing each other and parting, according to security-camera footage.They fit a pattern of Islamic extremism in Britain. Of 264 people convicted of terrorism in the U.K. from 1998 to 2015, more than 20% had lived in east London, according to the Henry Jackson Society, a neoconservative think tank.The neighborhoods around Barking and nearby Ilford, where Butt, Zaghba and Redouane all spent time, are working-class areas transformed by immigrants from Africa, central Asia and Eastern Europe. Barking was for decades a stronghold of white families who relocated from East End London slums into new social housing after World War I, drawn to jobs at a nearby Ford plant.By 2011, under half of the area\u2019s residents were white, census data show, and around 14% were Muslim. The pub on Barking\u2019s main street serves African food. There is a Romanian convenience store and a halal butcher.\u201cAs nice a place as it is here, there are a few people in our community who think extremism is a good idea,\u201d said       Stephen Timms,        a local member of parliament who was stabbed in 2010 by a constituent protesting the Iraq war. \u201cThey seem to be mostly homegrown, so it\u2019s really difficult to spot them.\u201dIn the years since the 2005 London attacks, which left 52 people dead, Britain has largely succeeded in flushing extremism out of mosques, according to       Bob Quick,        a former Scotland Yard counterterror official.But as \u201cmosques got tougher in preventing such people...we\u2019ve seen extremist ideology and recruitment drift away to other places, especially gyms,\u201d Mr. Quick said. \u201cGyms offer a perfect opportunity for radicals. A lot of young guys go there, and these are prime targets for their extremist views.\u201dThe Ummah Fitness Centre, on the second floor of a building that is being renovated, became a meeting point for young Muslims. \u201cA strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than a weak believer,\u201d says a motto on its website. In deference to Islamic sensibilities, it doesn\u2019t play music.On a rack outside the gym, behind a copy of Men\u2019s Fitness magazine, there was a pamphlet on how better to \u201cKnow Muhammad,\u201d which railed against what it called the corruption of morality in Western culture.Ash Siddique, secretary of the nearby Al Madina Mosque, described the gym as a \u201ckind of an isolated, not inviting place. We don\u2019t know what could have been going on in there.\u201dButt could be seen often in the gym, where he sometimes sat behind its small reception desk and helped out, according to Qaiser Khan Niazi, who teaches taekwondo classes there. Mothers who came to pick up their children grew frustrated when managers, and on one occasion Butt, wouldn\u2019t let them enter. \u201cWe always had arguments with the management,\u201d Mr. Niazi said. \u201cIt caused so many problems.\u201dUntil recently, the fitness center was run by a man named Sajeel Shahid, according to Mr. Niazi. Mr. Shahid once operated a training camp in Pakistan that was attended by       Mohammed Sidique Khan,        the leader of the 2005 London attacks, according to testimony in a British court case. He was also a prominent member of Al Muhajiroun, a now-banned group whose followers were responsible for a quarter of all Islamist terror offences in the U.K. between 1998 and 2015, according to a Henry Jackson Society report.Mr. Shahid, who was never charged with terror offenses, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Mr. Naizi said Mr. Shahid told him recently he was no longer managing the gym. The manager of the women\u2019s side of the fitness center said he wasn\u2019t the owner. The gym\u2019s management didn\u2019t respond to requests for further comment.Butt, living a mile away in the tall apartment complex, had a young family, attended two mosques sporadically and went by the nickname Abz, short for       Abu Zaitun,        neighbors say. He had worked briefly for the London Underground.Butt would sometimes greet children who lived in the complex when they returned from school. locals said. He enjoyed cycling and supported the Arsenal soccer club. He died during the attack, shot by police, wearing an Arsenal shirt.Away from the neighborhood, Butt fraternized with several people who had formed the Al Muhajiroun group, whose stated aim is to establish a state governed by Shariah law. In 2013 he stood outside Parliament alongside Anjem Choudary, a radical preacher who helped found the group, at a rally showing support for the murder of an off-duty soldier by two Islamic extremists.VIEW InteractiveMohammed Shafiq,        who was protesting against the gathering, recalls telling Butt he was a disgrace. \u201cAt that stage he called me a Murtad,\u201d or apostate, Mr. Shafiq said.In 2015, Butt again appeared alongside radical preachers at a demonstration outside the London Central Mosque, his presence captured on video. The mosque had been so disturbed by Mr. Choudary\u2019s previous protests it tried in vain to purchase the sidewalk in front to deny access to his followers.In the documentary \u201cThe Jihadis Next Door,\u201d a man locals identify as Butt is seen praying in front of a flag associated with Islamic State in July 2015, and\u2014with a group of men\u2014being stopped on the street by police officers, including one of Mr. Choudary\u2019s lieutenants.Mr. Choudary\u2019s previous lieutenant,       Siddartha Dhar,        led patrols in east London to promote Shariah law before being arrested in September 2014 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism. He skipped bail and joined Islamic State in Syria. Mr. Choudary is in prison for inviting support for Islamic State.Last summer, Butt was again reported to authorities after a counterterrorism think tank called Quilliam said he lunged at one of its advisers. \u201cYou support gay marriage,\u201d Butt said at the time, according to the think tank.Despite his behavior, Butt remained popular with some of the locals. The weekend before his attack, he held a barbecue that was attended by 20 people.Jean Morrison, a neighbor who was invited, said she didn\u2019t see his preaching about Islam as unusual. \u201cOthers do that too,\u201d she said.Last Saturday, a neighbor invited Butt to come around and watch a soccer match on TV. He declined. Just after 9 p.m., a white van was seen screeching away from the apartment complex. An hour later the killing began.\u2014Mike Bird, Saabira Chaudhuri and Riva Gold contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'London Attacker Didn\u2019t Hide Extremism.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-attacker-wasnt-hiding-in-plain-sighthe-wasnt-even-hiding-1497027806", "news_title": "London Attacker Wasn\u2019t Hiding in Plain Sight\u2014He Wasn\u2019t Even Hiding ", "keywords": "borough market,london attack,london bridge,london terror attack,Ummah Fitness Centre,London Central Mosque,Quilliam,Al Madina Mosque,Rachid Redouane,Youssef Zaghba,Khuram Butt,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,health,living,lifestyle,terrorism"}, {"content": "Three years after the start of the \u201csheikhs vs. shale\u201d oil battle, the upstart U.S. shale producers that were supposed to have been crushed by low prices.

How can we get drivers to show more respect for those around them? \u2014JamieIn a word: convertibles. If we all drove rag tops with the roof down and no windows to shield us from fellow drivers, we would be far more aware of social norms and more likely to behave with some consideration for others.Driving often brings out the worst in us, and it can be shocking to see how myopic, self-centered and unaware we become behind the wheel\u2014from driving recklessly to cutting into lines to picking our nose.All of this is much worse than our typical behavior when we, say, walk down a crowded public street. Pedestrians aren\u2019t always polite, but they certainly don\u2019t exhibit the same type of risk-taking and selfishness. Being in proximity to other people makes us more aware of our own standards of decency, and we behave accordingly.Noise-blocking (and often darkened) windows and the controlled environment of a car create an illusion of isolation, separating us from other drivers. It lets us feel that our actions are unobserved, which makes it easier for us to ignore our own standards.Dear Dan,How can I overcome my hot-and-cold attitudes toward my romantic partner? Sometimes I\u2019m convinced that we aren\u2019t compatible, but at other moments, I feel perfectly content with our relationship. Are these fluctuations normal? \u2014TinaAll relationships oscillate between good and bad\u2014it\u2019s just part of the deal. The question for you is whether the downsides that you are experiencing are worth it for the upsides\u2014and whether you can deal with the fluctuations.What I can tell you is that you shouldn\u2019t make big decisions about the future of your relationship when you\u2019re experiencing its bad side. When we are in a particularly strong emotional state, we often find ourselves consumed by that emotion and incapable of seeing how we could feel differently.But emotions are transitory, and they often change more quickly than we anticipate. So assess your relationship only when you are calm and content. You\u2019re more likely to find the right answer when you\u2019re thinking clearly, not emotionally. Good luck.Dear Dan,I recently bought an adjustable standing-or-sitting desk, but I find that I lack the motivation to consistently stand. Any suggestions to get me on my feet more? \u2014TimWhen you work at a standing desk, you sometimes naturally feel the need to sit down\u2014and once you do, of course, you\u2019ll rarely feel the urge to stand back up. I suggest setting a timer that reminds you once an hour to put your desk back in standing position, then stand for as long as you want.This way, you won\u2019t sit forever.

Gov.       Ricardo Rossell\u00f3,        a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, has made the push for statehood a centerpiece of his administration since assuming office in January.\u201cThe people of Puerto Rico cherish our relationship with the United States,\u201d said       Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez,        the island\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress and a member of the pro-statehood party. \u201cWe hope to strengthen that relationship\u201d by becoming the 51st state.But the opposition Popular Democratic Party\u2014which supports keeping the island\u2019s current status, though with more autonomy\u2014has urged voters to boycott the vote. It calls the referendum rigged in support of statehood, in part because the governing party had initially sought to exclude the territorial option from the ballot. The smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party has also called for a boycott.Sunday\u2019s vote will be the fifth plebiscite since 1967 on the island\u2019s status, an issue that has divided Puerto Ricans for decades. Under the current status, Puerto Ricans are born U.S. citizens, but those living on the island can\u2019t vote for president and have only one representative in Congress, a resident commissioner who cannot vote.Proponents say Puerto Rico\u2019s current status is essentially that of a colony, marring the island\u2019s dignity. Gaining full admission to the U.S., they argue, could help the island contend with a decadelong recession and a $73 billion mountain of debt. It would draw more investment, they say, and allow the island to tap federal funding that is more-restricted for territories.Apart from the plebiscite, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 signed into law this week a measure aimed at bolstering the campaign for statehood. It would create a commission comprised of two \u201csenators\u201d and five \u201crepresentatives\u201d\u2014which Puerto Rico would be expected to receive if it were to become a state\u2014to press U.S. lawmakers for admission.Yet the island\u2019s economic woes make that a hard sell. In May, Puerto Rico declared what amounts to the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in the U.S. and was placed under court protection. It is currently engaged in an acrimonious battle with Wall Street creditors that invested in the island\u2019s bonds.Another obstacle: Puerto Ricans in the U.S. vote heavily Democratic, leading many analysts to predict that a new delegation from the island would skew toward that party. Though President       Donald Trump       and both U.S. national parties have said they support allowing Puerto Ricans to choose their status, a statehood bid could face strong opposition.With Republicans in full control of Congress\u2014the body that needs to authorize the admission of a new state\u2014a statehood bid \u201cis dead on arrival,\u201d said       Charles Venator-Santiago,        a political-science professor at the University of Connecticut.In the first three plebiscites\u2014in 1967, 1993 and 1998\u2014statehood never won an outright majority. In the most recent one\u2014a two-part referendum in 2012\u2014voters rejected continuing the status quo in the first question, and then a majority opted for statehood over two options akin to independence in the second question.But the Popular Democratic Party had urged voters to leave the second question blank as a form of protest, and about 500,000 did. Had those been counted as votes for \u201cnone of the above,\u201d statehood wouldn\u2019t have won a majority, they argue.Given the current dispute among the island\u2019s parties over the legitimacy of Sunday\u2019s plebiscite, analysts question whether the vote will provide a clear mandate. \u201cFor decades, [the New Progressive Party] has tried, time and again, to manipulate the results of the plebiscite process,\u201d said       H\u00e9ctor Ferrer,        president of the Popular Democratic Party.But Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said the referendum is valid and that if voters choose statehood, she would pursue it aggressively with members of Congress. \u201cWe are going to use every tool that we have,\u201d she said.Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Puerto Rican Voters Weigh Pros and Cons of Statehood.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 12:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-to-vote-sunday-on-statehood-1497026520", "news_title": "Puerto Rico to Vote Sunday on Statehood ", "keywords": "puerto rico debt,puerto rico election,puerto rico independence,puerto rico statehood,puerto rico vote,New Progressive Party,Popular Democratic Party,Puerto Rican Independence Party,government finance,government budget,taxation,government borrowing,sub-national,local budget,local borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,municipal debt"}, {"content": "Wall Street investors battling Puerto Rico for payments had viewed the U.S. government\u2019s intervention as helping their cause. Now they fear the opposite may be true.A $9 billion restructuring deal covering the island territory\u2019s electric utility debt is at risk of collapsing as U.S. officials supervising Puerto Rico\u2019s finances struggle to reach consensus on the merits of the agreement, according to people close to the matter. The financial settlement has lost support in recent weeks among the seven voting members of Puerto Rico\u2019s federal oversight board, leaving the viability of the deal in flux and creditors dubious about its fate, these people said. The fluid situation has opened up tensions between the oversight board and certain Republican leaders in Washington.Creditors were instrumental in convincing Congress to install the oversight board last year, saying an impartial financial management entity was needed to rehabilitate Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and facilitate voluntary agreements to renegotiate its debts.Bondholders under the existing deal would receive new debt worth 85% of their claims, paid from a new charge on utility customers. But the oversight board\u2019s delay in deciding on the proposed terms has rattled investors who hoped the deal would set the tone for consensual settlements of Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts. Without a settlement framework in place, the power monopoly known as Prepa could join in the territorial government\u2019s court-supervised bankruptcy, where a judge would decide who gets paid what.\u201cThe oversight board\u2019s apparent stance in opposition to the Prepa agreement at this stage is highly concerning,\u201d said       Stephen Spencer,        a banker representing a group of utility bondholders.Bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority have steadily weakened since early April when creditors revised their restructuring terms at the request of Puerto Rico Gov.       Ricardo Rossell\u00f3,        who sought additional debt concessions to ameliorate projected rate increases on consumers.Local businesses and ratepayer advocates remain critical of the deal, which they say pays creditors too much and fails to free up sufficient funds to modernize Prepa\u2019s outdated power-generation assets. Purging more debt would protect consumers from paying higher rates to repay creditors, mitigating the drag on economic growth from the island\u2019s high power costs, said       Gustavo V\u00e9lez,        a Puerto Rico-based economist.The Prepa deal may not be popular locally, but its potential collapse is deepening tensions with congressional Republicans who created the oversight board last year as part of a federal rescue package to stabilize Puerto Rico\u2019s deteriorating finances, encourage private investment and stanch the flow of out-migration to the mainland U.S. The bill they passed, known by its acronym Promesa\u2014Spanish for \u201cpromise\u201d\u2014empowers the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in bonds either consensually through negotiated deals or nonconsensually with the help of the courts.Prepa had been negotiating with its creditors for more than two years before the oversight board\u2019s creation, and the rescue law was meant to give the board \u201cno discretion\u201d to veto the debt deal, said       Bill Cooper,        a lawyer and former staff director in the House Committee on Natural Resources who lead the drafting of the bill on Capitol Hill.But board member Ana Matosantos told Congress in March that the oversight board would review the deal to ensure it fostered a \u201ccomprehensive transformation\u201d of Prepa\u2019s business. Ms. Matosantos, a former finance director for the state of California, has also argued privately against the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter.A GOP aide with the Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over U.S. territories, said the delay in concluding \u201cwhat was a preordained negotiation\u201d was \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d A lack of good-faith negotiations around Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts is \u201cequally troubling,\u201d the aide said.Unrest has been growing for years in Puerto Rico over an unreliable energy service that costs consumers more than in every U.S. state but Hawaii. A massive blackout last year left Prepa customers without power for three days. Also last year, the Santa Rosa Hospital in the coastal town of Guayama had its power cut off after failing to pay millions of dollars in utility bills. A court later ordered the power back on.Investors now view the oversight board as a drag on debt recoveries, if bond prices are any indication. Benchmark Puerto Rico general obligation bonds have tumbled to 60 cents on the dollar, down 17% since March. The 10-year fiscal plan approved that month rejected some of Gov. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s deepest austerity suggestions and replaced earlier growth estimates with more conservative figures, lowering debt payments to $787 million annually from $1.2 billion and leaving less money to broker settlements. The board also nixed negotiations with general obligation bondholders shortly before Puerto Rico entered what amounts to the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy.\u201cWhat a lot of smart people told us a year ago would solve Puerto Rico\u2019s problems hasn\u2019t worked out,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a May 24 floor speech.It remains unclear how the oversight board\u2019s approach could affect Gov. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s efforts to sway congressional Republicans and Trump administration officials to bolster Puerto Rico\u2019s share of federal health-care subsidies and accept its bid for U.S. statehood.On Sunday, Puerto Rico will hold a plebiscite on its political status orchestrated by the pro-statehood Rossell\u00f3 administration. Voters will choose between seeking U.S. statehood, maintaining the current territorial status or political independence, in which the island would adopt a status recognizing its sovereignty.The local government continues to support Prepa\u2019s restructuring agreement, said       Gerardo Portela,        executive director of Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, known as AAFAF.

The deal might also remove competition in the market for chips used in the automotive sector, the EU said.Qualcomm agreed to buy Netherlands-based NXP for $39 billion in October, in a deal that would make it one of the top suppliers of chips used in cars at a time when manufacturers are building cars with greater computer power and as self-driving models develop.\u201cWith this investigation, we want to ensure that consumers will continue to benefit from secure and innovative products at competitive prices,\u201d said EU antitrust chief       Margrethe Vestager.In a statement, Qualcomm said \u201cboth companies expected a thorough review process and are working closely with relevant regulators, including the European Commission, to obtain the necessary approvals.\u201d Qualcomm also said it was \u201cconfident\u201d it could address the EU\u2019s concerns, adding it still expects the transaction to close by the end of the year. The deal has already won the green-light from U.S. antitrust authorities.In-depth investigations are common in EU merger reviews. A full-blown review allows companies several more months to come up with remedies, like selling assets, to offer the regulator in exchange for clearance. The commission could still clear the deal without conditions, or block it, if it deems any remedies offered to be insufficient to assuage antitrust concerns.The probe comes as the EU scrutinizes Qualcomm\u2019s behavior in other areas. The commission in December 2015 formally accused Qualcomm of illegally paying a major customer to exclusively use its chips and selling chips below cost to force a competitor, Icera Inc., out of the market.Qualcomm has previously said its sales practices \u201chave always complied with European competition law.\u201dThe antitrust cases against Qualcomm are \u201cstill a work in progress,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview in March, adding that she considered them important cases because of the implications for mobile communications.Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is the largest supplier of chips for mobile devices, including baseband chips that provide cellular connections and processors that run smartphone applications. But Qualcomm earns most of its profits from charging handset makers royalties for using its cellular patents. Most other government investigations so far have focused on its licensing practices.The U.S. chip maker\u2019s legal woes grew this year after             Apple Inc.       in January opened a legal battle against the company by suing Qualcomm in the U.S., and later in China and the U.K.\u2014building on international resistance to Qualcomm\u2019s patent-licensing business that has included antitrust investigations and fines in China, South Korea and the U.S.\u2014Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-opens-in-depth-probe-into-qualcomm-nxp-deal-1497022280", "news_title": "EU Opens In-Depth Probe Into Qualcomm-NXP Deal    ", "keywords": "qualcomm nxp deal,European Commission,European Union,NXP Semiconductors,NXPI,Qualcomm,QCOM,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,semiconductors,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "DEODORANT and antiperspirant have never possessed much prestige. They\u2019re typically functional, fairly garish, mass-market products kept hidden in medicine cabinets\u2014as glamorous as Band-Aids. And natural deodorants? Most were viewed just as dimly, if not more so, since many were thought to be ineffective.But a shift is under way: A wave of botanical- and mineral-based beauty brands has turned natural deodorant into a more respected, and prettily packaged, category. Why now? \u201cI think it\u2019s related to the wellness industry as a whole,\u201d said Tara Pelletier, co-founder of 8-year-old vegan beauty brand Meow Meow Tweet, which offers four natural deodorants. \u201cPeople are becoming more aware. It started with the food movement and spills into products we use.\u201dSpecifically, women are becoming aware of possible concerns surrounding aluminum chlorohydrate, the active ingredient in many antiperspirants. Susan Blum, an assistant clinical professor of preventative medicine at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, cited a 2016 study on mice published in the International Journal of Cancer that linked aluminum to the transformation of mammary epithelial cells into tumor cells. Dr. Blum, who also runs the Blum Center for Health in Rye Brook, N.Y., said that in her practice, doctors suggest \u201cthat breast cancer patients avoid traditional deodorants and antiperspirants.\u201dBeth Jonas, chief scientist at the Personal Care Products Council, a national trade association for the industry, countered Dr. Blum\u2019s assertion with two studies that show no connection. Dr. Jonas also pointed to the National Cancer Institute, which has stated that \u201cno scientific evidence links the use of [antiperspirants or deodorants] to the development of breast cancer.\u201dStill, with a slew of improved natural options that are more sophisticated both in their product and their packaging, some women are trying a different approach. Meow Meow Tweet\u2019s Ms. Pelletier reports that customer demand has played an important role in her brand\u2019s sharpened focus on the naturally sweet smell of not sweating: \u201cInstead of it being some hippie thing,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are saying, \u2018No, the texture has to be better. The scent is important to me.\u2019\u201dEmily Doyle, co-founder of minimalist natural beauty brand Ursa Major, says that for much of its six-and-a-half year existence, deodorant has been the product customers requested most. Ursa Major finally introduced a natural version, called Hoppin\u2019 Fresh, in late 2015. Its active ingredients are hops, which are antimicrobial and antibacterial, as well as kaolin clay, which absorbs moisture.And the brand recently debuted a new version of Hoppin\u2019 Fresh made without baking soda, a common ingredient in natural deodorants but one that can irritate sensitive skin. This variant\u2019s cheeky name is \u201cNo B.S.\u201dSwitching to a natural product isn\u2019t always easy; often women keep a reliable, high-performance antiperspirant on hand for stressful moments. If she\u2019s facing an important meeting on a hot day, Jennie Panzeri, a yoga instructor in St. Petersburg, Fla., will use a traditional drugstore product. Though her preferred natural deodorant by Bodhi Basics \u201cdefinitely helps with body odor,\u201d said Ms. Panzeri, \u201cit\u2019s not as effective in preventing wetness.\u201d Still, when teaching yoga, she said, she goes natural.That\u2019s a smart move, said Dr. Blum: \u201cIn general, you don\u2019t want to block sweating because it is one of the main ways that the body excretes toxins. Especially during exercise, it\u2019s better to focus on natural deodorants.\u201dTo find a natural deodorant that clicks with your pH and works effectively, you may need to test several, suggested Ms. Pelletier: \u201cEveryone\u2019s body chemistry is different.\u201d You can improve your odds, however. \u201cWithout being too preachy,\u201d she added, \u201cthe place to start is your diet. Eat more plants, less dairy, less processed food and less sugar, and drink more water. You increase the chances that whatever natural deodorant you pick will work.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Though they are made with plant- and mineral-derived ingredients, natural deodorants are not strictly chemical-free.

AMZN 0.24%       to help close its e-commerce gap.Carrefour, Europe\u2019s largest retailer, said current Chief Executive       Georges Plassat       would step aside next month.Mr. Bompard, 44 years old, has been chief executive of Fnac Darty, where he has been credited with turning around the book, music and electronics retailer\u2019s online operations.Carrefour is a brick-and-mortar behemoth that has struggled to compete with more nimble retailers online as well as smaller shops that are more conveniently located and price-competitive. The French-based company\u2019s main format is the hypermarket\u2014sprawling warehouses that sell everything from baguettes to bicycles. That model has fallen out of favor as clientele migrate online where they can shop with the swipe of a finger.\u201cMr. Bompard adds the potential to improve their digital capability and increase the flexibility between online and offline \u201c said Cedric Lecasble, analyst at Raymond James.Carrefour had been searching since late last year for a successor to Mr. Plassat, 68, whose mandate as Chairman and CEO was due to expire in May 2018.Mr. Plassat took the helm of Carrefour in 2012 as the retailer was trying to overcome years of declining sales and strategic missteps. He shrank the company\u2019s global footprint, pulling out of a number of markets. In France, he focused on Carrefour\u2019s pricing strategy, cutting back on promotional sales and keeping prices low throughout the year, while investing heavily in an overhaul of its stores.At Fnac, Mr. Bompard quickly established himself by leading a digital transformation and cutting costs. He took the company public in 2013 and won a bidding war for white-goods retailer Darty last year. That allowed the French-based company, whose main markets also include Spain, Belgium and Brazil, to build scale and better compete with large e-commerce companies. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its listing.Mr. Bompard\u2019s first priority at Fnac was to keep its customers from straying. He committed to matching competitors\u2019 prices and brought prices in line with Amazon\u2019s. Fnac also increased advantages for its most loyal clients, while using data mining to target them. It also improved its website and mobile app.At the same time, Fnac used its brick-and-mortar network to its advantage by asking vendors including Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. to set up their own branded areas in the shops. Mr. Bompard knew that his suppliers wanted Fnac to do well, particularly as a showroom for their higher-end products.\u201cHe increased ties with the main suppliers, knowing that the two have common interests,\u201d said Mr. Lecasble.Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/carrefour-taps-new-ceo-for-digital-makeover-1497012369", "news_title": "Carrefour Taps New CEO for Digital Makeover", "keywords": "carrefour locations,carrefour sales,carrefour shopping online,compard carrefour,new carrefour ceo,who is carrefour's ceo ,Carrefour,CA.FR,Amazon.com,AMZN,Alexandre Bompard,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Conflicting restrictions on Qatari oil and gas shipments have sown confusion among Middle East energy traders, as the diplomatic rift between a Saudi-led group of Arab countries and Qatar widened on Friday.Qatar, the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, and ships carrying its fuel have no access to ports or fuel stations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The measures were imposed after those two countries and Egypt and Bahrain broke off diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing its leaders of supporting terrorism and meddling in their internal affairs.The potential for the rift to disrupt vital energy arteries was underlined this week when Qatar diverted two LNG tankers headed for Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal on their way to the U.K. The ships made U-turns and charted new courses, even though Egypt hasn\u2019t closed it to Qatari vessels.Egypt has said Qatar is still allowed to use the Suez Canal, saying it would only restrict access to a country it was at war with. The Suez Canal, one of Egypt\u2019s largest sources of foreign currency, is the fastest shipping route between Europe and Asia, and Qatar has had other vessels use it this week.Qatari officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on why they would forego the Suez, which its ships use hundreds of times a year.According to a person with knowledge of the Qatari decision, one of the ships\u2019 masters didn\u2019t feel there was \u201cdefinitive clearance\u201d to use the Suez as tensions kept escalating between the arguing countries. The ship master didn\u2019t want to commit to going to the Suez only to be blocked there, a process that would take days, the person said.\u201cThere is a lot of confusion out there,\u201d the person said.According to shipping intelligence firm, Kpler, one of the ships appeared to have set a course Friday for a long journey to Great Britain around the southern coast of Africa. The other is now heading east toward an unknown destination, Kpler said.The diversions sent British natural gas prices 4% higher on Thursday as U.K. traders rushed to secure gas for the country\u2019s power and heating systems.As a whole, traders said, the diplomatic crisis has complicated the Persian Gulf energy business but hasn\u2019t stopped it in the same way that cargo-ship traffic was upended. Qatar\u2019s neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., closed off air, sea and land routes, but Qatari ships and tankers carrying its gas and crude still have access to international sea lanes. Its Asian exports were proceeding without problems, traders said.Qatar produced about a third of the world\u2019s LNG supply in 2016, exporting about 77 million tons. Its key markets are in Asia, but it also sends over 17 million tons a year to Europe and is an important supplier to Africa.\u201cSome LNG cargoes out of Qatar remain problematic, but it\u2019s not chaos,\u201d said a shipping broker in Singapore, a global energy trading hub. \"Prices are ticking up, but unless there is a complete breakdown between Qatar and its neighbors shipments will continue to move out.\u201dThe bans against Qatar have forced oil and gas shippers to find alternatives to Fujairah\u2014an emirate that is a key refueling station for the Middle East energy trade. The shippers have also had to sift through a host of shifting restrictions, with the U.A.E. allowing a tanker bearing Qatari crude to berth in Abu Dhabi this week before reimposing its ban.But the Saudi-led coalition has longstanding energy relationships with Qatar that they appear to have shielded from the crisis.Gas exports by pipeline to the U.A.E. are still occurring. Egypt gets half of its LNG exports from Qatar and reaps millions of dollars in Suez transit fees from the country\u2019s LNG ships.An LNG trader who does business with the Qataris said the emirate may have been trying to send a message to Egypt by diverting ships from the canal. The trader said it didn\u2019t make sense for Qatar to divert cargoes over confusion over Suez access.\u201cIt is Qatar flexing their muscles,\u201d the trader said.\u2014Nikhil Lohade contributed to this article.Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-restrictions-confuse-oil-gas-traders-1497022654", "news_title": "Qatar Restrictions Confuse Oil, Gas Traders ", "keywords": "lng shipping,lng tankers,qatar,qatari lng,saudi arabia,suez canal,uae,Kpler,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,natural gas markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,liquefied,compressed gas,marine transport,freight transport,logistics,marine freight,water transport,shipping,transportation"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014When President Donald Trump signed an executive order on religious liberty last month, he was surrounded in the White House Rose Garden by religious figures\u2014Catholics, orthodox Jews, Sikhs and a host of evangelical Christians.One prominent evangelical was conspicuously missing:       Russell Moore,        the public face and chief lobbyist of the Southern Baptist Convention, the country\u2019s largest Protestant denomination.Mr. Moore\u2019s absence was a sign of the rift between him and the new administration, and hinted at a rupture within the Southern Baptist Convention itself that is challenging Mr. Moore\u2019s leadership and potentially pushing the powerful, conservative institution off the political course he set.As Southern Baptists head into their annual meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Moore, 45 years old, is at the center of a generational struggle over the denomination\u2019s future. The outcome could determine whether Southern Baptists continue to be a leading conservative voice in cultural disputes over abortion and gay rights\u2014and whether evangelical Christians remain a reliably Republican voting bloc.For the past four years, as head of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public-policy arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Mr. Moore has tried to lead\u00a0evangelicals\u00a0in a new direction.He hosted a conference to bring together Baptists with gay-rights leaders. He said white evangelicals must do more to combat racial injustice. Most notably, he argued that evangelicals must avoid being in lockstep with one party, and he criticized the priorities of the \u201creligious right\u201d\u2014including many Southern Baptists who backed Mr. Trump for president.\u201c2016 has destroyed evangelical credibility,\u201d Mr. Moore wrote last October on             Twitter.       The post linked to an opinion piece he had written in the Washington Post, which called evangelical leaders\u2019 enthusiastic support for Mr. Trump\u00a0\u201ca scandal and a disgrace.\u201dHis approach\u00a0won him support among a younger, more racially diverse generation of evangelicals who are more suspicious than their parents of political parties.It also led to a backlash from Southern Baptists who helped build the denomination into a political force within the Republican Party. Many of them saw Mr. Trump, despite his three marriages and ties to the casino industry, as the only realistic hope for the socially conservative agenda they have been pushing for decades.Dozens of pastors have openly criticized Mr. Moore since the election. Some have withheld funding for the national denomination in protest. Dozens more churches have left the denomination altogether, some citing Mr. Moore\u2019s and other denomination officials\u2019 support for Muslims who want to build a mosque in Bernards Township, N.J.Mr. Moore\u2019s board of trustees\u2014the only entity that can fire him\u2014issued an unusual endorsement of him in March in an attempt to quell the unrest.But Mr. Moore has no access to Mr. Trump, fueling questions about how effectively he can do his job. Some Southern Baptists are talking about eliminating the public-policy group he leads at the annual meeting.\u201cThe election revealed some differences among us, in the broader evangelical community as well as the Southern Baptist Convention,\u201d said\u00a0      Frank Page,        president of the denomination\u2019s executive committee. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to go away after the election.\u201dInstead of pushing Southern Baptists\u2019 agenda with an administration friendly to evangelicals, Mr. Moore has spent the early months of the Trump era fighting to put down an insurgency.Mr. Moore, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article.On Feb. 22, Mr. Moore dialed in to a conference call with some of the most influential Southern Baptists in the country, according to several people who were on the call.Prestonwood Baptist Church, a Texas megachurch led by       Jack Graham,        a widely respected former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, had announced days earlier that it was withholding $1 million from the denomination, citing concerns about Mr. Moore\u2019s organization.Smaller congregations also were pulling funds, a rebuke that was depriving the national denomination of money for seminaries, missionary work and other needs.Several pastors on the conference call, including Mr. Graham, were part of an evangelical advisory board Mr. Trump had assembled during his campaign.When the call began, Mr. Graham thanked Mr. Moore for joining them. Mr. Graham said he didn\u2019t want to get anyone fired, but there were certain things he didn\u2019t have to pay for, according to the people who were on the call. His church, he said, felt strongly about it.Pastors asked Mr. Moore whom he was talking about when he criticized the motivations of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. Did he mean them?Some pastors said in interviews that they weren\u2019t sure Mr. Moore realized how out of step he was with most of the denomination.\u00a0More than 80% of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit polls.Ted Traylor,        pastor of Olive Baptist Church in Pensacola, Fla., said many members of his church had been asking him, \u2018Pastor, are we paying this guy?\u201d After the call, he said, Mr. Moore began to understand \u201ca little deeper\u201d how his comments about Trump supporters had affected many Southern Baptists.The last time the Southern Baptist Convention was so divided was during the 1980s, when theological conservatives reclaimed control over the denomination. Nearly 2,000 churches left to form their own denomination, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which now ordains women.Mr. Moore\u2019s predecessor,       Richard Land,        played a leading role in that denominational battle. As head of the public-policy arm, Mr. Land had turned the Southern Baptist Convention into a conservative political juggernaut. He helped push the Republican Party to the right on issues such as abortion and became a regular in the       George W. Bush       White House.Since then, evangelicals have consistently delivered votes for Republicans.Last year, Mr. Land said a vote for Mr. Trump was the only realistic option for Christians, calling       Hillary Clinton       \u201cthe most pro-abortion presidential candidate ever nominated by a major party.\u201dMr. Moore also is a vocal critic of abortion and opposes gay marriage, but he said he couldn\u2019t endorse either major party candidate.Ruth Malhotra,        a 33-year-old\u00a0Southern Baptist of Indian descent who lives in Atlanta, said her generation was looking to Mr. Moore and taking a more expansive view of being \u201cpro-life\u201d\u2014not just opposition to abortion but also work on behalf of refugees and the poor.\u201cIt used to be people would say, \u2018Oh, but abortion. We have to vote pro-life. That\u2019s why we have to vote Republican,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Malhotra, who voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin.\u00a0\u201cOur generation is becoming more diverse. We\u2019re starting to say no, it\u2019s not an automatic check-the-box for any Republican.\u201dLike almost all major U.S. denominations, the Southern Baptist Convention is shrinking. After decades of growth, membership has declined for 10 consecutive years, falling from\u00a016.3 million\u00a0in 2006\u00a0to 15.2 million in 2016, according to the denomination.Eighty-five percent of Southern Baptists are white, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, although the denomination is growing more diverse. Half of\u00a0new churches\u00a0are predominantly nonwhite, according to denomination officials, and in 2012 the convention elected its first black president,       Fred Luter,        who served a two-year term.William Dwight McKissic\u00a0Sr.      , pastor of\u00a0Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas,\u00a0said the backlash against Mr. Moore had \u201chuge implications\u201d for black Southern Baptists such as himself, who are far less likely than white evangelicals to support Republicans.\u201cThe fact that he was targeted was very chilling,\u201d Mr. McKissic said. \u201cIt sends the signal that anybody who speaks a word that is not in line with traditional Southern Baptist, Republican thought will face opposition, to the extent that their jobs will be threatened.\u201dSome critics of Mr. Moore said their frustration is more about his leadership style than his politics. In a denomination that likes to settle disputes quietly, some were rankled that he criticized Trump supporters on national television and didn\u2019t speak to them directly.\u201cI\u2019d have gone to a Jack Graham\u201d before publicly criticizing Trump supporters like him, said       Jay Strack,        president of Student Leadership University and member of Mr. Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board, who called himself \u201ca big fan\u201d of Mr. Moore.As churches began pulling funding, Mr. Moore went quiet. He made few television appearances and hardly said a negative word about Mr. Trump.He also visited Mr. Graham in Texas and met privately with others.In March, the board of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission released a statement of support for Mr. Moore, who himself issued an apology.\u201cAs I look back over the last year, I am grieved by the tensions in our denomination,\u201d Mr. Moore wrote. \u201cI\u2026apologize for failing to distinguish\u201d between people who voted for Mr. Trump despite reservations and \u201cthose who put politics over the gospel.\u201dIn response, Mr. Graham wrote on Twitter, \u201cThis is a gracious and unifying statement from\u00a0@drmoore.\u201d\u00a0Prestonwood Baptist announced in April it would resume giving to the national denomination.\u201cWe\u2019re in a truce,\u201d Mr. Strack said of the situation, adding that Mr. Moore had taken important steps to mend fences. \u201cI think he can build trust back, but now you have this debate internally.\u201dAfter years of feeling shut out during the Obama administration, evangelicals are now enjoying far greater access at the White House. Mr. Moore, however, has been shut out, according to evangelicals who work in Washington. A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Moore didn\u2019t appear to have visited since Mr. Trump took office.While other evangelical leaders were in the White House Rose Garden last month, he was at a conference about orphans in Nashville, according to his Twitter feed.On\u00a0March 3, about a month after       Neil Gorsuch       was nominated to the Supreme Court, two dozen religious leaders gathered at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to strategize how to help his Senate confirmation process. Mr. Graham was there, as was       Tony Perkins,        a Southern Baptist pastor and president of the Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group.\u00a0Mr. Moore was not.At one point this spring, Mr. Moore\u2019s staff had to search for a way to get in touch with the White House.\u201cDr. Moore\u2019s office reached out to ask if I could give them a good email address for the White House,\u201d said Johnnie Moore (no relation to Russell Moore), a 34-year-old Southern Baptist member of Mr. Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board\u00a0and founder of the Kairos Co., a public-relations firm that represents many religious figures.\u201cIt was a strange question from a multimillion-dollar public-policy organization. They apparently still couldn\u2019t find the front door, despite that door being in plain sight,\u201d said Johnnie Moore, who sent Mr. Moore an email address for the White House. \u201cThe polite thing to do was to help.\u201dErick Erickson,        a conservative radio host and blogger who opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign, said there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill, and even White House staff, who pay attention to Mr. Moore.\u201cI know for certain, when the president signed the religious liberty executive order, people in the White House were mindful of what guys like Russell Moore would think,\u201d Mr. Erickson said.Still, some pastors are now going around Mr. Moore to lobby in Washington, building their own relationships with the White House or working with other conservative groups.\u201cI think this Russell Moore controversy was really a catalyst to begin asking a bigger question, which is whether the ERLC is even relevant anymore,\u201d said       Robert Jeffress,        pastor at First Baptist Dallas and another member of Mr. Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board. \u201cNo one person represents the views of Southern Baptists.\u201dMr. Land\u2019s influence stemmed partly from his ability to speak on behalf of the vast majority of the denomination. During the Bush administration, he has said, the White House would call him to find out how Southern Baptists felt about a given policy.Rod Martin, who will help run operations at the annual meeting, recently wrote an article advocating the elimination of Mr. Moore\u2019s public-policy commission, which has an annual budget of nearly $4 million.Mr. Traylor of Olive Baptist Church said such a motion \u201cwouldn\u2019t get to first base\u201d at the annual meeting.Yet bitterness remains even after Mr. Moore\u2019s apology, and several churches are still withholding funding.\u201cA lot of younger people think he\u2019s the greatest thing since sliced bread,\u201d       Craig Mitchell,        a professor at Criswell College and former ERLC research fellow, said of Mr. Moore. \u201cSome of the older people who didn\u2019t like him before still don\u2019t like him now.\u201d\u201cWhat that leads me to believe is that anything can happen at this convention,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope there\u2019s not going to be any ugliness.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'For a Baptist Leader, Politics Turn Perilous.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russell-moore-baptist-leader-who-shunned-trump-splits-his-church-1497022212", "news_title": "Russell Moore, Baptist Leader Who Shunned Trump, Splits the Faithful", "keywords": "donald trump,erlc,ethics and religious liberty commission,jack graham,johnnie moore,richard land,russell moore,sbc,southern baptist convention,trump,Southern Baptist Convention,Russell Moore,abortion,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,religion,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Women\u2019s clothing retailer BCBG Max Azria Group LLC announced bankruptcy deals worth $165 million to sell off its core businesses, which would live on as a going concern.Marty Staff, BCBG\u2019s interim acting chief executive officer, said the proposed transactions were \u201cthe best possible outcome for customers, vendors, business partners and our employees who are the lifeblood of the company.\u201dMarquee Brands LLC and             Global Brands Group Holding Ltd.       emerged as willing purchasers after a marketing process in which nearly 60 interested financial and strategic buyers signed confidentiality agreements to assess the value of the retailer\u2019s assets.Subject to bankruptcy court approval, Marquee would buy BCBG\u2019s intellectual property assets for $106 million in cash, while Global Brands would pay $23 million cash to operate wholesale and e-commerce operations and up to 22 standalone store locations. The proposal also includes a royalty-sharing agreement that provides BCBG lenders with an interest in Marquee\u2019s use of the purchased intellectual property. The transactions\u2019 implied value is roughly $165 million, according to bankruptcy documents.BCBG is now seeking court permission to enter into agreements requiring it to support the planned sales, except in the case its fiduciary obligations compel it not to.BCBG said Marquee would expand the company\u2019s brands into \u201cnew product categories, distribution channels and geographies\u201d once the deal closes, expected no later than July 31. In addition to business operations, Global Brands would acquire existing inventories. The deal includes a $3.2 million breakup fee.Company lawyers asked Judge Shelley C. Chapman in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York to hold a hearing on the proposal on June 23. The judge in March approved a dual-track timeline to govern BCBG\u2019s bankruptcy process that contemplated either a sale of some or all of the company or, alternatively, a debt restructuring.The retailer was founded by Max Azria in 1989. He and his wife were the sole owners until a 2015 out-of-court restructuring that left BCBG largely in the hands of investment firm Guggenheim Partners.BCBG, which is known for selling women\u2019s dresses costing between $250 and $750, fell victim to industrywide retail trends of declining foot traffic and the shift in consumer habits to online shopping.

Don\u2019t be alarmed.The 35-year-old actress from Maine has appeared in the lead female role of       Roxie Hart       in the long-running Broadway production of \u201cChicago\u201d a mere six times since joining the show this past summer. As an understudy, her presence is typically announced unceremoniously with a slip of paper inserted into the program.Yet when       Sloane Kelly,        a New York high-school student, bought a ticket to \u201cChicago,\u201d she purposely chose a night when Ms. Hurder would be performing. \u201cShe is just so passionate about the role,\u201d Ms. Kelly explained.Broadway\u2019s marquee stars\u2014like       Josh Groban,        now appearing in the Russian-inspired musical \u201cNatasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\u201d and       Bette Midler       in a revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d\u2014still soak up most of the applause. Sunday\u2019s Tony awards will, as always, serve as a coronation for Broadway\u2019s megawatt celebrities.For a small niche of Broadway fans, however, social media is enabling them to indulge a quirky passion\u2014watching fill-in performers. Standbys including Ms. Hurder often share news on social media about when they will be stepping into the lead, and Broadway Understudies, a fan group, provides updates on multiple web outlets. The group\u2019s             Twitter                   feed has more than 17,000 followers.The Broadway Understudies team goes so far as to talk about understudies in training and those who are going on in touring shows. In May, it shared news about a fill-in at a Providence, R.I., road date of \u201cMatilda the Musical.\u201d It also noted that Paul Slade Smith, an actor from Connecticut, was beginning rehearsals as the understudy for the lead role of Willy Wonka in the new Broadway musical \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory.\u201d\u201cBreak legs, Paul! We can\u2019t wait for you to go on!\u201d the group tweeted.Broadway obsessives, who will go to shows dozens of times, say they appreciate the energy and perspective understudies bring to their roles. Not unlike baseball fans who attend minor-league games to see the sport\u2019s rising prospects, they also admit to taking a kind of geeky pleasure in \u201ccollecting\u201d understudies, noting which ones they have seen in which roles over the life of a production.Mo Brady, a former understudy who co-hosts The Ensemblist, a podcast about Broadway, calls such fans \u201ccompletists.\u201d\u201cThey want to see every permutation of the show,\u201d he said.Hayley Goldstein       said she attended \u201cSomething Rotten!,\u201d a Shakespeare-spoofing musical that played on Broadway from April 2015 to the beginning of this year, some 40 times. Ms. Goldstein, a college student, is especially thrilled she caught Broadway veteran       Eric Sciotto       understudy in not just one, but two of the show\u2019s main roles over the course of its run.Ms. Goldstein said her ultimate \u201cget\u201d would be seeing Colton Ryan, the understudy for       Ben Platt,        the Tony Award-nominated actor who plays the lead in the musical \u201cDear       Evan Hansen.      \u201dThe reason? The star, Mr. Platt, has missed only two performances since the show bowed last fall, making sightings of understudy Mr. Ryan the Broadway equivalent of, say, sightings of a rarely seen owl among bird-watchers.\u201cUnderstudies always bring something completely different\u201d to the part, Ms. Goldstein said, adding that when she makes plans to see a show, she considers it a plus if there is a fill-in.\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m like, \u2018Are there any understudies on?\u2019\u201d she said.Understudy       Shoba Narayan,        an actress from Pennsylvania of Indian heritage, started appearing as Natasha in \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\u201d earlier this year. It marked a rare appearance by a South Asian actress in a lead role on Broadway.Ms. Narayan said as news spread of her occasional performances, dozens of fans, including many South Asians, started buying tickets. She said she received about 100 congratulatory letters and emails. One fan even sent a watercolor painting depicting her in the role.\u201cIt was touching,\u201d said Ms. Narayan.Not everyone is so thrilled about understudies. Many Broadway regulars admit to a degree of disappointment when they see that inserted slip of paper, especially given the cost of attending a show. The average price for a ticket hit a record $109 this season, an increase of $6 over 2015-16, according to the Broadway League, a trade group.In a survey Broadway producer       Ken Davenport       undertook with a research firm, 73% of theatergoers had a negative response to having to sit through a replacement\u2019s performance. In a blog post summarizing the survey, Mr. Davenport said most ticket-buyers felt \u201ccheated.\u201dDon\u2019t tell that to       Melissa Anelli.       A Broadway enthusiast and co-founder of BroadwayCon, a New York convention for fans, she has been tracking understudies since the pre-social media era of the \u201990s. Back then, she had to check with cast members directly\u2014she particularly followed the award-winning musical \u201cRent\u201d\u2014to find out about replacement performances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have what people have now,\u201d said Ms. Anelli, who saw \u201cRent\u201d many times and \u201cstopped counting after 60\u201d performances. She said fans like her \u201cjust want to support the show by supporting the people who are less celebrated in it.\u201dPerhaps the biggest fans of understudies are understudies themselves, since they have an appreciation for what it takes to step into a role, especially at the last minute, and win over an audience. \u201cThey\u2019re always so good,\u201d said Ms. Hurder, the understudy in \u201cChicago.\u201d Like other understudies, Ms. Hurder has a regular role in the show; she plays the character Mona, when she isn\u2019t subbing.Still, even understudies understand replacements aren\u2019t quite the stars. It was a point that hit home for Ms. Hurder when she went a few years ago to see the Tony Award-winning revival of \u201cPippin\u201d and learned       Charlotte d\u2019Amboise,        a favorite actress of hers, would be out for that performance.\u201cI was very disappointed, to put it lightly,\u201d said Ms. Hurder.Earlier this year, when Ms. d\u2019Amboise was starring in \u201cChicago,\u201d Ms. Hurder was her understudy.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Take a Night Off, Bette!

Democrats took that as evidence of potential obstruction of justice meriting investigation by Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who was appointed special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into the Russia matter.But Republicans also found material in Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony to defend the president, and there was little sign that the appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee was prompting GOP lawmakers to draw more distance from Mr. Trump.Mr. Comey said that as of May 9, the day Mr. Comey was fired, the president himself wasn\u2019t under investigation as part of the FBI\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election, which Moscow has denied. Those comments bolstered Republican lawmakers at a time when they are trying to advance a legislative agenda that has met hurdles. Senate Republicans say they are coalescing around a health-care plan, and the party also hopes to craft an overhaul of the tax code this year.Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) took Mr. Comey\u2019s appearance on the Hill as evidence that the president isn\u2019t under investigation in the probe now being led by Mr. Mueller.\u201cIf you think the special counsel believes there\u2019s an obstruction of justice, he\u2019s the biggest idiot in the world to let his chief witness go through this?\u201d he said. \u201cMueller is not an idiot.\u201dDuring his testimony, Mr. Comey said he wasn\u2019t sure whether the president\u2019s behavior rose to the level of obstruction, saying it was Mr. Mueller\u2019s job \u201cto sort that out.\u201dAs for Mr. Comey\u2019s saying that he felt pressure from the president to drop his investigation into       Mike Flynn,        the former national security adviser, Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said he thought the assertion was \u201ca little gratuitous.\u201d Mr. Comey testified that the president had said in a private conversation that he \u201choped\u201d the then-FBI director would end the investigation into Mr. Flynn.\u201cWhen you say \u2018I hope you can see your way to letting this go,\u2019 that\u2019s not an order,\u201d Mr. Cornyn told reporters.Mr. Flynn was later forced to resign after making false statements about his conversations with a Russian diplomat.Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called the hearing a \u201cset of bombshells.\u201d Among them, he said, was Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony that he \u201cfelt from the very first meeting this president was so likely to lie that he had to keep contemporaneous memos of his conversations.\u201dMr. Comey also testified that after his firing he leaked accounts of his conversations with the president in hopes of sparking the appointment of a special counsel.Mr. Comey, in his testimony, also said he believes he was fired because of the agency\u2019s pursuit of the Russia investigation.\u2014Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-see-different-things-in-james-comey-testimony-1497017807", "news_title": "GOP Lawmakers Stick With Trump After Comey Testimony", "keywords": "FBI,James Comey,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Health-care officials are turning to a slew of potential fixes to their doctor shortages, including opening the door wider for graduates of foreign schools, creating new medical schools from scratch and lobbying for funding to add residency slots so a new generation of doctors can be fully trained.Sens. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.), Dean Heller (R., Nev.) and       Charles Schumer       (D., N.Y.)\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0introduced legislation that would provide Medicare funding for an additional 3,000 residency positions a year for five years. It matches a House proposal from last month. The program that helps pay for senior citizens\u2019 medical costs sets aside money each year to help fund residency programs; the number of spots it supports has been frozen since 1997.Sen. Nelson and Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) also put forward a bill this week easing the way for hospitals that have part-time residency programs to also establish full-time ones with Medicare backing.Three-quarters of medical students and graduates who applied for residency positions in 2016 were successfully matched with teaching hospitals\u2019 programs. That means there\u00a0were\u00a0roughly 8,600 more individuals who wanted\u00a0to be doctors and passed the first level of their qualifying exams than there\u00a0were\u00a0spots to continue training them.Meanwhile, 22 new medical schools have been accredited in the past 15 years in states including Texas, Florida, Arizona and South Carolina, helping add thousands of seats at U.S. programs. Another eight are on the path to approval.But with 4,223 areas and populations around the country currently\u00a0designated as\u00a0medically underserved by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, officials don\u2019t want to wait for years until those new students complete their training.Missouri legislation from 2014 created a class of \u201cassistant physicians,\u201d with modifications introduced this year that, if signed by the governor, would open the door to more potential candidates. The law allows trainee doctors to practice, in a limited way and under supervision, before getting fully licensed. To be considered, they must have graduated medical school within the past three years and completed the first two steps of their medical licensing exams in the past two years.A handful of other states have instituted or are considering similar measures.Some states also have become more accepting of medical students from foreign schools who want to complete clinical rotations in their facilities, with the hope that they\u2019ll return for residencies, and then settle down in the area afterward.This spring, for example, the Georgia Composite Medical Board agreed to have third- and fourth-year students from St. George\u2019s University, a for-profit institution in Grenada, complete clinical rotations around the state.State medical schools aren\u2019t thrilled by the competition for clinical spots, especially because for-profit institutions often pay hospitals to set aside slots for their students.But local medical authorities are becoming more accommodating, said Dr. Heidi Chumley, dean of American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St. Maarten, a for-profit school.\u201cI don\u2019t see olive branches,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I see more non-interference.\u201dWrite to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-search-of-more-doctors-new-training-efforts-grow-1497021686", "news_title": "In Search for More Doctors, New Training Efforts Grow", "keywords": "doctor shortage, family doctors, rural medicine,political,general news,education"}, {"content": "With U.S. medical schools struggling to churn out enough doctors to meet the demand in rural and other underserved areas, overseas programs that cater to their admission rejects are helping to pick up the slack.The international schools have long carried a stigma of being pricey, mainly for-profit and a little too close to the beach for proper studying. And health-care professionals say many\u00a0still do have lax admission standards and abysmal outcomes.But amid uncertainty over whether the pipeline of foreign doctors will slow due to tighter immigration rules under the Trump administration,\u00a0some offshore institutions have polished their images as\u00a0their American\u00a0graduates help to fill a critical need in places like Louisiana and Wyoming.New Jersey native Chantel Taylor was turned down by more than 20 U.S. medical schools with a 3.0 grade point average from Brown University and an \u201caverage\u201d score on the MCAT medical-school admission test. To get her dream job as a primary-care doctor, she enrolled in a program created eight years ago specifically for Americans\u2014in Australia.Dr. Taylor, 29 years old, attended a joint program between the University of Queensland and the Ochsner Health System in Louisiana. Now she is about to start her second year of residency at the Louisiana State University rural family -medicine program in Bogalusa, La., where she does everything from deliver babies for uninsured mothers to care for elderly patients with chronic conditions.\u201cThe work we do makes a huge impact,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are not a lot of doctors here.\u201dThe Association of American Medical Colleges forecasts a physician shortage of between\u00a040,800 and 104,900 by 2030. In response, U.S. medical schools have increased first-year enrollments by more than one-quarter over the past 15 years, with 21,030 such students this year.Still, demand for a medical education far outstrips the supply of seats on U.S. campuses. And that is where overseas medical schools are stepping in.In 2016, 3,298 U.S.\u00a0citizens from international medical schools\u00a0were certified to\u00a0enter\u00a0American residency and fellowship programs, up from 1,858 in 2006, according to the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, which grants the certificates. Residencies are required before doctors-in-training can become fully licensed in the U.S.Even though students at international schools often face higher tuition and less lucrative assignments as generalist doctors after graduation, their student-loan default rates are extremely low, often under 2%, according to government statistics.Studying medicine overseas\u00a0can be a risky move, since only about 54% of American students in foreign medical schools are accepted into a U.S. residency program the first time around, compared with about 94% for U.S. students in domestic programs, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which matches medical-school students with hospitals.A few of the schools outperform when it comes to getting students into residency programs at U.S. teaching hospitals. UQ-Ochsner, a nonprofit institution, this year achieved a residency match rate of 95%. And graduates from\u00a0for-profit Ross University Medical\u00a0School\u00a0in Dominica, American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St. Maarten and St. George\u2019s University School of Medicine in Grenada, along with a handful of others, regularly post residency match rates over 85%.\u201cYou have high-quality candidates that come from all walks of programs,\u201d said Stephen Knohl, internal medicine residency program director at SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, N.Y. \u201cYou have to take a chance.\u201dDr. Knohl knows the dreary central New York city isn\u2019t a top destination for most medical-school\u00a0graduates, so he casts a wide net. Nearly half of the 59 first-year residents starting at the program this summer are U.S. citizens from Caribbean medical schools.He said he has seen \u201cno distinct difference\u201d between the students he brings in from U.S. or international schools.Of aspiring doctors who applied for residency matches in 2016, 15% were U.S. citizens who attended foreign medical schools, nearly double the share of such candidates in 2000, according to the match program.These days, the overseas schools are becoming a magnet for students interested in general practice or working in rural areas.\u00a0Dr. Leonardo Seoane, head of school at UQ-Ochsner, said clinical rotations in Haiti and the Ninth Ward in New Orleans are a draw, as is exposure to Australia\u2019s general-practitioner-centered system.Ross and American University of the Caribbean, both owned by the publicly traded             Adtalem Global Education Inc.,       have been focusing their messaging in recent years on how their graduates fill coverage gaps in places like Nevada, Wyoming and Tennessee.\u201cSomeone who wants to be a plastic surgeon is probably not heading here,\u201d said Neal Simon, president of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine. The for-profit school matched 85% of its students into residencies over the past four years, the vast majority in internal and family medicine.Lindsey Ling said she knew which career paths would be available when she signed up for\u00a0Ross\u00a0in Dominica\u2014and that was fine, since she went to medical\u00a0school\u00a0with the intention of someday taking over her father\u2019s family-medicine practice near Tampa.Dr. Ling, a resident at St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla., has colleagues who attended Caribbean schools and met her husband, an anesthesiology resident at the University of Miami, at Ross.\u201cIt makes you work harder to be noticed,\u201d Dr. Ling said of the negative connotations associated with international graduates. \u201cBut some of the stigma is fading away.

It\u2019s a staggering amount of money\u2014enough to buy a few mansions and a very shiny yacht, with plenty of spare change for a space tourist ticket to orbit the Earth. Of course, this was no ordinary rock; it was the 59.6-carat Pink Star diamond, the largest flawless pink diamond ever found and, as of April, the world\u2019s most expensive gemstone.But high prices aren\u2019t the only extraordinary feature of diamonds. They\u2019re extraordinary in the world of science, too, and not just for their famed hardness. The diamond is nature\u2019s standard-bearer for the beauty of slowing things down, especially the fastest thing of all.The next time someone offers you a glass of sparkling water with ice in it, take a closer look before your first sip. The air bubbles, the water, the glass and the ice are all transparent and colorless. The question is: Why aren\u2019t they invisible? You get a bit of help from reflections off the outside, but not much. Light goes through them all, but the crucial subtlety is that it doesn\u2019t go straight through them all.As light travels into the glass from the air, it slows down, which makes it swerve. The swerve is known to physicists as refraction, and the greater the change in speed, the greater the change of direction.\u201cThe speed of light\u201d is well known to be the fastest that anything can travel, but even light doesn\u2019t have to move at that speed. As light flows through glass, it is only traveling at about 67% of that maximum. Then it hits the water, and speeds up slightly, to 75%. Then air, then ice, and more water, speeding up, slowing down and swerving until what arrives at your eye is a contorted image of reality, with some parts missing and some magnified. Your brain is used to this contortion and correctly infers the existence of the invisible components that caused it.In fact, none of us has ever seen or touched light that is traveling at its full speed. Even the insubstantial air around us slows light by a few hundredths of a percent and bends it by a similar amount. At sunset, the moment you think the bottom of the sun\u2019s disk is just touching the horizon is actually when the sun has just passed below the horizon. You can see it because the air has slowed the light and bent its path around the Earth, so although it isn\u2019t straight ahead of you, it\u2019s still visible.Diamond is the champion of this game, slowing light down to a languid 41% of its full speed, less than almost any other material that lets light through. The shimmy as light enters is enough to guide the beam all the way around the inside of the diamond and back out, making a facet opposite shine.But the real beauty arises because different colors cross the jewel at different speeds: from 40.7% for violet light to 41.5% for red, with all of the rainbow spaced out in between.The colors are split at the first swerve and split further on the way out, turning plain white light into vivid glittering sparkles. The pink color of the Pink Star is caused by something different: a minuscule shift in the gem\u2019s crystal structure. Deep inside the volcanic pipes where diamonds are forged, the pressure is immense, and even a diamond may yield slightly in the most extreme conditions, turning it pink.So when you hold a diamond, you\u2019re as close as you\u2019ll ever get to holding light, as it dawdles through the crystal. This moment of serenity brings out the richness of that light, twisting and turning it in such a distinctive way that it\u2019s obvious the sparkle is caused by something special. Even slowing down a tiny bit gives us more to appreciate, and maybe that reminder is the real value of a diamond.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 11:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-brilliant-science-of-diamonds-1497021015", "news_title": "The Brilliant Science of Diamonds", "keywords": "diamonds,helen czerski, light, physics, science, speed of light,political,general news,crime,legal action,traffic violations"}, {"content": "The U.K.\u2019s surprise general election result left the ruling Conservative Party without a majority and many investors without a clue on how the pound will react as political events unfold.There are many ways Britain\u2019s political situation could pan out as the Conservatives scramble to form a government following their failure to win a majority in Thursday\u2019s poll. That is important for a country about to begin it is divorce from the European Union, its biggest trading partner.Each outcome offers a different path for sterling, which tumbled by as much as 2.4% against the dollar after the exit polls came in.\u201cIn recent European elections it\u2019s been very clear in terms of outcomes for markets\u2014good or bad\u2014this time it\u2019s far more foggy,\u201d said Antoine Lesne, head of strategy and research in Europe for SPDR ETF.Here are a few of the scenarios investors are currently trying to game:A Weakened Conservative GovernmentStrategists are torn about what a Conservative minority government means for the pound, though this is the most likely outcome of the vote.Sustaining that government would require full backing from the Conservatives\u2019 own lawmakers and support from the Democratic Unionist Party\u2014a Northern Irish party with 10 members of Parliament that, like the Conservatives, wants to leave the EU.Some investors believe that outcome would lead to a stronger pound, as the government would be forced into a more conciliatory position with the EU. Most investors believe that Brexit will be bad for the British economy, given its potential effect on trade and the country\u2019s large finance industry.\u201cWe would caution against chasing (the pound) lower from here. Today\u2019s result will in part be seen as a vote against a definitive break from the EU,\u201d said John Wraith, head of U.K. rates strategy at UBS. \u201cA Tory minority may have to make concessions in the direction of a softer exit.\u201dBut others believe that political uncertainty may overwhelm any optimism about the potential for a so-called soft Brexit and keep pressure on sterling.\u201cRegardless of a possible arrangement with DUP\u2014the new government won\u2019t have a strong mandate from the get-go,\u201d said Rabobank in a research note. \u201cAs the position of the new government emerges, the currency could be in for a rocky ride.\u201dAnalysts at HSBC predict that sterling will hit $1.20 by the end of the year, even with a Conservative-led government.A More Powerful Labour PartyA minority government led by the Labour Party now seems unlikely. With 261 seats, even support from other parties wouldn\u2019t bring Labour to 316 seats, the number needed to get a majority.If Prime Minister Theresa May fails to form an administration, the Labour Party would get a crack at it.Some analysts see a minority Labour government as the most sterling-positive outcome. While both the Conservatives and Labour say Brexit should still happen, Labour is expected to adopt a more conciliatory approach with Brussels. J.P. Morgan\u2019s foreign exchange strategists predict it would push the pound 2% to 3% higher from pre-vote levels.\u201cIt could ultimately lead to a far less disruptive Brexit,\u201d the bank said.In any case, a slim conservative majority could leave the Labour Party with more influence over the shape of Brexit. If the Conservative\u2019s more pro- or anti-EU lawmakers refuse to back Mrs. May on Brexit she may have to call on Labour, which has so far stuck to its position on the issue.\u201cThe possibility of a soft Brexit holds the promise of a more constructive view on sterling,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multiasset at Janus Henderson. \u201cBut the fog of domestic political uncertainly will need to clear before much faith can be placed in that scenario.\u201dNo Functioning GovernmentThe most negative outcome for sterling may be if it takes a long time for any government to form, something that happens relatively regularly in continental Europe and could lead to another election. The U.K. was set to began negotiating the two-year period of exiting the EU within two weeks, and the longer it takes for a new administration to form, the longer the clock ticks.\u201cAnother election could be pursued later this year. This injects huge uncertainty into markets and will lead to volatility,\u201d said Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM. \u201cIn our view, this is the worst possible outcome for the markets in the short term.\u201dThough the U.K. can ask for the two-year negotiation period to be extended, that would require the unanimous agreement of all EU states.\u201cThe longer this goes without a resolution, the more uncertainty there is,\" said Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, who sees the pound falling to $1.25 or $1.24 under that scenario.Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 10:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-the-pound-a-world-of-uncertainty-awaits-1497020350", "news_title": "For the Pound: Three Scenarios", "keywords": "European Union,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,foreign-exchange commentary,routine market,financial news"}, {"content": "More than a dozen state attorneys general wrote to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency vowing a legal fight to block regulators from easing vehicle-emissions standards, the latest broadside in a battle over the Trump administration\u2019s move to reopen a review of the regulations.New York Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman       and 12 other attorneys general sent a letter to EPA Administrator       Scott Pruitt       late Thursday, threatening to take the agency to court should U.S. officials relax the standards when the regulatory review concludes, according to a person familiar with the matter and a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office on Friday confirmed the Journal\u2019s report, disclosing the coalition of attorneys general wrote to Mr. Pruitt and releasing the letter publicly.The state officials were writing in response to a letter Mr. Pruitt sent to California Gov.       Jerry Brown       in May asserting that the Obama administration\u2019s review of the emissions standards was flawed and circumvented a process that wasn\u2019t expected to be concluded until April 2018.The EPA, about a week before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, closed the so-called midterm review and locked in standards requiring car companies to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon, or 40 mpg in real-world driving, by 2025. The emissions targets, often expressed in terms of mileage, start climbing significantly in 2022.Many of the states writing to Mr. Pruitt follow stringent tailpipe emissions standards that California sets under a waiver from the EPA. Mr. Brown in March told Mr. Pruitt that California would take \u201cnecessary actions to preserve current standards\u201d after the Trump administration reopened the emissions review. California\u2019s standards are aligned with U.S. regulations set before Mr. Trump took office.The state attorneys general writing to Mr. Pruitt said they were adopting California\u2019s stance. Some state officials are leery that the administration could attempt to revoke California\u2019s waiver in an attempt to prevent it and other states from setting standards tougher than those emanating from Washington.\u201cIf you seek to roll back these important standards, we intend to pursue appropriate legal action to defend them in court,\u201d the attorneys general wrote to Mr. Pruitt, adding that if the EPA \u201cacts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action.\u201dThe EPA had no immediate comment.Auto makers contend the standards are tough to meet as low gasoline prices send consumers flocking to fuel-thirsty pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles that now account for more than 60% of U.S. sales. That makes it difficult to sell electric cars and other more-expensive, cleaner technologies needed to meet future standards, auto makers say.Car companies have pointed to stretching the time frame for meeting the standards and receiving more compliance credits for certain technologies to help them meet future targets. A Washington lobbying group representing auto makers earlier this year estimated current rules will cost them $200 billion. Still, car makers want to ensure U.S. standards are in line with California\u2019s rules to avoid a patchwork of regulations across state lines.California in late March upheld its own vehicle emissions standards. The EPA and California officials have found auto makers in recent years beating targets, with costs for technologies needed for compliance declining. According to California regulators, auto makers can meet future standards even with 93% of their vehicles featuring gas-powered engines, and the rest using electric-car technology.California and the states writing to the EPA chief support stringent emissions regulations on tailpipes, contending their rules significantly cut greenhouse gases and combat climate change, and also reduce dependence on foreign oil. The future targets currently on the books would save U.S. motorists $1,650 each over the lifetime of a new vehicle, largely due to less money spent on fuel, according to EPA research.The signatories to Thursday\u2019s letter include attorneys general in Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Washington, D.C.

The strategy has been a hallmark of Soviet and post-Soviet propaganda, and some commentators have accused President       Donald Trump       of mimicking Mr. Putin\u2019s use of the technique. When former Fox News host       Bill O\u2019Reilly       called Mr. Putin \u201ca killer\u201d in an interview in February, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cWe got a lot of killers\u2014what, you think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201dThe term was popularized by articles in 2007 and 2008 by       Edward Lucas,        senior editor at the Economist. Mr. Lucas, who served as the magazine\u2019s Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002, saw \u201cwhataboutism\u201d as a typical Cold War style of argumentation, with \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s useful idiots\u201d seeking to \u201cmatch every Soviet crime with a real or imagined western one.\u201dBut the roots of \u201cwhataboutism\u201d actually go back to the decadeslong sectarian struggle between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.On Jan. 30, 1974, the Irish Times published a letter to the editor from       Sean O\u2019Conaill,        a history teacher from the town of Coleraine in Northern Ireland. Mr. O\u2019Conaill wrote of \u201cthe Whatabouts,\u201d his name for \u201cthe people who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the \u2018enemy.\u2019 \u201dThree days later, in the same newspaper,       John Healy       picked up the theme in his \u201cBackbencher\u201d column, citing Mr. O\u2019Conaill\u2019s letter. \u201cWe have a bellyful of Whataboutery in these killing days, and the one clear fact to emerge is that people, Orange and Green, are dying as a result of it,\u201d he wrote.Commentators on the Troubles embraced the term \u201cwhataboutery\u201d and frequently mentioned it in the ensuing years of strife. The \u201cwhataboutism\u201d variant appeared as early as 1993, in       Tony Parker\u2019s       book \u201cMay the Lord in His Mercy Be Kind to Belfast\u201d: \u201cAnd I\u2019d no time at all for \u2018What aboutism\u2019\u2014you know, people who said \u2018Yes, but what about what\u2019s been done to us?\u2019 \u201dReached by email, Mr. O\u2019Conaill told me that he is surprised at how the \u201cwhatabout\u201d idea has spread and mutated since his 1974 letter to the editor. \u201cThe phenomenon was waiting to be named, and others were soon observing it too, and naming it much the same way,\u201d he said.

I said that I wanted Middlebury to be a community whose members engage in reasoned, thoughtful debate openly and without fear, where we are resilient in argument and generous to those we disagree with, and where the conversational circle expands to take in more and more people. I had no illusions about how difficult and messy it might be to achieve these goals, but I also had no doubt that we needed to pursue them.We experienced a hard test of these aims in early March, when student demonstrators at Middlebury shut down a speaking event featuring the political scientist       Charles Murray.       A rash of similarly disturbing incidents on other campuses this spring has reminded us of the fragility of the principle of free expression and why all of our institutions, but especially our institutions of higher learning, must be vigilant in safeguarding it.At Middlebury\u2019s commencement last month, as I shook the hands of 550 graduating seniors, it was difficult to overlook the challenge that lies before them. These young people\u2014our newest alumni\u2014are a remarkable group, full of promise and hope. But the unfortunate reality in America today is that they are embarking on their life\u2019s journey at a moment when our nation is sharply divided\u2014politically, economically, culturally, and in seemingly every other way. As historian       Jon Meacham       said to our graduates in his commencement address, \u201cA decade and a half into the 21st century, what do we love in common? The painful but unavoidable answer is: not enough.\u201dIt was precisely this dynamic of polarization that played out when Charles Murray came to Middlebury. Students from a conservative campus group, the American Enterprise Institute Club, had invited him to talk about his 2012 book \u201cComing Apart,\u201d which explores the roots of class division in white America. In publicizing the event, the students had cited the need for vigorous discussion and asked the community to listen to Dr. Murray and challenge his ideas. His 1994 co-authored book, \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d which linked race with IQ, has long been the focus of controversy and served as the backdrop for how many on campus saw the event.A number of groups at Middlebury were upset by the prospect of Dr. Murray\u2019s appearance and asked the administration to cancel the event. In the spirit of a robust public square, we thought it was important to allow students and others in the community to engage with Dr. Murray about the issues on their minds.\u2018Like many at Middlebury, I was deeply upset by these events.\u2019Students protested when Dr. Murray took the stage. They prevented him from speaking and went on to disrupt attempts to continue the program, including a question-and-answer session moderated by Prof.       Allison Stanger,        via video feed\u2014a backup plan that we had created to ensure that the talk could continue even if it was disrupted in the hall. Later, when Dr. Murray, Prof. Stanger and a Middlebury administrator left the building, a crowd of about 20 people, most of them outsiders but some students as well, physically confronted them and surrounded their car. Prof. Stanger was injured in the melee.Like many at Middlebury, I was deeply upset by these events. As a community of learners, we must extend the same privileges and rights of speech to others as we would ask others to extend to us. Given my call for more resilient conversations and debate, the disruption of Dr. Murray\u2019s talk was especially disheartening.The college immediately asked independent investigators to give us an impartial account of what happened. They reviewed photographic and video evidence, interviewed a number of eyewitnesses and gathered other statements and accounts. Their work provided the basis for disciplinary proceedings under the college\u2019s long-established, community-based judicial procedures. The college charged a number of students with violating policies that prohibit disruptive behavior at community events and that call on students to \u201crespect the dignity, freedom and rights of others\u201d and forbids \u201cviolence or the use of physical force.\u201dThe Community Judiciary Board (which is made up of students, faculty and staff members) heard the most serious of these charges, made the final determination of wrongdoing and assigned sanctions. Neither I nor anyone in the senior administration had the authority to impose penalties unilaterally.In a March 5 article on the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s AEIdeas blog, Charles Murray wrote about his experience at Middlebury:In the 23 years since \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d was published, I have had considerable experience with campus protests. Until [the event at Middlebury], all of the ones involving me have been as carefully scripted as kabuki: The college administration meets with the organizers of the protest and ground rules are agreed upon. The protesters have so many minutes to do such and such. It is agreed that after the allotted time, they will leave or desist. These negotiated agreements have always worked. At least a couple of dozen times, I have been able to give my lecture to an attentive (or at least quiet) audience despite an organized protest.Middlebury tried to negotiate such an agreement with the protesters, but, for the first time in my experience, the protesters would not accept any time limits. If this becomes the new normal, the number of colleges willing to let themselves in for an experience like Middlebury\u2019s will plunge to near zero. Academia is already largely sequestered in an ideological bubble, but at least it\u2019s translucent. That bubble will become opaque.Worse yet, the intellectual thugs will take over many campuses. In the mid-1990s, I could count on students who had wanted to listen to start yelling at the protesters after a certain point, \u201cSit down and shut up, we want to hear what he has to say.\u201d That kind of pushback had an effect. It reminded the protesters that they were a minority. I am assured by people at Middlebury that their protesters are a minority as well. But they are a minority that has intimidated the majority. The people in the audience who wanted to hear me speak were completely cowed. That cannot be allowed to stand. A campus where a majority of students are fearful to speak openly because they know a minority will jump on them is no longer an intellectually free campus in any meaningful sense.In the end, the board took disciplinary action against 74 Middlebury students. Most received probation, which means that they will face more serious penalties if they violate these policies again. A few, who took an especially prominent role in the episode, received what we call \u201ccollege discipline,\u201d which places a letter in their permanent file noting their infractions. Because students often must disclose such information in applications to graduate programs and employers, it is a serious penalty, with potentially long-term consequences. For its part, the Middlebury Police Department investigated the events outside the hall and found no evidence to support criminal charges.On campus and in press coverage of these events, some praised our effort to hold the students accountable, noting that we had followed Middlebury\u2019s longstanding policy of drawing a clear line between peaceful and disruptive protest. Some dismissed the sanctions as a slap on the wrist, and others criticized our actions as overly punitive, arguing that all protest is inherently disruptive. Not everyone was happy with the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings, but we were all committed to the integrity of our established practices, including the role of the community-based judicial body charged with deciding such cases.For Middlebury and other schools where such confrontations are sure to arise again, it is now time to look ahead and to think about principles that can help us to avoid future escalation and to ensure respect for the rights of both speech and protest. I would suggest the following:\u00b7 Embrace freedom of expression and inquiry as an educational value for everyone, regardless of their background or political views. Controversial speech is especially difficult at a time when issues that should be addressed and debated become the exclusive province of the left or the right. In our current state of high tension, it is hard to explore vital, fraught topics such as the history of oppression or the nature of freedom, but we have a responsibility to teach and discuss them openly and honestly, with mutual respect.\u00b7 Move beyond the false dichotomy between free speech and inclusiveness. Our dual commitment to free expression and to making all students full members of our communities must be embraced fiercely and with conviction. But an educational institution does not become more inclusive by limiting freedom of expression. Nor does it achieve greater freedom by reducing its commitment to building an inclusive, robust, brave public square where all students are equally welcomed and valued.\u2018Educational institutions have a primary obligation to foster open and civil discourse.\u2019\u00b7 Let students know that, when these values come into conflict, as they did at Middlebury this past spring, educational institutions have a primary obligation to foster open and civil discourse. Schools have to be prepared to enforce this commitment, as we did in this episode. Free speech lies at the heart of our purpose as an institution, and we cannot allow force or disruption to undermine it.\u00b7 Ensure that students have a basic understanding of the First Amendment and its history as well as of historical and current models for creating a more inclusive public square. It is essential to include such topics in student orientations and to ask them to reflect on them at regular intervals throughout their careers.\u00b7 Prepare students for our polarized politics by actively acknowledging and learning about the full range of perspectives on the important issues of the day. Faculty should regularly ask themselves and their students if anyone is afraid to speak about his or her views\u2014including conservative students, who tell us that they often feel alienated in the classroom and social settings of left-leaning campuses.\u00b7 Reflect on who is and is not included in different public debates, and ask why. Many students from underrepresented groups tell us that they get the message every day that they do not belong at elite colleges. Are there ways to create new traditions of dialogue and argument that can expand the definition of who belongs? Our public square must be as energetically invitational as it is educationally rigorous.I believe that this dual commitment to free expression and inclusiveness is crucial to the well-being of our institutions of higher learning and to the health of American society as a whole. But I won\u2019t pretend that the tension between them is easy to negotiate or resolve. If we manage it well, however, it can be a force in our public life for creativity rather than for distrust and division.\u2018Once censorship becomes acceptable in principle, those who have walked on the margins will become even more vulnerable.\u2019At Middlebury and other schools, we must respect and engage students who have walked on the margins of American society. This means not turning our back on the accumulated injury that some of them have confronted in the history of our nation. But this is yet another reason to remain committed to the fundamental value of freedom of expression and inquiry: Once censorship becomes acceptable in principle, those who have walked on the margins will become even more vulnerable, putting at risk the gains we have made in reducing disparities in access and increasing participation.We must prepare young Americans, whatever their background, to take on arguments that offend them; to enter the public square with better ideas supported with better reason, better research, better logic, and better data; to risk being offended and to argue back even when they might feel afraid.Committed speech, reasoned speech, courageous speech, speech countering other speech\u2014these are essential to higher education and to sound democratic politics. It is simply not acceptable to shut down speakers and interfere with the right of others to hear them, learn from them and challenge them. Only when we\u2019re able to listen to each other, across our many differences, will we begin to discover, for our own times, what we are still capable of loving in common.Dr. Patton is the president of Middlebury College and a scholar of South Asian history, culture and religion.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'The Outspoken Campus.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 10:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-right-way-to-protect-free-speech-on-campus-1497019583", "news_title": "The Right Way to Protect Free Speech on Campus", "keywords": " campus,campus protests,charles murray, college, free speech,laurie l. patton,middlebury, universities,political,general news,society,community,education,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college"}, {"content": "Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

Online ticketing company Eventbrite Inc. is buying Pandora\u2019s Ticketfly for $200 million, down significantly from what Pandora originally paid for it in 2015. Pandora\u2019s initial deal to buy Ticketfly was valued at about $450 million in cash and stock, but the value fell to $335.3 million after its own share price fell.In May, Pandora said it would review strategic options, including a potential sale of the company, and said it struck a deal for private-equity firm KKR & Co. to make a $150 million investment.Friday, the company said the review process resulted in the Sirius investment and the canceling of the KKR deal. KKR will get a $22.5 million termination fee.Shares of Pandora rose 5.8% to $8.91 in morning trading, though they are still down 25% over the past three months.The recorded music industry has seen its global revenue drop 60% since 2000, and it was hoping paid-streaming services would grow fast enough to make up for declining CD and download sales. Pandora launched a $10-a-month music service earlier this year amid steep competition from other streaming providers. Players like             Apple Inc.\u2019s       music service and Spotify AB are grabbing subscribers.Pandora Chief Executive       Tim Westergren       said the investment will help the company grow and innovate.When the deal closes, three individuals chosen by SiriusXM will be named to Pandora\u2019s board and one will become it chairman.Sirius holdings represent a stake of 19% of Pandora\u2019s outstanding common shares.

Denied an outright majority in Parliament, she must now cobble together a government, thrusting the country into a new period of uncertainty as it prepares to depart from the EU.Other explanations for the poor showing Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives\u2014and the better-than-expected performance of Labour, the U.K.\u2019s other main political party\u2014will emerge as exit polls and other data are examined in detail. But some patterns are already clear.Overall, voter turnout on Thursday was high, with the proportion of voters who cast ballots rising to 68.7% from 66.1% in 2015, its highest level since 1997.Also, both the Conservatives and Labour, led by       Jeremy Corbyn,        boosted their share of the vote at the expense of smaller parties, attracting 82.4% of votes cast\u2014the highest combined share since 89.4% in 1970.But Labour, in particular, was the main beneficiary of the increased turnout by the young, especially in districts where they formed a large part of the electorate.Anthony Wells,        director of political and social opinion polling at YouGov, said the 2016 referendum to take Britain out of the EU was fresh in their minds. Although younger people wanted the U.K. to stay in the bloc, many stayed home in last year\u2019s vote, while older voters who wanted Brexit headed to the polling stations.\u201cWe\u2019ve had       Trump,        we\u2019ve had Brexit, and both were instances where people thought it was never going to happen and didn\u2019t bother to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThose surprise results made it more important for people to vote for what they believe in.\u201dCollege towns and districts with a higher proportion of younger voters saw rises in the Labour\u2019s share of the vote, in the double digits.A survey of 14,000 people who voted\u00a0Thursday, commissioned by       Michael Ashcroft,        a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, found that 67% of those aged 18 to 24 voted for Labour. The Conservative Party was supported by 59% of those aged 65 and over.Chloe Pizzey,        a 19-year-old student at the University of Kent, voted in her first general election. Her district in south London remained in Labour\u2019s hands, with an increase in its share of the vote of 12.2%. She said conversations with friends suggested the Brexit vote had made them more likely to vote.\u201cBrexit had a massive impact,\u201d she said. \u201cLeaving the EU was a massive shock to loads of young people. They wanted to make sure they got the best outcome.\u201dCanterbury, a Conservative district since 1918, saw a 20.1% rise in the Labour vote as it changed hands. That shift appears to have been driven by the large student population, among whom Labour\u2019s pledge to abolish tuition fees also proved popular.The number of people who voted in the district rose to 56,800 from 53,465 in 2015, pushing up turnout to 72.7% from 64% in 2015.In Bristol North West, a district in England\u2019s southwest, Labour\u2019s       Darren Jones       became a lawmaker for the first time on the strength of a 16.2% increase in his vote compared with his losing effort 2015.Mr. Jones credited his success to his \u201cunashamedly pro-European\u201d stance, which he said attracted support from people who would otherwise have voted for other parties.\u201cA coalition of voters supported me, not just because I\u2019m a Labour candidate,\u201d he said.Mr. Jones said that across the country, Labour had outperformed in districts that supported continued membership of the EU, and had done less well in districts that favored Brexit.Mrs. May called the election in April, betting she could substantially increase her party\u2019s 17-seat majority and strengthen her hand as she negotiated Brexit. One of the party\u2019s hopes was that voters would abandon the UK Independence Party, which had long sought Brexit and seemed to have no further purpose.UKIP\u2019s vote fell by almost 11% compared with 2015, but Conservatives weren\u2019t the only party to benefit. As a result, they failed to win seats they had hoped to gain from Labour in the northeast of England.Contrary to expectations before Thursday\u2019s vote, Labour and the Conservatives drew almost the same share of voters who had abandoned UKIP, said Mr. Wells, the YouGov official.While the Conservatives\u2019 anticipation of former UKIP support appears to have been wrongheaded, there were also some specifically regional trends that worked in the party\u2019s favor.In Scotland, the Conservatives increased the number of districts they hold to 13 from one, as the pro-independence Scottish National Party lost ground.That shift represented a unionist vote, as Scots who want to remain in the United Kingdom looked to the Conservative Party. The country rejected independence in a 2014 referendum, but SNP leader       Nicola Sturgeon,        who leads the country\u2019s government, had suggested a rerun might be possible if the U.K. leaves the EU. After Thursday, that seems less likely.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Young Voters Proved Pivotal for Labour.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 10:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-voters-flock-to-labour-denying-theresa-mays-conservatives-in-u-k-election-1497006858", "news_title": "Young Voters Flock to Labour, Spurning Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives in U.K. Election ", "keywords": " brexit, coalition government, conservative party, hung parliament, labour party,supply and confidence,uk election, youth vote,European Union,Conservative Party,Labour Party,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "DENVER\u2014The oft-repeated line around the U.S. men\u2019s national team these days is, \u201cwe have to be patient and give him time.\u201d\u201cHim\u201d in this case is Christian Pulisic, the 18-year-old wunderkind of the American team, whose two second-half goals against Trinidad & Tobago in a crucial World Cup qualifier here Thursday night once again kept hope alive for a U.S. team that for long spells looks like the furthest thing from a World Cup-quality squad.So here is the problem with the polite request for patience with Pulisic: U.S. Soccer simply doesn\u2019t have that luxury. The hard truth is that at the end of 90 minutes, it wasn\u2019t simply a 2-0 win for the U.S., it was every bit Christian Pulisic 2, Trinidad & Tobago 0.\u201cThese guys don\u2019t come along very often,\u201d goalkeeper Tim Howard said of Pulisic after a game that was tied at the half and far more nerve-wracking than it was supposed to be. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to lean on him.\u201dIndeed they are.Halfway through the 10-game, final qualifying tournament, the Americans have proven that they are going to need Pulisic to perform an absurd number of tasks to get enough points to qualify for Russia.He is the hub in the middle of the field who often gets the ball from the back and starts the attack. He is the creative mind up front, whose super-quick, slanted runs into the penalty area leave defenders twisting in search of him and the ball. He has to use that quickness and his young legs to track back on defense and help stymie the opponent\u2019s attack. When the only space open is on the wings he fills it.Head Coach Bruce Arena recently told him to take the free kicks and corner kicks. A showdown with Mexico is just two days away and it seems inevitable that Pulisic will be one of the few players to play another full game at more than more than a mile above sea level. If it were possible him to both cross and finish the same ball, the team might ask him to do that, too.It is a lot to ask of an 18-year-old kid from Hershey, Pennsylvania, a year removed from his senior prom, but U.S. soccer really has no choice.After Thursday night\u2019s game, Trinidad coach Dennis Lawrence said he saw little difference between the two teams, that his team lost because it made two critical mistakes that allowed Pulisic to get free in the penalty area, where he is deadly. Lawrence wasn\u2019t far off.That is sort of incredible given that his team represents an island nation of 1.2 million people with a gross domestic product of $43 billion, which is about what New York City spends on its school system every 16 months. Only the crossbar, which stopped Trinidad striker Kenwyne Jones\u2019 header late in the first half, allowed the U.S. to head into halftime with a scoreless tie.After two wins and a draw under Arena\u2014installed in November to replace Jurgen Klinsmann following two ugly losses to open this tournament\u2014the U.S. tenuously holds the third and final automatic qualifying place from its region, but there are still some big problems. The defense is unsteady, and gives up too many good scoring chances. Arena is frustrated with how slowly the team transitions the ball through the middle of the field, as though they have never watched the Golden State Warriors play basketball, or the world champion Germans play soccer.Fabian Johnson, the German-American midfielder who played inspired in 2014, rarely creates danger on the wing. Striker Clint Dempsey still starts but can\u2019t seem to beat a defender one-on-one. He was seriously salty when Arena subbed him out after an ineffective hour Thursday night, almost refusing to shake Arena\u2019s hand as he left the field.Striker Jozy Altidore and midfielder Michael Bradley are in their late 20s and no longer getting better. Tim Howard is 38. Younger talents like DeAndre Yedlin and Jordan Morris aren\u2019t as advanced in their development as coaches expected them to be.Then there is Pulisic, who is going to have to carry this team to Russia whether he likes it or not. Arena knows this. Moments after he said everyone needed to give the teenager time to develop, he was asked if he was actually doing that, given that he is already asking him to quarterback the team and score and do so many other things.\u201cWhere would you have me play him?\u201d Arena responded rhetorically.Thursday night, Arena said Pulisic had been a little hesitant when told he was going to be taking the free kicks and corner kicks\u2014a job that Bradley, the captain, used to fill. Arena told him not to worry, that if he got fired for giving the kicks to Pulisic he would be just fine with that.\u201cI guess I have to start taking more responsibilities,\u201d Pulisic said as he headed for the bus following the game.For now, goalkeeping seems out of the question, but at this point anything seems possible.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 10:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-time-is-now-for-u-s-soccer-phenom-1497019021", "news_title": "The Time Is Now for U.S. Soccer Phenom", "keywords": "soccer,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Is mass commerce capable of producing elegant art objects?

DLTR 1.54%       is suing Sycamore Partners, alleging the firm not only siphoned funds and took more than $50 million of goods and services without payment, but also ended up hurting its brand.The lawsuit stems from Dollar Tree\u2019s sale of 330 stores to Sycamore Partners in 2015\u2014a deal that was required by the Federal Trade Commission to have the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merger pass muster.The merger resulted in the largest chain of dollar stores in the country, with about 14,400 stores currently. But the 330 stores sold to Sycamore two years ago are creating a big headache for the giant chain.As part of the deal, Dollar Tree had signed an agreement to provide goods and services at cost to Sycamore Partners, as well as allow the chunk of stores to remain under the Dollar Tree name for a year. The few hundred stores were then intended to be renamed Dollar Express Inc., the new company formed by Sycamore.However, more than two years after the deal, and about $50 million in unpaid costs later, the stores remain under their original banners. They were recently liquidated after the business was no longer \u201cviable,\u201d due to \u201ccompetitive conditions since the purchase,\u201d Sycamore said in a FTC filing. As part of the liquidation, the second major chain in the sector,             Dollar General Corp.      , will take over the defunct locations.The liquidations \u201ccaused customer confusion and harm\u201d to Dollar Tree\u2019s brand and goodwill, as the stores were still using its name, Dollar Tree said in court papers. The retailer said customers reached out to them \u201cto express dismay and displeasure with the store conditions and conduct of the liquidations.\u201dWhen the year-mark passed for the name change, Dollar Tree said it entered negotiations with Sycamore to extend the agreement, but the talks inevitably went nowhere.Dollar Tree wants an outsider to oversee that the proceeds of the liquidations get rationed off evenly, in hopes of some being pitched their way to repay Sycamore\u2019s debts. Sycamore has given \u201cpreferential treatment of certain creditors to stave off an involuntary bankruptcy filing, and its refusal to pay [Dollar Tree] tens of millions of dollars owed,\u201d Dollar Tree said in its lawsuit.A spokesman for Sycamore Partners and Dollar Express told The Wall Street Journal that Dollar Tree\u2019s allegations \u201care without merit.\u201d\u201cSycamore Partners formed Dollar Express in 2015 to acquire 330 Family Dollar branded stores to provide a much-needed business solution to the FTC\u2019s challenge to the 2015 merger of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar,\u201d the spokesman said.Sycamore has responded to Dollar Tree\u2019s lawsuit with one of their own. Sycamore alleges that Dollar Tree schemed to kill its dollar-store venture by opening up its own locations nearby and diverting customers, court papers show.The New York buyout firm said in court papers the \u201cscheme\u201d resulted in the closure of its stores as well as \u201cthe loss of approximately 3,000 jobs\u2026and the loss of millions of dollars invested\u201d to establish the stores.A Dollar Tree spokeswoman rejected those allegations.\u201cSycamore Partners failed to make Dollar Express a viable and solvent retailer, and its failure had nothing to do with Dollar Tree,\u201d a Dollar Tree spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cSycamore\u2019s lawsuit is a disingenuous attempt to deflect attention away from their refusal to pay Dollar Tree over $50 million for goods and services and to shift blame for another of their retail failures.\u201dDollar Tree and Sycamore are slated to meet Tuesday in Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court.Sycamore has made its name buying distressed retailers and their assets. The firm, run by       Stefan Kaluzny,        focuses on the retail sector-- particularly distressed investments, like bankruptcy-sale acquisitions of Coldwater Creek Inc., Limited Stores Co. brand names.

But in talking with and hearing from hundreds of retirees through the years, I have found that those who are most satisfied with their lives spent at least some time thinking and talking about their hopes for the future\u2014typically, several years before retirement itself\u2014and then took specific actions to move closer to those goals.As one retiree memorably told me: Retirement could well \u201crepresent 25% of your life. Why leave it to chance?\u201dI have often read that 4% is a relatively safe withdrawal rate for your retirement savings to last for 30 years or more. I am soon to be 69 and am fortunate enough to be in relatively good health and still able to work full time. I am currently planning on delaying retirement until age 70.If I retire at 70 and now have to plan only for 25 years of retirement, can I safely withdraw a higher percentage? If so, what would your estimate of that percentage be?Actually,       William Bengen,        the California-based financial adviser who developed the 4% rule, addressed this very idea\u2014time horizons shorter than 30 years\u2014in some of his early research. In 1996, for instance, he calculated that a person leaving work at age 75 with a retirement lasting 20 years could use a safe withdrawal rate of about 5.1%.In the years since, several researchers have tackled the same topic. Their efforts have been summarized nicely in an article by       Michael Kitces,        director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md. (Go to kitces.com and search for: adjusting safe withdrawal rates to the retiree\u2019s time horizon.) For a 25-year time horizon, a good initial withdrawal rate, according to Mr. Kitces, is about 4.5%.I am 88 with an individual retirement account, from which I take the required minimum distributions each year. Don\u2019t laugh, but I became gainfully employed again last year, and my employer has a 401(k) plan into which it deposits some money and I likewise. Because I am an employee adding to this new 401(k), do I have to take distributions from it, or can I just wait until I retire from this employment? And if I can wait, when do I need to begin withdrawals?There\u2019s a good chance you can wait, but you need to check with your company and/or 401(k) custodian. Generally, individuals age 70\u00bd and older who are still working can delay taking RMDs from their current employer\u2019s 401(k) if they own no more than 5% of the company and if their particular company plan allows employees to delay RMDs. Many companies allow such delays.And if you\u2019re wondering, there is no formal definition of \u201cstill working,\u201d notes Ed Slott, an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. The employment can be part time or full time.If you are able to postpone required withdrawals, your first RMD would be due for the year in which you retire. So if you retire in, say, 2018, you would have to take an RMD for that year. But you would have until April 1, 2019, to make the actual withdrawal. If you take advantage of the extra time, you would have to take two withdrawals in 2019: one for tax year 2018 and one for tax year 2019.And congratulations on the new job. No laughing here! I hope it\u2019s something you enjoy.Mr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.

During World War II, it was used as a prisoner-of war camp. After the war,       Stanley Whitman,        a real-estate investor and Navy veteran, moved into a former military barracks there so he and his young family could live near the beach.In a vision few shared, he saw the potential for luxury shops in Bal Harbour to give jet-setters a diversion from the beach. The open-air mall he developed, Bal Harbour Shops, opened in 1965 and became one of the most lucrative in the U.S.His success was partly due to persistence in courting executives of luxury retailers\u2014and waiting for them in lobbies if they put him off. \u201cIt was nothing to go and spend a half a day waiting for a big shot to come out,\u201d he told the Miami Herald in 2013. \u201cI was about as welcome as a skunk at a picnic.\u201dThough a sophisticated world traveler, he sometimes described himself as \u201cjust an old gator skinner.\u201dMr. Whitman died May 24 at his home in Miami Shores, Fla. He was 98.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.When planning the mall, he rejected architects\u2019 suggestions that it should be enclosed and air-conditioned. He planted palm trees and counted on sea breezes to keep shoppers comfortable.He also required customers to pay for parking. Otherwise, he believed, parking spaces\u00a0would be\u00a0 hogged by employees of the stores and nearby hotels. \u201cIf I had had free parking, there would be no parking for my customers,\u201d he said in a video interview several years ago.Stanley Finch Whitman was born Nov. 15, 1918, in Evanston, Ill. His father owned a printing business but became increasingly involved in real-estate investments in the Miami area, where young Stanley grew up.He studied economics at Duke University, where he met Dottie Stivers, his future wife. After graduating from Duke, he served in the Navy as a commander of a fleet of submarine chasers off the Atlantic coast.Mr. Whitman joined the family real-estate business after the war and was one of the people involved in incorporating Bal Harbour as a village. He paid about $500,000 to become a partner with Robert Graham in a retail development project there. Later, Mr. Whitman bought out Mr. Graham\u2019s stake in the project.His death came 10 days after the village council in Bal Harbour approved a $400 million plan to expand the mall to about 800,000 square feet from 450,000 square feet.\u00a0 The mall, whose anchor stores are Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, is now headed by one of his grandsons, Matthew Whitman Lazenby.Mr. Whitman played tennis into his 80s and was a dedicated weight lifter who kept records of his exercise regime dating back to the 1970s. At home he had a stair-climbing exercise machine he dubbed \u201cthe beast.\u201dHe is survived by two children, four grandchildren and four great-grandsons.

The aorta, clogged with plaque, showed the risks of poor dietary choices, he explained.\u201cIt was kind of an unusual way to get acquainted with the young man in my life,\u201d she said.Dr. Kummerow, a maverick biochemist who spent most of his career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was finally vindicated in 2013 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed heavy restrictions on trans fats. The agency ruled two years later that, starting in 2018, food makers would have to seek its approval before using partially hydrogenated oils, a primary source of trans fats in processed foods.\u201cHe was certainly ahead of his time,\u201d said       Walter Willett,        a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University. Dr. Willett estimated that food makers already have eliminated 85% or more of the trans fats formerly used in their products.Dr. Kummerow died May 31 at his home in Urbana, Ill. He was 102.\u201cIt was a lonely battle,\u201d he said in a 2015 video interview.Dr. Kummerow worked outside the major centers of nutrition research, struggled to obtain funding and occasionally used his own money to pay assistants. Sometimes he let students live rent-free in his basement.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Most trans fat is formed by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil. Food manufacturers loved the way trans fats improved shelf life, texture and flavor.Fritz August Kummerow, who later adopted the name Fred, was born Oct. 4, 1914, in Berlin. His father fought in World War I and worked for a railroad. Food was so scarce, Fred Kummerow later recalled, that \u201cmy mother used to put me and my brother to bed during the day\u2026rather than let us run around burning calories we didn\u2019t have.\u201dWhen he was a boy, the family emigrated to Milwaukee, joining relatives there. His father found work making concrete blocks but lost that job during the Depression. For a time, the family relied on the $5 a week young Fred earned by delivering newspapers.An uncle gave him a chemistry set, spurring his interest in that subject. \u201cI tried to make noises with bombs and put them on the streetcar tracks,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cIt worked.\u201dAfter graduating from high school, he worked for a wholesale drug company, mixing cold creams and other products, while attending night school. He then transferred to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he earned his doctorate in biochemistry.In the 1940s, he took part in a Clemson University project to study pellagra, a disease then common in the South. He and his colleagues encouraged food makers to fortify corn grits with niacin to prevent the potentially fatal disease.He later worked at Kansas State University, developing his expertise in the role of fats in human and animal health, before joining the University of Illinois in 1950.In Illinois, he obtained samples of arteries from people who had died of heart disease. He discovered large amounts of trans fats clogging those arteries and published his first paper on that topic in 1957.\u00a0 Other academics dismissed his early research. The consensus at the time was that saturated fats, such as those found in meat and dairy products, were the prime danger.Decades later, many other researchers found evidence of harm from trans fats, but Dr. Kummerow wasn\u2019t satisfied with the government\u2019s response. He filed a petition to the FDA in 2009, urging a ban on trans fats. \u201cEverybody should read my petition because it will scare the hell out of them,\u201d he said at the time.By contrast, Dr. Kummerow argued that health warnings against cholesterol in the diet had been overdone. In his 2014 book \u201cCholesterol Is Not the Culprit,\u201d written at age 99, he extolled his own diet, featuring meat, whole milk and daily servings of scrambled eggs cooked in butter. He also recommended a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.He shunned French fries\u2014and saw particular danger in food cooked in oil used numerous times.Dr. Kummerow swam laps daily and enjoyed opera.He is survived by three children, three grandchildren and a great grandson. His wife of 70 years, Amy, died in 2012.\u00a0A former sociology teacher, she served for two decades on the Champaign County board of supervisors.For his 100th birthday, one of Dr. Kummerow\u2019s daughters made him trans fat-free cupcakes.

Eventually, his reputation for flaunting wealth stirred resentments in the Saudi royal family. When Time magazine put him on its cover in 1987, his business empire was in trouble. His entanglement in the Iran-Contra affair and other controversies made him less appealing to Western companies seeking discreet help in tapping Arab markets.Mr. Khashoggi lived his final two decades in relative obscurity. He suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and died Tuesday in London at age 81.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.He was known to his employees as A.K. and once owned an 18,000-square-foot duplex in Olympic Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The Washington Post reported in 1984 that he also had homes in Paris, London, Rome and Madrid, among other places.When he wasn\u2019t in one of those homes, he was likely to be aloft in one of his private planes or afloat in his 285-foot yacht, which made an appearance in the James Bond movie \u201cNever Say Never Again\u201d and later was owned briefly by       Donald Trump.

She converted to Islam and changed her name to Soraya. Their divorce led to a 1980 legal battle in California, during which she accused him of giving expensive gifts to executives of defense contractors, helping them open Swiss bank accounts and inviting them to parties attended by prostitutes. Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s lawyers at the time declined to comment.Adnan Mohamed Khashoggi was born July 25, 1935, in Mecca. His father, a physician to Saudi King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, sent him to Alexandria, Egypt, to study at Victoria College, a boarding school modeled on the elite English secondary schools. He later recalled discovering his calling there: One classmate\u2019s father had a factory making sheets and towels, and another\u2019s wanted to buy those items. Young Adnan made the connection and collected a fee.He began studies at a state college in Chico, Calif., but dropped out after finding he could earn fees by arranging shipments of vehicles to the Middle East.The real money was in military jets and other weaponry. He cultivated clients among defense contractors in the U.S., Britain and France.             Lockheed Corp.       disclosed that it had paid him commissions totaling $106 million in the five years ended in 1975. Shortly after that disclosure, the Saudi government issued a decree banning companies that sold arms to the kingdom from paying commissions to agents.Mr. Khashoggi was in the headlines in the late 1980s as the U.S. Congress unearthed details of how proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran were illegally diverted to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua. An independent counsel appointed to investigate that scandal found that Mr. Khashoggi lent millions of dollars to a broker involved in the deal to facilitate the arms sales. (Mr. Khashoggi said he lost money on the deal.)He amassed a Byzantine global network of businesses, including cattle ranching and real estate, and interests in furniture and meat packing.

The result comes on the heels of strong economic growth in the first quarter and emerges after the Bank of Canada adopted a more upbeat tone following months of caution.The Canadian economy added a net 54,500 jobs in May, Statistics Canada said Friday. Market expectations were for a gain of 15,000 positions, according to economists at             Royal Bank of Canada.       On a year-over-year basis, Canadian employment increased 316,800, or 1.8%, which marks the fastest annual rise in job growth in more than four years.The country\u2019s unemployment rate rose to 6.6% in May from 6.5% in the previous month, matching market expectations. The uptick in the jobless rate can be attributed to an increase of 78,400 Canadians looking for work, the largest one-month gain in the labor force since April 2012.The U.S. released its May jobs report last week, and it showed the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in 16 years, at 4.3%, and data suggested employers started to add to payrolls more slowly in a tight labor market. Using U.S. data concepts, Canada\u2019s jobless rate in May was 5.6%.The Bank of Canada left its main interest rate unchanged last month at 0.50% and in its policy statement pivoted toward a positive tone. This was reinforced in comments Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       made during a news conference Thursday following the release of its semiannual financial-system review.\u201cAt this stage, I am comforted by the fact the economy is showing better dynamics,\u201d Mr. Poloz said.Other economic indicators suggested job growth would continue at a decent clip. A closely watched index put together by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business hit a 30-month high last month, recovering most of the ground lost following the commodity-price swoon that started in mid-2014.Canadian economic output advanced at a 3.7% annualized pace in the first quarter, making the country the best-performing economy among Group of Seven countries in early 2017 on the strength of consumer spending and a long-awaited rebound in business investment. On Monday, the Bank of Canada\u2019s second-ranking official,       Carolyn Wilkins,        is scheduled to deliver remarks in Winnipeg, Manitoba, focusing on developments in the Canadian economy.Even amid a pickup in job creation, the Bank of Canada has exhibited caution, citing \u201csubdued\u201d wage growth. In May, average hourly wages climbed 1.3% from a year ago, versus a comparable 0.7% advance in the previous month, which marked the slowest increase in two decades.\u201cBefore taking the first step in raising policy rates, the Bank of Canada is looking for greater evidence of a tightening labour market,\u201d the economics team at TD Securities said in a note to clients. \u201cFriday\u2019s report strongly adds to that, and moreover, strengthens the view that sustained job gains will put further upward pressure on wages.\u201dAdding to the positive jobs report was data indicating companies operated in the first quarter at their highest rate of capacity in the postcrisis period. This suggests the economy is gradually absorbing slack that is kept a lid on inflationary and wage pressure.The May jobs report said full-time employment in Canada rose 77,000, while the number of part-time jobs declined 22,300. The bulk of net new jobs created in the past 12 months have been full-time positions. The private sector added 59,400 workers in May, and the ranks of the self-employed\u2014generally independent contractors\u2014fell 14,000.The goods-producing and services sectors recorded robust employments gains in May, with the manufacturing adding 25,300 positions.

But the Thursday\u2019s British results weren\u2019t reassuring.Leading up to the election, polls put the Conservative Party of\u00a0Prime Minister       Theresa May       ahead of the main opposition Labour Party by 1 to 12 percentage points.But British voters turned against the prime minister, leaving her short of the 326 seats needed to win a majority of Britain\u2019s 650-seat Parliament.\u201cThe irony is that pollsters were all midstream in making changes when Theresa May called the election,\u201d said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey, which conducts online polls in the U.S. and U.K.Polls can be bedeviled by low response rates, samples that are too small or respondents whose demographics don\u2019t match those of voters. To examine their practices, the U.S. and U.K. each assigned a task force.The American Association for Public Opinion Research wanted to know why U.S. polls had erroneously predicted that       Hillary Clinton       would win the 2016 presidential election.The British Polling Council and Market Research Society wanted to know why U.K. polls had incorrectly shown the Conservative and Labour parties running neck and neck in 2015, when in the end the Conservatives won 38% of the vote to Labour\u2019s 31%.Either polling mistake could have influenced voter turnout, political strategies or possibly even the end result of the elections.Historically, one of the most reliable ways to conduct public-opinion polls has been through telephone surveys based on what are known as probability samples of randomly selected participants, in which every member of a group (likely voters, for example) has an equal chance of being selected.But such polls are costly and have been undermined by poor response rates and the proliferation of cellphones. Less than half of American homes now have landlines.To compensate, polling companies increasingly rely on nonprobability internet surveys, which are cheaper but potentially less accurate.A\u00a0solution to make the surveys more accurate is to weight non-random samples to correct for biases, but in 2015, the U.K. polls got that wrong. The British inquiry concluded the survey samples systematically overrepresented Labour supporters and underrepresented Conservative supporters.The samples were weighted to account for such discrepancies, but the statistical adjustments failed.The British inquiry suggested a number of remedies to ensure that future samples would be representative, but in the short-term, the changes, which are still in progress, may have contributed to the wide-ranging survey results leading up to this week\u2019s election.\u201cWe are in this situation where the methods have not been fully adapted to the recommendations of the British Polling Council, nor is it exactly clear what should be done,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Similarly, after reviewing last year\u2019s American presidential race surveys, the U.S. task force concluded that national polls, predictors of the popular vote, got it right, but state polls, predictors of the Electoral College vote, didn\u2019t.In the U.S. Electoral College, representatives from each state formally cast votes to elect the president and vice president.\u00a0A state\u2019s electors are equal in number to its representatives in the U.S. House and Senate.When the popular vote and Electoral College results disagree, as they did in 2016, state-level polls are a better predictor of the election outcome.\u201cUltimately, the only thing that mattered was the Electoral College, and the polls didn\u2019t get that right,\u201d said Timothy P. Johnson, president of the American public-opinion research group.Most notably, the state polls failed to account for the overrepresentation of college graduates in polling samples, a discrepancy that caused important battleground states to appear to favor Mrs. Clinton, according to the U.S. task force report. The examination observed that contemporary polls seldom interview enough voters without a college degree, though in the U.S., two-thirds of the adult population doesn\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s degree.The national polls, which tend to have larger samples and more comprehensive weighting adjustments, did align with the results of the popular vote.\u201cThe polls said collectively that Clinton had a 3 percentage point lead,\u201d Dr. Johnson said. \u201cWhen the vote count was finished, she had a 2 percentage point lead.\u201dThe perception of the accuracy of the polls was also influenced by forecasts issued by various outlets that aggregated the results of multiple polls and calculated the probability of each candidate winning the election.

She now faces the task of cobbling together a government, which will entail political deals and compromises, including possible changes to its terms for departing the EU.European Council President       Donald Tusk       said Friday on             Twitter                   that a date for the start of Brexit talks was still uncertain. But he urged the U.K. to move swiftly to ensure the two sides reach a deal by the March 2019 deadline.\u201cWe know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 as result of \u2018no negotiations,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tusk wrote.That view was echoed across Europe. A spokeswoman for German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       said the two-year period for negotiating Brexit had already started, noting that it can be extended only if all EU countries agree.Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said the EU had been waiting for the talks to begin since U.K. voters decided in referendum last June to leave the bloc.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should talk about some prolongation of the deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should clearly come to terms with the British to start as quickly as possible.\u201dBefore Thursday\u2019s election, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator,       Michel Barnier,        had called for talks to begin on June 19. His team of negotiators has already started setting out its negotiating positions publicly.European officials said they were ready to go.\u201cAs far as the commission is concerned we can open negotiations tomorrow morning at half past nine,\u201d European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       said at a news conference in Prague. \u201cI do hope the result of the elections will have no major impact on the negotiations we are desperately waiting for.\u201dThe U.K. formally notified the EU on March 29 about its intention to leave the bloc, triggering the two-year process to withdraw.Mr. Barnier warned last month that time is short to negotiate the terms of divorce between the EU and the U.K. and to agree on the outlines of their future relationship. He wants negotiations completed by October 2018 to ensure enough time to ratify the exit terms.Mrs. May\u2019s decision to call snap elections was aimed at strengthening her government\u2019s negotiating mandate in the talks and in Brussels. Many EU officials hoped it would give her team the flexibility to make the concessions needed to secure a deal.During the campaign, Mrs. May pointed to the big win by       Emmanuel Macron       in France\u2019s presidential elections last month, saying her government needed an \u201cequally strong mandate.\u201dInstead, Britain is now poised to enter Brexit talks on weaker political footing, while many of the U.K.\u2019s biggest EU partners will come from a position of strength.Polls say Mr. Macron is on course for a big win in this weekend\u2019s parliamentary elections. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is poised for victory in her country\u2019s elections set for this fall, and Dutch Prime Minister       Mark Rutte       is holding coalition talks after roundly defeating       Geert Wilders      \u2019 euroskeptic, anti-immigrant Party for Freedom in March\u2019s Dutch elections.\u201cTwo strong partners are confident, and will come faster and better to a conclusion that both sides can accept,\u201d EU Budget Commissioner       G\u00fcnther Oettinger       said Friday on German public radio. \u201cA weakened partner weakens the negotiations overall.\u201dOne uncertainty for the EU is whether the election result could soften Britain\u2019s Brexit stance, which Mrs. May laid out when she formally notified the EU of the U.K.\u2019s intention to leave.Mrs. May has set her sights on a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU but has said she would take Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market of goods and services and will exit the EU\u2019s customs union, which would free the U.K. to sign its own trade deals.Britain\u2019s main opposition parties, including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, are all urging a softer Brexit, with some opposition lawmakers seeking to keep Britain in the single market in exchange for keeping the U.K. open to EU workers.While EU rules are clear that talks could be extended if both sides agree, EU governments have reasons for keeping the clock ticking.European officials say that protracted talks will increase pressure on Britain to make concessions to secure a deal to ensure its economy doesn\u2019t drop off a post-Brexit cliff. That gives them leverage.Brussels also wants the U.K. out of the bloc before elections for a new European Parliament in May or June 2019.\u2014       Andrea Thomas       in Berlin and       William Horobin       in Paris contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com, Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 08:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-says-u-k-needs-a-government-before-brexit-talks-start-1496988793", "news_title": "EU Urges U.K. to Start Brexit Talks as Soon as Possible", "keywords": "brexit, theresa may, uk, uk election,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Stock investors reacted to the shock U.K. election result just as they did to the shock Brexit vote almost a year ago: by selling \u201cdomestic\u201d stocks\u2014local banks, property companies and retailers\u2014and buying London-listed international ones like             Royal Dutch Shell                   and             Unilever.But if history is any guide, this trade should be measured in weeks, not years.Over the past 10 years, the FTSE 100 has underperformed the FTSE 250 by 34 percentage points, despite       the pound       falling to $1.27 from $2 and a highly unusual period of falling real wages between 2009 and 2014.The mid-cap       FTSE 250       and large-cap       FTSE 100       indexes are often seen as proxies for domestic and international stocks, respectively. There are exceptions\u2014FTSE 100-listed Lloyds and RBS are clear plays on the local economy, while the U.K.\u2019s globally minded capital goods companies mainly sit in the FTSE 250\u2014but the indexes work as a rough guide.Weaker sterling inflates foreign earnings for the U.K.\u2019s multinationals relative to their sterling-denominated share prices. With a limited local market, Britain\u2019s biggest companies, such as             HSBC,Vodafone                   and             British American Tobacco,       make most of their profits abroad. After 2016\u2019s Brexit referendum, that, and a flight to safety lifted the FTSE 100 relative to the mid-cap index.But that effect lasted barely two weeks. The FTSE 250 has been recovering its losses, off and on, ever since. And over the long term, the FTSE 250 has consistently outperformed its large-cap peer. The exceptional periods of large-cap outperformance have mostly been in times of crisis: the banking collapse in 2008, the eurozone-debt worries of late 2011 and last year\u2019s political ructions.Renewed weakness in the pound has pushed up inflation, prompting another round of concerns about real wage growth, while boosting foreign earnings. But the lesson of history is that this doesn\u2019t guarantee better large-cap returns over the medium- or long-run.The outperformance of smaller stocks is a well-documented stock-market phenomenon.

But the voters didn\u2019t attach a message to the brick they chucked through the political window.The core result seems to be that Britain is evermore divided, making governing harder. With negotiations over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union just about to start, the country has no government and no mandate from voters for the difficult choices that have to be made. Investors can be forgiven for being confused too.Consider just three aspects of the results:\u2022The governing Conservatives gained about the same share of the national vote as in       Margaret Thatcher\u2019s       1983 landslide victory. Yet there is already talk within the party of how to replace Mrs. May, who is no Iron Lady.\u2022The opposition Labour Party gained about the same share of the vote as in       Tony Blair\u2019s       2001 (second) landslide victory. Yet Mr. Corbyn is detested by many of his own MPs, and has no prospect of becoming prime minister.\u2022The Liberal Democrats fought a campaign focused on having a second Brexit referendum, and gained seats\u2014but their share of the vote fell. Voters presented no mandate to reverse the Brexit decision.Investing is all about decision making under uncertainty, but the uncertainty runs much deeper than usual now. The discussion isn\u2019t about what Britain might wring out of its former EU partners at the negotiating table in Brussels, but what it will even ask for.If the Tories are to remain in power they will have to rely on Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party for votes, and they stood on a pledge to stay in the single market\u2014something Mrs. May ruled out.Traders responded by dumping the pound. Sterling hit a low of $1.264 on Friday morning, down 2.4% from where it was before the first exit poll. And there is no positive story about Britain coming from equities.The Brexit negotiations drown almost everything, and the medium-term outcome for sterling turns on a binary decision: will the U.K. accept EU immigration to secure single market access, or not? Such a move is anathema to many Tories, including Mrs. May, and seems highly unlikely.In the longer term an almost equally divided electorate combined with Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system means a weak government, and a weak government won\u2019t take hard decisions. Government spending won\u2019t be cut as much, difficult choices about retirement and health care will be put off again, and more inflation will have to be tolerated as a result.This isn\u2019t the 1970s though. London may have led the ABBA revival, but unlike the Seventies Britain has a competitive labor market and remains open to trade and investment. Inflation is rising and back above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target thanks to the plunge in the pound in the past year, but is still only 2.7%\u2014a far cry from the 20%-plus hit in the Seventies.Britain is down, and it is going to hurt.

The so-called hung parliament leaves the Conservatives seeking enough support from smaller parties to form a government.Here\u2019s what this means:A hung parliament occurs when no single party wins a majority of seats in the lower chamber, the 650-seat House of Commons.The incumbent government gets first crack at forming a new administration.It can try to put together a formal coalition or try to rule as a minority government by winning smaller parties\u2019 backing for individual pieces of its policy platform.If the ruling party can\u2019t form a workable administration, the second-largest party gets a shot.Yes, most recently in 2010. Then the Conservatives under former Prime Minister       David Cameron       emerged as the largest party but failed to win an outright majority. They eventually went into coalition with the Liberal Democrats, an administration that survived for five years. Labour Prime Minister       Gordon Brown       had tried and failed to persuade the Liberals to join him in government.In 1974, Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath called a snap election in the midst of industrial unrest and an energy crisis. He resigned after failing to form a coalition. The opposition Labour Party ruled as a minority government for only a few months before party leader Harold Wilson called another election, and managed to win a narrow majority.As the incumbent, Prime Minister       Theresa May       gets first shot at forming a working majority. Mrs. May has already reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with the Democratic Unionist Party, a small Northern Irish party whose 10 seats are enough to give Mrs. May and her Conservatives\u2014who won 318 seats with one district still to declare\u2014enough votes to govern.Should Mrs. May fail to form a government, Labour under       Jeremy Corbyn       may get a chance. Labour could potentially draw on a broader range of center-left parties for support, including the Scottish National Party, Liberal Democrats and the Greens. But these possible allies have sounded lukewarm on forming a formal coalition, which could leave Mr. Corbyn at the head of a much looser, \u201cprogressive alliance.\u201d Mr. Corbyn has already called on Mrs. May to resign and said he was ready to form a minority government.Minority governments tend to be less stable than formal coalitions, which have an agreed platform based on policies drawn from each participant. A minority government\u2019s policies could be subject to much more revision and amendment to win enough support to pass.That could have major consequences for the biggest task facing the next administration: Brexit. The U.K. formally notified the EU in late March about its intention to leave the bloc, triggering the two-year process to withdraw. European officials have already expressed concern about the impact of the election\u2019s shock result on Brexit negotiations and urged Britain to begin the talks as soon as possible. The two-year deadline can only be extended by EU governments\u2019 unanimous agreement.Northern Irish parties have been angling for special treatment for their region in the coming Brexit talks, as it is closely linked economically to Ireland to the south. Such could be the price of their support for a Conservative minority government. However, as a pro-U.K. party it will be suspicious of any solution that is seen to push toward a politically united Ireland.The much less likely prospect of Labour-led alliance would likely have an even greater impact, as parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party want the U.K. to stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and services\u2014a \u201csofter\u201d Brexit that the Conservatives in particular oppose.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'How Hung Parliament May Affect The U.K..'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 07:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-election-four-things-to-know-about-a-hung-parliament-1496969571", "news_title": "U.K. Election: Four Things to Know About a Hung Parliament", "keywords": "hung parliament,u.k. elections,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "In the U.K. election, no clear result looks a good result if it means a less harsh Brexit\u2014a big \u201cif.\u201dPrime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       tenuous grip on power following an embarrassing loss of seats in parliament severely dents her ability to lay down ultimatums in the Brexit talks. \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d Mrs. May has often said. She can no longer threaten to walk away when she has no certainty that parliament will back her up.No deal and a hard break with the EU would cost Britain trade in goods and services with its biggest partner. A weak U.K. government makes the talks a more complicated balancing act between domestic and European aims and probably means a less drastic break. That helps explain why the pound hasn\u2019t fallen further on the result and remains higher than it was before the election was called in April.To stay in power, the Conservatives will be relying heavily on the support of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which is pro-Brexit in character, but still wants free movement of people and goods with the Republic of Ireland (a full EU member), access to some EU funding and protection for its farmers. In other words, something not far from current arrangements.But even with the DUP\u2019s 10 members of parliament, Mrs. May will enjoy the slimmest of majorities, just three more than the halfway mark of 326 seats needed for a basic majority.That thin cushion leaves her vulnerable to sabotage from the rabidly anti-EU wing of her own party, so in practice support from Labour and other opposition parties will be required to ratify a Brexit deal.The worse alternative of course is that this chaotic and fluid domestic situation means Britain is unable to maintain a coherent negotiating position at all, which could lead to talks collapsing and the clock running down with no arrangement in place: the U.K. could get no deal without ever knowing what the bad deal might have been.Behind all this, the thing to watch closely is U.K. government bond yields. They are now a haven for domestic investors and yields dropped slightly Friday, but the worry is that political instability leads foreign investors, who own more than one-quarter of the market according to Nomura, to start drifting away.

But the sheer number of web users in Asia compared with the U.S. and Europe, combined with deeper knowledge of local markets, is creating a dynamic where user feedback\u2014more so than raw engineering power\u2014has become an important asset.\u201cAI is the new electricity,\u201d said       Andrew Ng,        a Stanford University professor and former top AI scientist at             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Baidu Inc.,       the Chinese internet giant. \u201cWhatever industry you work in, I think AI will likely transform it.\u201dMr. Ng\u2019s sentiments were echoed by other speakers at the WSJ\u2019s D.Live Asia event, where AI was a frequently discussed topic. But participants also discussed how doing business in China has changed, the cutthroat mobile-payment space and unparalleled mobile adoption in Southeast Asia\u2014one of the few places exhibiting growth in a fast-maturing tech world.Going forward, much of the focus will be on harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence. The U.S. had a clear advantage with the first wave of smartphone apps and software, but newer services like mobile payments, online shopping or messaging-service platforms appear to be evolving more quickly in Asia\u2014which as a region has a size advantage in web-connected users.Connie Chan,        a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm whose investments include Airbnb Inc. and             Facebook Inc.,       sees instances where China\u2019s internet titans such as             Tencent Holdings Ltd.       are influencing both major and startup U.S. firms, as well as replicated efforts. For instance, Ms. Chan said,             Apple Inc.       recently added payment services to its iMessage chat service, taking a page from Tencent\u2019s playbook.\u201cI love this reversal of what \u2018China copycat\u2019 can mean,\u201d Ms. Chan said. \u201cIt no longer just means a Chinese company copying the States, it can mean a U.S. company copying China.\u201dMicrosoft Corp.      , which has been in China for decades, is now working closer with Chinese firms and taking a different approach, said       Alain Crozier,        the company\u2019s chairman for Greater China. For instance, Mr. Crozier cited a customized version of Windows 10 made for the Chinese government that was completed through a joint venture with the state-owned CETC.\u201cYou have to change your business model,\u201d Mr. Crozier said. \u201cI share maybe more than I used to share.\u201dBut the time-tested lessons in China are contrasted with the lesser-tapped markets of Southeast Asia, which is undergoing explosive growth in mobile users.In Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth-largest country with a population of more than 250 million, Singapore\u2019s GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd. and Indonesia\u2019s Go-Jek are slugging it out across the region. Grab co-founder       Anthony Tan,        meanwhile, spoke of the company\u2019s fast growth since launching in 2012, now covering 55 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.But Go-Jek, the motorcycle-hailing startup, said it was defending its home territory successfully, beating both Grab and Uber Technologies Inc. \u201cIn terms of competition, we\u2019re clearly number one across verticals,\u201d said       Nadiem Makarim,        co-founder of Go-Jek.VIEW GraphicJD.com Inc.,       China\u2019s second-largest online retailer after             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , also has ambitious growth plans for the region. Other Chinese giants will help pave the way, said JD.com\u2019s Chief Executive       Richard Liu.\u201cI believe in the next 10 years, many Chinese brands will become global brands,\u201d said Mr. Liu, citing hardware firms Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. as examples. \u201cIt is then that Chinese e-commerce platforms can take these brands overseas and win consumers in Europe and the U.S.\u201dThe advantages of Chinese firms aren\u2019t based only on their sizable user bases. In China, emerging tech sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence are receiving government subsidies and other support as part of China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan, said       Jenny Lee,        managing partner of GGV Capital.This funding has drawn new startups into these sectors, she said. It is only in recent years that China has attained the technology levels needed to join the race in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, she said. \u201cTen years ago, there was no cloud infrastructure in China,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cToday the story is very different.\u201dSouth Koreans are so reliant on         Kakao Corp.\u2019s       messaging app that it has become dominant in other areas, like mobile payments and taxi hailing. Now, the South Korean firm is making a major play into voice-activated artificial intelligence, with a rollout of some features in the third quarter of this year, said Kakao Chief Executive Rim Ji-hoon. Sizable user bases are critical to these so-called deep-learning databases getting smarter.The Asian tech advantage is more clear-cut in other areas. China has already sped ahead in getting its consumers to do their shopping online, said       Yuri Milner,        founder of the prominent tech investment firm DST Global. But he expects the rest of the world to catch up. Only 6% of consumer spending world-wide takes place online, a figure he expects to rise to 15% by 2025, a number that \u201cis pretty close to the Chinese number today.\u201d\u2014Eva Dou, Liza Lin and Newley Purnell contributed to this article.Write to Timothy W.

What. A. Day. I think we can now safely say that the only thing you can be certain about in politics is that you can never be certain of anything. And \u201cuncertainty\u201d isn\u2019t a word anyone in the world of advertising wants to hear, as it usually means marketers are going to hold back on making big decisions and spending money.Former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s dramatic testimony Thursday was must-see TV: in the traditional sense, on internet livestreams and even in Russia, as the New York Post reports. Bars opened early and offices canceled their meetings as the U.S. stopped in its tracks to watch Mr. Comey accuse the Trump administration of lying and revealing he shared memos about his meetings with the president with a friend in order to leak the details to the press. TV ratings were likely to rocket (we don\u2019t have the data yet), but, bizarrely, TV media-owner stocks\u2014including shares of Fox, Comcast and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2014took a dive Thursday. Nevertheless, in 2017, political hearings like these are turning into mainstream TV events, and some marketers could start to consider them more like \u201ctentpoles\u201d in terms of their ad placements.Analysts at Nomura Instinet have voiced concerns about Snap\u2019s ability to attract new users, pointing to data from app research company SensorTower that shows downloads of the Snapchat app have dropped 22% in the past two months, Fortune reports. What\u2019s all the more worrying about that figure is that downloads of its more-established competitor, Instagram, have grown year over year. Nomura has slapped a \u201creduce\u201d rating on Snap\u2019s stock and lowered its estimates for the company\u2019s revenue and profit for 2017 and 2018. Snap\u2019s marketing to date has been sparse and subtle. If you\u2019re a Snapchat user, you\u2019ll know what that little ghost in your TSA tray at the airport is all about, but everyone else is probably clueless. It\u2019s time to drop the nonchalant act and switch to user-acquisition to explain why people should download Snapchat if they\u2019ve already got Instagram on their phonesChina\u2019s three biggest internet giants\u2014Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu\u2014are competing on a new battleground: to be the leaders in lifestyle. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the rivals are making frenzied investments to back lifestyle apps that do everything from hailing rides to booking vacations. Here\u2019s why: \u201cThe data those services yield gives the companies more power to target consumers with tailored advertising, helping them capture a larger slice of the online advertising pie.\u201d With 731 million internet users in China, user growth is peaking on their existing services across search, video, gaming, shopping and social media, so the trio must tap new revenue streams. Marketers should keep an eye on what is happening in China because internet giants in the West are likely to follow the trend, too.Facebook put out some stats detailing *shock* findings that people look at their phones during the commercial breaks on TV. In other news, I\u2019m just compiling the final data point on my ad-break-to-toilet-visit ratio report. In all seriousness, this blog post is another attempt by Facebook to encourage marketers to shift their TV dollars to its platform. \u201cBe careful of false equivalences,\u201d the blog reads, which, funnily enough, is exactly what TV companies say when digital platforms try to play up the size of their audiences. Here\u2019s something from the blog post everyone can agree on, though: \u201cMeasure results not seconds.\u201d Quite right. As luck would have it, another report dropped earlier this month, from Neustar Media (backed by Horizon Media and Turner, a TV company, so make of that what you will) that found that over a seven-year period, TV dominated all other media when it comes to return on advertising investment.Alexis Berger, the former senior vice president of sales at mobile ad tech company Kargo, has been awarded $40 million in a third-party arbitration. She claimed she was the victim of \u201cgender discrimination, retaliation, equal-pay violation, violation of wage law and breach of contract.\u201d Kargo disputes the allegations and plans to contest the decision.

Catalonia, on Spain\u2019s northeastern border with France, represents around one-fifth of the country\u2019s economic output and its capital, Barcelona, is the country\u2019s second-largest city after Madrid.Catalonia held a symbolic referendum in 2014. Those who went to the ballot box voted in favor of Catalonia\u2019s secession from Spain, but turnout was relatively low and the referendum was nonbinding.The vote in October, if it happens, would \u201cclosely resemble the \u2018symbolic\u2019 referendum held in 2014, but with some pretense of legality and run by Catalan authorities themselves rather than grass roots volunteers,\u201d       Federico Santi,        an analyst with Eurasia Group, a political-risk advisory firm, wrote in a recent research report.The separatists say Spain\u2019s central government drains the region of taxes without respecting its distinctive culture. Madrid, in turn, says Catalonia benefits from the union and has plenty of autonomy already.Madrid could intervene to prevent the referendum from taking place in October, but Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government would prefer instead to rely on Spanish courts \u201cto invalidate any pro-independence legislation and wait for the internal contradictions of the secessionist movement to eventually lead to its collapse and new regional elections,\u201d       Antonio Barroso,        an analyst with consulting firm Teneo Intelligence, said in a report.The road to independence for Catalonia is unlikely, most analysts say.\u201cThere is no scope for a binding independence referendum in the Spanish constitution, let alone a negotiated secession, and a very wide majority of parties in the national parliament has and will continue to oppose it,\u201d Mr. Santi wrote.Still, tensions will continue to simmer between Barcelona and Madrid as Catalonia\u2019s secession remains a key political issue on Spain\u2019s political agenda.Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 06:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/catalonia-leaders-defy-madrid-and-call-fresh-vote-for-independence-1497003750", "news_title": "Catalonia Leaders Defy Madrid and Call Fresh Vote for Independence", "keywords": "Mariano Rajoy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014A top South Korean national-security official sought to tamp down concerns about the government\u2019s commitment to a controversial U.S. missile-defense system, days after Seoul raised alarms about whether it would proceed with the deployment.Chung Eui-yong, the head of South Korea\u2019s presidential National Security Office, said the new left-leaning government under President Moon Jae-in had \u201cno intention of fundamentally changing what it has promised under the South Korea-U.S. alliance.\u201dMr. Moon wouldn\u2019t make any decisions on Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense lightly and would continue to work closely with the U.S., Mr. Chung told reporters.Mr. Chung\u2019s remarks appeared aimed at offering some reassurances after the presidential Blue House said on Wednesday that it would suspend deployment of Thaad until an environmental review of the deployment site in southern South Korea was completed.Mr. Chung\u2019s remarks also come ahead of a planned summit meeting in Washington later this month between Mr. Moon and U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who riled up public sentiment in South Korea earlier this year when he suggested that Seoul should pay for the $1 billion system.During the presidential election in the spring, Mr. Moon criticized his predecessor\u2019s decision to approve the deployment of Thaad as opaque, and vowed to review the process. At times, he appeared to take a softer line on Thaad, saying that he recognized the need for the missile-defense system as North Korea ramps up its nuclear and missile development.But Mr. Moon last month also excoriated his defense ministry for intentionally covering up the arrival of more Thaad components into South Korea in a report to the president.\u201cWe must move forward in a transparent manner according to procedure,\u201d Mr. Chung said on Friday, adding that a legally-mandated environmental review had to be conducted in a reasonable, legal and transparent fashion.During a meeting last week with Sen.

Still, the Conservative\u2019s failure to win a clear majority strengthens the bargaining position of the EU in any Brexit negotiations.\u201cThe outcome of Brexit is likely to be more unfavorable and as a result anyone that is looking to invest in the U.K.\u00a0is going to be more circumspect to see how things play out,\u201d       Mr. Bishop       said.Others are more optimistic despite the added uncertainty over Britain\u2019s planned split from the EU.\u201cThe Brexit elephant in the room still encourages sellers to sell now and there are more than enough buyers willing to discount this as a bit of local political difficulty,\u201d said       Phil Sanderson,        a lawyer specializing in private equity at Ropes & Gray.The Labour Party trailed the Conservatives, winning more than 260 seats. But bankers and lawyers caution a coalition government led by the left-leaning party wouldn\u2019t offer any more certainty. For one, U.K. Inc. could face higher taxes,\u00a0undermining the ability of British companies to fund deals and making the country less attractive for foreign investment.That said, the deal-making environment still benefits from strong equity markets and the availability of cheap debt to finance M&A. The sell-off in the British pound\u00a0Friday\u00a0following the election result also offers silver lining for cross-border M&A.\u00a0 U.K.-based conglomerates that generate the majority of their revenue in U.S. dollars but report earnings in sterling stand to benefit from higher profits because of the currency boost. That will drive their stock prices higher, making it less expensive for the companies to fund deals using their shares.A sell-off in the British pound following Brexit proved to be a key factor behind             British American Tobacco\u2019s       $49 billion deal to acquire             Reynolds American Inc.       to create the world\u2019s largest listed tobacco company.The weaker pound can also make U.K. companies cheaper to acquire for foreign buyers.\u00a0            21st\u00a0Century Fox Inc.       took advantage of the weaker pound to lower its funding costs to bid for             Sky                   PLC in December. Fox and             News Corp,       which owns The Wall Street Journal, are largely controlled by       Rupert Murdoch       and his family.That said, in London trading\u00a0Friday\u00a0Sky was down 2.3% amid investor concerns that\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0election result could delay approval of the deal by the U.K.\u2019s\u00a0 media watchdog and its competition authority.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 06:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-voters-turn-out-to-be-no-friend-of-dealmakers-1497002617", "news_title": "U.K. Voters Turn Out to Be No Friend of Dealmakers ", "keywords": " conservative pary, hung parlianment, labour party,pe industry news,pound,uk election, uk markets,European Union,Theresa May,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "JD.com Inc.

That\u2019s because the $1 trillion plan would largely depend on funding from private investors who typically favor projects that throw off steady streams of revenue and tend to be near big population centers, the WSJ\u2019s Ted Mann writes. Highways in lightly populated states, for example, may lack the traffic to raise funds for investors through tolls and user fees, while some groups fear privatizing the air-traffic control system could isolate smaller communities. Many Democrats have said they oppose efforts to rely on tolls to pay for building projects, concerns echoed by some rural Republicans like Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, who said the package shouldn\u2019t require tolls on roads in his state, the least populous in the country. Freight companies have rallied around the promised infrastructure overhaul, though analysts say whether such public-private partnerships provide a boost to the transportation industry will depend in large part on whether significant funding is funneled into highways repairs.To rally support, the White House says the president\u2019s program will include federal grants for bridges, roads and waterways in rural areas, though details remain scarce.Fallout from the diplomatic rift between Qatar and its neighbors is  roiling the shipping world. Many container liners are steering clear of Qatar after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and commercial ties, the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris and Nikhil Lohade write. That\u2019s devastating for a country that imports 80% of its food. The effect on carriers is more muted, as Maersk Line and others stop in Dubai\u2019s Jebel Ali hub before dispatching smaller vessels to Doha. Qatar is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, but those tankers haven\u2019t been affected by the dispute, brokers say, and Egypt hasn\u2019t restricted access to the Suez Canal. Airfreight is a different story, as Doha\u2019s airport is an important waypoint for long-haul cargo flights. Now, planes departing from Qatar will need to burn more fuel to stay clear of restricted U.A.E. airspace on their way to India and other Asian destinations. The biggest toll may be uncertainty, with shippers, brokers and carriers evaluating future routes through Qatar\u2019s air and seaports that could be put at risk should the situation worsen.As electric vehicles get more affordable, the price of a key component is skyrocketing. Cobalt prices are up 70% this year, largely on soaring demand from battery manufacturers, who need the hard, silvery metal to produce the lithium ion-batteries that power electric vehicles, the WSJ\u2019s Stephanie Yang writes. Rechargeable batteries sucked up over half of all cobalt bought or sold last year, up from 20% in 2006. Demand is only expected to grow as auto makers roll out cheaper electric cars, including Tesla, which wants to produce 500,000 vehicles next year, compared with 84,000 in 2016. The supply of cobalt is controlled by trading houses, producers and consumers, who set prices in the opaque physical market. That makes gauging future prices tricky, with contracts in the small cobalt futures market prone to big swings that can be traced to a single buyer or seller. Investors sometimes load up on physical cobalt, or buy stakes in cobalt miners, to gain exposure. Battery makers are also stocking up on the metal in case prices rise.Boeing Co.       is moving some parts of its supply chain abroad in a bid to expand its business in China and other markets. The shift, which the aerospace company says won\u2019t affect its domestic workforce, comes as U.S. manufacturers are under pressure to help deliver on President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to bring such jobs back stateside. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of taking large operations in the U.S. and moving them overseas,\u201d Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told WSJ\u2019s Doug Cameron. Instead, workers at a new plant being built near Shanghai will paint and fit-out jetliners destined for the Chinese market, which is expected to generate sales of 6,800 jets over the next two decades. The company\u2019s Chinese partner on the plant could ultimately become a competitor to Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter by dollar value. State-owned Comac supplies Boeing with parts for its jets, but the company is also leading China\u2019s efforts to expand its aerospace sector, and has ambitions to produce a range of its own. Meanwhile, Boeing has been trimming its U.S. workforce with the aim of retooling its factories to lower the cost of production through increased automation and other new technologies.\u2018[Cobalt] has been a rather boring, tedious market.

Previously, such professionals were held to a suitability standard that allowed them to pitch the products that paid them the best commissions so long as they were suitable for a client\u2019s risk profile.Investors can expect changes to how their money is handled, the investment options they have and how they pay for advice. The degree of change will vary by firm and by account, and much will depend on how the Labor Department\u2019s review plays out. Here are some things to watch:As of Friday, brokers and insurance agents must adhere to the best-interest standard, or the spirit of the fiduciary rule. That means advice must be based on clients\u2019 interests, rather that than the financial interest of the adviser or firm. It also means brokers can charge no more than \u201creasonable compensation\u201d and have to offer up more transparency around the compensation they earn, the transactions they make and potential conflicts of interest.While wealth managers and insurance sellers are on the hook to act as fiduciaries starting June 9, it\u2019s essentially on the honor system until Jan. 1.The Labor Department pushed out the compliance deadline for certain parts of the regulation, including its enforcement, giving the industry more time to adjust and potentially preventing compliance with elements that could be revised after the review. For example, advisers don\u2019t have to provide clients with a best-interest contract until January, and some client disclosures about compensation and conflicts aren\u2019t yet required.The Labor Department crafted the fiduciary rule in a way that allows flexibility in how firms adopt the best-interest standard. This means changes retirement savers experience will depend on where they have their money and how much they have invested.Customers of Merrill Lynch with commission-based accounts, for example, were last year given a choice to make if they want to remain with the firm: either move to Merrill Edge, where they can self-direct their investments, or the firm\u2019s new robo service; or pay a fee and stay with their broker.At             Wells Fargo                   & Co., meanwhile, customers can remain in commission-based IRAs, though with a slimmer menu of investment options. Brokers there will be required to document and prove they are giving best-interest advice to retirement savers, said Heather Hunt-Ruddy, head of client experience and growth at Wells Fargo Advisors.\u201cJune 9 has this sort of Y2K panic sort of thing,\u201d said Ms. Hunt-Ruddy, referring to the anxiety around how computer systems would interpret the year 2000. \u201cThe whole world isn\u2019t going to end, but what will change is the responsibility to retirement accounts.\u201dClients of Wells Fargo won\u2019t receive notifications of changes until September, Ms. Hunt-Ruddy said.Many firms are waiting for more clarity about how the fiduciary rule might change before finalizing some decisions and alerting clients to them. (Here is a partial list of how some of the biggest brokerages are handling the implementation.)Some clients may receive email or paper communications from their broker that nothing is changing, at least for now.Corrie Scoby, a Memphis, Tenn.-based compliance officer at Arete Capital, said her firm\u2019s advisers were told to tell clients by June 8 that the fiduciary rule was kicking in and to direct clients to the firm\u2019s regulatory filing that discloses potential conflicts of of interest. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an email prepared that explains this is no real change,\u201d Ms. Scoby said, though she added that some changes, such as providing a contract and more disclosures, might be in store after the Labor Department finishes its review.The fiduciary rule includes a grandfathering provision that allows for certain commission-generating accounts to remain as-is after June 9. But investors must generally forgo new investment advice and aren\u2019t able to make significant changes to the account if the manager of it is to stay compliant with the regulation.Rather than have their commission accounts grandfathered, some clients may find themselves dropped. That won\u2019t necessarily happen immediately and such accounts may simply be frozen in the meantime.Joseph Romano, president of Evanston, Ill.,-based wealth-management firm Romano Brothers & Co., said compliance costs and legal risks associated with the rule make it less lucrative to service relatively small accounts. As such, he said he has identified some smaller client accounts that he will shed if the Labor Department doesn\u2019t make substantial changes to the rule.Those clients won\u2019t receive any notification yet, he said, but between June 9 and Jan. 1, \u201cit\u2019s pretty much hands off\u201d and his firm won\u2019t initiate trade on those clients\u2019 behalf.Most likely. Products that generate more than \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d such as high-fee mutual funds, are likely to be eliminated from retirement account menus. And new products that generate fees are likely to emerge as demand grows for fee-generating choices versus those that pay commissions.Christine Gill, head of investor solutions at             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.      , said distributors like broker-dealers and retirement-plan platforms have been reducing the number of products they\u2019re offering in order to mitigate conflicts of interest. For example, she said, the lineup of mutual funds on offer at some firms has been shrinking so that firms can do the due diligence necessary for compliance with the higher standard of care.At the same time, new products are being created as more advisers seek investment options that make complying with the fiduciary rule easier. For example, Lincoln Financial Group, which sells insurance products, earlier this year launched a line of fee-based variable and fixed-income annuities. The launch was in part tied to the fiduciary rule as annuities have typically generated commissions.A new type of mutual-fund share has also been designed ahead of the fiduciary rule\u2019s deadline, though its adoption hasn\u2019t fully caught on amid the uncertainty. \u201cClean shares\u201d charge only the fee to manage and operate a mutual fund, and don\u2019t include payments to distributors that could violate the rule.\u2014-- Michael Wursthorn contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-09 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-fiduciary-rule-phases-in-now-what-1497000605", "news_title": "As Fiduciary Rule Phases In, Now What?", "keywords": "Lincoln Financial Group,Bank of New York Mellon,BK,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "When       Jerome Schlichter       started filing 401(k)-fee lawsuits against big companies a decade ago, the personal-injury lawyer from St. Louis wasn\u2019t taken seriously.\u201cWe had heard that a lawyer who did railroad-injury cases was advertising for participants to sign up for litigation,\u201d said James Fleckner, an attorney who defends companies in Boston. \u201cWe were unsure what to make of it.\u201dCompanies now are so worried about suits alleging mismanagement of these retirement plans that 401(k) industry consultants have coined a term for the threat: \u201cgetting Schlichterized.\u201dMr. Schlichter\u2019s firm, Schlichter Bogard & Denton LLP, has secured $334 million in settlements for clients since 2010. Two years ago, it won a case before the Supreme Court, which ruled that employers with 401(k) plans have an ongoing duty to monitor the investments they choose.Mr. Schlichter, 68 years old, said retirement plans previously didn\u2019t receive watchdog treatment from regulators or anyone else. \u201cNobody\u2019s bonus depended on how the 401(k) plan was managed,\u201d he said.Last year, law firms filed more than 25 fee cases against 401(k)-type plans, according to Groom Law Group in Washington. That includes 14 from Mr. Schlichter\u2019s firm against employers including elite universities. The complaints allege, in part, that the plans failed to bargain for lower fees.Consumer advocates say the litigation has saved 401(k) participants nationwide billions of dollars by helping to push down 401(k) fees, which declined 17% from 2009 to 2014, according to financial-information provider BrightScope Inc.Critics contend that the fear of litigation is encouraging employers to focus on fees at the expense of service and innovation. They say the settlements have significantly benefited Mr. Schlichter, whose firm received about $90 million since 2010 while the more than one million 401(k) participants covered by the settlements have received an average of $283 each, according to Mr. Schlichter.Mr. Schlichter counters that his fees cover more than 10 years of work related to the cases and that his clients stand to gain much more in the long run, thanks to the resulting changes.The son of an airplane mechanic, Mr. Schlichter, who goes by Jerry, focused on 401(k) plans after a 2005 meeting with a union official at a unit of             Boeing Co.       in St. Louis.The workers were worried about their retirements, Mr. Schlichter said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand how the 401(k) plan worked,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided to take a deep dive\u2014not just into Boeing\u2019s plan but into the whole 401(k) industry.\u201dAt the time, the firm had no expertise in the federal law that governed 401(k) plans. It hired four lawyers who spent 18 months reading plan disclosures and seeking information from experts.Mr. Schlichter found a study from the Labor Department, which regulates the plans, that he said pointed out jumbo plans can get fees for one-quarter the cost of retail mutual funds.\u201cWe saw billion-dollar-plus plans paying retail fees that an investor\u201d with a $500 account had to pay, he said.In 2006, the firm filed a dozen lawsuits against the 401(k) plans of companies including             Lockheed Martin Corp.       and Boeing. The companies, which declined to comment, didn\u2019t admit to wrongdoing.Because his firm is paid only when it wins or settles cases, it could take years\u2014if ever\u2014to see a payoff. To pay attorneys\u2019 salaries and experts\u2019 fees in the early years, the firm used its profits and a line of credit. In 2006, Mr. Schlichter mortgaged his family\u2019s four-bedroom home in St. Louis for millions of dollars. \u201cWe made a \u2018bet the firm\u2019 decision,\u201d he said.The second of five children raised in Mascoutah, Ill., Mr. Schlichter was the first in his family to attend college, graduating from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1969 after three years. Rather than accept a scholarship to the law school there, he borrowed to pay out-of-state tuition at University of California, Los Angeles.\u201cMy dad\u2014a thrifty, hardworking person\u2014could not comprehend what I was even talking about,\u201d Mr. Schlichter said. \u201cHe was appalled that I would even dream of turning down a scholarship.\u201d His father was also worried that he would become a hippie, Mr. Schlichter added.In law school, Mr. Schlichter juggled law review with jobs as a legal researcher and janitor. He got involved in the civil-rights, labor and antiwar movements and said he spent a day in jail after being arrested while picketing with striking Teamsters.Mr. Schlichter said he was drawn to the idea of representing the underdog while working one summer for an East St. Louis, Ill., firm that defended seven university students involved in a demonstration that resulted in damage to a U.S. Army building. Mr. Schlichter says the firm\u2019s contingency-fee work appealed to him because it allowed him to \u201crepresent the little person\u201d who couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer.\u201cI began to see how I could make a living and also live my values,\u201d he said.After graduating, Mr. Schlichter returned to that firm, specializing in employment-discrimination and railroad-injury cases.

Spending on magazine ads fell 8% over the same period to $2.6 billion, Zenith says.While many industries began moving their ad dollars to digital media years ago, fashion magazines suffered less from the trend due to their symbiotic relationships with the brands they cover. Magazines provide wall-to-wall coverage of fashion shows and other promotional events important to brands, which have long responded by buying reams of advertising pages that underpinned the glossies\u2019 business model. Meanwhile, magazine editors historically have worked hand-in-glove with brands, designers and retailers, developing new looks and occasionally calling the shots on what appears on the runways.Now, the industry is realizing the benefit of reaching out to its affluent customers on the internet versus print. Luxury executives say that digital campaigns are highly effective, can reach people at relatively low cost and give advertisers loads of data to track how their spending translates into higher sales.Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault\u2014the French billionaire and chief executive of luxury conglomerate Kering Co., whose brands include Gucci and Saint Laurent\u2014described \u201ca real reallocation from what we spent on print to the internet.\u201d Mr. Pinault estimates that Kering spends 35% to 40% of its communication budget on digital, compared with 15% to 20% some 18 months ago.\u201cIf we were to launch a brand today, all the communication to start would be online,\u201d he says.The industry has a welter of options other than Vogue, Marie Claire and Glamour to communicate with the public. Instead, brands can connect with clientele over Instagram,             Facebook,Twitter                   and Snapchat, along with a host of new internet fashion websites.\u201cWe do have our own audience,\u201d says       Ian Rogers,        chief digital officer at             LVMH                   Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the world\u2019s biggest luxury company, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Christian Dior.LVMH has hired San Francisco-based Tribe Dynamics to identify and interact with \u201cinfluencers\u201d\u2014those who talk about LVMH\u2019s brands on social networks, ranging from celebrities to people with just a few hundred followers on Instagram.Tribe calculates a metric it calls \u201cearned media value\u201d\u2014the amount of money a company saves on advertising because influencers are talking about its brands online.\u201cThese influencers are themselves brands and micro-publishers, \u2018earned media\u2019 the same as Vogue,\u201d says Mr. Rogers.Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue, Glamour and other titles, has been capturing the fashion industry\u2019s digital communications spending to help offset the drop in print advertising, says Pamela Drucker Mann, the group\u2019s chief marketing officer. Its magazines are also boosting revenue and retaining their influence by tweaking their business models: Some titles are joining with fashion brands to create digital movies and other content.\u201cThey\u2019re coming to Vogue to help them create their advertising campaigns and their custom content,\u201d Ms. Drucker Mann says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to become a creative agency.\u201dMs. Drucker Mann adds that Ms. Wintour is more influential than ever, with the new audience that Vogue and other Cond\u00e9 Nast websites have found online. Cond\u00e9 Nast titles have 100 million online readers each month and 174 million social-media followers.\u201cShe went from being this fashion icon, to a household name,\u201d Ms. Drucker Mann says. Ms. Wintour declined to comment for this article.Mr. Pinault credits deft digital communication over social media for much of the runaway success of Gucci over the past two years. Sales in the first quarter surged 50%, beating expectations of even the most optimistic analysts.Gucci and its creative director,       Alessandro Michele,        have been among the most aggressive in the industry in engaging customers on social networks. Gucci recently asked social-media artists to write \u201cmemes\u201d\u2014witty messages paired with an image\u2014that would help launch the brand\u2019s new line of watches last quarter.One meme selected by Gucci shows a 16th-century painting of a Spanish noblewoman staring glumly ahead, emblazoned with the phrase: \u201cWhen he buys you flowers instead of a Gucci watch.\u201d The image was liked 91,000 times on Gucci\u2019s Instagram account.Mr. Pinault calls the campaign \u201can incredible success.\u201d\u201cDigital communication allows us to have a much deeper understanding that we couldn\u2019t have before about the effectiveness of our campaigns,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in the process of measuring more and more, almost in real time, the impact in which social network at what time and what type of image.\u201dPrada is also shifting its communication to digital, says       Stefano Cantino,        the Italian fashion house\u2019s chief marketing officer. He estimates that 25% of Prada\u2019s communications budget goes to online campaigns, a significant increase over recent years.But Prada remains cautious about using influencers to market itself, fearing that aligning the brand with the wrong person on social media could tarnish its image.\u201cIt\u2019s really key to keep the DNA of the brand,\u201d Mr. Cantino says.Write to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fashion-ads-a-last-bastion-of-print-are-going-digital-1497000602", "news_title": "Fashion Ads, a Last Bastion of Print, Are Going Digital", "keywords": "fashion,fashion advertising,fashion marketing,gucci,Zenith Media,Kering,marketing,markets,advertising,branding,corporate,industrial news,social media marketing,political,general news,living,lifestyle,media buying,public relations,business,consumer services,consumer goods,internet,online,luxury goods,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "One month after a power outage snarled the morning commute for hundreds of thousands of subway riders, its cause is still disputed.New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, blamed the May 9 outage\u2014as well as a similar power loss two days earlier\u2014on utility             Consolidated Edison Inc.At the time, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo demanded that the company \u201cidentify the cause and propose a real and improved response plan for the future.\u201dConsolidated Edison, however, has found no evidence that it could have caused the May 9 outage, said       Robert Schimmenti,        senior vice president of electric operations at the utility.He added that a transformer failure at a substation on\u00a0May 7\u00a0shouldn\u2019t have been sufficient to cause subway disruption on that day either.Mr. Schimmenti explained that the subway is powered by multiple transformers, and when one transformer fails it causes a power disturbance lasting less than a second, the kind of fluctuation that might cause a lightbulb to flicker. The MTA\u2019s equipment \u201cshould be designed to handle a disturbance,\u201d he said.Consolidated Edison previously accepted responsibility for a power outage on\u00a0April 21\u00a0at the 7th Avenue and 53rd Street subway station in Manhattan.MTA spokesman       Stephen Morello       said that the transit agency continues to \u201cbelieve that the May 7 and 9 failures were the responsibility of ConEd.\u201dMr. Cuomo has directed the state\u2019s Department of Public Service and the MTA to investigate the April and May outages.James Allen,        a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said: \u201cThe investigation is ongoing and a full report is expected to be completed early this summer.\u201dThe transformer failure on\u00a0May 7 knocked out signal equipment at DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn, causing delays for several hours.The signal system went down again two days later at about\u00a07:30 a.m., affecting the B, D, N, Q and R trains and sending disruption cascading through the system through the rush hour.The subway\u2019s antiquated signal system is a prime cause of delays. Upgrading to a more efficient system will cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete.In the wake of the disruptions, Brooklyn Borough President       Eric Adams       asked the city\u2019s independent budget office to study the economic cost of the outages to workers, businesses and in the form of lost tax revenue.A spokesman for the budget office said that study is under way.Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/andrew-cuomo-consolidated-edison-dispute-cause-of-subway-outages-1497000606", "news_title": "Andrew Cuomo, Consolidated Edison Dispute Cause of Subway Outages   ", "keywords": "andrew cuomo,commuting,mass transit,metropolitan transit authority,new york subway,new york subway outages,new york transit,subway outages,transit,Consolidated Edison,ED,Metropolitan Transportation Authority,Andrew Cuomo,blackouts,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,energy,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,multiutilities,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics,utilities"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014When President Donald Trump took office, many in the financial industry were confident that a looming retirement-savings rule they had opposed for years would soon be dead. To their dismay, the core principle of the rule was implemented Friday.The resilience of the so-called fiduciary rule is partly attributable to delays in appointing senior officials at the Labor Department, the rule\u2019s creator, who would be capable of unwinding a major regulation so close to its implementation, according to industry representatives and consumer advocates involved in the process.Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       didn\u2019t take up his post until late April, after Mr. Trump\u2019s first pick for the role withdrew from consideration. Other top positions at the Labor Department remain vacant, leaving career officials\u2014who had helped to write the original rule\u2014to shepherd a review of the rule that the president requested in February.Aversion toward the risk of litigation from consumer groups has also made the administration reluctant to delay the rule long enough to allow for an overhaul or kill it altogether, industry representatives and consumer advocates say.White House representatives did not provide comment.Mr. Acosta, a former law-school dean, followed the required rule-making procedures strictly, rather than taking a risk in delaying the rule.The Labor Department is implementing the regulation in two stages. The core principle that went into effect Friday\u2014two months after the original date set by the       Obama       administration\u2014requires brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to be \u201cfiduciaries\u201d who act in the best interest of their clients. Previously, they were required to offer guidance that was \u201csuitable,\u201d a looser standard.The rule\u2019s operational requirements, such as disclosure of conflicts of interest to investors, will become applicable in January. The regulation is aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest, which can come about with commission-based compensation.The rule\u2019s critics say it would punish smaller savers in the form or reduced access to financial advice and higher costs.The Labor Department continues to re-evaluate the rule per Mr. Trump\u2019s February order. Meanwhile, Mr. Acosta said this week the administration had taken its \u201cfirst step\u201d to decide the rule\u2019s fate, with the Office of Management and Budget requesting information on the rule. The OMB is the gatekeeper in the rule-making\u2014and rule-changing\u2014process.But some in the industry say it is too late.\u201cWe have growing concerns about the ability to fix or significantly alter the fiduciary rule now that it is set to begin on Friday,\u201d said       Edward Mills,        an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co.The rule\u2019s survival shows the Trump administration\u2019s difficulties in meeting its pledge to roll back regulations because it doesn\u2019t have people in place to carry out the job. Hundreds of top government positions remain unfilled. At the Labor Department, nominations haven\u2019t been made for the dozen or so positions that require Senate confirmation, including assistant secretary for employee benefits security, the overseer of the fiduciary rule.\u201cMany of the pieces were still missing at the DOL,\u201d said       Fred Reish,        a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP who specializes in fiduciary issues. \u201dIf Trump wants to implement his agenda through abolishing regulations, he\u2019s going to have to fill a lot of positions.\u201dUnwinding the fiduciary rule was tough to begin with. Unlike some of the recent Obama-era rules that the Republican-controlled Congress has successfully overturned, it was already effective when Mr. Trump took office, just waiting to become applicable. That meant changing or delaying the rule required the department to go through a lengthy rule-making process again under the Administrative Procedure Act and prove that revising it would bring clear net economic benefit.Even with the clock ticking, the action was slow to come. Mr. Trump\u2019s memo asking for a re-evaluation of the rule was issued Feb. 3. Time was wasted over his first pick for labor secretary, fast-food executive Andy Puzder, who was opposed by labor unions and eventually withdrew in February amid allegations of domestic abuse. In early April, the department announced the main part of the fiduciary rule would become applicable in June. Meanwhile, consumer groups supporting the rule stressed that delaying it would be \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d and open the department to legal challenges.By the time Mr. Acosta, a safe pick with known Democratic support, was confirmed on April 27, he had little time left. He declined all requests for meetings from industry executives who wanted him to put the rule on hold. On May 22, he said the rule would go live on June 9, writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion column that \u201cRespect for the rule of law leads us to the conclusion that this date cannot be postponed.\u201d\u201cAcosta is a smart lawyer. He is not an ideologue,\u201d said       Mercer Bullard,        a law professor at the University of Mississippi who supports the rule. \u201cIf Puzder had been appointed, that rule probably wouldn\u2019t have been implemented,\u201d he said, adding that would have led to a lawsuit by the rule\u2019s proponents, which the department would have lost.Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-is-now-partially-in-effect-1497000602", "news_title": "Fiduciary Rule Is Now (Partially) in Effect", "keywords": " alexander acosta,andy puzder, brokers, commission-based advisers,department of labor,fidicuiary rule takes effect june 9, fiduciaries,fiduciary rule, financial advisers,financial regulations, labor department, labor secretary alexander acosta, wealth management,DOL,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,financial advisors,personal finance,personal investments,politics,international relations,domestic politics,retirement planning,government bodies,executive branch,labor department,banking,financial investments,investment advice,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014            Microsoft Corp.

GOOGL 0.59%       units building robots that can perform feats such as pirouetting and climbing stairs, highlighting the Japanese company\u2019s long-term investment horizon.Price and other terms weren\u2019t disclosed.The deal comes more than a year after the Google parent dissolved its robotics group and started seeking buyers for Boston Dynamics, the unit at the centerpiece of the program. People close to Alphabet have said the company decided to sell Boston Dynamics when it resisted developing a commercial product within the next several years.The deal also includes Schaft, a Japanese robotics maker that achieved fame by winning a challenge held by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2013 for robots to perform rescue tasks.One person familiar with SoftBank\u2019s thinking said time to commercialization is less important for the Japanese company, whose chief, Masayoshi Son, often talks about what he sees ahead for the next 300 years.\u201cOwning the technology is what\u2019s important at this stage,\u201d this person said of the robotics revolution. \u201cThe research, by itself, opens up new possibilities.\u201dBoston Dynamics develops robots that can open doors, pick up objects, and walk and run on two legs. Videos of its robots have attracted more than 150 million views on YouTube. It was once partly funded by the U.S. military, but Alphabet cut those ties after buying it in 2013.Boston Dynamics recently released a video of a 6\u00bd-foot-tall wheeled robot called Handle that can pirouette and descend stairs and has a 4-feet vertical leap.Boston Dynamics and Schaft have focused on increasing robot intelligence, dexterity and staying power on a single charge, aiming to enable humanoid robots to perform industrial and service tasks.SoftBank already makes Pepper, a service robot with an engaging smile but less-spectacular abilities.The Japanese company, whose empire includes a Japanese telecom arm, U.S. mobile carrier             Sprint Corp.       and U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings Inc., last month started the $93 billion Vision Fund with investors including Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund.SoftBank said the buyer of the robotics businesses will be one of its subsidiaries, not the Vision Fund. It declined to say whether the fund might take a stake later. People familiar with the fund said it has right of first refusal on all SoftBank deals exceeding $100 million, except for investments in ride-hailing companies.Mr. Son, the SoftBank chief, has said he envisions SoftBank having to transform itself into a telepathy company, facilitating communication between chips embedded in people\u2019s brains. He has described a world where robots have emotional intelligence and humans try to find happiness and meaning in lifespans stretching to 200 years.After acquiring ARM last September, Mr. Son told managers at the chip company not to worry about sales, but to invest more on research to speed up development, officials at both companies have said.\u201cOne of the chips in our shoes in the next 30 years will be smarter than our brain,\u201d Mr. Son said during a keynote speech at the Mobile World Congress in February.SoftBank shares ended Friday up 7.4% at a 17-year high, driven not by the robotics deal but by an overnight surge in the share price of Alibaba Group Holding, which is about one-quarter owned by SoftBank.Write to Mayumi Negishi at mayumi.negishi@wsj.com and Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 05:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-buy-two-pioneers-in-advanced-robots-1496972870", "news_title": "SoftBank to Buy Two Pioneers in Advanced Robots From Google Parent ", "keywords": "alphabet,darpa,google,handle,humanoid robots,pepper,robotics,robots,schaft,softbank,vc ma,vision fund,Boston Dynamics,U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,Alphabet Inc.

His older son, 57-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito, will likely take over the throne at the end of next year, according to local reports.Only males can become emperor, according to Japanese law, and women lose their status as imperial family members when they get married. Debate over changing those restrictions has ebbed and flowed in recent years, largely driven by a chronic shortage of male heirs.The issue gained traction again recently when Prince Naruhito\u2019s eldest niece said she planned to marry a nonroyal, a move that will result in the imperial family having only 18 members, of whom 13 are women.In recognition of the succession problem, Parliament on Friday also approved a resolution calling for the issue of women in the imperial family to be studied.Hidetsugu Yagi, an imperial family expert at Reitaku University near Tokyo, said it was unlikely that any changes to the law would be made under the conservative government of Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe.Mr. Abe\u2019s top aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said this week that the government wanted to continue male-only succession but added that it was open to the idea of women keeping their royal status after marriage.Mr. Abe\u2019s economic policies include trying to increase the percentage of women in the workforce, in a country where many women still quit their jobs after marriage or childbirth.Few of those who do pursue long-term career growth rise to top-level positions in the public or private sectors.Japan ranks 163rd globally for female representation in parliament, according to United Nations data, and has never had a female prime minister. Less than 5% of board members at companies in Japan are women, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The abdication law won overwhelming support from both houses of parliament, and opinion polls showed the public supported allowing the popular emperor, who put war remembrance at the center of his reign, to ease into retirement.While Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, have no formal political role, they have traveled frequently to countries involved in World War II to express condolences and bolster diplomatic relations.Mr. Yagi said Prince Naruhito, who often performs official duties alone due to his wife\u2019s ill health, may struggle initially to build similar public support.\u201cI think it is a reality that the role of the imperial family as a whole will diminish,\u201d he said.The upper house\u2019s vote on Friday, the final hurdle, was unanimous with a handful of abstentions.\u201cEnsuring the stability of imperial succession is a very important issue,\u201d Mr. Abe said after the vote. The law only allows the current emperor, who has had heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer, to retire.A few conservatives expressed concern about the abdication law, saying Emperor Akihito should have handed his duties to a regent while keeping his title.\u201cThe emperor\u2019s status is not something that should be affected by either his own will or by the state,\u201d said lawmaker Shizuka Kamei. \u201cIf we proceed down this aberrant path, it may inadvertently lead to the end of the emperor system.\u201dEmperor Akihito in his address last August suggested that naming a regent in this case wouldn\u2019t work well because he said \u201cit does not change the fact that the emperor continues to be emperor till the end of his life.\u201d He said \u201csociety comes to a standstill\u201d when an emperor is seriously ill and it was best to avoid that situation if possible.\u2014Koji Everard contributed to this article.Write to Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com and Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 03:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-emperor-akihito-allowed-to-abdicate-after-parliament-clears-hurdles-1496979558", "news_title": "Japan\u2019s Emperor Akihito Allowed to Abdicate as Parliament Clears Hurdles", "keywords": " abdicate, abdication,akihito,crown prince naruhito,emperor akihito, japan, japan emperor, monarchy,Emperor Akihito,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,royal families,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Electric vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence are poised for growth in China due to the government\u2019s support of these sectors, said       Jenny Lee,        managing partner of GGV Capital.In China, \u201dthe technology business model cannot exist without government support,\u201d said Ms. Lee, speaking at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s D.Live Asia conference in Hong Kong on Friday.Companies in these emerging tech sectors are receiving government subsidies and other support as part of China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan.

After several hours of gyrations, the pound slumped to a fresh post-election low of $1.2650 early Friday morning following media reports that Prime Minister       Theresa May       won\u2019t resign. That\u2019s a decline of 2.4% since the release of last night\u2019s exit poll.Futures on the FTSE 100 stock index were down 0.1%, as S&P 500 futures remained mostly unchanged. Other British markets and U.S stock markets were yet to open.The key concern driving investors\u2019 decisions is how this election will impact Britain\u2019s ongoing divorce with the European Union, which Ms. May had already begun in March.\u201cThe prospect of a hung Parliament will just complicate Brexit negotiations,\u201d said James Athey, a portfolio manager at         Aberdeen Asset Management.The main drop in the pound happened right after an exit poll at 10 p.m. projected that Ms. May\u2019s Conservative Party would remain the largest party in Parliament but lose the majority. The poll was right: With only seven constituencies left to declare, Conservatives had secured 313 seats out of a 650-seat lower chamber.The Conservatives, as the party with most seats, will have first shot at trying to form a new government either as a formal coalition with another party or by relying on other parties to help vote through its policies. If they can\u2019t build a majority large enough to govern, the Labour Party would get a chance to form a government.Whichever of the two main parties forms a government could potentially draw on several centrist and center-left parties to build a parliamentary alliance, including the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats say they want a second referendum, while the pro-EU SNP wants to be part of the Brexit negotiations and to keep Scotland in the single market.\u201cAs a negotiating stance in Brussels, it will look like the country as a whole has said \u2018we\u2019re sorry, we didn\u2019t mean to vote for Brexit,\u2019\u201d said       Stephen Gallo,        European head of currency strategy at         BMO Financial Group,       who thinks sterling could go as low as $1.25.Nevertheless, some investors think that a minority or coalition government could eventually boost the pound because the parties involved would be more likely to make concessions to European officials\u2014offsetting their concerns about the interventionist policies of       Mr Corbyn,        a self-declared socialist.While Brexit supporters argue that the U.K. would be able to carve out new deals with trading giants like the U.S. and China, most analysts say the sort of clean break from the EU that Conservatives have advocated would be negative for the British economy, throwing up tariffs and obstacles to trade and hurting the country\u2019s large finance industry.Arnab Das, a senior analyst at Invesco, said a hung parliament might be positive over the long term, because it \u201cshould end up softening Brexit.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, over the coming weeks, sterling unwinds and we end up right where we started,\u201d said       Eric Lonergan,        macro fund manager at M&G Investments, who believes the low value of the pound already reflected a worst-case scenario before the election.\u201cThe U.K. economy has been performing quite well, so it\u2019s not obvious that the exchange rate should be as weak as it is,\u201d he added.For U.K. stocks, a weaker pound makes income earned abroad look beefier and tends to push share prices higher. Most of the revenues earned by companies in the FTSE 100 index\u2014and roughly half in the FTSE 250\u2014come from abroad. So the fall in the FTSE 100 futures suggests that concerns about the result might offset any currency benefit in the minds of equity investors when trading starts later on Friday.\u201cThe uncertainty will put a lid on the U.K. equity market,\u201d said       Dominic Rossi,        global chief investment officer at Fidelity International. \u201cThe prospect of another election within next few months, coupled with the Brexit negotiations which are more unpredictable than before, raises the risks for all investors in U.K. equities.\u201dAlthough \u201cmarkets will express disdain for the country mainly through the currency,\u201d domestic-oriented companies in the FTSE 250 might also suffer as long as the shape of the next government remains unclear, said       James Butterfill,        head of research and investment strategy at exchange-traded funds provider ETF Securities. Shares of utilities and railway companies\u2014sectors that Mr. Corbyn has pledged to nationalize\u2014could be singled out, he added.A hung Parliament could also dent U.K. government debt, on the back of expectations that the Conservatives would be less able to keep fiscal policy tight. That could drive up growth and inflation, leading the Bank of England to raise interest rates earlier than previously believed. Bond yields broadly track interest rates and move opposite to prices.\u2014Alistair MacDonald, Christopher Whittall and       Mike Bird       contributed to this article.Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Pound Drops as Early Count Points To Tory Setback.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 02:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-markets-fall-after-exit-polls-predict-minority-government-1496957136", "news_title": "British Pound Falls on Hung Parliament", "keywords": " british pound,conservatives,election,hung parliament,labour party,markets,sterling,u.k., u.k. investors,voting,Viraj Patel,Paul Markham,James Athey,Kallum Pickering,Patrick O'Donnell,Seema Shah,Kit Juckes,Arnab Das,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,equity markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "CANBERRA\u2014Australia\u2019s state and federal governments agreed to crack down on parole granted to people with terrorism links, in a move intended to toughen the country\u2019s security stance following a spate of global \u200bterror\u200b attacks.The deal, which makes it harder for state\u200b courts to grant bail to extremist suspects, came days after a convicted gunman on parole killed one and wounded three police in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Police shot him dead.\u201cWhere a person has had a involvement with or support for, or connection with, violent extremism, there would be a presumption that they would not get bail or parole,\u201d Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull       said.Authorities have been reviewing parole arrangements since a 2014 siege in Sydney in which a gunmen killed two of 18 hostages.

Last month, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said it was considering appointing a senior official to oversee counterterrorism efforts.Australia has been on high alert for terrorist attacks since sending warplanes and special-forces advisers to join the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The country, a close Washington ally, was an original member of U.S.-led coalitions during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Police and spy agencies have disrupted a dozen terrorist plots and arrested 63 people since September 2014, most recently a plot before Christmas to detonate a bomb in a busy square in Melbourne. Other foiled plans have included an Islamic State-inspired plot to behead someone in public.Mr. Turnbull said the FBI-equivalent Australian Federal Police, intelligence agencies, paramilitary-style border guards and state police had agreed to joint counter-terrorism teams, responding to recommendations from a coroner investigating the 2014 siege for more federal-state cooperation.\u201cViolent criminals with terrorist links should not be walking the streets.

They can sell the bonds to fund infrastructure projects and use revenue from land sales, a major source of local-government income, to pay the interest.This might seem a straightforward and legitimate way to finance local-government investment. Alas, there\u2019s a wrinkle: Rules issued last month bar local governments from pledging revenue from land sales for debt payments. They\u2019re also barred from using land assets to guarantee debt issued in the past by off-balance-sheet financing vehicles linked to local governments.The conflicting messages call into question Beijing\u2019s commitment to lowering China\u2019s worrying debt levels, and underline its dilemma. Infrastructure spending remains key to meeting official economic targets\u2014investment still contributes over 40% of annual growth\u2014and that requires an unfettered flow of financing.

With no party gaining the 326 seats needed to form a majority, the next few days and even weeks could be filled with horse trading as the Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party seek to muster allies to form a government.Some 83% of the electorate voted for the two main parties\u201443% for the Conservatives and 40% for Labour\u2014the highest proportion in decades. Ironically, this return to two-party voting patterns didn\u2019t produce a clear result.The most likely outcome depended on exactly how many seats the Conservatives win. If they get 318 seats\u2014the exact projection of the BBC\u2014they would likely seek to govern with the help of the pro-U.K. Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats.The DUP supported Brexit\u2014but will extract concessions to back the Conservatives. That will also leave the Conservatives depending on their hard-line anti-Brexit lawmakers to pass legislation.Apart from the DUP, no other grouping would likely back the Conservatives. This could lead the Conservatives to attempt to form a minority government\u2014which could well be short-lived. There is even an outside possibility that Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       could try to pull together an alliance to govern.In this process, the negotiations over Brexit will be called into question. It isn\u2019t clear anyway that negotiations will be able to start as scheduled on June 19. Mrs. May formally gave notice to leave the EU at the end of March, opening a two-year negotiating window.Vince Cable,        a former Liberal Democrat business minister who regained his seat in west London, said \u201cclearly the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought.\u201d\u201cThere will have to be compromise\u201d to address the concerns of the 48% of Britons who voted in the 2016 referendum to remain in the EU, he told the BBC. He said he didn\u2019t think the new Parliament would pass a mammoth act of Parliament that Mrs. May has proposed to make sure Brexit happened.The outcome raised the possibility about whether the Brexit negotiations should be halted or put on ice while the British sort out their political crisis. Any effort to extend the negotiating period\u2014or halt Brexit\u2014would need the unanimous support of the other 27 EU governments.In the election, there were almost too many data points to sum up. Regional differences abounded. Labour gained spectacularly in London and added seats unexpectedly in other parts of England and in Wales.Yet the Scottish National Party yielded seats in Scotland to the Conservatives, as those opposing Scottish independence appeared to vote tactically.

As polls closed, that gambit immediately appeared to backfire, and as tallying went on, her party lost rather than gained seats.By early morning, it was clear there would be a so-called hung Parliament, in which no party has command. The surprising blow immediately put Mrs. May\u2019s leadership of her party and of the government in question.The prime minister acknowledged the uncertain outcome early Friday. \u201cAt this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability,\u201d Mrs. May told reporters upon winning her own seat. \u201cIf the Conservative Party has won the most seats and most votes, it will be incumbent on us to ensure that the country has that period of stability.\u201dWith most races decided, projections put her ruling Conservatives short of the 326 seats needed to win a majority in Britain\u2019s 650-seat Parliament. Early Friday, the British Broadcasting Corporation said it saw the Conservatives winning 318 seats, compared with 330 in the outgoing Parliament. The main opposition Labour Party gained ground to win what some projections put at 267 seats.The pound sank sharply against the dollar after the exit polls and remained low through the night but the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 stock index rose more than 1% in early trading.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Mrs. May to resign. \u201cThe prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate and the mandate she got is lost seats\u2026and a lost mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that that\u2019s enough to go.\u201dSteven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said Mrs. May\u2019s future as prime minister was at risk.\u201cThe capital she had with her own party\u2014that\u2019s been spent, that\u2019s all gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you call an election to reinforce your authority, to reinforce your negotiation hand and you don\u2019t get that endorsement, clearly people are going to ask questions about you.\u201dProjections early Friday suggested a Labour gain of more than 35 seats. In other surprises, the Scottish Nationalist Party lost more than a dozen seats and the Liberal Democrats appeared to have gained several seats.\u200bIn a major win in London, the Labour Party gained Battersea from the Conservatives, a sign that anti-Brexit sentiment may have hurt the Conservatives in areas where a majority of people voted to stay in the EU. In another significant result, Labour Party held on to Bridgend in Wales, a key Conservative target that Mrs. May visited near the start of the campaign.The political uncertainty comes as Britain prepares to begin talks on June 19 on extricating itself from the EU after 44 years. The two sides already face a tight timetable to agree on a host of complex issues. Depending on the election\u2019s final results, forming a working government could turn out to be a drawn-out process that would threaten to leave Brexit negotiations on hold.The prospect of a stable coalition similar to the one formed quickly in 2010 between the Conservatives and the smaller Liberal Democrats seems distant.\u00a0The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party have ruled out joining a coalition, though leaders have said they would consider a looser alliance.In the event of a hung parliament in the U.K., the incumbent government gets first shot at crafting an administration. The Conservatives may be able to turn to longtime allies in Northern Ireland to support their policy program.The result marks a startling gain for Mr. Corbyn, a veteran left-winger. He squeaked onto a Labour Party leadership ballot in 2015 and was expected to come in a distant last in a field of four. Instead, Mr. Corbyn galvanized young backers to win that contest. Support from younger voters during the recent seven-week campaign\u2014and a manifesto that struck a chord with the wider public\u2014helped Labour close a yawning polling gap with the Conservatives, though no poll before the elections put Labour in the lead.If in the coming days the Conservatives can\u2019t build a majority large enough to govern, Mr. Corbyn may get a chance. He can potentially draw on a broader range of center-left parties to build a looser parliamentary alliance, including the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Greens.Either outcome leaves the path to Brexit more unclear.Mrs. May, who campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the EU before the June referendum mandated its exit, has laid out\u00a0plans for a clean break with the bloc, including leaving the European single market to gain tighter control of immigration.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party said it would prioritize retaining the benefits of the single market and keeping closer links to the EU, hinting at a softer approach to talks. But with the party\u2019s backers split between young, urban voters and traditional working-class strongholds that favored Brexit, it has struggled to lay out a clear plan on the issue.Potential partners have conflicting and sometimes irreconcilable objectives. Some, such as the SNP and Liberal Democrats, hope to keep the U.K. in the single market, complicating the two main parties\u2019 plans. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, a potential ally for the Conservatives, would likely demand its region gets special treatment in any Brexit deal as the price of its support.To\u00a0the surprise of most observers\u2014and likely to Mrs. May\u2019s detriment\u2014the election campaign wasn\u2019t dominated by Brexit. Voters paid more heed to bread-and-butter issues such as health care and pensions.It was on one of those issues that Mrs. May appears to have made a damaging judgment, presenting a complex plan to finance elderly care that bombed with graying voters and their likely heirs, who feared they would have to pay more.The campaign was twice suspended in response to terror attacks, allowing the Labour Party to focus on cuts to police numbers during Mrs. May\u2019s six years as the minister responsible for security. Any new government will face the immediate challenge of overhauling the country\u2019s counterterrorism strategy.In Mr. Corbyn, Mrs. May and her team encountered a more formidable foe than they had anticipated. His avuncular style and refusal to abandon long-held but unpopular positions contrasted with what many saw as Mrs. May\u2019s robotic campaign appearances and policy reversals.Maria Caulfield, a Conservative lawmaker in Lewes, said the results would change Parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tense few days while we find out the results of this election and seeing who is going to be forming the next government,\u201d she said.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com, Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Vote Delivers a Stunning Blow To May.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 01:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-exit-polls-show-no-party-with-majority-1496956761", "news_title": "U.K. Voters Deliver Stunning Setback to Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives", "keywords": "brexit,british elections,conservative party,eu,european union,green party,hung parliament,jeremy corbyn,labour party,liberal democrats,scottish national party,theresa may,u.k. election,uk general election 2017,European Union,Parliament,Democratic Unionist Party,Scottish National Party,Jeremy Corbyn,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "NEW DELHI\u2014            Amazon.com Inc.

Amazon has so far had to act as an online marketplace, providing online and logistics support for other companies rather than selling products directly to consumers.Last year, India allowed foreign companies to sell groceries directly to consumers, provided the produce and processed foods are sourced locally.

The May reading matched a forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.Producer prices rose 5.5% in May from a year earlier, in line with expectations, slowing from April\u2019s 6.4% pace.Given a relatively benign inflation environment and recent monthly CPI readings well below the government\u2019s 3% annual ceiling, policy makers are expected to maintain relatively high short-term interest rates and continue tightening financial regulations in a bid to spur deleveraging. The International Monetary Fund is set to release its annual review of the Chinese economy next week that is expected to include warnings about rapidly rising corporate debt.Beijing\u2019s recent mission to contain financial risks was made easier by a relatively strong first quarter, which helped ease concern that measures to rein in debt would jeopardize its growth target for the year of about 6.5%. However, economists caution that Beijing faces a delicate balancing act.\u201cFood prices are extremely soft these days, and commodity prices are losing momentum, so I don\u2019t expect any turnaround in policy,\u201d said             Commerzbank AG       economist       Zhou Hao.       \u201cBut if they tighten too much, they could kill real demand if the real economy has trouble getting funding.\u201dHigher nonfood prices drove up inflation in May, accelerating 2.3%, compared with 2.4% in April. Mounting costs in health care, education, transportation and rent led those prices upward. China\u2019s Dragon Boat Festival holiday last month also nudged up hotel, airline and other travel-related costs.Countering these were food prices, which fell 1.6% last month after a 3.5% drop in April.\u00a0 Egg and pork prices in particular saw double-digit declines after earlier elevated prices encouraged farmers to raise more pigs and chickens, leading to an oversupply.Economists said they don\u2019t expect consumer inflation to speed up significantly this year. Higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy risk denting corporate profits and eroding personal incomes, while tighter restrictions on home buying are expected to stem rent increases and discourage spending on furniture, they said.Cui Pengyu, a 28-year-old software engineer working for a steel company in the northern city of Baotou, said prices for the vegetables he buys to make steaming hot pot stews have more than halved since last winter even as costs for basic household items rise modestly.For a worker in a bloated sector like steel, that is helpful at a time of uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019m worried about losing my job,\u201d Mr. Cui said. \u201cThese days, I\u2019m a bit more careful with my spending.\u201dAfter reaching a peak of 7.8% in February, price increases at the factory gate have lost momentum on weakening commodity prices, including a 30% drop in iron ore prices in recent months. This has cut into profits for large industrial firms, which rose 14% year over year in April, down from 28% in the first quarter.\u00a0 China\u2019s industrial sector accounts for about a third of the nation\u2019s economy.Economists said they expect factory-price inflation to continue weakening, with UBS forecasting that the producer-price index will decelerate to 4% to 5% in the third quarter and to 2% to 3% toward the end of the year.\u201cHopes for a more sustained period of reflation that would help erode the country\u2019s growing debt burden are likely to be disappointed,\u201d said Capital Economics in a report. \u201cIf the economy slows in the coming months as we expect, broader price pressures are likely to cool.\u201d\u2014Liyan Qi contributed to this article.Write to Mark Magnier at mark.magnier@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-09 00:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-consumer-inflation-edges-up-in-may-1496973487", "news_title": "China Consumer Prices Rise Faster in May", "keywords": "china consumer inflation,china consumer prices,china cpi,china inflation,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,consumer price index"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The Conservatives\u2019 stunning setback in Thursday\u2019s national elections has weakened Prime Minister       Theresa May       and raises the possibility that she may not be able to continue as her party\u2019s leader.In a speech after being re-elected as a member of Parliament early Friday morning, Mrs. May signaled that she may seek to hang on to her position despite the setback at the polls, saying Britain needs a \u201cperiod of stability.\u201dShould she decide to resign or be forced out, however, there are several candidates her party could put forward to replace her.Betting companies immediately offered odds on her potential replacements. Irish bookmaker             Paddy Power                   PLC had Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary       Boris Johnson       in the lead, followed by Brexit minister       David Davis       and then Treasury chief       Philip Hammond.Mr. Johnson was one of the highest-profile campaigners for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. After Britons voted last year to leave the bloc, he sought to become prime minister but dropped out of the race at the last minute after his close ally       Michael Gove       withdrew his support. Mrs. May got the job instead.Mr. Davis, who is overseeing the country\u2019s exit negotiations with the European Union, ran an unsuccessful leadership campaign against former Prime Minister       David Cameron       in 2005. One of a handful of government ministers who supported Brexit during the referendum campaign, he is a longtime campaigner against EU membership and has a following among euroskeptics in his party.Mr. Hammond, the Treasury chief, would be seen as an experienced hand that could steer the country through thorny negotiations. But given his support for staying in the EU and apparent rifts with the prime minister over economic policy, it may be difficult for him to command authority within the party.Another possible contender is       Amber Rudd,        the minister overseeing Britain\u2019s security and policing brief and an ally to Mrs. May. Ms. Rudd shone throughout the campaign, representing the Conservatives during the general election debate. She campaigned to stay in the EU and, like Mr. Hammond, may struggle to win support from euroskeptic lawmakers.The Conservatives will be eager to find a replacement quickly, since Brexit negotiations are due to start in earnest later this month.\u201cWe need someone to go and sit at the table a week\u00a0from Monday,\u201d said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know who that might be.

But it pulled the plug on the app last month and said it would launch a new parking service this summer.On Wednesday, Uber\u00a0was\u00a0interviewing Luxe engineers to determine which it would keep after the acquisition closes, according to\u00a0a person familiar with the matter. Chief Executive Curtis Lee and co-founder Craig Martin will continue with what remains of Luxe, said\u00a0one of the people. Uber isn\u2019t likely to take the Luxe name as part of the deal,\u00a0the people said.\u00a0Terms of the deal couldn\u2019t be learned.Uber hasn\u2019t been particularly acquisitive though it has raised about $15 billion in equity and debt financing. Last year, it bought self-driving truck company Otto for around $680 million and artificial-intelligence firm Geometric Intelligence for an undisclosed sum. Before that, it bought mapping startup deCarta in 2014 and some assets of             Microsoft\u2019s       Bing mapping service.Luxe was part of a generation of startups that launched several years ago in the wake of Uber\u2019s success and improvements in mobile technology. Investors piled money into startups that gave people a way to summon just about anything with a tap of a smartphone. To keep costs low, the startups typically relied on freelancers to perform the tasks, whether it is cleaning houses, running errands or delivering food.Known as the \u201cUber for parking,\u201d Luxe dispatched attendants who wore bright-blue track jackets and rode around on Razor scooters, picking up cars and fetching them when it was time for the driver to go home. It reached deals with parking lots\u00a0for\u00a0discounted rates.In 2015 it began converting hundreds of parking attendants to employees who could work full or part-time, paying for expenses such as cellphones and uniforms, plus health benefits. But as it expanded to more cities, Luxe encountered expensive contracts to park cars in garages, eating up cash.Luxe earlier this year pared back its service to\u00a0just\u00a0San Francisco, New York and Chicago and laid off some workers, including customer-service representatives.More recently, Luxe set up valet parking stands and offered lower rates at Luxe-branded parking lots. Luxe had been planning a service to allow for short-term car rentals in conjunction with its biggest shareholder, Hertz, owned by             Herc Holdings Inc.,       according to\u00a0one of the people. But that plan was called off after Hertz\u2019s CEO was pushed out in December.Uber is embroiled in an overhaul of its work culture in the wake of a former engineer\u2019s blog post about a permissive attitude toward sexual harassment and sexism.

The report also found that the city has a lower rate of repeat maltreatment\u00a0within six months\u00a0compared with other areas of the state\u20149.8% in the city compared with 13% elsewhere.But in an examination of specific ACS cases, researchers found that the agency sometimes didn\u2019t give families prompt or correct intervention. Researchers also determined there were inconsistencies in the way prior reports or background information\u2014history of substance abuse, for example\u2014 was incorporated into decision-making on cases. Moreover, researchers said the manner in which policies are communicated to ACS staff is problematic.In response to recommendations made in the report, an ACS spokeswoman provided a detailed list of actions the agency is undertaking, including a program in the South Bronx and Brooklyn\u2019s Brownsville section targeted to children from infancy to 3 years; greater coordination with the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services to enhance communication around ACS families; and increased staffing in borough offices.The Casey Family report is among several probes of ACS, which has come under fire for a string of high-profile child deaths in the past year. In response, the state has appointed a third party to monitor the agency. A spokeswoman for the state\u2019s\u00a0Office of Children & Family Services said it is in regular communication with ACS and will be making recommendations for improvement on an ongoing basis.In an interview, ACS Commissioner       David Hansell       said the report offered a \u201cgrounded assessment\u201d of where the agency should focus. He said the main recommendation, to institute a multiagency public-health strategy, is already moving forward in some areas, with increased collaboration among city agencies. But there \u201care more opportunities for us to leverage the work that\u2019s going on and resources available to other city agencies,\u201d he added.\u201cMany reforms are already under way, including encouraging interagency partnerships and relaunching CHILD-STAT, and we look forward to continue to strengthen ACS\u2019s ongoing work,\u201d a City Hall spokesman said.Jennifer March, executive director of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children, a New York-based child-advocacy group, said the report from Casey Family echoes what advocates have long known: \u201cA single system or agency can\u2019t be the only one involved in making certain that children are safe,\u201d she added.In shifting to a public health strategy\u2014which might include increasing programs focused on home visits or making sure early childhood education resources are deployed in the right way\u2014you are going \u201cbeyond improving child protection,\u201d she said.Write to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'City Is Urged to Revamp Child Services.'", "news_time": "2017-06-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-is-urged-to-revamp-child-services-1496980800", "news_title": "New York City Is Urged to Revamp Child Services ", "keywords": "acs,administration for children\u2019s services,casey family programs,child services,child welfare,new york city child welfare,political,general news,child abuse,society,community,crime,legal action,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,social issues"}]
