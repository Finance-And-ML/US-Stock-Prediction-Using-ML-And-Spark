[{"content": "Donald Trump Jr.      , the president\u2019s eldest son, arranged a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer who has been linked to the Kremlin, according to\u00a0Mr. Trump and\u00a0a lawyer for\u00a0      Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser who also attended the meeting.The meeting, in New York, was also attended by       Paul Manafort,        President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at the time who resigned about\u00a0two months later\u00a0amid reports of his connection to pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine. Investigators are currently examining whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for foreign interests violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related laws.Mr. Manafort\u2019s spokesman has said he is taking the \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to respond to guidance from federal authorities about his FARA disclosures.The Trump aides met with the Russian lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        on June 9, about a month after Mr. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination. The New York Times first reported the meeting\u00a0on Saturday.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russian President       Vladimir Putin       ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, and a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department earlier this year is investigating whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia in that effort. Mr. Trump has denied that there was any collusion and has said he doubts the intelligence community\u2019s assessment, saying earlier this week, \u201cNo one really knows for sure.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump met face-to-face with Mr. Putin at the Group of 20 leading nations summit, where he told the Russian leader that Americans are upset about Russia\u2019s actions and want them to stop, according to Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson.       Mr. Putin denied that Russia played a role, and the leaders opted not to \u201crelitigate\u201d the past, Mr. Tillerson said.Russia\u2019s account of the exchange differed from that of the Americans. Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov,        who was also in the meeting in Hamburg, told reporters afterward that said Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s contention that Russia didn\u2019t interfere in the campaign.The younger Mr. Trump, who has been charged with running the family company together with his brother, Eric, while his father is in office, in a statement described the sit-down with Ms. Veselnitskaya as a \u201cshort introductory meeting\u201d focused on a Russian adoption program that\u00a0was\u00a0halted by the Russian government.\u201cI asked Jared and Paul to stop by,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said in the statement.\u00a0\u201cWe primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up.\u201dHe added: \u201cI was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.\u201dMr. Kushner disclosed the meeting earlier this year in a required form to obtain a security clearance, according to a statement by his attorney,       Jamie Gorelick.      \u00a0Mr. Kushner initially filed a disclosure that didn\u2019t list any contacts with foreign government officials, but the next day submitted a supplemental disclosure saying that he had engaged in \u201cnumerous contacts with foreign officials.\u201d Mr. Kushner has since submitted information about \u201cover 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries, most of which were during transition,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said.\u201cMr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr.,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said. \u201cAs Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.\u201dTwo previously disclosed meetings Mr. Kushner held with key Russians\u2014the head of a state-run bank that has faced U.S. sanctions and       Sergei Kislyak,        the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014had already drawn the interest of agents conducting a counterintelligence investigation to determine the extent of those contacts. Mr. Kushner agreed earlier this year to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the first White House official to do so.Ms. Veselnitskaya counts among her clients state-owned companies and family members of top government officials and her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region. As a lawyer, she has campaigned against the Magnitsky Act, which targets Russian human-rights abusers, and the Russian accountant for whom the measure was named.       Sergei Magnitsky       was jailed and died in prison after he uncovered evidence of a large tax-refund fraud.Ms. Veselnitskaya raised the Magnitsky Act in the meeting at Trump Tower, according to a person familiar with the conversation. The person said the meeting ended shortly afterward. The president didn\u2019t become aware of the meeting until recent weeks, the person said.In a move seen as retaliation to that law, Mr. Putin in 2012 signed a law banning adoption of Russian children by American families.In postings on her social media accounts, Ms. Veselnitskaya appeared critical of former President       Barack Obama       and the Democratic Party. Last July, she shared an article posted by another page and highlighted the quote, \u201cLiberalism is a f\u2014ing mental disorder.\u201d She has also appeared to cheer some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top achievements, such as the confirmation earlier this year of       Neil Gorsuch,        Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 22:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-jr-arranged-meeting-between-fathers-campaign-russian-lawyer-1499558446", "news_title": "Donald Trump Jr. Arranged Meeting Between Father\u2019s Campaign, Russian Lawyer   ", "keywords": "donald trump,donald trump jr.,election 2016 interference,foreign agents,jared kushner,kremlin,paul manafort,russian hacking,trump administration,trump russia links,trump russian connections,Donald Trump Jr,Jared Kushner,Paul Manafort,Natalia Veselnitskaya,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "HAMBURG\u2014Leaders from the Group of 20 countries vowed Saturday to fight protectionism and secure fair trade, finding a broad consensus after President       Donald Trump\u2019s       defiantly unilateral stance exposed a rift between the world\u2019s leading economies.In light of the broad political pushback against globalization and the rise in antiestablishment forces in recent years, however, the G-20 stepped back from an unequivocal commitment to free trade for the first time since its inaugural summit in 2008. Instead, it recognized the need for defensive measures in pursuit of balanced trade.In another unprecedented move, the group broke from unanimity in its final communiqu\u00e9, splitting off the U.S. position on climate change from that of the other members.In the summit\u2019s concluding statement, the G-20 noted \u201cthe importance of reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade and investment frameworks.\u201d But in a nod to concerns of Mr. Trump and other leaders over trade imbalances, the group also said it would \u201cstrive to ensure a level playing field.\u201d The phrase seemed to reflect concerns of the U.S. and some European member states over China\u2019s expanding footprint in the global economy.Securing the support of Mr. Trump, whose \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies pose a potential clash with the international economic order, was the dominant theme among officials as the gathering drew to a close.\u201cThe negotiations on the climate issue reflected dissent\u2014everyone against the United States of America,\u201d said German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        who held the rotating G-20 presidency over the last year. \u201cAnd that the negotiations on the trade issue were especially tough was also a result of the United States taking certain positions.\u201dIn a tweet on Saturday, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cThe #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!\u201dA European official said the talks demonstrated that a new\u2014and different\u2014international consensus on economic issues could be slowly rebuilt despite the challenges thrown up by Mr. Trump\u2019s positions.One bellwether will be an international effort to curb the world\u2019s excess capacity of steel, as Mr. Trump considers unilateral measures to protect the U.S. market. On Saturday, the G-20 agreed to outline by November steps to temper the global overcapacity upending local markets.\u201cAll things considered, my impression is that we\u2019re getting back in small steps in many areas to a greater degree of business as usual,\u201d the official said.Yet some leaders warned the statement won\u2019t close deep divides on trade that have emerged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.French President       Emmanuel Macron       took swipes at Mr. Trump and others during the two-day summit for equating fair trade with avoiding bilateral deficits. Brandishing his smart phone during the session on trade, Mr. Macron said many products consumed in G-20 countries rely on global production chains, according to delegates. Mr. Trump had left the room when the French leader spoke, they said.\u201cA text does not efface tensions that exist and will continue to exist on this subject for a long time,\u201d Mr. Macron said during a press briefing as the summit concluded, describing the trade approach adopted by the U.S. president as \u201ca profound error.\u201dThe U.S. wasn\u2019t alone in its views on trade, officials said. On some points, such as promoting support for defensive measures against unfair trade, Mr. Trump was joined by other leaders, including the Turkish and EU presidents and Mr. Macron.For most world leaders, however, one of the summit\u2019s achievements was getting Mr. Trump to back international organizations that underpin global trade.Ahead of the summit, G-20 officials cited concerns that Mr. Trump would go beyond his decision to scrap a 12-country trans-Pacific trade pact and renegotiate America\u2019s trade agreement with Canada and Mexico to undermine broader platforms such as the World Trade Organization. The White House has launched a review of the WTO, with an eye toward proposing reforms.But in Hamburg the U.S. joined the other G-20 members in reiterating a commitment to safeguard rules-based global trade under the WTO umbrella.\u2018Working together isn\u2019t just the best option, it\u2019s the only option.\u2019\u201cWorking together isn\u2019t just the best option, it\u2019s the only option. Indeed it\u2019s the only way we can meet the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau       said at the end of the summit.Leaders overseeing 80% of the global economy also need to address the anxieties of people disenfranchised by globalization, Mr. Trudeau said, adding that the G-20 had heard the concerns of tens of thousands of demonstrators\u2014a small but violent section of whom rioted in Hamburg throughout the summit.Signaling the difficulties ahead in squaring cooperation with Mr. Trump\u2019s demands, G-20 members wrangled for days to find a joint position on climate change in the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to reject the Paris Agreement against global warming.In the end, they could only split the difference. Germany, a staunch supporter of action against global warming, led the \u201cvery difficult\u201d negotiations to reaffirm 19 members\u2019 commitment to the Paris accord while accommodating Mr. Trump\u2019s stance, officials said.To that end, Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiators were able to insert a line into the communiqu\u00e9 on the U.S. helping other countries \u201caccess and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently,\u201d according to an EU official.\u201cThe inclusion of this paragraph is the trade-off of having a consensual approach,\u201d the EU official said. \u201cObviously, to have in the text a reference to these kind of energy sources is not something we like.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s team pushed hard to isolate the U.S. on climate change, a French official said, and safeguard the 2015 accord signed by every country in the world except Syria and Nicaragua. Signatories overwhelmingly rallied behind the deal after Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out.\u201cWe don\u2019t want any contagion,\u201d the French official said.In a move that could further isolate the U.S, Mr. Macron announced a Dec. 12 gathering to mark the second anniversary of the Paris accord, with a focus on financing environmental projects.While isolated in leaving the climate deal, Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t alone in criticizing its implementation so far. Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       said that despite joining the G-20 communiqu\u00e9 in reaffirming Paris Agreement commitments, Ankara would withhold ratification because financial pledges by Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessor hadn\u2019t yet been delivered.\u201cFollowing America\u2019s step, our stance currently is also that this should not pass in parliament,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said, adding that the communiqu\u00e9 papered over unease about the climate pact.Another sticking point at the annual G-20 gathering was migration. Russia and China blocked an effort by the European Union\u2014supported in principle by the U.S.\u2014to pursue United Nations sanctions against human traffickers, according to EU officials. But G-20 leaders did commit to countering migrant smuggling and human trafficking for the first time in their conclusions, without offering any specifics.\u201cThe reference to countering migrant smugglers and bringing them to justice is a very important step,\u201d another EU official said.Despite the lack of greater consensus on migration and climate change, the G-20 members did find language suggesting a shared commitment to staving off what many officials had flagged ahead of the summit as a major risk: trade wars.\u201cInternational trade and investment are important engines of growth,\u201d the G-20 leaders said. \u201cWe will strive to ensure a level playing field, in particular by promoting a favorable environment for trade and investment.\u201d\u2014Anton Troianovski and Andrea Thomas contributed to this article.Write to Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 15:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/g-20-leaders-set-to-reach-compromise-on-trade-at-summit-1499513260", "news_title": "G-20 Leaders Find Trade Compromises but Are Split on Climate", "keywords": " climate change, donald trump, g-20, hamburg, merkel, trade,trump,Group of 20,Donald Trump,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,fair trade,political,general news,climate change,society,community,natural environment,globalization,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "HAMBURG, Germany\u2014When President       Donald Trump       left a session at the Group of 20 summit on Saturday, the White House official who slipped into the chair he had just vacated was his daughter and senior adviser,       Ivanka Trump.       It was a reminder of the role that his family plays in his presidency.A photo taken and tweeted by a woman who identified herself as a Russian \u201csherpa\u201d at the Group of 20 summit showed Ms. Trump sitting at the main table between British Prime Minister       Theresa May       and Chinese President       Xi Jinping.Leaders are allowed to bring a few aides into the G-20 meetings. And the aides are permitted to fill the leaders\u2019 chairs should the need arise. Besides Ms. Trump, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       was also in the room on the president\u2019s behalf.Ms. Trump is far lower in the formal hierarchy than Mr. Mnuchin. But she took the seat, a White House official said, because the conversation turned to a subject that touches on one of her projects\u2014African development. She had been sitting at the back of the room and \u201cbriefly joined the main table\u201d after her father left, the official said.When other leaders stepped away, their seats, too, were \u201calso briefly filled by others,\u201d the official said.As the image of Ms. Trump circulated Saturday, some questioned whether she should have taken the seat.\u201cIf senior members of his cabinet were present they should have been representing the United States.\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in an interview. \u201cHis seat is America\u2019s seat at the G-20\u2014not his family\u2019s seat.\u201dOthers were untroubled by the move, saying it isn\u2019t unusual for delegation members to sit in for the president from time to time.Since her father took office, Ms. Trump has been forging ties to some foreign officials. Earlier Saturday, German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau       and others took part in an event at the summit showcasing a project that was Ms. Trump\u2019s idea: A fund to promote women entrepreneurs.Asked about the seat swap at a news conference later in the day, Chancellor Merkel said: \u201cIf the president is not there\u2014which sometimes happens with all delegations\u2014then the delegations decide themselves who will sit at the table. And Ivanka Trump was part of the American delegation, so this was something that was along the lines of what all delegations do. And it is known that she works in the White House and has exercised responsibility for certain initiatives.\u201dAt the women entrepreneurs event, Mr. Trump suggested that if anything, he has been an impediment to his daughter\u2019s progress.\u201cIf she weren\u2019t my daughter it would be so much easier for her,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt might be the only bad thing she has going if you want to know the truth.\u201d\u2014Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-08 15:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trump-briefly-fills-presidents-seat-at-g-20-summit-1499543105", "news_title": "Ivanka Trump Briefly Fills President\u2019s Seat at G-20 Summit", "keywords": "g20,ivanka trump,steven mnuchin,Group of 20,Ivanka Trump,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the apology and financial compensation his government issued to Omar Khadr, saying Saturday they were the price for violating Mr. Khadr\u2019s constitutional rights while he was held at Guantanamo Bay for over a decade.Canada\u2019s constitution \u201cprotects all Canadians, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters at the end of the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in Hamburg, Germany. \u201cThis is not about the details or the merits of the Khadr case. When the government violates any Canadians\u2019 [constitutional] rights, we all end up paying for it.\u201dNegative reaction to the formal settlement unveiled Friday has been swift, with former Canadian Prime Minister       Stephen Harper       weighing in, saying the deal is \u201csimply wrong.\u201dThe formal settlement with Mr. Khadr, a Canadian held by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay for over a decade following the death of a U.S. Army medic, marked an attempt to bring closure to a case that fueled a bitter debate on how to handle national security threats.Canada\u2019s Liberal government said it wished to \u201capologize to Mr. Khadr for any role Canadian officials may have played in relation to his ordeal abroad and any resulting harm.\u201dSettlement details, such as a payment for damages, weren\u2019t publicly disclosed. A person familiar with the details said the payment was about 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.75 million).The settlement brings an end to a drawn-out lawsuit Mr. Khadr\u2019s lawyers launched against the Canadian government. It sought C$20 million in damages over his detention in Guantanamo Bay and what it claimed were a violation of his constitutional rights by Canadian officials, who interviewed Mr. Khadr while he was in custody. Canada\u2019s top court ruled in 2010 that Mr. Khadr\u2019s rights under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights were infringed.Mr. Khadr, now 30 years old, was born in Canada and later brought to Afghanistan, where at age 15 he was captured by the U.S. Army in July 2002 and transferred to Guantanamo Bay. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty to a series of charges including murder, attempted murder, providing support for terrorism and spying. He came to Canada years later to serve the remainder of his eight-year sentence. He was released on bail in 2015, and has lived in western Canada since.In the face of intense criticism, the Canadian government late Friday said its decision to settle wasn\u2019t an attempt to thwart legal action by the family of Chris Speer, the U.S. combat medic who died in 2002, and Layne Morris, blinded in a 2002 battle. Their lawyer filed a notice with a Canadian court to stop Mr. Khadr from receiving any financial reward from the federal government in the event of a settlement.\u201cFor anyone to suggest that a payment was rushed to avoid the Speers\u2019 legal claim is wrong and offensive,\u201d the government said.Attempts to reach the lawyer for the Speer and Morris families haven\u2019t been successfulThe leader of Canada\u2019s Conservative Party,       Andrew Scheer,        said Friday the apology and financial payout \u201cwas disgusting,\u201d referring to Mr. Khadr during a press conference as a convicted terrorist.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com<mailto:paul.vieira@wsj.com>", "news_time": "2017-07-08 14:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trudeau-defends-canadas-settlement-with-former-guantanamo-detainee-1499540260", "news_title": "Trudeau Defends Canada\u2019s Settlement With Former Guantanamo Detainee", "keywords": "former detainee,former prisoner,gitmo,guantanamo bay,omar khadr,settlement,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The Tour de France hit the most grueling stage of the race so far on Saturday, rolling through the Jura hills so fast that it briefly rediscovered something it had lost in recent years: a little bit of chaos.The 116.5-mile, up-and-down stage brought a mess of attacks, huge fractures in the peloton, and a surprise win for a French Tour rookie who nearly cramped his way out of contention. Two different riders threatened to steal the leader\u2019s yellow jersey. In fact, the pace was so high that rider Geraint Thomas said there wasn\u2019t even time for a \u201cnature break.\u201dFor fans and Tour de France romantics, it was exactly what this race had been missing. The only group that hated it was the defending champion, Team Sky. Chaos isn\u2019t how the British outfit rode to victory in four of the past five Tours. For a team that obsesses over every nugget of data at all times, chaos is the enemy.So with 20 miles and a nasty climb to go on Saturday, Team Sky, the deepest, richest team in the sport, did what it does best and killed the party.Overall race leader Chris Froome and his Sky lieutenants drove the main bunch like a locomotive to close the gaps to their nearest rivals and retain the yellow jersey. (The day\u2019s winner, 24-year-old Lilian Calmejane, isn\u2019t a general classification threat.) Sky is now the first team in 40 years to hold on to the overall lead through the first eight stages of a Tour.\u201cReally, really tough day,\u201d said QuickStep Floors rider Dan Martin, who took 13th on the stage. \u201cThe way Sky rode, and with that finish, you were never going to get anywhere anyway.\u201dAfter the first week of the Tour put sprinters in the spotlight with predominantly flat stages, the weekend came with the potential for a shake-up in the general classification. And when a group of 50 riders broke away early in Saturday\u2019s stage, it forced all of the major contenders into high gear. As far as Sky is concerned, this is too much excitement.\u201cToday some teams wanted the yellow jersey,\u201d Froome said. \u201cSo we couldn\u2019t let them go. We\u2019ve had to ride at the very high tempo behind them.\u201dTeam Sky even gave itself a scare, when Thomas and Froome overcooked a corner while riding downhill. Thomas steered himself into a hay bale to avoid some trees, but Froome only rolled onto the gravel without falling off.\u201cWe had it all in control in the end,\u201d Thomas said, voicing a familiar position for Sky at this race.Only four men have worn the yellow jersey for longer than Froome, who has worn it for 47 days in his career through Saturday. The murderer\u2019s row of champions includes Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Miguel Indurain, and Jacques Anquetil. (The list ahead of Froome is actually five riders long, but the Tour\u2019s official record book makes the rather spectacular point of printing and crossing out       Lance Armstrong\u2019s       name.)Froome could draw level with Anquetil on 52 days next week, but first he must survive Sunday\u2019s brutal mountain stage with its seven climbs and one technical descent. He conceded that it had the potential for even more fireworks than Saturday, that the general classification could be \u201cblow to pieces.\u201d Sky\u2019s priority, above all, will be snuffing them out.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 14:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tour-de-france-gets-some-much-needed-chaos-in-grueling-stage-1499537805", "news_title": "Tour de France Gets Some Much-Needed Chaos in Grueling Stage", "keywords": "cycling,stage eight tour de france,team sky tour de france,tour de france,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "CARACAS, Venezuela\u2014Jailed opposition leader       Leopoldo L\u00f3pez       was moved from a military prison to house arrest Saturday morning in a surprise move ahead of a plan by the government to rewrite the constitution in what its foes say will be a power grab.Venezuela\u2019s supreme court said in a statement that it had commuted the sentence because of unspecified mistakes in judicial proceedings and health concerns. One of the country\u2019s most popular government adversaries and head of a major opposition party, Popular Will, Mr. L\u00f3pez was serving a nearly 14-year sentence for allegedly instigating violence at protests in 2014 that left 43 people dead.Waving the Venezuelan flag, a seemingly healthy Mr. L\u00f3pez briefly appeared on his house balcony in front of about a hundred jubilant supporters chanting \u201cLiberty\u201d on Saturday afternoon. Many wore T-shirts with Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s portrait and his party\u2019s orange colors.\u201cI stand firm in my opposition to this regime and in my fight for liberty,\u201d he said in statement read by his party\u2019s chief. \u201cIf my fight will lead me back to a jail cell\u2026I\u2019m more than ready to assume it.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez has called on supporters to take to the streets Sunday to maintain the pressure on the government.A squad of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s intelligence police installed themselves a block from the residence.\u201cWhat happened is important,\u201d said schoolteacher Ana Teresa de Sola, who said she came to Mr. Lopez\u2019s house to show her support. \u201cWe have to keep fighting until they free all political prisoners.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez, 46 years old, staged a monthlong hunger strike in 2015 and during his time in jail occasionally got messages out to the public urging opponents to continue pressuring a government he calls a dictatorship. Mr. Maduro and his predecessor,       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,        have long viewed Mr. Lopez with suspicion and had years ago barred him from running for mayor of Caracas. In official pronouncements, government officials referred to him as \u201cthe Monster of Ramo Verde,\u201d instead of using his name.\u201cChavez and now Maduro have always seen L\u00f3pez as a potential threat, a threat to them, because I think he does have enormous appeal,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy group in Washington. \u201cAnd the fact that he went through this ordeal will only heighten his appeal. I think he\u2019s a figure to be reckoned with.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez and his lawyers have repeatedly denied all the charges that were leveled against him, which were criticized by all major international rights groups and governments from Europe to the U.S. One of the prosecutors of the case fled to Miami, where he denounced the charges as fake and politically motivated.\u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez is innocent,\u201d Franklin Nieves told The Wall Street Journal in 2015 in an interview in which he apologized to Mr. Lopez\u2019s family.The prosecutors claimed at the time that Mr. L\u00f3pez, who wasn\u2019t present in any street clashes with security forces, used \u201csubliminal messages\u201d to push his supporters to violence. He was arrested days after the protests erupted in February 2014.\u201cThe measure of house arrest for what the government calls humanitarian reasons does not signify that the judge\u2019s decision condemning him for 14 years has been overturned,\u201d said Carlos Romero, a Venezuelan political scientist and author. \u201cThe place where he is being jailed has changed.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez had 48% approval rating in June, compared with President Maduro\u2019s 20%, according to the latest poll from Caracas-based Datanalisis. Another opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, topped the poll with a 51% approval.The measure releasing Mr. L\u00f3pez comes at a time of rising repression by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which has been confronted by rollicking social unrest and a collapsing economy. More than 90 people, mostly protesters, have died in the almost daily demonstrations rocking the country for the past three months. On Wednesday, government supporters armed with pipes burst into Venezuela\u2019s congress and severely beat several opposition lawmakers.Hundreds of protesters are being tried in closed military courts on treason charges, a move decried by Venezuela\u2019s attorney general and international rights groups. There are 431 political prisoners in the country, including a lawmaker and dozens of activists for Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s Popular Will party, according to local rights group Penal Forum.The government crackdown, and the increasing violence, has drawn condemnation from several governments, including the U.S., while prompting diplomats and former presidents from around the region and Spain to reach out to Mr. Maduro and his aides.Mr. Shifter said Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s transfer to house arrest \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the regime is opening up and that a transition is imminent.\u201d\u201cBut I think it does reflect that there has been international pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cSustained international pressure had an impact, and the government felt that it had to do this, especially with what happened the last couple of days with the attacks in congress.\u201dIn what Mr. Maduro has called an attempt to calm the unrest, the government here has called for a vote on July 30 for a special assembly, which will have the powers to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution. The opposition and ruling party dissidents say the assembly will be made up of government supporters and will work to wipe out the last vestiges of Venezuela\u2019s democracy by solidifying Mr. Maduro\u2019s hold and sidelining critics. The government\u2019s foes say they will boycott the vote.Instead, the opposition alliance has said that on July 16 it will stage a parallel, unofficial referendum on Mr. Maduro\u2019s government and the planned constitutional overhaul. About 85% of Venezuelans say they are against changing the country\u2019s constitution, according to June\u2019s poll from Caracas-based Datanalisis.A Caracas-based political analyst, Dimitris Pantoulas, said that Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s transfer has the potential to take the steam out of the political opposition\u2019s aggressive protest campaign ahead of the July 30 vote. Indeed, government officials, who frequently accuse the opposition of instigating violence, on Saturday spoke publicly about how the Maduro administration was adhering to the supreme court\u2019s transfer order and calling for calm.\u201cThis is a humanitarian measure,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s human rights ombudsman William Tarek Saab, a close ally of Mr. Maduro, told reporters Saturday. He added that more similar measures for political prisoners can be announced soon.Mr. Pantoulas said that the decision \u201clegitimizes the government\u201d on the international stage. \u201cIt allows them to say we are pacifists, that we are not dictators and that we have ceded in something,\u201d he said.\u2014Juan Forero in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, contributed to this article.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 14:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jailed-venezuelan-opposition-leader-leopoldo-lopez-moved-to-house-arrest-1499519365", "news_title": "Jailed Venezuelan Opposition Leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez Moved to House Arrest ", "keywords": " house arrest,leopoldo lopez,leopoldo l\u00f3pez, lopez freed, popular will party leader, venezuela's lopez freed, venezuela opposition, venezuela opposition leader,Leopoldo L\u00f3pez,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "UNITED NATIONS\u2014Advocates say a treaty adopted by the United Nations on Friday represents the first step toward a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons.But the U.S., other nuclear powers and their allies said the move would have no effect on weapons and called for greater efforts to halt proliferation and pursue disarmament efforts.Two-thirds of United Nations\u2019 member states\u2014122 countries\u2014adopted the treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons. The 10-page document follows the framework of similar treaties that ban the use of chemical and biological weapons, signed in 1972 and 1993 respectively.\u201cThe treaty represents an important step and contribution towards the common aspiration of a world without nuclear weapons,\u201d U.N. Secretary General       Antonio Guterres       said in a statement Friday.The world\u2019s nine nuclear powers and all but one member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization didn\u2019t attend the vote session at the General Assembly. Netherlands, the only NATO member that participated, voted no. Singapore abstained. Iran, which ended its controversial nuclear program after a deal with world powers, voted in favor of the treaty.Upon adoption, many in assembly hall gathering, which included diplomats, U.N. officials and a wide array of civil society organizations, broke into cheers and clapped, with some crying.\u201cI have waited seven decades for this moment and I am overjoyed that it has finally arrived,\u201d said Hibakusha       Setsuko Thurlow,        a survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing who was present at the U.N. for the occasion. She was a 13-year-old schoolgirl at the time of the attack.The only time nuclear weapons have been used was during World War II, when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. The U.N. has a permanent display of artifacts and tattered burned pieces of clothing from then in the corridor leading to the General Assembly hall.Diplomats critical of the treaty said they favored a bilateral, gradual step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament. They said the treaty doesn\u2019t address North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and the security situation that makes \u201cnuclear deterrence\u201d necessary.The U.S., France and United Kingdom issued a joint statement rejecting the notion that the treaty would lead to international peace and security. They said they wouldn\u2019t abide by its provisions.\u201cWe do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to it. Therefore, there will be no change in the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons,\u201d the countries said in their statement.In a statement late Friday, the U.S. State Department said the treaty \u201cwill do nothing to advance real-world efforts to make the world a safer place.\u201d\u201cAt best it is a distraction from those efforts. At worst, it will deepen political divisions, undermine alliance relationships that help make the world more secure, and make it harder for the international community to work together,\u201d said spokeswoman       Heather Nauert.When the negotiations for the treaty initially began at the U.N. in March, U.S. Ambassador       Nikki Haley       organized a boycott outside the General Assembly together with a dozen allies. She told reporters then that nobody believed North Korea would ever disarm its nuclear program under this treaty.The treaty, which came about after months of intense negotiations, will become international law if 50 countries sign it on Sept. 20 during the U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders. Once the agreement is ratified it would be legally binding for the signatories. There are no enforcement provisions.\u201cThis is a historic moment for the international community,\u201d said Ambassador       Elayne G. Whyte Gomez       of Costa Rica and president of the U.N. conference that negotiated the Treaty. \u201cWe are building norms. The world changes and situations will change.\u201dThe treaty forbids nations from making, using or stockpiling nuclear weapons and calls on them to disarm completely. It also doesn\u2019t allow them to trade nuclear know-how with other countries.The agreement also entails confidence-building measures and humanitarian obligations. Countries must give assistance to people and environments that have been victims of a nuclear attack. Countries that have signed the treaty will meet every two years to discuss progress.Disarmament organizations said that getting opposing countries on board will take time and effort. Previous treaties that prohibit the use of biological and chemical weapons, cluster bombs and landmines initially met with resistance as well, but eventually became universally accepted, activists said.\u201cThese kinds of treaties have an impact that forces countries to change their behavior. It is not going to happen fast, but it does affect them,\u201d said       Beatrice Fihn       the director of the Geneva-based International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which has been at the forefront of this cause.Write to Farnaz Fassihi at farnaz.fassihi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 12:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/advocates-opponents-debate-effects-of-new-u-n-move-to-ban-nuclear-weapons-1499530608", "news_title": "Advocates, Opponents Debate Effects of New U.N.

The other is a group led by the University of California, Berkeley, which is challenging the Broad patent in court and has been issued its own patents for Crispr-Cas9 in other areas of the world, including Europe.Forming a patent pool would allow researchers or companies around the world to obtain a one-stop license more efficiently. In patent pools, patent holders typically merge their assets together and voluntarily negotiate terms of the license, fees and how any royalties will be divided. Pool members may also pay royalties to the pool if they need a license to commercialize products, depending on the terms of the agreement.Kathleen Denis, associate vice president for the Office of Technology Transfer at Rockefeller University, said the university believes the patent pool \u201cholds promise for simplifying the process for scientists to obtain the appropriate licenses\u201d for Crispr.Rockefeller\u2019s decision to join the Broad in exploring a patent pool follows a clash between the two institutions over credit for Crispr. Ms. Denis said Thursday that Rockefeller and Broad have agreed to settled their differences via an \u201cinformal dispute resolution process.\u201dThe proposal for a pool comes from a group called MPEG LA LLC, based in Denver and Chevy Chase, Md. It operates licensing programs for a number of different technologies, primarily video.In the uncertainty over resolution of the patent dispute, some companies have chosen sides, signing licensing deals with one or the other camp; others have hedged their bets and sought licenses from more than one party.\u201cPotential licensees all want clarity on this,\u201d says       Kristin Neuman,        executive director, biotechnology licensing, at MPEG LA. \u201cIt is confounding their ability to plan for their businesses.\u201dSome companies and researchers are calling on the government to play a greater role in ensuring access to Crispr technology, whose discovery was funded by federal grants. Therapeutics based on the technology could home in on a gene defect, cut it out and, if necessary, replace it with other DNA, potentially revolutionizing the treatment of disease.Although the patent dispute is unresolved, the main Crispr players have granted exclusive rights to spinoff companies formed by their own researchers to use Crispr in developing human therapies. Some experts have cried foul, saying the technology is too important to allow it to be locked up by a chosen few.Jorge Contreras, a law professor at University of Utah who writes extensively about Crispr, says current exclusive licenses are too broad and allow companies to act as de facto gatekeepers of science.Larry Horn, president and chief executive of MPEG LA, says a patent pool would offer benefits to all players because, given the complicated patent landscape, no single party is likely to have all the licenses it needs to develop therapeutics or other products. \u201cThe word exclusivity is muddled in an environment like this,\u201d he says.Lee McGuire, chief communications officer for the Broad, said the institute currently licenses Crispr-Cas9 nonexclusively for all applications except human therapeutics, where it believes some exclusivity is needed if a licensing company is going to invest the kind of money needed to develop gene editing. Patent holders may pursue different licensing strategies, an issue a patent pool must address.Terms of the patent pool and any license that emerges will still have to be negotiated. Among the open questions is how a patent pool that aims to create a streamlined, standardized license will also allow for enough exclusivity so that companies will invest in drug development.A spokesman for U.C.

On election day, security agencies will be strained while attempting stop any possible violence and al-Shabaab could take advantage, he said.Kenya is among five countries contributing troops to an African Union force that is bolstering Somalia\u2019s fragile central government against al-Shabaab\u2019s insurgency.

According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.K. government cut its annual borrowings before interest payments to\u00a02.0%\u00a0of economic output in 2016 from 3.8% in 2008.That reduction\u00a0of 1.8 percentage points of gross domestic product\u00a0was below the average for OECD members. Britain\u2019s belt tightening was nowhere near the 18.6 points cut by Greece or Ireland\u2019s 7.5-point reduction over the same period. Indeed, it was below the 2.9-point drop in borrowing by the U.S.But if the cuts haven\u2019t been deep, they have lingered. Explicit spending curbs have been in place for longer in the U.K. than for any other European country, bar Greece.\u201cGenerally, people are tired of austerity and the same old thing,\u201d said       Max Neal,        a 19-year-old student at the University of Kent, who was among the many whose votes transferred the Canterbury electoral district to the opposition Labour Party after a century in Conservative hands. \u201cThis was a chance to put an end to the cuts.\u201dAnother factor encouraging austerity fatigue may be the pound\u2019s slump since the June 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union, pushing up prices of imported goods and spurring inflation.With wages lagging behind, real incomes have shrunk in Britain, especially for the 5.4 million public-sector workers subject to an austerity measure limiting annual pay rise to 1%.Many Britons have already suffered large drops in income, government figures show. While the median British worker saw his or her real hourly pay fall by 5.8% between 2005 and 2015, teachers suffered a 10.1% drop and doctors a decline of 22.5%. Police officers\u2019 real pay declined by 7.5% over the same period.Police forces have been shrinking too. The numbers of officers in England and Wales have fallen by nearly 19,000, or 13%. Even though crime fell in the wake of the cuts, hitting a 30-year low in 2013, police cite their lower staffing numbers as a reason why Britain\u2019s crime rate increased by 9% from 2015 to 2016, with knife and gun crime rising sharply by 14% and 13% respectively.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to say \u2018I told you so,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been banging on about austerity and policing for years,\u201d said       Steve White,        the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. \u201cFor years we\u2019ve been saying that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone.\u201dMartin Hewitt,        the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, was more careful about such a link when speaking earlier this year about the rise in knife and gun crime.\u201cIt would be a naive answer to say that if you cut a significant amount out of an organization, you don\u2019t have any consequences,\u201d he said. But he stopped short of drawing a \u201ccausal link\u201d between austerity cuts and the crime rise.Prime Minister Theresa May, in a heated exchange with the leader of the opposition Labour Party over public-sector pay\u00a0Wednesday, reaffirmed the need to limit increases to bring down borrowing, but didn\u2019t rule out rises in excess of the 1% cap.\u201cOur policy on public sector pay has always recognized that we need to balance the need to be fair to public sector workers, to protect jobs in the public sector and to be fair to those who pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the balance we need to strike and we continue to assess that balance.\u201d\u2014Amanda Coletta contributed to this article.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-08 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-government-wavers-on-austerity-1499515202", "news_title": "U.K. Government Wavers on Austerity ", "keywords": "austerity,u.k. austerity ,u.k. economic recovery,u.k. economy,u.k. politics,u.k. public spending,U.K. government,Philip Hammond,Theresa May,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Peter Rejlers gets fired up when a competitor kicks him in the face in the water during a triathlon. Getting kicked in the face by his race partner? \u201cThat isn\u2019t quite as motivating,\u201d he says.Mr. Rejlers, the 50-year-old CEO of Rejlers AB, a Stockholm-based engineering consultancy, competes in a sport called swimrun. A test of endurance and friendship, swimrun races require teams of two to swim and run between and over islands while remaining within 10 meters of each other throughout the course.\u201cScuffles during the race are inevitable,\u201d he says. \u201cMy partner mentioned quitting and I threatened to carry him to the finish line.\u201dThe swimrun idea was conceived as a drunken bet between four Swedes to swim and run across more than 20 islands in Stockholm\u2019s archipelago, according to organizers. In 2006, the concept was dubbed \u00d6till\u00f6, which means island-to-island in Swedish. Today a series of swimrun races are held throughout Europe. The sport is slowly catching on in North America.Mr. Rejlers signed up for his first swimrun in 2012 at the behest of a colleague. Sprint courses span around 7 to 9 miles, but the duo went much bigger. \u00d6till\u00f6, the Swimrun World Championship demands 6.2 miles of open-water swimming and 40.4 miles of trail running between 26 islands in the archipelago around Stockholm. The longest swim is 1.1 miles and the longest run is 12.4 miles.\u201cNeither of us were really swimmers,\u201d he says. After eight hours swimming in 46-degree water with huge swell, the duo had to quit. \u201cWe were freezing,\u201d he says. \u201cI barely made it back to land.\u201d The failure fueled Mr. Rejler\u2019s competitive side. \u201cIt was the first time I ever quit something,\u201d he says.He committed to swimming in open water every day for two years. He tried competing with a new partner,       John Norling,        in 2014. \u201cUnfortunately, my race companion only practiced in a pool,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was swimming in the totally wrong direction. I had to have a rope between us in the water so he could find the way.\u201d The duo finished in 13 hours, 26 minutes and 42 seconds.\u201cI\u2019ve done an Ironman, and I still think the \u00d6till\u00f6 is one of the toughest single-day races,\u201d he says. Unlike a triathlon, athletes don\u2019t change clothes between transitions. Instead of asphalt, they\u2019re running on cliffs, slippery rocks and dirt trails. \u201cIf you only practice running on the road, you\u2019ll have great difficulty,\u201d he says. Teams of two are required for safety.Mr. Rejlers competes in shorter swimruns throughout summer and is training for his third attempt at the Sept. 4 world championship.Mr. Rejlers trains two hours a day, sometimes longer on weekends. He built a CrossFit-inspired gym in his backyard to allow more time with his children, ages 15, 13, 11, 8 and 2. \u201cWhen I run, they bicycle alongside me. Or if I swim, they might kayak next to me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they get older, I\u2019d love to have one of my children race the \u00d6till\u00f6 with me.\u201dTRX straps and ropes dangle from trees. Oversize tires and kettlebells litter the lawn. \u201cThe kids really like the slackline,\u201d he says, referring to a suspended length of flat, narrow webbing that people walk across. Mr. Rejlers often has friends and colleagues over for group workouts. He also has a gym at work. He often works out for an hour in the morning, again at lunch and sometimes at home before dinner.Mr. Rejlers lives in the seaside town of Saltsj\u00f6baden, near the world championship course, and swims daily. \u201cSwimming in open water is crucial to finishing a swimrun,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you swim in a pool, you tend to breathe one way. In the ocean, you need to breathe on both sides to take into account the waves.\u201d He runs trails near his home, often carrying a pack filled with water and food similar to what he\u2019d carry during the race. He and Mr. Norling train two to three times a month.In the summer he plays tennis and during the winter he competes in Nordic skiing races to keep up his cardio.\u201cOats porridge with banana, blueberries and strawberries keeps me full until noon, and I can order it at any breakfast meeting,\u201d he says. Lunch is often salad, sometimes topped with chicken, and steamed spinach or broccoli. \u201cI rarely eat meat and try to keep the carbs down,\u201d he says. A banana is his go-to afternoon snack. Dinner is often Thai food, extra spicy, with one glass of red wine.Swimrun athletes compete in wetsuits and swim in their sneakers. Mr. Rejlers has a Blueseventy Reaction wetsuit (retail $500) and competes in Salomon S-Lab XA Amphib sneakers (retail $180), which are made of quick-drying mesh. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a cushioned shoe that will take on water,\u201d he says. He uses Head hand paddles, which make swimming more efficient (retail from $18 and $28) and wears Head Tiger LSR mirrored goggles (retail $27). A Swimrunners pull belt is designed to combine a belt, a pull buoy and an elastic cord and retails for around $160.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend three to 12 hours swimming and running with or possibly attached to another person, you better really like them and have similar expectations,\u201d says Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Herbert Kramel, the co-race director for SwimRun NC. Mr. Kramel says finding a partner with a similar attitude is just as important as finding someone who matches your fitness.He says it\u2019s best to find a partner with similar running speed\u2014matching swim speed isn\u2019t as crucial. \u201cSince teammates in swimrun races are allowed to be connected together with an elastic tether, a weaker swimmer can easily be towed by the stronger one,\u201d he says. \u201cIn running, that is not so simple.\u201dDuring the race, the stronger runner needs to pace the team, says Nicolas Remires, a swimrun racer and endurance sports coach with Envol Coaching in Nacka, Sweden. He says knowing your partner is key to staying supportive when they\u2019re struggling.Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.comExercise on Vacation: Essential or Pure Evil?A family holiday often means bad food and slothful habits.

The new consumer is \u201ca guy who already knows a lot about fashion and has a pretty dialed-in personal style.\u201dMr. Welch and retailer       Josh Peskowitz       are two leading promoters of the post-trend aesthetic. Although they don\u2019t work together, their shared sensibility is having a major influence on the industry. Both have worked in the business for many years: Mr. Peskowitz is a former Bloomingdale\u2019s men\u2019s fashion director and co-founder of Magasin, an eclectic menswear boutique in Culver City, Calif. He has a large social media following with 16,300 Instagram followers.Mr. Peskowitz likens the post-trend customer to the type of person who buys organic, farm-raised, fair-trade, or locally-sourced food. A consumer \u201cwho cares how their clothes are made and the meaning behind these clothes.\u201dSuch a consumer is interested in high-end Italian fashion brands, not only the usual suspects such as Gucci and Prada, but obscure ones like       Massimo Piombo       and       Salvatore Piccolo.       He\u2019s likely to visit a cool, niche specialty store like Noah in New York or RTH in West Hollywood, Calif., more than a Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue.Mr. Welch and Mr. Peskowitz have introduced many of their respective acolytes and customers to idiosyncratic brands, such as Needles of Japan and       Massimo Alba       of Italy.\u201cWe wanted to have interesting stuff, one or two standard deviations away from normal,\u201d said Mr. Peskowitz about his store. Magasin carries independent, under-the-radar Italian and Japanese labels mixed with some pieces from individualistic designer labels like Dries Van Noten and Missoni.Both men believe the men\u2019s fashion pendulum has swung too far to the extreme. Among the looks that went over the top: Guys who like the post business-casual mix of tailored blazers with hoodies or track pants; dandies who wear Italian or Savile Row-inspired suits with artfully-folded pocket squares; sneakerheads; and fashion-trend daredevils early to adopt crazes like Adidas Yeezy Boost sneakers and ankle-baring trousers.\u201cI hope that we\u2019ve got the machetes out and are hacking down a different path [for men to follow]\u201d, Mr. Welch said.Andrew Gura, a 45-year-old filmmaker who lives in Silver Lake, Calif., is the type of customer Mssrs. Peskowitz and Welch are describing. He \u201cbought really heavily into the shrunken preppy thing\u201d that has been a trend for a few years but started going for a different look last year. He likes independent, artisanal stories like Magasin because they are \u201cfor people who have an inkling for something different. The creativity is what attracts me. A lot of the lines [they carry] are so unique and specialized.\u201d He now prides himself on not wearing \u201cwhat everyone else has\u201d and rarely shops at mainstream department stores, choosing Magasin, RTH and Mohawk General Store and select others instead.Brendon Babenzien, the former design director at the popular Supreme streetwear brand, started his clothing label Noah in 2015 with the goal of getting more men to shop for better quality over trends. \u201cPeople are taught to buy things based on a very surface level but a lot of the quality has gone away completely,\u201d he said. The Noah label supplies information to customers on everything from how garments are made to how much it costs to make and eschews trends.Write to Ray A.

VZ 0.21%       and             AT&T Inc.       It was a contrarian strategy that Frontier could generate steady revenue from residential internet and video services even as wireless use exploded.Instead, Frontier has been losing customers and scrambling to cover looming debt payments. The Norwalk, Conn., company recently slashed its dividend, and its shares have tumbled 69% so far this year. It plans a 1-for-15 reverse stock split on Monday, a move designed to keep its             Nasdaq                   listing.Frontier\u2019s troubles multiplied in spring 2016 after it closed a $10.5 billion deal for phone and internet lines from Verizon. The move nearly doubled Frontier\u2019s revenue and gave it millions of new customers in California, Texas and Florida. They included 1.6 million subscribers on Fios, a fiber-optic service that appeared lucrative but hid some snags below the surface.\u201cThis last acquisition was largely about acquiring fiber,\u201d a strategy the company still supports, Frontier finance chief       Perley McBride       said. \u201cIt\u2019s just integration that didn\u2019t go well. When you double in size and you don\u2019t do it well, it\u2019s sort of up front and center.\u201dMr. McBride said he doesn\u2019t expect revenue growth anytime soon from the consumer markets acquired from Verizon last year. That is a reversal from the forecast of his predecessor,       John Jureller,        who in 2015 called the revenue trends \u201cvery positive.\u201dRevenue has instead declined companywide for the past year. Frontier\u2019s 2016 loss widened to $373 million from $196 million a year earlier. The company plans to devote at least $1 billion this year on capital spending to keep its network humming.\u201cCable companies are beating the pants off Frontier,\u201d said       Jonathan Chaplin,        an analyst for New Street Research, noting that companies like             Charter Communications Inc.       have invested more heavily in marketing, network equipment and customer service in the past three years.The stiffened competition came just as Frontier faced pressure to cut costs, partly so it could pay for the networks it bought. The result was a series of network failures and complaints about customer service.Compounding that challenge, Frontier said Verizon stopped writing off overdue accounts before the deal closed, saddling the acquirer with thousands of subscribers unlikely to pay their outstanding bills.\u201cVerizon is notorious for being very good sellers of assets,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Mark Stodden. The bond-rating firm recently downgraded Frontier\u2019s credit to B2, five steps below investment grade, citing \u201csharp subscriber losses\u201d since the latest acquisition.Verizon spokesman       Bob Varettoni       said the company\u2019s \u201cobjective was to concentrate landline operations in contiguous northeast markets to enhance operational efficiency, and to sharpen our strategic focus on wireless.\u201dOther telephone companies that have acquired assets from Verizon have also suffered poor results. Verizon\u2019s former Hawaiian franchise filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 after it was sold to a private-equity firm. FairPoint Communications Inc. declared bankruptcy in 2009 after it spent $2.3 billion on Verizon landlines in New England.\u201cIf Verizon\u2019s selling assets, they\u2019re selling them for a reason,\u201d New Street\u2019s Mr. Chaplin said. In Frontier\u2019s case, \u201cVerizon had taken those markets pretty close to saturation before they sold. That\u2019s the point at which they punted the assets to Frontier.\u201dVerizon wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar business partner to Frontier, which paid $8.6 billion in 2010 to acquire the wireless carrier\u2019s landlines in 14 states.Frontier\u2019s profits were barely growing in the years leading up to its latest deal, but its performance took a turn for the worse after the deal closed. It was the Fios business that undershot executives\u2019 rosy expectations the most as cancellations climbed.Departing customers remain one of the company\u2019s most daunting challenges. \u201cFrontier must reverse its subscriber trends to demonstrate sustainability to the bond market or it will face growing refinance risk\u201d as it approaches $2.4 billion in debt payments due in 2020, Moody\u2019s wrote in a May 24 research report.Frontier\u2019s executives say the business is trending in the right direction. Customer losses, excluding canceled past-due accounts, have eased. New managers include a former executive of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Fiber hired to improve network performance.Mr. McBride said Frontier had an eye on the future when it bought landlines from Verizon and AT&T, each time gaining networks with a bigger share of high-tech fiber optics and fewer copper wires. \u201cThe company\u2019s always stuck to its knitting of fixed-line communications services rather than venturing out into mobile,\u201d he said.Another carrier,             Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc.,       also pinned its future on fiber, though it snapped up many assets for less money. Its acquisition of FairPoint closed earlier this month for $1.3 billion, including debt. Consolidated said the deal would cut the combined company\u2019s costs and support its dividend.\u201cOurselves and Consolidated are sort of the last of the traditional telcos,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t operate that way.\u201dWrite to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Frontier\u2019s Big Bets on Landlines Falter.'", "news_time": "2017-07-08 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-telecom-bet-big-on-landlines-and-lost-1499511601", "news_title": "This Telecom Bet Big on Landlines...and Lost ", "keywords": "frontier,landlines,telecom networks,telecoms,telecoms infrastructure,verizon,Verizon Communications,VZ,Frontier Communications,FTR,Alphabet Cl C,GOOG,AT&T,T,Perley McBride,financial performance,earnings,dividends,marketing,markets,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,political,general news,sciences,humanities,telecommunications,wsj pro industry - telecommunications,telecommunications technology,equipment,telecommunication services,wired telecommunications services,wireless telecommunications services,integrated communications providers,internet search engines,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "The dreaded day for commuters has arrived.From\u00a0Monday\u00a0until Labor Day, Amtrak will reduce weekday capacity at New York Penn Station by 20% so engineers can overhaul a web of rails and switches.Thousands of passengers on the Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit will be diverted to other stations where they must transfer to buses, the subway or ferries to reach their destinations. Those who continue into Penn Station face the possibility of overcrowding and delays.Here are five things to know to help get through the summer:Experiment Have you ever wondered whether your door-to-door commute would be better by bus? If you are a NJ Transit train commuter and your office is close to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, now is the time to put it to the test. LIRR commuters might want to try some of the free buses that depart from eight park-and-rides to Grand Central Terminal. Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman       Joe Lhota       has urged commuters to consider every mass-transit alternative, rather than getting in their car and clogging up roads.Do Your homework If you are thinking of gaming this temporary system, don\u2019t make assumptions.To prevent diverted NJ Transit passengers from hopping onto Montclair-Boonton Line Midtown Direct trains at Broad Street, Newark, those trains won\u2019t stop there during peak hours. And if you are thinking of taking advantage of NY Waterway\u2019s temporary ferry service from Hoboken to West 39th Street in Manhattan, be warned. It is only available to passengers with a NJ Transit rail ticket.Use Technology \u201cThe service providers\u2019 websites are better than ever,\u201d says Joshua Crandall, founder of Clever Commute, a free mobile app that tracks suburban commuter lines across the region.The MTA and NJ Transit set up dedicated webpages for the summer commute at\u00a0lirrsummerschedule.com\u00a0and NJTransit.com/TheUpdate. Their mobile apps provide real-time service updates and schedules.There also are services such as Clever Commute that pull real-time data from rail providers and combine it with crowdsourced information from commuters. If you are an LIRR commuter diverted to Jamaica or Atlantic Terminal, you can check the status of every subway line at a glance using Datadog\u2019s new MTA Service Checker at\u00a0mtaservicechecker.com.Choose the Right PATH Only four NJ Transit Morris & Essex Lines Midtown Direct trains, which arrive at Penn Station before\u00a07 a.m., survived the summer cull. Remaining trains will be diverted to Hoboken where the Port Authority is braced for an additional 7,000 passengers to flow into the PATH system between\u00a07 a.m. and 9 a.m.PATH is adding an extra seven trains during that period on the 33rd Street line, each capable of carrying 1,100 passengers. Even so, a PATH spokesman suggested that, if possible, commuters should try to avoid the peak between\u00a08:15 a.m. and 8:45 a.m.Is Penn Station Safe? Amtrak officials say\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0derailment of a NJ Transit train occurred in the same area at the western end of the station where the repair work is being carried out. The station is safe, and the work is necessary to ensure reliability and resiliency, they contend. \u201cIncidents like last night reinforce our decision to accelerate renewal work this summer,\u201d Scot Naparstek, Amtrak\u2019s chief operating officer, told reporters Friday \u201cThis work needs to be done now.\u201dWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'How to Cope as Work At Penn Station Starts.'", "news_time": "2017-07-08 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-tips-to-help-get-through-the-penn-station-disruption-this-summer-1499511601", "news_title": "Five Tips to Help Get Through the Penn Station Disruption ", "keywords": "amtrak,lirr,long island railroad,metropolitan transit authority,mta,nj transit,penn station,port authority,port authority bus terminal,Amtrak,output,production,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport,railroads,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,railroad passenger transport,transportation,logistics"}]
