Merkel said she wanted the balance of power to be maintained  sensibly  in the region, and that combating terrorism would be on the agenda when G20 leaders meet next month in Hamburg. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a  high-level  sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the U.S. Department of State's efforts to ease heightening tensions and a blockade of the Gulf nation by Arab states and others.

The nation of Qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,  Trump told reporters at the White House.   So we had a decision to make, do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action. We have to stop the funding of terrorism. I decided ... the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding,  Trump said, adding that he helped plan the Qatar action with Arab leaders after a recent summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A senior administration official told Reuters earlier this week that the United States had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis in Riyadh during Trump's visit last month that they would sever ties with Qatar. The crisis is a major diplomatic test for the United States, which is a close ally of countries on both sides. Trump has called key players in the region since they severed ties with Qatar on Monday.  The Trump administration has given mixed signals on whether to isolate Qatar or bring it into talks with other Gulf nations. The confrontation in the region intensified on Friday as Arab states tightened their squeeze on Qatar by putting dozens of figures with links to the country on terrorism blacklists, while Qatar's ally Turkey rushed to its side with plans to send troops. The Pentagon said the blockade was hindering U.S. ability to plan for long-term operations in the region. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces and an important base for the fight against Islamic State. It is the U.S. Air Force's largest base in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he expected all parties to find a resolution.  We call on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar,  he said in Washington. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department that the crisis, which has cut transportation links and trade, had begun hurting ordinary people in Qatar, and that it was impairing business dealings and harming the U.S. battle against the Islamic State militant group. A picture on Facebook showed a supermarket displaying food from Turkey including milk, eggs and chicken. Tillerson demanded that Qatar, as well as the other countries, take steps to curtail support for terrorism. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have accused Doha of supporting extremist groups, but Tillerson suggested that all sides needed to do more. Related CoverageMerkel says all Gulf nations, Iran, Turkey must work to ease Qatar crisis The emir of Qatar has made progress in halting financial support and expelling terrorist elements from his country, but he must do more and he must do it more quickly,  Tillerson said.  Others must also continue to eliminate factions of support for violent organizations within their own borders.  On Trump’s Air Force One flight to New Jersey, a senior White House official told reporters that Trump and Tillerson were on the  same page  on Qatar.  The United States wants a resolution to the situation but it wants a resolution on terms consistent with the principles the president laid out in Riyadh,” the official said, adding that Trump was concerned about the humanitarian impact of the crisis but also Qatar's support of  terrorist finance.  Riyadh, Cairo and their allies have accused Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, of supporting militant Islamist movements across the region. They have imposed what Qatar said was a blockade of shipping and air traffic and closed Qatar's only land border, causing panic buying at supermarkets and provoking confusion and anxiety across the population. Qatar, which has developed an assertive foreign policy over the past decade, denied that it supports militants and said it was helping to reduce the threat of terrorism by backing groups that fight poverty and seek political reform. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani called the moves by Arab neighbors and others  clear violations of international law and international humanitarian law.  They will not have a positive impact on the region but a negative one,  the minister said during a visit to Germany. A view shows buildings in Doha, Qatar, June 9, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonThe United Arab Emirates said on Friday that Qatar must acknowledge concerns about its  troubling support for extremism  and  re-examine its regional policies.    This will provide the necessary basis for any discussions,  UAE ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba said in a statement on Friday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.  Along with our American colleagues but above all our colleagues in the region, we must try to find solutions, especially lifting the sea and air blockades,  Gabriel told reporters.  The Hour of Diplomacy  Qatar has vowed to ride out the isolation imposed on it by fellow Arab states and said it would not compromise its sovereignty over foreign policy to resolve the region's biggest diplomatic crisis in years. One U.S. official said that while Qatar needs to do more to combat terrorist financing, it was inaccurate to single out that Gulf nation. “The (counter terrorist-financing) challenges they face aren’t unique to them,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There are other countries in the region that grapple with the same issues.” Qatar is home to 2.7 million people but only about 300,000 citizens. Most of its population is comprised of foreign workers who helped build the tiny finger off the Arabian Peninsula into a natural gas exporting powerhouse, crowned with skyscrapers. Projects include soccer stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Armed Qatari gunboats patrolled the corniche of the capital Doha on Friday.  Tiny Qatar has played an outsized role as a sponsor of factions in wars and revolutions across the Middle East under its 37-year-old ruler, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and his father Hamad who stepped down in 2013 after 18 years in power. With supply chains disrupted and concern mounting about economic turbulence, banks and firms in Gulf Arab states were trying to keep business links to Qatar open and avoid a costly firesale of assets. The riyal currency has tumbled and the cost of insuring Qatari debt against default has risen. Clashing Over Brotherhood Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain added 59 people to terrorist blacklists, among them 18 Qataris, including Abdullah bin Khalid Al Thani, a former interior minister and member of Qatar's royal family. The Qatari government said the move  reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact .  Our position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement - a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authors,  it said in a statement. Those on the list, including the former interior minister, could not be reached for comment. Many of the others added to the list are figures associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who have made Qatar a base, including Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi. Some are prominent jihadists who have fought in Libya and Syria. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, whose AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics and who has voiced support for the Brotherhood, signaled his firm backing for Qatar by swiftly signing a law to send troops to a Turkish base there. Turkey will send warplanes and warships to Qatar after an initial deployment of troops, the mass-circulation Hurriyet newspaper said on its website. Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on the report, but Hurriyet said there were plans to send some 200 to 250 soldiers within two months.

The right-handed pitcher had played independent league ball before he was drafted, but he never made the majors with the Rangers. He was traded to the Washington Nationals in 2010 and he lost 17 games at Triple-A Syracuse two years later. Roark faced Texas for the second time Friday night and it wasn't pretty, as he gave up 11 hits and five runs (two earned) in six innings as the Rangers defeated the Nationals 5-2. The Washington pitcher was upstaged by Andrew Cashner, who gave up just one run in seven innings to get the win.  He was battling,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said of Roark.  But we didn't get much going on offense against Cashner.  To make matters worse, the Nationals made three errors, two by young shortstop Trea Turner.  We didn't play very well on defense. We gave them a couple of runs,  Baker said.  It wasn't a very good day at the ballpark.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at NationalsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchCatcher Jonathan Lucroy had three hits and three RBIs for the Rangers.  He has been swinging the bat well,  said Texas manager Jeff Banister, who said Lucroy has been getting the barrel of the bat out front on offspeed pitches. The third-place Rangers (28-32) improved to just 10-18 on the road and the first-place Nationals (38-22) are 17-10 at home. Former San Diego pitcher Cashner (3-5), who gave up 11 hits and five runs in his last start, allowed six hits Friday with two walks and four strikeouts. Alex Claudio struck out two in the eighth inning and Matt Bush got the last two outs for his seventh save after Stephen Drew drove in a run when his popup fell between two outfielders in the ninth.  He has been great all year,  Bush said of Cashner.  He has been a huge pickup for us.  The Rangers loaded the bases in the sixth, but Roark (6-3) fanned Elvis Andrus for the second out. Roark then walked Nomar Mazara to force in a run and make it 4-0. Washington got on the board in the sixth as Anthony Rendon had an RBI single with two outs to make it 4-1. But he was thrown out at second on a relay to end the inning. Rougned Odor (two hits) lined a homer to right to start the seventh to make it 5-1 and chase Roark. Mazara and Delino DeShields, a Maryland native, also had two hits for Texas. The Nationals entered Friday with a team batting average of .274 and 89 homers -- both marks led the National League. Ryan Zimmerman, Matt Wieters and Daniel Murphy had two hits for Washington. Roark and Cashner settled into a pitcher's duel as the game progressed quickly in the early innings on a crisp spring night. The Rangers had three singles in a row to begin the third, with Lucroy delivering an RBI single to make it 1-0. His hit scored Andrus, who led off with an infield single and went to second on a base hit by Mazara. Lucroy gave Texas a cushion with a two-run homer to left with two outs in the fifth off Roark. That made the score 3-0 as the Rangers scored two unearned runs in the inning, as Shin-Soo Choo reached on an error at first by Zimmerman to begin the inning. Roark won 16 games last year but has struggled this season.  He gave up a lot of hits but very few (earned) runs,  Baker said of Roark. NOTES: The Texas Rangers recalled INF/OF Jurickson Profar from Triple-A Round Rock on Friday and sent LHP Dario Alvarez to Round Rock. Profar will be in his second stint with Texas this season and was with the team from Opening Day to April 30. Alvarez was 2-0 with a 3.27 ERA in 14 games with the Rangers. Profar started at third base and was 0-for-5 ... Texas INF Adrian Beltre was not in the starting lineup and did not play. He hurt his foot in a game Tuesday and did not play Wednesday. The Rangers were off Thursday ...

That is a large audience for a daytime event, though it is short of the 30.6 million who tuned in to President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. (Graphic: Ratings for big televised events tmsnrt.rs/2sLLyPJ) Nielsen's estimates include people watching on 10 U.S. broadcast and cable television networks, but not those who streamed the congressional hearing on computers or mobile phones. Broadcasters interrupted regular programming to air nearly three hours of live coverage of Comey's remarks about his dealings with Trump before the president fired him in May. The tally was impressive for an event that aired during the work day, when typically only events like state funerals and royal weddings draw mass viewing, said Jeffrey Jones, director of journalism's Peabody Awards and a professor at the University of Georgia. Jones was traveling and saw crowds gathered around TVs in Atlanta's airport to watch the hearing.   Politics is quite often about theater and drama, and this was a classic showdown,  he said.

The party with the most female lawmakers is the opposition Labour party with nearly half of its elected members of parliament (MPs) women, while the smaller Green Party's only elected MP is a woman. However the announcement on Friday that Prime Minister Theresa May would form a new government with support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), after her Conservative party fell short of a parliamentary majority, raised concerns from LGBT and women's rights campaigners. The DUP, one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe, has fought to maintain tight restrictions on abortion and opposes gay marriage. The vote returned a small increase in women MPs from 191 in the last election in 2015 after which Britain ranked 46th in an index of parliaments based on the number of female lawmakers, behind many European countries and others such as Rwanda, Cuba and Belarus.  We are moving forward at a snail's pace and this is embarrassingly slow,  Sam Smethers, chief executive of women's rights organization the Fawcett Society, said in a statement.  If the UK only improves by this much at each election, we will not see equal representation in parliament until 2062,  she said. The election saw a record number of openly gay, lesbian or bisexual people elected, and a record number of transgender people stand for election. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights groups said there could be as many as 44 openly gay, lesbian or bisexual elected MPs.  Representation of LGBT people in positions of power is extremely important. It demonstrates how much progress Britain has made,  Bex Stinson, head of trans inclusion for LGBT rights charity Stonewall told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Having LGBT people visible in public life helps foster an inclusive society, and provides strong role models for those who don't yet feel able to be themselves and for young LGBT people.  But several members of Northern Ireland's DUP have come under fire after making homophobic comments. In 2015, Northern Ireland health minister and DUP senior member Jim Wells resigned after police started an investigation into comments he made linking gay marriage to child abuse.  You don't bring a child up in a homosexual relationship. That child is far more likely to be abused and neglected,  Wells told a campaign event in the last election. Many LGBT rights supporters took to social media to voice their concern.  We share the concerns of countless LGBT people, and our friends, of all political persuasions who are deeply anxious about the potential Democratic Unionist Party involvement in the new government,  Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, wrote in a blog.  It's important to remember that our values are defined as much by who we stand with as what we stand for,  she added. Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Ros Russell.

A peace deal signed last year between the government and the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) ended half a century of conflict. The accord has seen about 7,000 FARC fighters leave their strongholds and gather in 26 demobilization zones where so far rebels have surrendered about a third of their weapons to the United Nations. But now a new battle is on: to preserve Colombia's forests that are under threat from farmers seeking grazing land and criminal gangs cutting down trees for illegal gold mining. Colombia is home to a swathe of rainforest roughly the size of Germany and England combined. It is in war-torn areas like Caqueta where deforestation is on the rise following the FARC demobilization, and where Colombia - in partnership with Norway - is focusing efforts to halt forest loss with a scheme that offers former fighters training and jobs as forest guardians. As FARC fighters abandon their jungle strongholds, once no-go conflict areas are opening up for business. Farmers are pushing deeper into forests, cutting down more trees to make way for grazing land for cattle and agriculture.  We are seeing early signs of this already in Colombia so that is definitely a concern,  Vidar Helgesen, Norway's environment minister, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  With peace and with the prospect of FARC handing in their arms, existing farmers are ... more offensive in their approaches, they are more daring in that they are also expanding and engaging in practices that are not sustainable,  Helgesen said this week on a visit to Colombia to launch the new forest conservation program. Norway is donating about $3.5 million over two years to the pilot project it hopes will stem deforestation by offering paid jobs to ex-FARC fighters and communities to safeguard forests. When forests are degraded or destroyed, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, with deforestation accounting for 10 to 15 percent of carbon emissions worldwide.  We hope this project can be the way for more activities whereby peace comes with green dividends,  Helgesen said. Ex-Combatants  About 1,100 ex-FARC fighters, as well as villagers in Caqueta, will be trained in how to track and report illegal logging, along with sustainable farming methods and eco-tourism projects - a way of helping them integrate back into civilian society. Some jobs will be offered as forest guardians in national parks, others in local government environment agencies.  Reintegration is very important for the return to civilian life and when giving economic opportunities there's a bigger chance that the reconciliation process will succeed,  Helgesen said. Joshua Mitrotti, head of Colombia's reintegration agency, said integrating thousands of ex-guerrillas into society requires access to education and training, and on businesses and rural communities willing to give them a second chance.  This program is the first initiative that combines environmental protection with reincorporation .. while protecting land and creating income generation,  Mitrotti said. Many former fighters have spent most of their lives fighting in the jungle and have few other skills and little education. The first challenge is getting ex-fighters back in schools, said Christian Visnes at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), the aid agency carrying out the project on the ground. A survey of about 6,300 FARC fighters by NRC this year showed about 10 percent are illiterate and only two in five have finished primary school. By providing skills training and jobs, rebels are less likely to pick up a weapon again and join other criminal groups.  It's about creating opportunities to take away the incentive to become part of another (criminal) group,  said Visnes, Latin America director of NRC. Paid to Protect Forests Colombia has declared the goal of zero net deforestation by 2020 and halting the loss of all natural forest by 2030. Norway is also helping Colombia and other countries to stem forest less through the United Nations program aimed at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).  Countries participating in REDD+ receive payouts for meeting verified emission reduction targets for slowing deforestation over several years. The payments are usually distributed to farmers, grassroots communities and indigenous groups working on forest protection. Under the REDD+ program, Colombia on Wednesday received a payment of $10 million from Norway aimed at promoting sustainable rural development in war-torn regions. This follows the first payment of $6 million last year from Norway, Britain and Germany for reducing emissions from deforestation in its Amazon rainforest in 2013 and 2014. Rich from offshore oil, Norway is the biggest donor to REDD+, and is also financing projects to help protect forests from Ethiopia and Liberia to Peru and Guyana, as well as projects worth $1 billion each for Indonesia and Brazil. But the program has struggled to attract private funding and governments need to do more to get businesses on board, Helgesen said. According to a 2015 report by U.S.-based environmental group Forest Trends, REDD+ is  significantly short  of estimates indicating at least $20 billion per year is needed to reduce global deforestation by 50 percent.  We are way short of where we should be in terms of funding,  Helgesen said.

(Reuters) - During his trial on sex assault charges, Bill Cosby has mostly remained silent in court and avoided reporters' questions. But when fans have called out to him outside the courtroom, the 79-year-old has responded with attempts at humor. Mugging in front of the cameras this week after a fan said it was her birthday, he asked,  How old?  When the woman replied,  49,  he did a mock stumble in an apparent reference to a famous standup special he did about the challenges of nearing 50 years of age. On another occasion, Cosby responded to a fan by offering up the famous  Hey, hey, hey  catchphrase from Fat Albert, the animated character he voiced in the 1970s. Inside the courtroom, he has been largely expressionless, his only reactions an occasional chuckle at a courtroom joke or a shake of the head as two of his accusers testified that he drugged and sexually abused them. On Wednesday, in the midst of testimony from the main accuser, Andrea Constand, Cosby was walking down a hallway when a court officer spotted someone using a cell phone.  Put that phone away!  the officer thundered, worried the person may have been trying to snap a photo. Cosby, who is legally blind, jumped at the shout before pointing his cane like a weapon at the officer and saying,  What'd you say?  as observers tittered. Cosby's career has been derailed by dozens of sexual assault allegations from women stretching back decades, all of which he has denied.

His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told Reuters that Cosby got into his vehicle after a fan interaction outside court and told him,  Restoration of legacy,  showing his reputation is on his mind. In an interview before the trial, Cosby told a radio host that he hopes to resume touring afterward.  I still feel that I have an awful lot to offer in terms of my writing, in terms of my performance,  he said. A handful of protesters have at times stood outside the courthouse, yelling  guilty  as Cosby walked by. Conspicuously absent from the proceedings thus far has been Cosby's wife of 53 years, Camille Cosby. Instead, he has been accompanied each day by actors and comedian friends, including Keisha Knight Pulliam, the woman who played his youngest daughter Rudy Huxtable on the 1980s television comedy,  The Cosby Show.  Cosby's spokesman Wyatt said Camille Cosby continues to stand by her husband and may still attend the trial at some point, though he added that Bill Cosby wants to protect his family from the media frenzy. Wyatt, who is staying at Cosby's Pennsylvania home where Constand says she was assaulted in 2004, said Cosby recognizes the gravity of his situation but has remained confident and in good spirits.  He's Bill Cosby,  Wyatt told Reuters.  He's the greatest comedian of all time. Trust me, he takes this matter very seriously.

(Reuters) - Jurors at Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial on Friday saw the entertainer's own sworn statements that he gave young women sedatives before engaging in sexual activity with them. Pennsylvania prosecutors completed their case against Cosby after five days of testimony aimed at portraying the comedian as a serial predator. The trial was set to resume on Monday with the defense's case. Cosby, 79, previously said he does not expect to testify, though his spokesman Andrew Wyatt said that could still change. The jury in Norristown, Pennsylvania, saw excerpts from a deposition Cosby gave more than a decade ago in which he acknowledged obtaining seven prescriptions for the sedative Quaalude in the 1970s so he could give them to women.  Was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?  Cosby was asked.  Yes,  he answered, though he denied ever doing so without their knowledge. Cosby said he avoided taking the drug himself so as not to become  sleepy.

Constand has said Cosby suggested that the pills, which she said left her barely conscious and unable to resist, were herbal. Dozens of women have leveled similar accusations against the star of the 1980s television comedy  The Cosby Show.  All but Constand's are too old to support criminal charges.

The prosecution's key witnesses, Constand and another accuser, Kelly Johnson, testified that Cosby gave them unidentified pills to help them  relax.   Together with Cosby's admissions regarding the sedatives, prosecutors hope the jury will conclude that Cosby employed a familiar pattern with Constand: offering mentorship to a younger woman and then using drugs to facilitate a sexual assault.

Defense lawyers have focused on discrepancies in Constand's and Johnson's accounts. They have also emphasized that Constand maintained frequent contact with Cosby following the incident, which Constand has said was necessary for her job. Prosecutors on Friday called a psychologist, Veronique Valliere, to explain why sexual trauma victims sometimes have trouble recalling details and act in ways that can appear illogical. But Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle showed jurors a Facebook post after Cosby's case was bound over for trial in which Valliere wrote,  Victory! The case goes on.

The ruling gives Temer some breathing room but will not end a political crisis enveloping the beleaguered center-right leader. He is being investigated separately by federal prosecutors for corruption, obstruction of justice and racketeering.  We cannot be changing the president of the Republic all the time, even if the people want to,  said the court's chief judge, Gilmar Mendes. Mendes, who backed the impeachment of Rousseff, said the country should not expect the court to solve the current political crisis. The electoral court, known as the TSE, voted 4-3 to acquit the Rousseff-Temer ticket of wrongdoing. That avoided the annulment of their election and the removal of Temer from office. He took over a year ago following Rousseff's impeachment in the midst of Brazil's worst recession on record. In a decisive move, that same majority had ruled on Thursday to not allow as evidence in the case plea-bargain testimony from 77 executives of the Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] construction firm, which is at the center of a vast political graft scheme.  Those witnesses told investigators they funneled millions of dollars in illegal funds into the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket. But the testimony was made more than a year after the beginning of the case that concluded Friday, and without it Temer's lawyers argued there was no proof of wrongdoing.          The acquittal will help Temer, whose government's poll ratings are in the single digits, retain key coalition allies who will support approval in Congress of his fiscal reform  agenda. The austerity measures aim to bring a gaping budget deficit under control and restore investor confidence.

Investigations 'Just Starting' Political analysts said the acquittal was disastrous for the credibility of Brazil's judiciary, the government institution that polls show is most trusted by Brazilians. Some warned it would add to growing disillusionment with democracy.  This catastrophic ruling prolongs the survival of a government that has lost all credibility and can no longer  govern,  said Roberto Romano, professor of ethics and political philosophy at Campinas University. He said it would add to a small but worrying trend of Brazilians favoring a return to military rule.

The leader is likely to soon face separate charges in the case involving allegations of receiving bribes and condoning the payment of hush money handed over to a potential witness in a massive graft scandal, investigators have told Reuters.  The Supreme Court approved the investigation into the president late last month.  But to put him on trial, the charges against the president would have to be approved by two-thirds of the lower chamber of Congress, where Temer's coalition retains a majority. Slideshow (3 Images)With an election year approaching in 2018, however, the governing coalition's majority could shrink if lawmakers break away, concerned about voters punishing them for being part of a government overwhelmingly perceived in polls as corrupt. Acquittal by the electoral court could help Temer's main coalition ally, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), convince its younger members who want to bolt from the government to stay put and help push unpopular reforms through Congress. But political volatility will not die down.  The days ahead will be very difficult for Temer. The corruption investigations are just starting,  said Flavia Bahia, professor at the CERS law school and FGV think tank in Rio de Janeiro.  The government can't be sure of its allies anymore.  The separate investigation by prosecutors into Temer includes a secret recording of a conversation he had earlier this year with a former top executive of meatpacker JBS SA.  In it, the president appears to condone paying bribes to an imprisoned former lawmaker to keep him from turning state's witness and providing potentially devastating testimony about graft. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and insists he will never resign. But a one-time top aide to the leader, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, was caught on a police video released last month picking up a bag filled with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash from a JBS executive, allegedly meant to silence the potential witness. Temer aides told Reuters they worry that if Rocha Loures decides to reach a plea-bargain deal with investigators, it will strengthen any charges filed against the president.

And yet within three months, militants have breached security at the very heart of the nation, killing at least 17 people. This week's attacks at parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini have exposed shortcomings among the Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) which was supposed to be protecting these potent symbols of Iran's revolution. They have also undermined Tehran's belief that by backing offensives against Islamic State across the Middle East, it can keep the militant Sunni group away from Iran. Undaunted, officials say Iran will step up the strategy, which includes sending fighters to battle Islamic State in Syria and Iraq alongside allied Shi'ite militia groups. And with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the IRGC blaming Saudi Arabia for the attacks, tensions are only likely to deepen between the two arch rivals competing for influence in an already chaotic region. Riyadh denies the charges, describing Tehran instead as  the number one state sponsor of terrorism . Wednesday's killings in Tehran by Iranian members of Islamic State drew a shocked response similar to that in Western countries when they too have been attacked by locally-born jihadists. Now Iranians are worrying about how many others are out there, planning similar assaults. One senior Iranian official told Reuters that Islamic State had established a network of support in the country, and suggested that members' motivation was as much political and economic as to do with Sunni radicals' belief that Shi'ites are infidels.  Sunni extremism is spreading in Iran like many other countries. And not all of these young people who join extremist groups are necessarily religious people,  said the official, who asked not to be named.  But the establishment is well aware of the problem and is trying to tackle it.  Most Iranian Sunnis, who form up to 10 percent of the population, reject Islamic State's ideology. But some young Sunnis seem to regard policies of Shi'ite-led Iran as oppressive at home or aggressive abroad, such as in Iraq and Syria, pushing more of them into the arms of jihadist groups. Iran has been trying to stem the spread of radicalism into Sunni majority regions, which are usually less economically developed. Authorities said 1,500 young Iranians were prevented from joining Islamic State in 2016. Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan province, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the Balouch minority and has long been a hotbed of Sunni insurgents. Two Sunni groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been fighting the IRGC for over a decade. This has mostly been in remote areas but some say it was almost inevitable that violence would eventually spread to Tehran, as it did this week.  It's not the attacks that are surprising. It's that Iran has been able to avoid one for so long. The attacks were a wake-up call for Iran's security apparatus,  said senior Iran analyst Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group.  But so too will they probably serve as one for jihadists, who will be encouraged to exploit Iran's vulnerabilities.

Tasnim News Agency/Handout via REUTERS Strategic Folly  Since its creation shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution, the IRGC has functioned as Iran's most powerful internal and external security force, with a sophisticated intelligence and surveillance network. The IRGC has vowed revenge on Islamic State - known by its opponents under the Arab acronym of Daesh - but a top security official said this won't be easy.  The attacks showed the vulnerability of our security system, at the borders and within Iran,  the official said, asking not to be named. However, he added:  Many planned attacks by Daesh have been foiled by our security forces in the past years. Many terrorist cells were dismantled. Our Guards have been vigilant.  Syrian rebels and Iraqi forces are closing in on Islamic State in those countries, and the official said the group appeared to have tried to strike back in Tehran. A boy is evacuated during an attack on the Iranian parliament in central Tehran, Iran, June 7, 2017. Omid Vahabzadeh/TIMA via REUTERS The attacks are the result of Daesh being weakened in the region. They blame Iran for that ... But Iran will not abandon its fight against terrorism,  he added. Open discussion of security vulnerabilities is taboo in Iran. However, Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior Iran analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, criticized the idea that Syria and Iraq could form an effective  first line of defense for Iran.  Iranian officials have long justified their country's active military presence in Iraq and Syria as a way to keep the homeland safe,  he said.  Wednesday's attacks expose the folly of that strategy.  Spiraling Tensions A senior official, who also asked not to be named, said the attacks would push Iran toward  a harsher regional policy . Sanam Vakil, associate fellow with Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Programme, dismissed any expectation that Tehran might try to ease spiraling tensions with Riyadh.  If we are expecting to see any change in Iran's regional policy or a retreat in any way - that is not going to happen,  she said. Newly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani has said the attacks will make Iran more united. Analysts, however, believe they will exacerbate domestic tensions between Rouhani, a pragmatist, and his rivals among hardline clergy and the IRGC.  They have repeatedly criticized Rouhani's attempts to improve relations with the outside world.  Rouhani has generally lost out to the hardliners, who through the IRGC's Al Quds force - expeditionary units which are fighting in Iraq and Syria as well as organizing Shi'ite allies - continue to call the shots. In the view of the hardliners' critics, they are helping to drive alienated Sunnis toward militant groups.

Schwartzel collected five birdies in his first 11 holes en route to a nine-under 131 halfway total, matched by Colombian Sebastian Munoz and American Chez Reavie at TPC Southwind in Memphis, Tennessee. They led by one stroke from American Stewart Cink, while Australian former world number one Adam Scott surged to within four strokes with a late rush to match the day’s best round, a 64. But world number nine Rickie Fowler, the top-ranked player in the field, can get an early start to Erin Hills for next week’s U.S. Open in Wisconsin after missing the cut with rounds of 74 and 70. Schwartzel, who finished a quiet third at the Masters in April at Augusta National, continued a run of good form which he credited to improvements on the greens.  Last year I wasn’t putting well,” he told Golf Channel. “I identified the problem and switched putters, thought about all the things I did as a junior. I used to putt really well as a junior.  It feels like I’ve got my own natural stroke back, stays lower to the ground and scoring is showing.  Munoz, who shared the lead after the first round, stayed at the top of the leaderboard after a tidy 67 that included a lone bogey.  I’ve been pretty consistent with my tee shots, putting the ball in the fairway and getting the ball on the green, capitalising on some putts and if not just tap in for par,  said the PGA Tour rookie. He has found it difficult to get into a competitive rhythm this season because his low ranking reduces his playing opportunities, but says he is finally starting to find his comfort zone. Scott, meanwhile, was closer to the cut line than the lead for much of the day, but he stormed home with an eagle and two birdies in the final five holes to jump to equal 11th. A seven-iron that did everything but go in at the par-three 14th set the tone for his hot finish. “I’ll take a tap-in (birdie) any day on that hole,” said the 2013 Masters champion. “If I made a few more putts it would have been a real special round.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-stjude-idUSKBN191027"},

The first-to-five playoff final begins on Saturday in Bermuda's Great Sound. The winner will challenge holders Oracle Team USA for the oldest trophy in international sport in the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Match starting on June 17.

Friday's race against the Japanese crew was tight, hinging on a tactical mistake by their skipper Dean Barker who was forced to a standstill by Outteridge when he tried to get past them in the middle of their head-to-head encounter.  That was obviously the key moment,  an elated Outteridge said of the way the race unfolded in high winds and choppy seas. Although Barker, who was skipper of the losing New Zealand America's Cup crew in San Francisco in 2013, tried everything he could to catch Sweden, he was unable to close the gap in time and Artemis Racing romped home with a comfortable lead.  We are disappointed not to be going into the final, but we are very proud of what we have achieved,  Barker said in a live television interview on board SoftBank Team Japan's sleek black 50-foot (15 meter) catamaran.

The 31-year-old Spaniard, ready to reclaim his Roland Garros crown after a two-year hiatus, dispatched the sixth seed in little more than two hours and is on the verge of becoming the first player to win the same grand slam tournament 10 times. He faces Swiss Stan Wawrinka in Sunday's showpiece match in what will be only his second clash with the Swiss at Roland Garros -- having won convincingly four years ago.  Now remains one match against a very tough opponent. He played a very tough match this afternoon, so he will be full of confidence for Sunday,  Nadal told reporters referring to Wawrinka's five-set victory over top seed Andy Murray.  He's a dangerous player because he can hit the ball very hard. I need to play aggressive, if not I'll be in big trouble.  Thiem, like fourth seed Nadal, had reached the semi-final without dropping a set and had trounced Serbian defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. Related CoverageNine is fine for Nadal? Really?But after starting brightly in the early evening sunshine, his challenge disappeared into the encroaching shadows on Court Philippe Chatrier -- an arena on which Nadal has never lost a semi-final or final since his debut in 2005. Nadal has dropped only 29 games to reach the final -- surpassing his previous best of 35 in 2012 and only two more than Bjorn Borg's record set in 1978. Swedish great Borg might still hold that mark but Nadal has long since left the six-times French Open champion behind in the Roland Garros record books. Not that he cares too much for that. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 9, 2017   Spain's Rafael Nadal at the net with Austria's Dominic Thiemin after the match    Reuters / Benoit Tessier I think I don't need to make more history, no?  Nadal said.  It's enough. Nine is more than good. Today is not the moment to think about (winning the 10th).  After Nadal's limp exit to Djokovic in 2015 and the wrist injury that cut short his challenge last year, the Spanish claycourt king looks hungrier than ever to extend his domination on the clay surface where he has no rival. Third seed Wawrinka's epic battle against Murray had delayed Nadal's appearance until nearly 6pm local time and there was a sense of  after the Lord Mayor's show  as the day's second semi-final began. A break for Thiem in the opening game quickly concentrated minds -- although any prospect of a tussle to match the drama of the day's first installment did not last long as Nadal recovered with two breaks of his own to take the opening set. Thiem, whose elegant single-handed backhand had little effect throughout the contest, had break points early in the second set but Nadal slammed the door shut. The Spaniard, whose only defeat on the red dirt this year came against Thiem in Rome, then broke with a clubbing forehand and lost only three more points on serve as he sealed the set. Thiem's hopes of emulating compatriot Thomas Muster's French Open triumph in 1995 were over in a flash as Nadal raced through the third set in 28 one-sided minutes.  Of course I'm disappointed that, first of all, I just didn't play the way I can play. I was pretty far away from my best tennis today,  Thiem said.

The ruling gives Temer some breathing room but will not end a political crisis enveloping the beleaguered center-right leader. He is being investigated separately by federal prosecutors for corruption, obstruction of justice and racketeering.  We cannot be changing the president of the Republic all the time, even if the people want to,  said the court's chief judge, Gilmar Mendes. Mendes, who backed the impeachment of Rousseff, said the country should not expect the court to solve the current political crisis. The electoral court, known as the TSE, voted 4-3 to acquit the Rousseff-Temer ticket of wrongdoing. That avoided the annulment of their election and the removal of Temer from office. He took over a year ago following Rousseff's impeachment in the midst of Brazil's worst recession on record. In a decisive move, that same majority had ruled on Thursday to not allow as evidence in the case plea-bargain testimony from 77 executives of the Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] construction firm, which is at the center of a vast political graft scheme.  Those witnesses told investigators they funneled millions of dollars in illegal funds into the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket. But the testimony was made more than a year after the beginning of the case that concluded Friday, and without it Temer's lawyers argued there was no proof of wrongdoing.          The acquittal will help Temer, whose government's poll ratings are in the single digits, retain key coalition allies who will support approval in Congress of his fiscal reform  agenda. The austerity measures aim to bring a gaping budget deficit under control and restore investor confidence. Related CoverageBrazil's Temer sees healthy institutions in electoral court rulingAlexandre Parola, a spokesman for Temer, said after the ruling that the president viewed the decision as an example of effective institutions keeping the country's democracy working. Investigations 'Just Starting' Political analysts said the acquittal was disastrous for the credibility of Brazil's judiciary, the government institution that polls show is most trusted by Brazilians. Some warned it would add to growing disillusionment with democracy.  This catastrophic ruling prolongs the survival of a government that has lost all credibility and can no longer  govern,  said Roberto Romano, professor of ethics and political philosophy at Campinas University. He said it would add to a small but worrying trend of Brazilians favoring a return to military rule. The Statue of Justice is seen in front of the federal supreme court in Brasilia, Brazil June 9, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoTemer, a third of his Cabinet and dozens of powerful congressmen are under investigation for corruption. The leader is likely to soon face separate charges in the case involving allegations of receiving bribes and condoning the payment of hush money handed over to a potential witness in a massive graft scandal, investigators have told Reuters.  The Supreme Court approved the investigation into the president late last month.  But to put him on trial, the charges against the president would have to be approved by two-thirds of the lower chamber of Congress, where Temer's coalition retains a majority. Slideshow (3 Images)With an election year approaching in 2018, however, the governing coalition's majority could shrink if lawmakers break away, concerned about voters punishing them for being part of a government overwhelmingly perceived in polls as corrupt. Acquittal by the electoral court could help Temer's main coalition ally, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), convince its younger members who want to bolt from the government to stay put and help push unpopular reforms through Congress. But political volatility will not die down.  The days ahead will be very difficult for Temer. The corruption investigations are just starting,  said Flavia Bahia, professor at the CERS law school and FGV think tank in Rio de Janeiro.  The government can't be sure of its allies anymore.  The separate investigation by prosecutors into Temer includes a secret recording of a conversation he had earlier this year with a former top executive of meatpacker JBS SA.  In it, the president appears to condone paying bribes to an imprisoned former lawmaker to keep him from turning state's witness and providing potentially devastating testimony about graft. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and insists he will never resign. But a one-time top aide to the leader, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, was caught on a police video released last month picking up a bag filled with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash from a JBS executive, allegedly meant to silence the potential witness. Temer aides told Reuters they worry that if Rocha Loures decides to reach a plea-bargain deal with investigators, it will strengthen any charges filed against the president.

The 18-year-old had an even better one on Friday as he realized a childhood dream by speeding around the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in the cockpit of his Williams in opening practice for the race. It was a warm homecoming for Canada's first Formula One driver since former world champion Jacques Villeneuve left Sauber in 2006 and Stroll was welcomed to the track by waving flags and loud cheers.   It’s a great track, I really like the rhythm and it’s just good to be home,  said Stroll.   It was a good day getting used to the track, but I have to treat it as just another race at the end of the day as everything stays the same.  On the out lap I looked at the fans and saw them waving and cheering and that is really cool.  Stroll can expect even greater support during Sunday's race as he tries to build some confidence and momentum in what has been a challenging Formula One debut season. Without a point in six races, Stroll and the team have set a top 10 finish as the target at his home maiden grand prix. But if the first two practice sessions are any indication, Stroll faces another uphill battle. While the young Canadian received positive words for his work on Friday, 13th and 17th fastest will not get the job done.  He’s shown reasonable pace for this stage of the weekend and he hasn’t used the ultrasoft (tire) yet,  said Williams chief technical officer Paddy Lowe.

A better performance will be expected from Stroll on a track where Williams cars have done well in the past, including back-to-back podiums last two years. It has been a steep learning curve for Stroll and he has come under attack in some quarters for his modest results.  There are always going to be haters, there is always going to jealousy, that’s just the nature of sports in general,  shrugged Stroll.   But I don't focus on that. I know who is important around me and those are the people I listen to. The rest of the noise you just have to block it out.  Certainly Stroll has lofty standards to live up to this weekend.  The Circuit is named after Quebec motor racing icon Gilles Villeneuve and each lap his Williams will pass over the words  Salut Gilles  painted across the finish line. Jacques, son of Gilles, never won on the track but did claim a world title in 1997.  Gilles was a bit before my time, so I didn’t really have a chance to watch him race,  admitted Stroll.   To be the first Canadian to race here since Jacques is really an honor. He won the world championship with Williams in 1997, the year before I was born.   Now 20 years later to be here in the Canadian Grand Prix, just memories of when I was a kid watching the race.

The 37-year-old Finn has looked very lively in the last two races, taking pole for Ferrari in Monaco last month, and brought his speed to Canada by clocking a time of one minute, 12.935 seconds around the 2.7 mile (4.34 km) Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, the only driver to dip under 1:13.00 on an overcast cloudy day. Mercedes three-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was quickest in the morning session but could not match Raikkonen's pace in the afternoon, posting 1:13.150 ahead of arch-rival and championship leader Sebastian Vettel in the other Ferrari. Vettel, a four-times world champion with Red Bull who leads Hamilton by 25 points after six races, was timed at 1:13.200 just in front of Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas on 1:13.310.  The Ferraris are looking fast here and as the times show, it's super close at the top right now,  said Hamilton.  I feel like we are still just a little bit behind the red cars at this early stage of the weekend, but we'll be pushing as hard as we can to close the gap ahead of qualifying on Saturday.  After a tough weekend in Monaco, the main thing is that our car is already feeling a lot better around Montreal.  It should be game on for the rest of the weekend.      Young Dutchman Max Verstappen was fifth best in a Red Bull followed by veteran Brazilian Felipe Massa in a Williams. Master Hamilton Hamilton, Vettel and Raikkonen have claimed wins in Montreal but the Briton is the master of the island circuit having collected five victories. Putting a poor effort at the Monaco Grand Prix behind him, Hamilton, who can equal the 65 career pole positions of boyhood idol Ayrton Senna in Saturday's qualifying, has started from pole in Canada five times, including the last two years. It was a day of adventure on the technical layout with driver after driver spinning off the track. Vettel was off in both sessions, while Frenchman Romain Grosjean had his Haas spinning three times and Dane Daniil Kvyat twice. It was another bitterly frustrating day for Fernando Alonso as the double world champion was forced to the sidelines in the morning session with mechanical problems then did not get back onto the track until late in the afternoon as his team struggled to fix hydraulic problems. Alonso, who skipped the Monaco Grand Prix to race in the Indianapolis 500, has quickly discovered that little progress has been made at McLaren in his absence, leaving with a slim hope that his team can score their first points of the season. Teenager Lance Stroll, the first Canadian in his home grand prix since Jacques Villeneuve in 2006, got his first test of the circuit, the Williams rookie recording the 13th best effort in the morning then slipping back to 17th in the afternoon.

The 20-year-old, looking to become the first unseeded woman to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since 1933, blazed her way to the final, hitting winners and errors with reckless abandon. Third seed Halep, instead, dug herself into her second French Open final, showing the classical claycourt skills that marked her out as many people's pre-tournament favorite. Nowhere was her tenacity and ability to soak up punishment more apparent than in the quarter-finals when she trailed Elina Svitolina by a set and 5-1 but somehow found a way to win. Should she win on Saturday she will be the first player since Justine Henin in 2005 to win a singles' title at Roland Garros after saving a match point. With so many big names absent from the draw this could be Halep's best chance to land a first grand slam -- but that is not all that is at stake. The 2014 runner-up, bidding to become the first Romanian woman to win here since Virginia Ruzici in 1978, would also move top of the WTA rankings with the title.  I love the pressure,  the 25-year-old, who began the tournament with doubts over her ankle, said. If anything the pressure is off Ostapenko. Former men's champion Mats Wilander described the final as a  bonus  match for the young woman from Riga who thrashed 50 winners in the semi-final against Timea Bacsinszky.

She also has the chance to emulate the darling of Roland Garros, Gustavo Kuerten, by making the French Open her first career title -- the feat the Brazilian achieved in 1997 on the day Ostapenko was born. The stars seem aligned for the Latvian, whose style is reminiscent of that of Monica Seles. She goes for the throat on every shot, always looking for the lines.

Charity work and assisting coach Glen Mills with his track club appear at the top of the list for Bolt, who will retire after August's world championships in London. “I promised him (Mills) that I will try to be a part of Racers Track Club as much as possible,  Bolt told Reuters.  He wants me to take over but I don’t thing that will happen, but I will definitely try to assist as much as possible because I love Racers and I love my coach very much.  Multiple Olympic and world gold medalist Bolt, who seems to have moved past his earlier desire to play professional soccer, said he would miss competing, but not the hard training.  I'm going to miss the crowds,  the 30-year-old said.  I enjoy just playing with the crowd, feeling the energy and just competing in front of them... that's what I'm going to miss about track and field.  Politics are also out of the question, the 100 and 200 meters world record holder said. Even with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness offering opportunities in government, the lanky sprinter has said no. “I’ve said it over the years, politics is not me,  Bolt said.  When your guys (journalists) ask me questions, I’ve always tried to stay away from politics because it’s a tricky thing, so I try to stay as far away as possible.  But Bolt, who considers Jamaican sprint icons the late Herb McKenley and Don Quarrie, both Olympic gold medalists, among his role models, wants to put on a show in his last run on home soil, a 100 meters at the National Stadium. “The fans in Jamaica know that when I show up I always show up at my best,” the 11-time world champion said. “I always try to make sure they’re happy because they’re very hard to please,  added the man who clocked 50 sub-10 second 100 meters in his career.     Although he harbors no intentions of attempting his 100m world record of 9.58 seconds, Bolt aims to go out in the blaze of glory in London.

But in reality, soybeans do not need high crop condition ratings – at least relative to corn – to realize above-average yields. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday will include soybean condition scores for the first time in its weekly crop progress report. These ratings are the next pieces of information the market needs to evaluate the potential of the 2017 U.S. soybean harvest. While early corn condition ratings near 70 percent of the crop in good to excellent conditions are most preferable for above-average yields, soybeans can get away with numbers in the low 60s -- or less. In the past 31 years of data, soybean condition scores have been published for week 23 - the current week - in 20 of those years. After throwing out the high and low, good-to-excellent ratings in the remaining 18 years average out to 64.5 percent. Historically, week 23 has ended between June 6 and 13. Over the past three years, the week 23 good-to-excellent ratings averaged 72.3 percent. In both 2014 and 2016, some 74 percent of U.S. soybeans achieved that mark, which is the highest ever for the week. This is why comparing 2017’s numbers against year ago should be done with caution, as it could lead one to believe that the current crop is performing worse than it actually is. It will still be useful to compare conditions to last year, though, because it can practically be considered a benchmark of near-perfection. Fourteen U.S. states combining for 84 percent of production achieved record yields in 2016, making last year the one to beat.  As of June 4, soybeans were 83 percent planted and 58 percent emerged. The planting pace was slightly ahead of normal and emergence was just a hair behind, but some of the major production states have been lagging more significantly on the latter. Emergence has been unusually slow in Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio, when compared with five-year averages. However, emergence in Indiana and Ohio – which together produce 14 percent of the nation’s soybeans – was similarly slow in 2016 and both states went on to post record yields.   Lower Ratings Ok For corn, if the first good-to-excellent score of the year is much below 70 percent, above-trend yields are unlikely. But soybeans have a much wider margin for error.  Of the 20 years in which soybean conditions were reported in week 23, the better yielding years and worse yielding years seem to be divided by a good-to-excellent rating in the low 60s (reut.rs/2sIC6wG). Seven of the years held ratings of 60 percent or less in week 23, and only one – 2001 – was able to yield marginally above the long-term trend, while all others were notably lower. On the other hand, a week 23 rating of 64 percent was good enough to produce yields 4 percent above trend in 2005. Moving ahead to week 26, the first week for which the full 31-year history is available that ends between June 27 and July 4, the cushion becomes even softer.  Seven of the last 31 years pulled off above-trend soybean yields with week 26 good-to-excellent ratings between 53 and 60 percent. But of course, this required cooperative summer weather. Rally Chances? But however low the soybean ratings may become at any point during the season, it will be harder than usual to rouse the market bulls. Both the United States and Brazil – which together export 82 percent of the world’s soybeans – produced mind-numbingly large crops in 2016/17, and soybean futures and market enthusiasm toward the oilseed have struggled ever since.  As of May 30, hedge funds and other money managers held an all-time record short position across the soy complex, which also includes soybean oil and meal. This of course raises the possibility for a significant short-covering rally, but the U.S. crop might have a hard time being the source of that. If U.S. farmers plant 90 million acres of soybeans as many traders expect, final yield would only need to be 44.9 bushels per acre – well below USDA’s trend of 48 – to hit the 4-billion production mark. This was only achieved once, in 2016, when the crop reached 4.3 billion bushels off a 52.1 bpa yield. The previous two harvests, 2014 and 2015, held the previous production record of 3.93 billion bushels each with yields of 47.5 bpa and 48 bpa, respectively.

The New Zealander had not only been at the receiving end of one of the most spectacular sporting comebacks in San Francisco, he was then dumped as skipper by Emirates Team New Zealand. Yet this month in Bermuda, the 44-year-old was back in the hunt, reborn as skipper and CEO of SoftBank Team Japan, the first Japanese challenge for the America's Cup in 17 years. While Barker's poker face and sunglasses hid his emotions as he raced, his wit, warmth and wisdom shone through in the post-match briefings, even when things were not going his way. After he was knocked out of the contest by Sweden's Artemis Racing on Friday, Barker was positive in defeat.  The main emotion is an immense pride in what we have achieved in two years ... we started with nothing,  Barker told a televised news briefing. [L3N1J64RV]  It's been a fantastic honor and a privilege to be running a new team... and I would not trade that for anything.   While it was  too early to say  whether SoftBank Team Japan would be back for another shot at the cup, Barker said he hoped they had a future given the fan base they have built up in both Japan and New Zealand, where many of the team are from.  There's a few things that need sorting out before we have that certainty,  he added. Barker on Board? Whether Barker will be part of another campaign with Japan is also up in the air.   I really haven't given it any thought. We will have to see...  he said of his own future, adding that he had always said he loved racing and would like to continue. But Barker's performance on Bermuda's Great Sound has been mixed. At times his tactical and sailing brilliance shone bright, while at others he was punished for his errors.  Clearly there were mistakes,  he said of the last race, while pointing out that his opponents had also made some. Whether SoftBank Team Japan do return to fulfill their sponsor's aim of bringing the cup to Japan may depend on who triumphs in this month's competition. If Oracle Team USA or Artemis Racing win, a framework has been agreed among five of the teams for taking it through to the next event, once again in the high-octane foiling catamarans which have proved popular with sailors and broadcasters. But if New Zealand emerge victorious, they have said they will look to return to the cup's less structured roots, something which might make it harder for SoftBank Team Japan, who bought their design from the holders, to commit to. Whoever wins, Barker is adamant that the so-called Framework Agreement signed earlier this year by the British, U.S., French, Swedish and Japanese teams is the way forward. He will certainly be back out on the water this week, as a sparring partner for his former foe Jimmy Spithill, skipper of Oracle Team USA.

Iran, which used to be OPEC's second biggest oil exporter, has been raising output since 2016 to recoup market share lost to regional rivals including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. While many Asian nations continued to purchase oil from Iran during sanctions, Western nations halted imports, halving Iran's overall exports to as little as one million barrels per day (bpd). Last month, Iran exported about 1.1 million bpd to Europe including Turkey, almost reaching pre-sanction levels and only slightly below the 1.2 million bpd supplied to Asia, the source told Reuters. Iran's exports to Asia last month were the lowest since February 2016, Reuters' calculations showed. Oil exports to Asia fell as South Korea and Japan stepped up oil condensate purchases and bought less oil, said the source, who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential.  Iran's condensate parked in floating storage has almost been exhausted because of higher purchases by Japan and Korea,  the source said. Exports to Asia were also hit by India's decision to cut annual purchases from Iran by a fifth for the fiscal year to March 2018. After the lifting of sanctions, Tehran added new clients such as Litasco and Lotos and won back customers such as Total (TOTF.PA), ENI (ENI.MI), Tupras (RDSa.L), Repsol (REP.MC), Cepsa CPF.GQ and Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT). OPEC member Iran was allowed a small production increase under a December deal to limit output. Iran's overall May oil production totaled 3.9 million bpd, the source said.  Iran is currently producing about 200,000 bpd of West Karoun grade, which the nation blends with other Iranian heavy grades for export, he said.

The record books might not interest the 31-year-old Mallorcan, but he will have to be dragged away screaming and kicking before giving up the chance to move into double figures and land La Decima against Stan Wawrinka on Sunday. Nadal, often written off as a spent force since winning the last of his 14 grand slam titles here three years ago, is secretly salivating at the prospect of ruling Roland Garros again after watching Wawrinka and then Novak Djokovic usurp him. Victory on Sunday would see Nadal become the first player to win the same grand slam 10 times in the modern era. After dropping only 29 games en route to a 10th final, only a brave man would bet against him.  I think I don't need to make more history, no? It's enough. Nine are more than good,  Nadal, whose resurgence this year began when he reached the Australian Open final against Roger Federer, losing an epic, told reporters.  Nine or 10, it's only 10 percent more! It's true 10 is a beautiful number, but actually my favorite is nine. But for sure if it becomes 10, it will be my favorite.  In general, to be in the final again here is probably the most important event in my career.  Nadal's 6-3 6-4 6-0 defeat of Thiem means he will be playing his 22nd grand slam final on Sunday, putting himself second on the all-time list behind Federer who is out on his own with 28. Yet he describes himself as  not very special  -- another statement that was never going to wash, coming from the greatest claycourt tennis player of all time.  Nine is probably difficult,  he said.  It is obvious that you need to combine a lot of things, and a lot of things have to come together to have that record. You need to be lucky, you need to play well, you need to be healthy for two weeks.   I am not the right one to say, but to play 10 finals here is something difficult.  Sunday's final will be Nadal's first grand slam clash with the Wawrinka since the Swiss beat him to win his first major at the 2014 Australian Open -- a match in which Nadal struggled with physical problems. Asked if it was a chance to right a wrong, Nadal said:  Revenge is not part of my vocab. The best player will win again. He's in the final. It's the toughest opponent possible.

Seven weeks later, May has lost her majority and a novice party created by Macron looks set to win the biggest parliamentary majority for a French president since Charles de Gaulle's 1968 landslide. European Union leaders fear May's dramatic electoral miscue will delay Brexit talks due to start this month and so raise the risk of negotiations failing, and the fallout will doubtless continue to dominate headlines in the coming week. So will the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, which is expected to bring a rise in interest rates. But just as significant for Europe is the fact that the week is bookended by France's two rounds of legislative elections, this Sunday and on June 18. Predictions can go wrong, of course. Just ask May. But if Macron does succeed in stomping on the opposition as polls suggest,  he will be starting his tenure with clout to steer an economy in need of a bit of help. French economic growth has been accelerating. The central bank said on Friday it now expected it to rise 1.4 percent this year, a tad above earlier projections. Although that is the most since 2011, it is hardly robust and reflects what critics say is a rather sclerotic economic system -- which Macron is promising to fix. This was underlined by industrial output unexpectedly slumping 0.5 percent in April. The central bank also said France was again in danger of exceeding European Union budget deficit targets with a projected cap of 3.1 percent versus the EU's 3.0 percent and the previous government's 2.8 percent target. There is an audit due next month. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe says he is concerned the old government may have let things slip. Brexit Blow In the middle of Britain's expected week of political question, meanwhile, comes one of the bits of post-Brexit-vote economic data that UK citizens have actually felt -- inflation. It has risen sharply, mainly as a result of the pound's dive against the dollar and euro that followed the referendum. Economists polled by Reuters expect annual inflation to come in unchanged in May at 2.7 percent. It will not, of course, reflect the pound's falls related to the election result. Pay growth is meanwhile seen falling to 2 percent in the three months to April, excluding bonuses -- less than inflation and underscoring why many voters are unhappy.   May retail sales, on Thursday, are also expected to show some post-referendum blues, with a fall 0.8 percent month-on-month predicted, for a year-on-year rise of 1.4 percent versus April's 4 percent. As for the Fed, its rate rise is pretty much expected, although recent weaker inflation data has added a bit of a question mark to what may come next. There are also some expectations that the Fed may announce how it will reduce its balance sheet -- all those things it has bought during periods of stimulus -- as it seeks to normalize policy nearly a decade after the global financial crisis began.

Irish War Cry, 10th in the Derby, will likely go off as the favorite at Elmont, New York, but the race, the longest in the Triple Crown series, could be wide open. Japanese import Epicharis would win a $1 million bonus from the New York Racing Association if he triumphs. But the second choice is dealing with a front hoof issue and has not trained for three days. That leaves Lookin At Lee, the only entry in all three Triple Crown races this year, as the third choice. He came closest in the Derby, finishing second, and took fourth in the Preakness. Tapwrit and Senior Investment also could figure. The Todd Pletcher-trained Tapwrit had early trouble at the Derby before finishing sixth. Pletcher also will saddle the one-eyed Patch, who placed 14th in Kentucky. Senior Investment has speed but the one-and-a-half mile distance may be too long for the thoroughbred, who took third in the Preakness last month.

Forbes magazine reported this week that the charity run by Eric Trump, the president's second-oldest son, paid the Trump Organization to use its properties for charity events in recent years even though Eric Trump had told donors that the golf course and other assets were being used for free, so that just about all the money donated would help sick children. Forbes reported that based on filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, more than $1.2 million  has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization.  Eric Soufer, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in an email that his office was looking into issues raised by the Forbes story. Soufer did not immediately respond to a later request for details about the examination. The Democratic attorney general's office already is investigating allegations of self-dealing at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the Republican president's charity. Trump, a New York real estate developer, said in December that he would dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, but Schneiderman's office has said it could not be wound down while the investigation was ongoing.

Many of those charities  were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses,  Forbes said. Amanda Miller, who works for the Trump Organization and who identified herself in an emailed response to a Reuters query as a  spokesperson for Eric Trump,  said the Eric Trump Foundation would cooperate fully with Schneiderman's office. Eric Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisition for the Trump Organization. “During the past decade, the Eric Trump Foundation has raised over $16.3 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, including more than $3.6 million to St. Jude and other worthwhile causes just in 2016 alone,  Miller said in the email. Eric Trump said in a tweet on Thursday that he had raised the money for St. Jude with an expense ratio of less than 12.3 percent.  Let's not politicize pediatric cancer,  he said. On his foundation's website, Eric Trump said he had ceased  direct fundraising efforts at the end of 2016  in order to avoid the appearance or assertion of any impropriety and/or a conflict of interest.

Charlie Blackmon and Ryan Hanigan each hit a two-run homer and Colorado hung on to beat the Chicago Cubs 5-3 on Friday for its sixth straight victory. The Rockies, who lead the National League with 40 wins, cobbled the victory and improved to 23-10 on the road. After starter German Marquez lasted just three innings, five relievers allowed just one hit and one run.  It was a big day for them,  Hanigan said.  The bullpen has been huge for us all year.  We're in a good groove as a team right now. We've got to get greedy and try to win as many as we can.  But Friday's victory nearly slipped away. Veteran closer Greg Holland pitched the ninth for his majors-best 23rd save in as many chances despite walking the bases loaded with one out. He escaped by getting Ben Zobrist to pop out and before striking out Jason Heyward.  Uncharacteristic, really the three walks,  manager Bud Black said.  But the good closers know how to navigate through an inning when they need to.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at CubsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchHanigan calls Holland a cool and  deliberate  pitcher. He had to be after putting Ian Happ, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo on base.  I didn't have command early in the inning,  Holland said.  Luckily, I found it and Hanny walked me through it.  I've had the bases loaded enough to know you can still wiggle out of it if you make a few pitches.  Blackmon snapped a tie in the fifth with his 14th homer, a shot off Seth Frankoff, who made his major league debut. Nolan Arenado drove in an insurance run with a single in the seventh and Ian Desmond had three hits. Heyward had two RBIs as the Cubs lost their third straight following a five-game winning streak. Marquez's 80-pitch start was pushed back a day to allow bruising on his right thumb to subside. The right-hander allowed two runs -- one earned -- on two hits and three walks before being replaced by Chris Rusin (3-0), who pitched two innings for the win. Chicago long-relief specialist Mike Montgomery made his first start of the season and went four innings, allowing two runs -- on Hanigan's homer -- and striking out five.  I wasn't able to those quick outs,  Montgomery said.  I knew that I had to battle. The pitch count (73) got up a little bit, but you have to give their team credit for that.  Montgomery started in place of right hander Kyle Hendricks, who went on the 10-day disabled list on Thursday with tendinitis in his pitching hand. Frankoff (0-1), who pitched two innings following Montgomery, had been recalled to fill Hendricks' roster spot. All-Star shortstop Addison Russell rejoined the Cubs on Friday after the team told him to take off Thursday's game against the Rockies in the wake of a domestic violence allegation on social media. Russell was available off the bench. The Cubs took a 2-0 lead in the first inning, scoring one unearned run on a rare Rockies defensive miscue. With two outs, Anthony Rizzo walked and Zobrist singled. Both came home when Heyward singled up the middle, then advanced to second after Blackmon bobbled the ball in center field and threw wide back to the infield. Blackmon was charged with just his second error this season. The Rockies tied it 2-all in the second on Hanigan's second homer, a shot to left . Aided by a catcher interference call on Hanigan, the Cubs loaded the bases with one out in the third. Marquez escaped the jam by striking out Javier Baez and getting Miguel Montero to fly out to short left. Colorado moved ahead 4-2 in the fifth on Blackmon's drive to right. Frankoff, recalled to take Hendricks' roster spot, was greeted by Rusin's single. Blackmon then tagged the 28-year-old righty with a towering shot. The Cubs trimmed it to 4-3 the bottom half of the inning. Rizzo scored from third when Heyward grounded into a force out. Arenado's sharp single with two outs in the seventh drove in pinch-hitter Raimel Tapia from third to make it 5-3. NOTES: The Rockies reinstated RHP Adam Ottavino (right shoulder inflammation) for the 10-day disabled list. He pitched a scoreless eighth for his 16th hold. To make room, Colorado sent RHP Carlos Estevez to Triple-A Albuquerque. ... Hendricks said he hope to miss only one start and would be able to rejoin the rotation next week in Pittsburgh. The righty said the  inflammation  in his hand flared up Tuesday after a bullpen session, and that he never experienced a similar injury. Hendricks is 4-3 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 starts after winning 16 games and leading the majors in ERA a year ago. ... Manager Joe Maddon hopes to get Russell, who has struggled at the plate, back into the lineup soon.  We'll just treat him normally and get him back on the field,  Maddon said. Russell was accused of  mental and physical  abuse against his wife, Melisa, by someone claiming to be a family friend -- with the Instagram handle @carlierreed -- in a post on a now-removed account. In meeting with media on Friday, Russell said the Cubs had been supportive during the episode.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-cubs-writethru-idUSMTZED69AWWA70"},

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott signed amended  stand your ground  legislation on Friday, making it easier for defendants in the state to successfully claim they were protecting themselves when they commit violence. Previously, the law required defendants to prove that they were using force in self-defense. The new law shifts the burden of proof in pretrial hearings to prosecutors, rather than defendants, to prove whether force was used lawfully. Supporters of stand your ground laws, including the National Rifle Association, the powerful U.S. gun lobby, see the legislation as bolstering civilians' right to protect themselves.  Florida's self-defense law was initially passed in 2005, and inspired similar laws in other states. It removes the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allows the use of deadly force when a person feels greatly threatened. Opponents have said the amended law will embolden gun owners to shoot first, citing the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the Orlando area, which spurred national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.  The neighborhood watchman who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder after the state's stand your ground law was included in jury instructions. Scott, a Republican, signed the amended legislation into law along with a spate of other measures passed this week in a special session of the state's legislature. The measure was largely passed by party-line vote in the legislature.

Attorney General Mark Herring appealed the May 26 ruling by a U.S. district judge in Norfolk, Virginia, that Lee Boyd Malvo, one of the two so-called  Beltway snipers,  must be re-sentenced for two life sentences he received in Virginia, according to court documents.  The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that mandatory life sentences were unconstitutional for juveniles and later found that the ruling should be applied retroactively.  Malvo, 32, was one of two men found guilty of committing a series of sniper shootings in fall 2002 that killed 10 people in the Washington, D.C., area. The shootings terrified people in the D.C. suburbs and along much of the Eastern Seaboard.

In the years following his conviction, Malvo said he was sexually abused by Muhammad from the age of 15 until the time they embarked on the shooting spree from inside a blue Chevrolet Caprice. They were arrested in October 2002 when police discovered them sleeping in the car at a rest stop in Maryland. The appeal documents were filed with the district court in Eastern Virginia but had yet to be filed with the Fourth District Court of Appeals that covers Virginia by Friday afternoon.

Police said there were indications that JBS and controlling shareholder FB Participações SA gained an unfair advantage in trading stocks, currency futures and forwards in April and May.  There is evidence these dealings occurred with the use of privileged information, generating undue advantages in capital markets in a context in which almost all investors incurred financial losses,  the police said in an emailed statement. JBS and its parent company J&F; Investimentos have denied any wrongdoing. The police operation follows several investigations by securities regulator CVM on trades made before the revelation of a plea deal by top JBS executives, which triggered a financial market selloff last month.

Police also questioned purchases of U.S. dollars in future and forward markets, which local media reported surpassed $1 billion. JBS shares have fallen 16 percent since the Temer scandal broke on May 21, contributing to a 7.2 percent loss of the benchmark Bovespa stock index.

The nation of Qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,  Trump told reporters at the White House.   So we had a decision to make, do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action. We have to stop the funding of terrorism. I decided ... the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding,  Trump said, adding that he helped plan the Qatar action with Arab leaders after a recent summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A senior administration official told Reuters earlier this week that the United States had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis in Riyadh during Trump's visit last month that they would sever ties with Qatar. The crisis is a major diplomatic test for the United States, which is a close ally of countries on both sides. Trump has called key players in the region since they severed ties with Qatar on Monday.  The Trump administration has given mixed signals on whether to isolate Qatar or bring it into talks with other Gulf nations. The confrontation in the region intensified on Friday as Arab states tightened their squeeze on Qatar by putting dozens of figures with links to the country on terrorism blacklists, while Qatar's ally Turkey rushed to its side with plans to send troops. The Pentagon said the blockade was hindering U.S. ability to plan for long-term operations in the region. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces and an important base for the fight against Islamic State. It is the U.S. Air Force's largest base in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he expected all parties to find a resolution.  We call on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar,  he said in Washington. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department that the crisis, which has cut transportation links and trade, had begun hurting ordinary people in Qatar, and that it was impairing business dealings and harming the U.S. battle against the Islamic State militant group. A picture on Facebook showed a supermarket displaying food from Turkey including milk, eggs and chicken. Tillerson demanded that Qatar, as well as the other countries, take steps to curtail support for terrorism. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have accused Doha of supporting extremist groups, but Tillerson suggested that all sides needed to do more. Related CoverageMerkel says all Gulf nations, Iran, Turkey must work to ease Qatar crisis The emir of Qatar has made progress in halting financial support and expelling terrorist elements from his country, but he must do more and he must do it more quickly,  Tillerson said.  Others must also continue to eliminate factions of support for violent organizations within their own borders.  On Trump’s Air Force One flight to New Jersey, a senior White House official told reporters that Trump and Tillerson were on the  same page  on Qatar.  The United States wants a resolution to the situation but it wants a resolution on terms consistent with the principles the president laid out in Riyadh,” the official said, adding that Trump was concerned about the humanitarian impact of the crisis but also Qatar's support of  terrorist finance.  Riyadh, Cairo and their allies have accused Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, of supporting militant Islamist movements across the region. They have imposed what Qatar said was a blockade of shipping and air traffic and closed Qatar's only land border, causing panic buying at supermarkets and provoking confusion and anxiety across the population. Qatar, which has developed an assertive foreign policy over the past decade, denied that it supports militants and said it was helping to reduce the threat of terrorism by backing groups that fight poverty and seek political reform. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani called the moves by Arab neighbors and others  clear violations of international law and international humanitarian law.  They will not have a positive impact on the region but a negative one,  the minister said during a visit to Germany. A view shows buildings in Doha, Qatar, June 9, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonThe United Arab Emirates said on Friday that Qatar must acknowledge concerns about its  troubling support for extremism  and  re-examine its regional policies.    This will provide the necessary basis for any discussions,  UAE ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba said in a statement on Friday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.  Along with our American colleagues but above all our colleagues in the region, we must try to find solutions, especially lifting the sea and air blockades,  Gabriel told reporters.  The Hour of Diplomacy  Qatar has vowed to ride out the isolation imposed on it by fellow Arab states and said it would not compromise its sovereignty over foreign policy to resolve the region's biggest diplomatic crisis in years. One U.S. official said that while Qatar needs to do more to combat terrorist financing, it was inaccurate to single out that Gulf nation. “The (counter terrorist-financing) challenges they face aren’t unique to them,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There are other countries in the region that grapple with the same issues.” Qatar is home to 2.7 million people but only about 300,000 citizens. Most of its population is comprised of foreign workers who helped build the tiny finger off the Arabian Peninsula into a natural gas exporting powerhouse, crowned with skyscrapers. Projects include soccer stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Armed Qatari gunboats patrolled the corniche of the capital Doha on Friday.  Tiny Qatar has played an outsized role as a sponsor of factions in wars and revolutions across the Middle East under its 37-year-old ruler, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and his father Hamad who stepped down in 2013 after 18 years in power. With supply chains disrupted and concern mounting about economic turbulence, banks and firms in Gulf Arab states were trying to keep business links to Qatar open and avoid a costly firesale of assets. The riyal currency has tumbled and the cost of insuring Qatari debt against default has risen. Clashing Over Brotherhood Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain added 59 people to terrorist blacklists, among them 18 Qataris, including Abdullah bin Khalid Al Thani, a former interior minister and member of Qatar's royal family. The Qatari government said the move  reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact .  Our position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement - a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authors,  it said in a statement. Those on the list, including the former interior minister, could not be reached for comment. Many of the others added to the list are figures associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who have made Qatar a base, including Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi. Some are prominent jihadists who have fought in Libya and Syria. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, whose AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics and who has voiced support for the Brotherhood, signaled his firm backing for Qatar by swiftly signing a law to send troops to a Turkish base there. Turkey will send warplanes and warships to Qatar after an initial deployment of troops, the mass-circulation Hurriyet newspaper said on its website. Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on the report, but Hurriyet said there were plans to send some 200 to 250 soldiers within two months.

Attorney General Mark Herring appealed the May 26 ruling by a U.S. district judge in Norfolk, Virginia, that Lee Boyd Malvo, one of the two so-called  Beltway snipers,  must be re-sentenced for two life sentences he received in Virginia, according to court documents. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that mandatory life sentences were unconstitutional for juveniles and later found that the ruling should be applied retroactively. Malvo, 32, was one of two men found guilty of committing a series of sniper shootings in fall 2002 that killed 10 people in the Washington, D.C., area. The shootings terrified people in the D.C. suburbs and along much of the Eastern Seaboard. Malvo, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, received two life sentences in two Virginia counties, as well as additional life sentences in Maryland. His co-defendant, John Allen Muhammad, was sentenced to death and was executed in 2009 in Virginia at age 48. In the years following his conviction, Malvo said he was sexually abused by Muhammad from the age of 15 until the time they embarked on the shooting spree from inside a blue Chevrolet Caprice. They were arrested in October 2002 when police discovered them sleeping in the car at a rest stop in Maryland. The appeal documents were filed with the district court in Eastern Virginia but had yet to be filed with the Fourth District Court of Appeals that covers Virginia by Friday afternoon.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/virginia-shooting-sniper-idUSL1N1J6283"},

Under the financial terms of the deal, which have already been disclosed, J&F; agreed to pay a fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.13 billion) as compensation for the role of its executives in a sprawling corruption scandal threatening to topple Brazilian President Michel Temer. The attorney general, the government's lawyer who defends its interests in court, asked to gain full access to the terms of the deal, the document showed. The terms were signed in the context of four ongoing federal police probes known as Greenfield, Sepsis, Cui Bono and Weak Flesh. These investigations cover a wide range of claims including corruption at the pension funds of state-run companies, bribery of food inspectors and alleged fraud in loans granted by federal banks such as Caixa Econômica Federal . These probes have implicated units of J&F; including the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA and eucalyptus pulp producer Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, which are owned by the Batista family.

Making her first public appearance at a court hearing in the case, Geimer, who was 13 years old when Polanski assaulted her in Los Angeles in 1977, said she had wanted the criminal case against the film director closed for decades.  I would implore you to consider taking action to finally put this issue to close as an act of mercy to myself and my family,  Geimer told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon.  Justice is not only about punishment. It's about equity and consideration,  she said, reading from a prepared statement. Polanski, now 83, admitted raping Geimer in 1977 and spent 42 days in  pre-trial custody. He then fled the United States, fearing a plea bargain with prosecutors would be overruled and that he would get a lengthy prison term. Since then, the  Chinatown  director has remained a fugitive. The United States has attempted several times to extradite him from Europe to face justice, and more jail time, in California. Polanksi's attorney, Harland Braun, asked the judge on Friday to unseal testimony about the 1977 plea deal. Braun hopes to use the testimony to persuade European authorities to rescind the international arrest warrant against Polanski.

She said the case continued to affect her life and that of her family and three sons.

Geimer also played down the severity of what happened to her in 1977, saying Polanski had apologized to her and that they had exchanged emails in recent years.  It wasn't as traumatic for me as everyone would like to believe it was. I was a young, sexually active teenager and it was scary thing. But it was not an uncommon thing.

Mark Turner, who owns LandMark Antiques & More, sells his own beef out of a small refrigerator in the shop. BPI is an industrialized meat processor with which he has little in common, Turner said.

May's gamble that she could capitalise on Britons' desire to quit the European Union and perceived weakness in the opposition Labour Party backfired on Thursday as voters stripped her of her parliamentary majority. The surprising outcome, which sent the pound tumbling , forced May to form a minority government, leaving her reliant on a small group of Northern Irish parliamentarians, just nine days before Britain is due to begin negotiating a deal to leave the EU. Britain's typically right-wing press savaged May over the election outcome, questioning whether she will be able to remain in power after a result that leaves her reliant on uniting rival factions within her party to deliver Brexit.  May stares into the abyss,  said The Times' Saturday edition while the Daily Mail led with  Tories Turn On Theresa . The Telegraph said senior Conservatives including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, interior minister Amber Rudd and Brexit minister David Davis were taking soundings over whether to replace her.  As I reflect on the results I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward,  May said on Friday in a televised statement. Britain's best-selling Sun newspaper said senior members of her party had vowed to get rid of May, but would wait at least six months because they were worried that a leadership contest now could propel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.  Theresa May is certainly the strongest leader that we have at the moment,  David Jones, a junior Brexit minister, told the BBC. He said it was impossible to predict whether she would still be prime minister at the end of the year. Several lawmakers demanded the resignation of May's top advisers, who have been widely blamed for a disastrous policy to make the elderly pay more towards their care and a campaign seen as too insulated from ordinary voters and too focused on attacking her opponent. Reshuffle After confirming on Friday that her top five ministers would keep their jobs, including finance minister Philip Hammond, May is expected to continue to appoint the government that will take on one of the most demanding negotiations in British history. May said Brexit talks would begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day as the formal reopening of parliament. But the election result meant it was unclear whether her plan to take Britain out of the bloc's single market and customs union could still be pursued. British politicians, including within May's own party, differ widely on what they want from the Brexit negotiating process. If she is to succeed in delivering the end of Britain's EU membership which 52 percent of the British public demanded last year, she must find a way to recapture the full support of her party because she will need their votes to pass legislation preparing for and ultimately enacting the departure. May will also need the support of the socially conservative, pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The two parties are broadly politically aligned, but it remains to be seen what price the DUP will seek to extract for its support. Several Conservative lawmakers, including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, raised concerns over the DUP's opposition to same-sex marriage. It was not immediately clear what the DUP's demands might be and one DUP lawmaker suggested support might come vote by vote. Any such arrangement would be fraught with political risk for May, fuelling uncertainty among businesses over what the final terms of Britain's departure from the EU would look like, and how it will affect future trade with the bloc.

Commander Dean Haydon also revealed that the men had a stockpile of petrol bombs in the back of their van and carried out their deadly attack with pink ceramic knives. Officers also discovered a Koran in their safe house, opened at a page on martyrdom. The discoveries, especially of the plan to hire a truck, suggested more could have been killed.  Getting hold of a 7.5 tonne lorry - the effects could have been even worse,  Haydon told reporters.  Although Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, Haydon said there was no evidence the attackers - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad.  We're not looking for a wider network,  said Haydon, head of London's Counter Terrorism Command, adding that officers were still trying to piece together how the three men had met.  How did they know each other? They are a diverse bunch,  he said.  Haydon provided unusually extensive details of last Saturday's attack, the deadliest in London since suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's transport network in 2005. Ringleader On Saturday morning, Butt, who Haydon said was believed to be the ringleader, tried to rent a 7.5 tonne truck but did not provided payment details.  Related CoverageLondon will not be cowed by militants, police chief saysBritish police arrest 27-year-old man in London Bridge attack probeIt was not clear why he could not pay, or if he lacked the necessary license to drive such a vehicle. But his attempt echoed last July's attack in Nice, France, when a 19-tonne truck was driven into crowds, killing 86 people. Shortly before 1700 GMT, Butt received a text message confirming his hire of a Renault van instead. At about 1730 GMT, the men drove to pick up the van before heading to Zaghba's home in east London. At 1838 GMT they left and two hours later the van reached London Bridge which they drove along twice before targeting pedestrians on the sidewalk on their third run. Three people on the bridge were struck and killed by the van, believed to have been driven by Butt, before the men abandoned the vehicle and began to attack people in bars and restaurants in the nearby bustling Borough Market area. The men were armed with identical 12-inch (30cm) pink ceramic knives, strapped to their wrists with leather bound around the handle. They were also wearing fake suicide belts - plastic water bottles wrapped in duct tape. People look at floral tributes near London Bridge, London, Britain, June 8, 2017.Marko DjuricaEight minutes after police were alerted, armed officers arrived at the scene and fired 46 rounds, killing all three men. Their victims were three French nationals, two Australians, a Canadian, a Spaniard and a Briton. In the attackers' van detectives found 13 wine bottles, filled with lighter fuel with rags wrapped round them to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs. There were also two blow torches which Haydon thought could have been used to light the homemade bombs as part of a possible secondary attack.  They were still fairly close to the van. There is a possibility that they could have come back,  Haydon said. There were also office chairs, a suitcase and two bags of gravel which Haydon said might have been to add weight or to act as a cover story for their activities to friends and family.   He said Redouane's home, an apartment in Barking, east London, was the men's safe house where they put their plot together and prepared the attack.  There they found an English-language copy of the Koran which had been left open on a page describing martyrdom, along with other items linked to their attack. Haydon said since last Saturday they had taken 262 statements from people from 19 different countries and numerous international inquiries were ongoing relating to the attackers and the victims. Criticism British police and security services were criticized after it emerged that they had known about Butt, who featured in a TV documentary entitled  Jihadis Next Door , in which he joined a group unfurling an Islamic State (IS) flag in a park.   Haydon acknowledged that Butt had links to al Muhajiroun, a banned group headed by cleric Anjem Choudary. He was jailed last year for encouraging support of IS, which has been linked to numerous militant plots in Britain and abroad. Butt was also arrested for fraud last October but was about to be told by prosecutors he would face no further action.  We will be looking at intelligence and our processes, and asking ourselves the question: 'Could we have prevented such an attack?',  Haydon said.  There is nothing that I'm seeing at the moment that suggested that we got that wrong.  Police have installed security barriers running alongside the sidewalks at eight bridges across the River Thames, and Haydon said similar protection was being considered at other locations. Police were also reviewing security at  iconic sites , crowded places and major events, and refreshing advice to theaters, bars, shopping centers and sports venues.

Chung Eui-yong called the decision to delay installation of  remaining launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, pending a review of its environmental impact, a domestic measure to ensure a democratic process. “The decision to introduce THAAD was made to protect South Korea and the U.S. forces in South Korea from a growing threat from the North. We won’t take this decision lightly,” Chung told a news briefing. He said South Korea would discuss ways to strengthen the joint defense against North Korea's weapons programs during a summit between new South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in late June. Two launchers of a full six-launcher THAAD battery, as well as the system's far-reaching radar, which China worries could upset the regional security balance, have already been installed on an old golf course in South Korea's southeastern city of Seongju. Moon's office said on Wednesday that deployment of the four remaining launchers would be halted for the environmental assessment, which may take well over a year, according to a senior administration official. Moon vowed in his election campaign to review the decision to deploy THAAD, which was made by his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, greatly angering South Korea's neighbor China, an important trading partner, and some domestic critics. U.S. officials have sought to play down the impact on relations with South Korea, a long-time treaty ally where more than 28,000 troops are based, although a Pentagon spokesman made clear it would like to see the full battery installed.  We believe considering the threat from North Korea, a full THAAD battery is the best addition to the defense of (South Korea),  Commander Gary Ross said. A senior official of the U.S. administration told Reuters that U.S. diplomats had sought clarification from South Korean officials as to whether the environmental review was a prelude for a rejection of the whole THAAD system, and were assured that South Korea planned to uphold its end of the agreement. The issue was discussed by Trump, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at a White House meeting on Thursday. A State Department spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said the decision to deploy THAAD was an essential response to North Korea's fast-developing nuclear and missiles programs, which has seen dozens of launches and two bomb tests since the start of last year.  Each launch ... further demonstrates the rationale and necessity of the U.S.-(South Korea) Alliance agreement to deploy THAAD,  she said. The State Department said U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon would visit Seoul from Tuesday to Thursday next week after a stop in Tokyo on Monday to discuss responses to North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has spoken of his aim to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States with a nuclear weapon, presenting  Trump with perhaps his most pressing security problem and underscoring the need for close cooperation with Seoul. Nevertheless, Trump, who campaigned on a populist  America First  platform, risked increased tensions with the U.S. ally when he told Reuters in an interview just before Moon's election he would either renegotiate or terminate a  horrible  free trade deal with South Korea and said Seoul should pay for THAAD, which he priced at $1 billion.

May called the snap election confident her Conservative Party would increase its majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit talks. Instead, Thursday's vote damaged her authority and made her negotiating position more vulnerable to criticism.  I'm sorry for all those candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful,  May said on Friday after a surprise resurgence by the main opposition Labour Party under its leftwing leader Jeremy Corbyn.  As I reflect on the results I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.  With all 650 seats declared, the Conservatives had won 318 seats, the Labour Party had 262 seats, followed by the pro-independence Scottish National Party on 34. May now risks more opposition to her Brexit plans from inside and outside her party, though a party source said leading the Conservatives was seen as too much of a poisoned chalice for her to face an immediate challenge.  She's staying, for now,  the source told Reuters. After noon, May was driven from her official Downing Street residence to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government - a formality under the British system. Her office said later that the key finance, foreign, Brexit, interior and defense ministers would remain unchanged. Further announcements were expected on Saturday. The socially conservative, pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party's 10 seats give the right-wing Conservatives a fragile but workable majority, which May said would allow her to negotiate a successful exit from the EU.  Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom,  May said.

British politicians differ widely on what they want from the Brexit negotiating process, seeing it as a way to shift Britain either to the right or left. Some parliamentarians in both the Conservative and Labour parties want to remain in the EU. Business, already struggling with the uncertainties of the two-year Brexit negotiating process, urged party leaders to work together. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip are welcomed by staff inside 10 Downing Street, in London, Britain June 9, 2017.Stefan Rousseau/Pool The last thing business leaders need is a parliament in paralysis, and the consequences for British businesses and for the UK as an investment destination would be severe,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors business lobby. May said Brexit talks would begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day the British parliament is due to reconvene. But  the election result meant it was unclear whether her plan to take Britain out of the bloc's single market and customs union could still be pursued. EU leaders expressed concern that May's loss of her majority would raise the risk of negotiations failing, resulting in a legal limbo for people and business.  Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations',  Donald Tusk, leader of the EU's ruling council, wrote in a tweet. Negotiation Risks  We need a government that can act,  EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.  With a weak negotiating partner, there's a danger that the (Brexit) negotiations will turn out badly for both sides.  Slideshow (18 Images)There was little sympathy for May from some Europeans.  Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,  tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian premier who is the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit process. May's predecessor David Cameron sought to silence eurosceptic fellow Conservatives by calling the referendum on EU membership, expecting Britons to vote to remain. The result ended his career and shocked Europe. Ruth Davidson, leader of Conservatives in Scotland, where the party did well, said the results showed the Conservatives should prioritize good trade relations with the EU.  We must in my view seek to deliver an open Brexit, not a closed one, which puts our country’s economic growth first,  Davidson said. Other Conservatives have emphasized the importance of migration controls, something the EU says is incompatible with open trade. Resurgent Labour Labour's Corbyn, reveling in a storming campaign performance after pundits had pronounced his party all but dead, said May should step down and that he wanted to form a minority government.  The mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence,  he said.  I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  May unexpectedly called the snap election seven weeks ago, three years early, polls predicting she would massively increase the slim majority she inherited from Cameron. Her campaign unraveled after a policy U-turn on care for the elderly, while Corbyn's old-school socialist platform and more impassioned campaigning style won wider support than anyone had foreseen, notably from young voters, say analysts. Late in the campaign, Britain was hit by two Islamist militant attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London, temporarily shifting the focus onto security issues. That did not help May, who had overseen cuts in police numbers during six years in her previous job as interior minister.

(Reuters) - In this rural outpost of just over 1,900 residents, a local college student has become a courtroom sketch artist, trailers on Main Street are ersatz offices for a major law firm and members of an agricultural youth club are puzzled by a new  metal detector at the local courthouse. The changes are part of Elk Point's selection as site of a multibillion-dollar defamation case pitting ABC News against South Dakota-meat processor, Beef Products Inc. The company contends that ABC and reporter Jim Avila defamed it by referring to its signature product as  pink slime  in 2012 broadcasts. BPI calls its product lean finely textured beef (LFTB). The trial, scheduled to run eight weeks, opened on Monday. ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. While BPI could face an uphill battle to show ABC intended to harm the company or knew its reporting was false, as required to prove a defamation claim, several Elk Point residents interviewed by Reuters this week were sympathetic to BPI and its founder, Eldon Roth.  I used his products and they were good products,  said one longtime resident, Jim Cody, referring to Roth.  I couldn't believe that people were saying this crap about them.  Mark Turner, who owns LandMark Antiques & More, sells his own beef out of a small refrigerator in the shop. BPI is an industrialized meat processor with which he has little in common, Turner said. Even so, he felt ABC unfairly depicted LFTB. Others, like Bobbye Wendt, who was hoping the trial would bring a boost in business for her coffee shop, were torn. ABC  could have just been reporting,  she said. During jury selection last week a handful of potential jurors were dismissed because of criticisms of LFTB, BPI or the company founders, the Sioux City Journal reported. The company's headquarters are not in Elk Point but some 20 miles (32 km) away. Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC, acknowledged the broadcasting company has no local ties during Monday's opening statements, but asked that jurors look beyond this and examine the facts. ABC maintains its reporting was fair and accurate.  No one that I will put on the stand is from here,  he said.  We're all outsiders,  BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion. The local newspaper, the Southern Union County Leader-Courier, has dubbed it  the trial of a lifetime.  BPI has moved four modular offices into town and purchased another building. ABC is renting Cody's Homestead, Jim Cody's shuttered, sun-faded steakhouse, the Leader-Courier reported. ABC declined to comment on the property. While the trial has not caused a traffic jam on Main Street as some had predicted, the Union County Courthouse was unusually busy this week. A parade of public relations staff, company officials and lawyers wheeled dozens of boxes of files under the court's mounted elk head after making the 30-minute drive from hotels in Sioux City, Iowa. Elk Point has only one hotel. On Tuesday, children sheepishly asked a security guard at the courthouse if they needed to walk through the new metal detector to drop off their farm club paperwork. They did not, he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/abc-pinkslime-town-idUSL1N1J626T"},

The Mexican currency clawed its way back to levels last seen before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president as higher oil prices helped lift emerging market currencies.     The peso strengthened to 18.1125 per dollar, its firmest level since Aug. 18, before retreating slightly.      Trump's election victory drove the currency to a record low on fears he would rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement.     But the peso rebounded and has been the best-performing major currency this year, up more than 14 percent against the dollar, as the Trump administration moved toward talks to renegotiate the NAFTA.     Data on Friday showed the number of bets by speculators for a stronger peso rose to a four-year high.     Long positions as of June 6 recorded by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rose to 115,601 contracts - the highest since late May 2013.     Some analysts think investors have become overconfident in further peso gains. Analysts at Citi this week warned they would not make big bets on further gains in the peso at these levels after analyzing other rallies in emerging market currencies seen since 2004.     In Brazil, yields paid on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts          dipped after annual inflation slowed to a 10-year low, spurring bets that the central bank would likely cut rates sharply next month.                  Rate futures' yields reflected the perception of a nearly 90 percent probability that Brazil's central bank would lower the benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points to 9.5 percent at its July monetary policy meeting           .     Investors unwound bets on a 50-basis-point reduction, an outlook that gained traction after the central bank said last month it could reduce the pace of cuts due to growing political uncertainty. The bank cut rates by 100 basis points in May.     In foreign exchange and stock markets, Brazilian traders were monitoring the deliberations of the country's top electoral court in a case that could unseat President Michel Temer if judges rule he used illegal campaign funding in 2014.     Even though the court seemed poised to toss out the case, the president faces a separate corruption investigation, stoking investor caution as Brazil's stocks and currency slipped.

(Reuters) - In this rural outpost of just over 1,900 residents, a local college student has become a courtroom sketch artist, trailers on Main Street are ersatz offices for a major law firm and members of an agricultural youth club are puzzled by a new  metal detector at the local courthouse.  The changes are part of Elk Point's selection as site of a multibillion-dollar defamation case pitting ABC News against South Dakota-meat processor, Beef Products Inc. The company contends that ABC and reporter Jim Avila defamed it by referring to its signature product as  pink slime  in 2012 broadcasts. BPI calls its product lean finely textured beef (LFTB).      The trial, scheduled to run eight weeks, opened on Monday. ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. While BPI could face an uphill battle to show ABC intended to harm the company or knew its reporting was false, as required to prove a defamation claim, several Elk Point residents interviewed by Reuters this week were sympathetic to BPI and its founder, Eldon Roth.   I used his products and they were good products,  said one longtime resident, Jim Cody, referring to Roth.  I couldn't believe that people were saying this crap about them.  Mark Turner, who owns LandMark Antiques & More, sells his own beef out of a small refrigerator in the shop. BPI is an industrialized meat processor with which he has little in common, Turner said. Even so, he felt ABC unfairly depicted LFTB.  Others, like Bobbye Wendt, who was hoping the trial would bring a boost in business for her coffee shop, were torn. ABC  could have just been reporting,  she said.  A reflection is seen along Main Street after a passing storm in Elk Point, South Dakota, U.S. June 3, 2017. Picture taken June 3, 2017.Ryan HenriksenDuring jury selection last week a handful of potential jurors were dismissed because of criticisms of LFTB, BPI or the company founders, the Sioux City Journal reported. The company's headquarters are not in Elk Point but some 20 miles (32 km) away.  Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC, acknowledged the broadcasting company has no local ties during Monday's opening statements, but asked that jurors look beyond this and examine the facts. ABC maintains its reporting was fair and accurate.   Slideshow (4 Images) No one that I will put on the stand is from here,  he said.  We're all outsiders,    BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion. The local newspaper, the Southern Union County Leader-Courier, has dubbed it  the trial of a lifetime.  BPI has moved four modular offices into town and purchased another building. ABC is renting Cody's Homestead, Jim Cody's shuttered, sun-faded steakhouse, the Leader-Courier reported. ABC declined to comment on the property. While the trial has not caused a traffic jam on Main Street as some had predicted, the Union County Courthouse was unusually busy this week.  A parade of public relations staff, company officials and lawyers wheeled dozens of boxes of files under the court's mounted elk head after making the 30-minute drive from hotels in Sioux City, Iowa. Elk Point has only one hotel. On Tuesday, children sheepishly asked a security guard at the courthouse if they needed to walk through the new metal detector to drop off their farm club paperwork.

With the Cuba policy review approaching its final stages, both sides of the issue have stepped up lobbying to sway Trump’s decision on how far to go in rolling back measures that Obama implemented after a 2015 breakthrough with America’s former Cold  War foe. In the letter, seven of Trump’s fellow Republicans expressed “deep concern” that he is considering rescinding Obama’s policies and said that such a move would “incentivize Cuba to once again become dependent on countries like Russia and China.” The warning reflected growing unease on Capitol Hill over returning to a more contentious approach to communist-ruled Cuba, even within a Republican party that has traditionally hewed to a harder line against Havana. Senior officials at the National Security Council were meeting on Friday to craft recommendations that will be sent to the principals committee - Trump’s top foreign policy advisers - and then to the president, people familiar with the matter said. Though divisions remain within the administration, Trump could make an announcement within weeks, possibly as early as mid- to late June in a speech in Miami, U.S. officials have said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump's changes are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored two years ago after more than five decades of hostility, administration officials say. Among the options under consideration are banning U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban enterprises tied to the military and tightening rules on Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions.  A White House official, asked about the latest meeting, said the Cuba review is still under way and “not final.” The U.S. airline and travel industries have made clear they do not want to see reinstatement of Cuba restrictions. But Trump has come under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, to roll back Obama’s rapprochement. “My hope is that when the administration is done with their review, they don’t let one or two voices overwhelm what is in the interest of the United States,” Representative Tom Emmer, a signatory to the letter, told Reuters. One of four pro-engagement Republicans who met with White House officials on Thursday, Emmer said they urged the administration not to go too far in rolling back Obama’s measures. Trump threatened shortly after his election in November to “terminate” Obama’s approach unless Cuba made concessions, something it is unlikely to do. Obama implemented his normalization measures through executive actions, and Trump has the power to undo much of it.

That is a large audience for a daytime event, though it is short of the 30.6 million who tuned in to President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Nielsen's estimates include people watching on 10 U.S. broadcast and cable television networks, but not those who streamed the congressional hearing on computers or mobile phones. Broadcasters interrupted regular programming to air nearly three hours of live coverage of Comey's remarks about his dealings with Trump before the president fired him in May. The tally was impressive for an event that aired during the work day, when typically only events like state funerals and royal weddings draw mass viewing, said Jeffrey Jones, director of journalism's Peabody Awards and a professor at the University of Georgia. Jones was traveling and saw crowds gathered around TVs in Atlanta's airport to watch the hearing.  Politics is quite often about theater and drama, and this was a classic showdown,  he said.  People wanted to see it for themselves.  The television ratings do not include the many people who watched the highly anticipated hearing during at bars and restaurants or online through TV network apps or on social media sites. Alphabet Inc's YouTube reported nearly 800,000 peak concurrent viewers across streams from 20 news outlets. Twitter Inc. said the average minute audience for its livestream of Bloomberg's coverage was 129,000 viewers. The year's most-watched television event is football's Super Bowl, which attracted 111 million viewers in February. Game Three of basketball's NBA Finals pulled in about 20 million for its primetime broadcast on Wednesday. During his appearance, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he believed Trump dismissed him to try to undermine a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia. Trump on Friday said Comey's testimony showed  no obstruction.  Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Leslie Adler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-ratings-idUSL1N1J61WN"},

The S&P; 500 information technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2.73 percent, with Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) down more than 3 percent each and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC losing 1.8 percent. The losses in just those three stocks wiped out more than $68 billion in investor wealth.  All you need is a spark. Everything has gotten pretty expensive, multiples are very high. It doesn't take much to get a decline started,  said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  A cautious report on technology valuations from Goldman Sachs helped ignite Friday's selling, as did a report from Bloomberg News that upcoming iPhones will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. (To view a graphic on 'Tech Stocks Hit a Big Bump' click reut.rs/2rKmdY5) But with the technology index up over 18 percent year to date, some investors said the selloff boiled down to straight-forward worries about valuations. They questioned whether the technology sector's rally may be coming to an end.   You have to be ready to make a sale if the momentum changes,  warned Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.  When it starts to erode, it could erode very quickly.      The information technology index recently traded at 18.4 times expected earnings, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Software company Cloudera (CLDR.N) tumbled 15.72 percent after its earnings report, while Wall Street favorite Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) slumped 6.46 percent to $149.60 after short seller Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. The decline in Nvidia, by far the top-performing stock in the S&P; 500 over the past year, contributed to a 4.23 percent drop in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX, its worst day in nearly a month. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia has surged 216 percent. Technology stocks are likely to remain under pressure until second-quarter earnings reports provide a new potential catalyst, predicted Wedbush trader Joel Kulina.  The sector showed signs of support late in Friday's session, with the Nasdaq reducing some of an earlier 2.9-percent loss. That reinforced some investors' expectations that the technology rally still has legs.  It signals that there's still money on the sidelines waiting to come in and buy the dip,  said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Money should come back into the stocks because investors are still looking for growth.

Shares of software company Cloudera (CLDR.N) also tumbled, shedding 15.6 percent after its quarterly results.  Tech has been on a tear for a very, very long ... time,  said John Praveen, managing director for Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey, adding that investors may be using the Cloudera quarterly results as  an excuse to take some profits.  Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe.   U.S. stocks had started Friday's session strong after the results of the UK election, in which British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not disruptive to the stock market. Market watchers had been concerned that the result of the Congressional hearing could derail President Donald Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P; 500 up 13.7 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates.  Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation,  Praveen said.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - A Minnesota police officer on trial for the fatal shooting of a black motorist during a traffic stop last year, the aftermath of which was streamed on social media by the driver's girlfriend, said on Friday he feared for his life. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was charged with second-degree manslaughter, sparked national outrage and triggered weeks of protests in St. Paul and Minneapolis after he fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, last July. On Friday, Yanez, who has pleaded not guilty, said at the Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul in sometimes emotional testimony that Castile disregarded the officer's commands and began reaching for a firearm he had disclosed he had in his possession. Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled for Monday.  I did not want to shoot Mr. Castile at all,  Yanez said as he took off his glasses and wiped away tears with a tissue.  That was not my intention.  I was scared to death. I thought I was going to die,  he said in response to questions from his attorney.  I had no other choice.  While holding a replica of Castile's 9mm handgun, Yanez told the jury he saw part of the gun's handle before opening fire. The police dashboard camera video showed Castile ignored two commands to avoid reaching for or pulling out his gun, Yanez's attorney, Paul Engh, said Monday. The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, like similar incidents across the United States, fueled public debate about appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. The police video of the traffic stop and the Facebook Live post by Castile's girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat next to him, were played in court Monday. Yanez fired seven shots, hitting Castile five times, including twice in the heart, prosecutors said. Reynolds said Tuesday she showed the video because she did not trust police. She testified she was afraid for her 4-year-old daughter, who was in the vehicle's back seat. Yanez has said he was justified in stopping Castile's car because he resembled a suspect in a convenience store robbery, court documents said. Castile's vehicle also had a broken brake light. After Castile was stopped, Yanez asked him to present his driver's license and insurance card. Castile disclosed he was carrying a licensed handgun. The exchange took just over a minute. Castile's gun permit was later found in his wallet. Writing by Ben Klayman; Editing by Bill Trott and Grant McCool","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-minnesota-police-idUSKBN1902J2"},

The S&P; 500 information technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2.73 percent, with Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) down more than 3 percent each and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC losing 1.8 percent. The losses in just those three stocks wiped out more than $68 billion in investor wealth.  All you need is a spark. Everything has gotten pretty expensive, multiples are very high. It doesn't take much to get a decline started,  said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  A cautious report on technology valuations from Goldman Sachs helped ignite Friday's selling, as did a report from Bloomberg News that upcoming iPhones will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. (To view a graphic on 'Tech Stocks Hit a Big Bump' click reut.rs/2rKmdY5) But with the technology index up over 18 percent year to date, some investors said the selloff boiled down to straight-forward worries about valuations. They questioned whether the technology sector's rally may be coming to an end.   You have to be ready to make a sale if the momentum changes,  warned Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.  When it starts to erode, it could erode very quickly.      The information technology index recently traded at 18.4 times expected earnings, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Software company Cloudera (CLDR.N) tumbled 15.72 percent after its earnings report, while Wall Street favorite Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) slumped 6.46 percent to $149.60 after short seller Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. The decline in Nvidia, by far the top-performing stock in the S&P; 500 over the past year, contributed to a 4.23 percent drop in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX, its worst day in nearly a month. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia has surged 216 percent. Technology stocks are likely to remain under pressure until second-quarter earnings reports provide a new potential catalyst, predicted Wedbush trader Joel Kulina.  The sector showed signs of support late in Friday's session, with the Nasdaq reducing some of an earlier 2.9-percent loss. That reinforced some investors' expectations that the technology rally still has legs.  It signals that there's still money on the sidelines waiting to come in and buy the dip,  said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Money should come back into the stocks because investors are still looking for growth.

When researchers examined data from facial images for 415 one-year-old children, they found subtle changes in babies’ faces mostly around the nose, eyes and lips associated with almost all levels of alcohol exposure regardless of whether drinking occurred only in the first trimester or throughout the pregnancy.  “We are surprised to see these differences in facial shape with low doses of alcohol exposure, which in our study was defined as two standard drinks on any one occasion and no more than seven in a week,” said lead study author Evelyne Muggli of the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne in Australia.  “This means that any level of alcohol contributes to the way the face is formed and raises questions about the possible impact on brain development, which is the subject of further research,” Muggli said by email.  The facial changes found in the study are so subtle they aren’t visible to the naked eye, Muggli said. They can only be seen with sophisticated three-dimensional facial shape analysis, and they don’t necessarily mean that unborn babies have been harmed if mothers consumed some alcohol while pregnant, Muggli added.  But differences around the middle of the face and nose seen with alcohol exposure during pregnancy in the study resemble anomalies associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.  Differences were most pronounced between children with no exposure to alcohol in utero and children with low exposure in the first trimester, particularly in the forehead, the study found.  Compared to children not exposed to any alcohol when their mothers were pregnant, kids with moderate to high exposure in the first trimester had differences in their eyes, mid-face and chin. Changes in the chin were also seen with binge drinking in the first trimester  Most women who do drink during pregnancy only drink a little bit and often stop once they realize they’re pregnant, limiting fetal alcohol exposure to the first trimester, Carol Bower of the University of Western Australia writes in an accompanying editorial.  Up to about one in 20 children may be affected by fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which can lead to cognitive impairment including irreversible brain damage.  Children exposed to alcohol in the womb may have learning challenges such as deficits in memory or speech as well as behavior problems like hyperactivity.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if different levels of alcohol exposure at different points in pregnancy might impact children’s faces, or cause specific developmental problems. In addition, all of the children in the study were white, and it’s possible facial changes associated with alcohol exposure during pregnancy might look different in children from other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers note.   Even so, the findings add to a growing body of evidence on the fetal development effects of even low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, said Heather Carmichael Olson, of the University of Washington School of Medicine.  “It is a substance that can change fetal development, and can be associated with lifelong changes in learning and behavior,” Carmichael Olson, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “If any amount of prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to physical changes in fetal development, as the current study suggests, so that it’s not just high doses or long-term drinking that have measurable effects, the safest advice that providers can give is that women who want a healthy pregnancy should avoid this biological risk factor if they are considering pregnancy or are pregnant,” Carmichael Olson added.

(Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday warned graduates at MIT, a pioneer in fields like computers and robots, about technology's dehumanizing aspects and urged them to infuse its development with their own values.  I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans,  Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence.  Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge.  Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything,  the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) chief executive said.  That part takes all of us.  Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world's most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Apple CEO Tim Cook waves after speaking during Commencement Exercises at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., June 9, 2017.Brian SnyderCook has criticized President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president's expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account.  “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.,” Cook said. Slideshow (6 Images)His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely.

Facebook Inc (FB.O) fell 3.3 percent, its biggest decline since November 2016, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) ended down 3.4 percent, its worst day since June 2016. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) fell 2.3 percent. chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) closed down 6.5 percent at $149.60 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130.  Kepner said the combination of the comments on Nvidia and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about tech stocks was leading to a  little air coming out of the balloon.  Shares of software company Cloudera (CLDR.N) also tumbled, shedding 15.6 percent after its quarterly results.

Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe.   U.S. stocks had started Friday's session strong after the results of the UK election, in which British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not disruptive to the stock market. Market watchers had been concerned that the result of the Congressional hearing could derail President Donald Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P; 500 up 13.7 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates.  Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation,  Praveen said. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

This week, the Trump administration backtracked, catching lawmakers off guard and alarming civil liberties advocates who say it is critical to know as Congress weighs changes to a law expiring at the end of the year that permits some of the National Security Agency's most sweeping espionage.  The NSA has made Herculean, extensive efforts to devise a counting strategy that would be accurate,  Dan Coats, a career Republican politician appointed by Republican President Donald Trump as the top U.S. intelligence official, testified to a Senate panel on Wednesday. Coats said  it remains infeasible to generate an exact, accurate, meaningful, and responsive methodology that can count how often a U.S. person's communications may be collected  under the law known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that even if he dedicated more resources the NSA would not be able to calculate an estimate, which privacy experts have said could be in the millions.

This week, the Trump administration backtracked, catching lawmakers off guard and alarming civil liberties advocates who say it is critical to know as Congress weighs changes to a law expiring at the end of the year that permits some of the National Security Agency's most sweeping espionage.  The NSA has made Herculean, extensive efforts to devise a counting strategy that would be accurate,  Dan Coats, a career Republican politician appointed by Republican President Donald Trump as the top U.S. intelligence official, testified to a Senate panel on Wednesday.  Coats said  it remains infeasible to generate an exact, accurate, meaningful, and responsive methodology that can count how often a U.S. person's communications may be collected  under the law known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that even if he dedicated more resources the NSA would not be able to calculate an estimate, which privacy experts have said could be in the millions.

Canada's job growth accelerated in May at its fastest pace in eight months, prompting economists to suggest the Bank of Canada could raise interest rates sooner than anticipated.

The children, ages 7, 14, 15 and 16, were treated free of charge at Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia.  Their travel and housing expenses were covered by the Global Medical Relief Fund, a New York-based charity that helps children who have been injured in conflicts or disasters.   When they come here, they have lost so much. They have lost part of their youth and part of their dignity,  said Elissa Montanti, founder of the fund, who housed them in the New York City borough of Staten Island.  We put them back together,  she said.  When they go back, they have a stronger sense of empowerment.  To stay in the United States, the children would have to file for asylum, and the fund can only afford to pay for the them while they receive medical care, Montanti said.      Albinism is a congenital disorder that causes lack of pigment in skin, hair and eyes. According to the World Health Organization, in sub-Saharan Africa 1 in 5,000 to 15,000 people could be affected. In Tanzania, it affects about 1 in 1,400.     Albinos are attacked for their body parts, which are highly prized in witchcraft and can fetch a high price. Superstition  leads many people in Tanzania to believe that albinos are ghosts who bring bad luck.

They typically visited the hospital five times during their two to three month stay.    Slideshow (20 Images)Mwigulu Magesa, 14, said he wants to be president of Tanzania one day. Emmanuel Rutema, 15, wants to be a doctor. Though they have a good grasp of English, which they study at home, the children were accompanied by Ester Rwela, a translator and social worker with the charity Under the Same Sun, which advocates for people with albinism.   The first time the Tanzanian kids came in, there was not a lot of conversation. They were extremely shy. They kind of huddled together in a pack,  said Dr. Scott Kozin, chief of staff at Shriners Hospital.      They weren't used to us and we weren't used to them, and there were a lot of awkward moments. And then as they got to know us, they started to open up to me and to the staff and to the therapists,  he said.     The children are able to attach and adjust prosthetic arms to their bodies, wash their laundry by hand and hang it to dry and make dinner. Near the end of their stay, they would walk into the hospital with confidence, sporting sunglasses and button-down shirts and looking  like they were home,  Kozin said.

Comey delivered scathing remarks about the president on Thursday at a congressional hearing and testified that Trump had asked him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia. Trump says Comey's testimony also vindicated him from allegations that he colluded with Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true,  Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Asked by a reporter if he had told Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Flynn, Trump said,  I didn't say that.  The reporter then asked,  So he lied about that?   Well, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that,  Trump replied.  And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today, but I did not say that,  he said. In his testimony, Comey also said Trump asked him in January to pledge loyalty to the president, an unusual request that would put in doubt the independence of the FBI.  I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that?  Trump said at joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. Comey's testimony was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years. The issue of the Trump election campaign's relationship with Russia has dogged Trump's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and alleged Russian meddling. Asked on Friday if he would be willing to go under oath to give his version of his interactions with Comey, Trump replied,  100 percent.  He said he would be happy to speak to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia interfered with the election and colluded with Trump's campaign.  I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you,  Trump told a reporter. Trump’s offer to testify under oath would pit his word against Comey’s before federal investigators. If either Trump’s testimony or memos written by Comey about his conversations with the president turn out to be untrue, either man could be charged with lying to federal investigators. A U.S. president is given a wide array of immunities from criminal prosecutions. The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted, and the area is the subject of legal debate. A president can be charged after leaving office. Trump wrote earlier on Friday on Twitter that the former FBI head had vindicated him by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had not been personally under investigation in the Russia probe. With a single tweet, Trump also castigated Comey as  a leaker  for giving an account of his conversation with the president to a law professor who shared it with a news outlet.  Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication ... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!  Trump tweeted.

Tomorrow’s News 2017 delved into Reuters exclusive survey results of reader trends on news consumption, featuring a panel discussion debating the findings. Edward Roussel, Chief Innovation Officer of the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones; Brian Braiker, Editor of Advertising Age; Cory Haik, Publisher of Mic; and Christopher Graves, President of Ogilvy Center for Behavioral Science, joined Reuters Editor-at-Large Axel Threlfall for a lively discussion of fake news, trust, social media and consumer behavior and perceptions of news brands.  Slideshow (3 Images)Among the highlights:   Braiker noted that a lot of ads are going places that brands and advertisers have no control over and are lining the pockets of people producing fake news. “Brands are increasingly aware of this and the mainstream culture is more increasingly aware of this. So they’re working to implement checks and balances, increasing transparency” about where ads are going. “Until now it’s been a black box, and that’s sort of cracking open a little more.” On fake news, Graves said the danger is the repetition. “It’s not just one story. It’s the hammering and the reverberation and the repetition—it’s called an availability cascade. And if you keep seeing the same story coming back at you, you not only confirm your own bias, you begin to kind of think, ‘well, I’ve heard that before,’ whether it’s lying Ted, crooked Hillary or any meme that you create. So the weaponization through tech becomes so different from just having a false story.” Haik said facts and trust matter more than ever. “How do we expose the process of what we do, how do we help to make that more transparent to everyone? So that’s how we’re fighting the fight internally, and making sure that when we actually have some analysis or some opinion to share off of the news, that it’s very clear that we’re basing that in facts. This is not a moment to despair…this is the moment to do our jobs.” Roussel said “the barriers are coming down in a dangerous way at some news organizations, where they’re conflating opinion and news, and they have to be kept distinct; that if you’re reporting the news, it’s fundamental you’re getting the facts right, which is hard enough in itself, and you want to keep the opinion elsewhere.”  Reuters also unveiled Reuters Plus at the event, the award-winning full-service custom content studio that builds on 165 years of Reuters expertise and news infrastructure to deliver world-class content to brands and agencies.

(Reuters) - During his trial on sex assault charges, Bill Cosby has mostly remained silent in court and avoided reporters' questions. But when fans have called out to him outside the courtroom, the 79-year-old has responded with attempts at humor. Mugging in front of the cameras this week after a fan said it was her birthday, he asked,  How old?  When the woman replied,  49,  he did a mock stumble in an apparent reference to a famous standup special he did about the challenges of nearing 50 years of age. On another occasion, Cosby responded to a fan by offering up the famous  Hey, hey, hey  catchphrase from Fat Albert, the animated character he voiced in the 1970s. Inside the courtroom, he has been largely expressionless, his only reactions an occasional chuckle at a courtroom joke or a shake of the head as two of his accusers testified that he drugged and sexually abused them. On Wednesday, in the midst of testimony from the main accuser, Andrea Constand, Cosby was walking down a hallway when a court officer spotted someone using a cell phone.  Put that phone away!  the officer thundered, worried the person may have been trying to snap a photo. Cosby, who is legally blind, jumped at the shout before pointing his cane like a weapon at the officer and saying,  What'd you say?  as observers tittered. Cosby's career has been derailed by dozens of sexual assault allegations from women stretching back decades, all of which he has denied. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby walks back into the courtroom after a break during the fifth day of Cosby's sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 9, 2017.Lucas Jackson      TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYHis interactions with fans outside the courthouse, coupled with a parade of show business friends who have attended the trial in support, have signaled he is intent on repairing his public image. His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told Reuters that Cosby got into his vehicle after a fan interaction outside court and told him,  Restoration of legacy,  showing his reputation is on his mind. In an interview before the trial, Cosby told a radio host that he hopes to resume touring afterward.  I still feel that I have an awful lot to offer in terms of my writing, in terms of my performance,  he said. A handful of protesters have at times stood outside the courthouse, yelling  guilty  as Cosby walked by. Conspicuously absent from the proceedings thus far has been Cosby's wife of 53 years, Camille Cosby. Instead, he has been accompanied each day by actors and comedian friends, including Keisha Knight Pulliam, the woman who played his youngest daughter Rudy Huxtable on the 1980s television comedy,  The Cosby Show.  Cosby's spokesman Wyatt said Camille Cosby continues to stand by her husband and may still attend the trial at some point, though he added that Bill Cosby wants to protect his family from the media frenzy. Wyatt, who is staying at Cosby's Pennsylvania home where Constand says she was assaulted in 2004, said Cosby recognizes the gravity of his situation but has remained confident and in good spirits.  He's Bill Cosby,  Wyatt told Reuters.  He's the greatest comedian of all time. Trust me, he takes this matter very seriously. But he has to continue being who he is: someone who loves laughter, loves comedy, loves life.

The defense ministry said it was  responding to distress calls from multiple sailing vessels,  coordinating efforts with marine rescue centers from the United States, Portugal and Britain. A Canadian frigate and two coastguard ships, as well as two civilian tankers, were en route in response to calls from three yachts damaged by the storm, ministry spokesman Daniel Le Bouthillier said by e-mail.  At least one vessel is dismasted, with others having rigging and or hull damage,  he said. The Canadian ships should arrive in 24 to 72 hours. Canada has also sent two long-range search-and-rescue aircraft. The vessels, carrying one or two sailors each, were sailing from Plymouth, England to Newport, Rhode Island as part of the Royal Western Yacht Club's single-handed and two-handed transatlantic race. The three boats are single-hulled vessels under 50 feet in length and the crews are experienced, Le Bouthillier said. None of the sailors in trouble is Canadian. The military said conditions in the mid-Atlantic remained difficult, with 10-15 meter (32-49 feet) seas and 50-70 knot (58-81 mph) winds. Sustained winds of 64 knots or greater are considered hurricane force. Twenty-one vessels from about a dozen countries began the race, departing Plymouth on May 29, according to the yacht club's website.

Moody's is the only major ratings agency to retain South Africa's investment grade status after Fitch and S&P; Global Ratings downgraded the credit rating of Africa's most industrialised economy to speculative or  junk status.  But Moody's lowering by a notch from Baa2 to Baa3, the bottom of the investment grade table, will be a cause for concern in Pretoria as the Treasury strives to convince investors it is serious about governance and fiscal discipline.  Recent events, particularly but not exclusively the abrupt March Cabinet reshuffle, illustrate a gradual erosion of institutional strength,  Moody's said, referring to the sacking of highly respected former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Moody's said  reduced growth prospects  were another driver behind its decision. South Africa sank into recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, led by weakness in consumer sectors such as wholesale, retail trade and accommodation. The ratings agency also cited a   ... continued erosion of fiscal strength. Lower levels of growth and heightened uncertainty about policy direction and policymakers' commitment to structural reforms have increased the risk of a weakening of the government balance sheet.  South Africa relies heavily on foreign money to cover its large budget and current account deficits but could struggle to attract investment if political tensions linger on and economic growth does not return. Investors fear policy steps to spur on the economy and keep debt in check are taking a backseat to corruption scandals and the jostling for positions as President Jacob Zuma's ruling African National Congress (ANC) prepares for a major policy conference and the election of new leaders later this year. South African debt has already been dropped from one the widely used global bond indexes, the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index Global, and risks being excluded from the larger Citi's World Government Bond Index, if both Moody's and S&P;'s cut the rand-debt rating to  junk . South Africa's long-term local-currency bond and deposit ceilings were also lowered to A2 from A1, and the long-term and short-term foreign-currency bond ceilings lowered to A3/P-2 from A2/P-1, respectively.

(Reuters) - United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing (BA.N) said on Friday it was not given an opportunity to bid against rival SpaceX for the upcoming launch of the U.S. Air Force’s miniature X-37B space plane. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson disclosed during congressional testimony on Tuesday that the service was planning to fly its fifth X-37B mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. “ULA did not have the opportunity to bid for the Air Force’s fifth X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) mission which was recently awarded.

The Air Force on Friday declined to confirm that it awarded the contract to Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, without soliciting other bids. It also declined to say when the contract was awarded or how much it is worth.  Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets.  SpaceX’s first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018. A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at $83 million and $96.5 million respectively.  United Launch Alliance did not bid for the first GPS launch contract but did compete and lost the second. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9.

The children, ages 7, 14, 15 and 16, were treated free of charge at Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia.  Their travel and housing expenses were covered by the Global Medical Relief Fund, a New York-based charity that helps children who have been injured in conflicts or disasters.   When they come here, they have lost so much. They have lost part of their youth and part of their dignity,  said Elissa Montanti, founder of the fund, who housed them in the New York City borough of Staten Island.  We put them back together,  she said.  When they go back, they have a stronger sense of empowerment.  To stay in the United States, the children would have to file for asylum, and the fund can only afford to pay for the them while they receive medical care, Montanti said.      Albinism is a congenital disorder that causes lack of pigment in skin, hair and eyes. According to the World Health Organization, in sub-Saharan Africa 1 in 5,000 to 15,000 people could be affected. In Tanzania, it affects about 1 in 1,400.     Albinos are attacked for their body parts, which are highly prized in witchcraft and can fetch a high price. Superstition  leads many people in Tanzania to believe that albinos are ghosts who bring bad luck. Pendo Noni, 16, a Tanzanian with albinism who had an arm chopped off in a witchcraft-driven attack, looks at her prosthetic hook at the Global Medical Relief Fund house in the Staten Island borough of New York City, U.S., June 2, 2017.Carlo AllegriThe United Nations estimates that at least 75 albinos were killed in Tanzania between 2000 and 2015 but says that could represent a fraction of the attacks as most occur in secretive rituals in rural areas.  Cartoons, Youtube Help Healing  As they moved through the stages of treatment and recovery, drawing, talking among themselves in Swahili, searching for YouTube videos on Google and watching cartoons helped the children heal. They typically visited the hospital five times during their two to three month stay.    Slideshow (20 Images)Mwigulu Magesa, 14, said he wants to be president of Tanzania one day. Emmanuel Rutema, 15, wants to be a doctor. Though they have a good grasp of English, which they study at home, the children were accompanied by Ester Rwela, a translator and social worker with the charity Under the Same Sun, which advocates for people with albinism.   The first time the Tanzanian kids came in, there was not a lot of conversation. They were extremely shy. They kind of huddled together in a pack,  said Dr. Scott Kozin, chief of staff at Shriners Hospital.      They weren't used to us and we weren't used to them, and there were a lot of awkward moments. And then as they got to know us, they started to open up to me and to the staff and to the therapists,  he said.     The children are able to attach and adjust prosthetic arms to their bodies, wash their laundry by hand and hang it to dry and make dinner. Near the end of their stay, they would walk into the hospital with confidence, sporting sunglasses and button-down shirts and looking  like they were home,  Kozin said.

A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Minnesota jury had enough evidence to conclude in 2015 that Toyota was 60 percent liable for the crash and that the driver of the Camry, Koua Fong Lee, was 40 percent liable. Lee was criminally charged in connection with the crash and served nearly three years in prison for vehicular homicide, according to his lawyer, Robert Hilliard. In 2010, when reports of unintended acceleration in other Toyota vehicles surfaced, Lee won a motion to set aside his conviction, and he was released from prison. The car in the accident was not covered by Toyota's recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2010 over acceleration issues.  I'm grateful to the 8th Circuit but I'm also relieved for Mr. Lee's family,  Hilliard said of Friday's decision.  We sympathize with everyone affected by this unfortunate accident from 2006,  Toyota said in a statement.  While we respect the 8th Circuit's decision, we continue to believe the evidence shows that Mr. Lee's 1996 Camry was well-designed and was not the cause of this accident.  A lawyer representing other people injured in the accident could not immediately be reached for comment. The Minnesota trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed on behalf of passengers injured or killed in the 2006 crash in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lee, who later joined the lawsuit, said he was driving his 1996 Toyota Camry when it inexplicably began to accelerate as he approached other vehicles stopped at an intersection. The Camry slammed into an Oldsmobile Ciera, killing the driver, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., as well as his 9-year-old son, according to the 2010 lawsuit. A 6-year-old girl who was also in the car was paralyzed and later died. Two other passengers were seriously injured, according to the lawsuit. Though it upheld the jury's findings, the 8th Circuit on Friday did find that the trial court judge had improperly calculated the damages for Bridgette Trice, mother of the 6-year-old, Devyn Bolton, and ordered that the amount be recalculated.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/toyota-accident-verdict-idUSL1N1J621O"},

The move was part of a policy change initiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the United States and whom the government considered no threat to public safety. Instead, the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes. Last month, things changed again for the painter, who has lived in the United States illegally since 2005 and has a U.S.-born child. He received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar, citing another shift in priorities, this time by President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who, like Velasquez, had been given a reprieve from deportation, according to government data and court documents reviewed by Reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers. Trump signaled in January that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation, but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases. It represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by Trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation. While cases were reopened during the Obama administration as well, it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime, immigration attorneys say. The Trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen, and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed. Between March 1 and May 31, prosecutors moved to reopen 1,329 cases, according to a Reuters' analysis of data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR. The Obama administration filed 430 similar motions during the same period in 2016. (For a graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2s8csUZ) Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had  since been arrested for or convicted of a crime.  It is not possible to tell from the EOIR data how many of the cases the Trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed. Attorneys interviewed by Reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes, but they are also seeing cases involving people who haven't committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations, like traffic tickets.  This is a sea change, said attorney David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Before, if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat, then it would be reopened. Now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people.  Elzea said the agency reviews cases,  to see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate.  Policy Shifts After Obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes, prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases. Between January 2012 and Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the government shelved some 81,000 cases, according to Reuters' data analysis. These so-called  administrative closures  did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed, but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation. Trump signed an executive order overturning the Obama-era policy on Jan. 25. Under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, anyone in the country illegally is a potential target. In cases reviewed by Reuters, the administration explicitly cited Trump's executive order in 30 separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket. (For a link to an excerpted document: tmsnrt.rs/2sI6aby) Since immigration cases aren't generally public, Reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys. In the 32 reopened cases examined by Reuters: --22 involved immigrants who, according to their attorneys, had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed. --Two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed: domestic violence and driving under the influence. --At least six of the cases involved minor infractions, including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets, or driving without a valid license, according to the attorneys. In Velasquez's case, for example, he was cited for driving without a license in Tennessee, where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses, he said.  I respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work,  he said.  I don't understand why this is happening.  Motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in 32 states, with the highest numbers in California, Florida and Virginia, according to Reuters' review of EOIR data. The bulk of the examples reviewed by Reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the New Orleans ICE office. Pumpkin Seed Arrest Sally Joyner, an immigration attorney in Memphis, Tennessee said one of her Central American clients, who crossed the border with her children in 2013, was allowed to stay in the United States after the government filed a motion to close her case in December 2015. Since crossing the border, the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement, said Joyner, who asked that her client's name not be used because of the pending legal action. Nevertheless, on March 29, ICE filed a two-page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children. When Joyner queried ICE, an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in El Salvador, according to documents seen by Reuters. The woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor. Government documents show U.S. authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed. Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of 580,000 pending immigration cases.  If we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made, it clearly generates more work,  she said.  It's a judicial do-over.

The Pittsburgh Penguins center is one win away from captaining his team to its second Stanley Cup in a row, and third during his career. That could happen as early as Sunday in Game Six in Nashville against the Predators. Yet Crosby doesn't gush, at least not publicly. Consider his description of the opening couple minutes Thursday in Game Five of the Stanley Cup Final when Crosby launched the Penguins toward a 6-0 win and a 3-2 series lead.  We had a great start,  he said.  Wanted to make sure that we played on our toes. I thought we did a great job of that.  Here's what really happened: Crosby, on the game's first shift, carried the puck over the blue line and bulled his way through strong Nashville defensive pair Roman Josi and Ryan Ellis. He drew a holding penalty against Ellis while ringing a shot off the left post.

Mandatory Credit: Don Wright-USA TODAY SportsOn the ensuing power play, Crosby set up Justin Schultz for a 1-0 lead, and the tone for the game was set. Crosby finished with three assists to reach 27 points, one behind Pittsburgh center Evgeni Malkin for the NHL postseason scoring lead. Crosby, Malkin and playoffs goals leader Jake Guentzel would seem to be the favorites to win the playoff MVP if the Penguins close out the series. Slideshow (3 Images)If Crosby, 29, wins that trophy, he will match the two that Penguins owner and Hall of Fame center Mario Lemieux won. Asked about being so close to lifting the Cup again, Crosby quickly reverted to form.  Still a lot of work to be done, but the way we played (Thursday) night, if we can build off that momentum that's important, but we know we're going to face a desperate team,  he said. What Crosby does, rather than what he says, is what counts.  What I've really grown to admire and respect about Sid is not only is he a talented player, because there's a lot of talented players; I just think he has such a drive to be the best, and he's willing to do what it takes,  coach Mike Sullivan said.  He doesn't just show up to the rink and put his equipment on. He controls everything within his power to be the very best.

The peso firmed to 18.1125 pesos per dollar, its best level since Aug. 18, but then pulled back a bit to trade around 18.17 per dollar, about 0.1 percent stronger on the day. Trump's election victory drove the currency to a record low on fears he would rip up a trade deal with Mexico. But the peso has bounced back and it has been the best-performing major currency this year, up more than 14 percent against the dollar, as the Trump administration moved toward talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.  The peso has more room to appreciate,  said Marco Oviedo, an economist at Barclays in Mexico City, citing fewer clouds over the NAFTA deal, as well as less concern about Mexico's political landscape combined with bets on higher interest rates.  The peso gained ground this week after data on Thursday showed a jump in inflation to an eight-year high that backed expectations of more central bank interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates lift the appeal of the peso to foreign investors. That added to gains seen Monday after the ruling party managed to hold onto the governorship in the populous State of Mexico, according to preliminary results.  President Enrique Pena Nieto's PRI party fended off a challenge there from new leftist party founded by populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leads in early polls for next year's presidential race. Analysts have warned that signs Lopez Obrador is gaining ground could weigh on the peso due to uncertainty about what he could do to free-market reforms seen under Pena Nieto, such as an opening of the energy sector to private investment.  Data on Friday showed the number of bets by speculators for a stronger peso rose to a four-year high.  Long positions recorded by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data rose to 115,601 contracts, the highest since late May 2013, as of June 6, the latest data.

(Reuters) - United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing (BA.N) said on Friday it was not given an opportunity to bid against rival SpaceX for the upcoming launch of the U.S. Air Force’s miniature X-37B space plane. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson disclosed during congressional testimony on Tuesday that the service was planning to fly its fifth X-37B mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. “ULA did not have the opportunity to bid for the Air Force’s fifth X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) mission which was recently awarded. ULA remains fully committed to continuing to support America’s national security missions with world-class launch services,” the company said in a statement. Only United Launch Alliance and SpaceX are certified to launch U.S. military satellites. The Air Force on Friday declined to confirm that it awarded the contract to Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, without soliciting other bids. It also declined to say when the contract was awarded or how much it is worth.  Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets.  SpaceX’s first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018. A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at $83 million and $96.5 million respectively.  United Launch Alliance did not bid for the first GPS launch contract but did compete and lost the second. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9. The mission, which was arranged through an intermediary, Ball Aerospace, took place last month.

Canada's job growth accelerated in May at its fastest pace in eight months, Statistics Canada said. Employers added 54,500 jobs, handily topping economists' forecast for a gain of 11,000.                   If you compared these (full-time employment) numbers to what they would have to be in the States, you'd be looking at three-quarters of a million jobs  there, said David Bradley, director of foreign exchange trading at Scotiabank.  The (U.S.) dollar would go crazy over a number like that.      At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3463 to the greenback, or 74.28 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     It had gotten to C$1.3424 after the data, its strongest since May 29, after touching its weakest since June 2 at C$1.3545 in overnight trade.     The greenback was itself higher against a basket of currencies       , helped by a sharp drop in the British pound        after the country's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election.                   In other domestic data, industrial capacity use rose to its highest since 2007 in the first quarter, lifted by manufacturing and construction.                  Perceived chances of an interest rate increase this year rose to nearly 30 percent soon after the jobs report versus 22 percent before, data from the overnight index swaps market showed. It was last at 26 percent           .      It is just another piece of information that suggests that the Bank of Canada could be tightening maybe a little bit earlier than markets are pricing,  said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.     The foreign exchange options market is showing much less risk of a sharp drop in the Canadian dollar than before last November's U.S. election, which could spell bad news for speculators who have heavily shorted the underperforming currency.                  Net short positions on the loonie were trimmed for a second straight week to 94,501 contracts as of June 6, from 98,187 a week earlier, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed, but held near a record high.      Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 4 Canadian cents to yield 0.737 percent and the benchmark 10-year             slipping 5 Canadian cents to yield 1.423 percent.

The New Zealander had not only been at the receiving end of one of the most spectacular sporting comebacks in San Francisco, he was then dumped as skipper by Emirates Team New Zealand. Yet this month in Bermuda, the 44-year-old was back in the hunt, reborn as skipper and CEO of SoftBank Team Japan, the first Japanese challenge for the America's Cup in 17 years. While Barker's poker face and sunglasses hid his emotions as he raced, his wit, warmth and wisdom shone through in the post-match briefings, even when things were not going his way. After he was knocked out of the contest by Sweden's Artemis Racing on Friday, Barker was positive in defeat.  The main emotion is an immense pride in what we have achieved in two years ... we started with nothing,  Barker told a televised news briefing.  It's been a fantastic honour and a privilege to be running a new team... and I would not trade that for anything.  While it was  too early to say  whether SoftBank Team Japan would be back for another shot at the cup, Barker said he hoped they had a future given the fan base they have built up in both Japan and New Zealand, where many of the team are from.  There's a few things that need sorting out before we have that certainty,  he added. Barker on Board? Whether Barker will be part of another campaign with Japan is also up in the air.  I really haven't given it any thought. We will have to see...  he said of his own future, adding that he had always said he loved racing and would like to continue. But Barker's performance on Bermuda's Great Sound has been mixed. At times his tactical and sailing brilliance shone bright, while at others he was punished for his errors.  Clearly there were mistakes,  he said of the last race, while pointing out that his opponents had also made some. Whether SoftBank Team Japan do return to fulfil their sponsor's aim of bringing the cup to Japan may depend on who triumphs in this month's competition. If Oracle Team USA or Artemis Racing win, a framework has been agreed among five of the teams for taking it through to the next event, once again in the high-octane foiling catamarans which have proved popular with sailors and broadcasters. But if New Zealand emerge victorious, they have said they will look to return to the cup's less structured roots, something which might make it harder for SoftBank Team Japan, who bought their design from the holders, to commit to. Whoever wins, Barker is adamant that the so-called Framework Agreement signed earlier this year by the British, U.S., French, Swedish and Japanese teams is the way forward. He will certainly be back out on the water this week, as a sparring partner for his former foe Jimmy Spithill, skipper of Oracle Team USA.

Conservative leader May, who managed to blow an election she herself called as Prime Minister sitting on a 20-point lead, will now try to form a coalition “government of certainty” with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. Having bluffed before the vote that “no deal is better than a bad deal,” May will now find herself in a yet weaker position, vulnerable to losing her leadership or being forced to go yet again to the country for a general election, and just as negotiations over the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union begin on June 19. That “no deal” would have been a disaster, with 10-to-14 percent tariffs for many British exports to Europe helping to catapult the economy into recession. Many are now clinging to hopes that May’s drubbing makes moderate 'remain' Conservatives more powerful, or that it allows Labour, which made a hard Brexit part of its election manifesto, to backtrack towards something more 'soft,' retaining rights and privileges for Britain’s economy in Europe. The only 'certainty' this government can truthfully promise is that the economic, industrial and competitive position of Britain will be worse in two years than it is today. Hopes that a weaker or stronger May might lead to a better or worse deal are misplaced and, worse, mislead those doing the hoping in where the motive force lies. The problem, as ever, is the anglocentric slant of the narrative. Once Britain voted for Brexit it was no longer in the driving seat, no longer the prime actor, and decades of behaving, against all evidence, that it was will now hit a hard wall. Britain, to use the metaphor of markets, is not a price maker in Brexit negotiations; it is a price taker. It does not get to set the price; that privilege and right belong to its EU negotiating partners, who are united and who hold most of the cards. Britain’s main power is in the right to pass on the price being offered, a decision, in the case of Brexit, with some particularly unpleasant consequences. “This doesn’t make the Brexit negotiations any easier,” Robeco Chief Economist Léon Cornelissen wrote to clients. “With a hung parliament it’s difficult to see how they’ll be able to make an upfront deal on the up to GBP 100 billion of divorce payments that are being demanded by the EU. What’s most likely now is a coalition between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists, but it would be an unworkable razor-thin majority. So a collapse of the government is likely, with perhaps new elections in October.” Would You Like a Recession With That, Sir? A so-called Norway-style deal, with access to the European Economic Area allowing for UK financial services to be 'passported' in to Europe, sounds attractive but is almost certainly a pipe dream, one German politicians have already explicitly rejected. It also implies continued commitment to the EU four freedoms of movement of goods, services, labor and capital. “We do not see that happening, unless the new Parliament votes to defy referendum results and reverse the course of Brexit. We do not see that happening either,” Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics wrote to clients. “So Britain’s exporters will export to Europe at a disadvantage and the City will be gutted of core businesses.” This will happen, of course, only after long and destabilizing negotiations and very possibly further changes of government. The chances that investment in Britain is deferred or diverted are high. Already the signs are not entirely great for the British economy. British GDP growth in the first quarter, at 0.2 percent from the fourth quarter, was the weakest in Europe. Data out on Friday showed construction sector output is in recession, down 0.6 percent from a year ago, very likely due to slowing flows of capital from abroad. Two surveys of consumer spending released this week, from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard, both showed consumer spending growth has all but halted. Like-for-like spending fell 0.4 percent last month, according to BRC data. Demand for new vehicles also fell by 8.5 percent. All of this is no surprise: living standards are being hit; pinched between stagnant wages and rising prices, some of it due to a slump in the pound. Brexit, from conception to execution, will stay true to its form as a great miscalculation.

The move was part of a policy change initiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the United States and whom the government considered no threat to public safety. Instead, the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes.  Last month, things changed again for the painter, who has lived in the United States illegally since 2005 and has a U.S.-born child. He received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar, citing another shift in priorities, this time by President Donald Trump.  The Trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who, like Velasquez, had been given a reprieve from deportation, according to government data and court documents reviewed by Reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers.  Trump signaled in January that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation, but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases.  It represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by Trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation.  While cases were reopened during the Obama administration as well, it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime, immigration attorneys say. The Trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen, and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed.  Between March 1 and May 31, prosecutors moved to reopen 1,329 cases, according to a Reuters' analysis of data from the Executive Office of Immigration Review, or EOIR. The Obama administration filed 430 similar motions during the same period in 2016.     Infographic ID: '2s8csUZ'     Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had  since been arrested for or convicted of a crime.   It is not possible to tell from the EOIR data how many of the cases the Trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed.  Attorneys interviewed by Reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes, but they are also seeing cases involving people who haven't committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations, like traffic tickets.   This is a sea change, said attorney David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Before, if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat, then it would be reopened. Now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people.   Elzea said the agency reviews cases,  to see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate.   Policy Shifts  After Obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes, prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases.  Between January 2012 and Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the government shelved some 81,000 cases, according to Reuters' data analysis. These so-called  administrative closures  did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed, but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation.  FILE PHOTO - A U.S. border patrol agent escorts men being detained after entering the United States by crossing the Rio Grande river from Mexico, in Roma, Texas, U.S. on May 11, 2017.Carlos Barria/File PhotoTrump signed an executive order overturning the Obama-era policy on Jan. 25. Under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, anyone in the country illegally is a potential target.  In cases reviewed by Reuters, the administration explicitly cited Trump's executive order in 30 separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket. (For a link to an excerpted document: tmsnrt.rs/2sI6aby)  Since immigration cases aren't generally public, Reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys.  In the 32 reopened cases examined by Reuters:  --22 involved immigrants who, according to their attorneys, had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed.  FILE PHOTO - A U.S. border patrol agent detains a man after entering the United States by crossing the Rio Grande river from Mexico, in Roma, Texas, U.S. on May 11, 2017.Carlos Barria/File Photo--Two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed: domestic violence and driving under the influence.  --At least six of the cases involved minor infractions, including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets, or driving without a valid license, according to the attorneys.  In Velasquez's case, for example, he was cited for driving without a license in Tennessee, where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses, he said.   I respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work,  he said.  I don't understand why this is happening.   Motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in 32 states, with the highest numbers in California, Florida and Virginia, according to Reuters' review of EOIR data. The bulk of the examples reviewed by Reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the New Orleans ICE office.  Pumpkin Seed Arrest  Sally Joyner, an immigration attorney in Memphis, Tennessee said one of her Central American clients, who crossed the border with her children in 2013, was allowed to stay in the United States after the government filed a motion to close her case in December 2015.  Since crossing the border, the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement, said Joyner, who asked that her client's name not be used because of the pending legal action.  Nevertheless, on March 29, ICE filed a two-page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children. When Joyner queried ICE, an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in El Salvador, according to documents seen by Reuters.  The woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor. Government documents show U.S. authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed.  Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of 580,000 pending immigration cases.   If we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made, it clearly generates more work,  she said.  It's a judicial do-over.

Trump,James Comey,Jim Comey,Jonathan Turley,Lester Holt,Marc Kasowitz,Mark Corallo,Michael Flynn,Richard Nixon,Robert Mueller,Stephen Vladeck,US,OTC,PRIVILEGE","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - In his pre-presidential life, Donald Trump was the boss of his own company and the star of his own television show. He flew wherever he wanted on a private plane with gold-plated seatbelt buckles and was usually home at his Trump Tower penthouse – or at one of his lavish golf clubs – in time for a steak dinner, well-done with ketchup on the side. If privilege is the power to define your reality, Donald Trump the mogul had a triple scoop.  Privilege has a different meaning now that Trump is president – and especially now that he is a president whose administration is under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. Rather than the padding of power and wealth that cosseted Trump in his pre-inaugural life, privilege for the president is a legalism that, according to experts, does not provide as much protection as Trump seems to believe.  Yesterday, former FBI director James Comey confirmed in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that he memorialized his meetings with the president, including a private dinner during which, according to Comey, President Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty and another conversation in which the president allegedly asked Comey to drop the FBI’s investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.  Comey told the Senate Committee that he was so concerned about Trump's public account of their interactions – and by Trump’s suggestion on Twitter that the president had taped their meetings – that he authorized a friend to disclose the existence and content of his memos to reporters.  In a written response to Comey’s testimony, Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz of Kasowitz Benson Torres, not only disputed the substance of Comey’s account of his conversations with President Trump but also disputed the former FBI director’s right to disclose those communications. Those meetings were privileged, the Kasowitz statement said. Comey, Kasowitz said, appeared to have an “entirely retaliatory” motive “for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information.”  Kasowitz apparently intends to continue to make an issue of Comey’s supposed breach of privilege. According to a Reuters report on Friday, Trump’s lawyer plans to file a complaint at the Justice Department and a submission to the Senate about Comey’s disclosure of conversations with the president.  My call to Trump counsel Marc Kasowitz was referred to spokesman Mark Corallo, who did not respond to a phone message requesting comment on the privilege claim. Comey could not be reached for comment.  The Trump team’s insistence that Comey violated the president’s privilege raises the question of exactly what privilege may have shielded Trump’s discussions with the FBI director. As I’ve previously written, Comey was not acting as the president’s attorney in their conversations so Comey is not bound by attorney-client privilege.  Law professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University argues that Comey violated FBI regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of investigative material.  Any way you look at it, this is FBI information,  Turley said, and Comey arranged for it to become public.  What he was describing is a grossly unethical act,  Turley said.  But even if the former director improperly disclosed investigative details, his violation would involve privilege belonging to the FBI or the Justice Department, not to Trump.  The only Trump-owned privilege that could reasonably apply to Comey’s conversations with the president is the executive privilege for presidential communications. And despite the implication of Kasowitz’s statement on Thursday, executive privilege does not grant the president a right to cloak all of his conversations in secrecy – if it did, there wouldn’t be bookshelves full of the memoirs of ex presidential advisers.  The U.S. Supreme Court said in 1974’s U.S. v. Nixon that the privilege for presidential communications is qualified. The justices held the privilege can be overcome, for instance, when the communications are evidence in a criminal investigation, as they were when a special prosecutor subpoenaed President Richard Nixon’s audiotapes. Comey testified Thursday that his records of conversations with President Trump are now in the hands of special counsel Mueller.  President Trump almost certainly waived his right to assert executive privilege over his Comey conversations – if not when he disclosed details of those conversations in tweets and interviews then when the White House did not invoke the privilege to block Comey from testifying.  Trump, you’ll recall, said in his May 9 letter firing Comey that Comey had assured him on three separate occasions that Trump himself was not under investigation. (Comey confirmed that assertion in his Senate testimony.) The president subsequently disclosed additional details about his conversations with the former FBI director in tweets and, most notably, in an interview with Lester Holt of NBC.  The president and his advisers weighed whether to invoke executive privilege to attempt to block Comey from testifying. Obviously, they opted not to. But their deliberation, said Savannah Law professor Andy Wright, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House, erases any doubt that Trump cannot now claim executive privilege over his Comey meetings.  “He didn’t preserve the privilege,” said Wright, who called Kasowitz’s assertion of a blanket privilege over Comey’s memos “hogwash.”  There will be fallout for Jim Comey from his Senate testimony. As he admitted, he made some questionable decisions in the four months he worked for Donald Trump. By Comey's own account, he assured the president of his “honest loyalty” without being sure the president shared his understanding of the phrase and failed to stand up forcefully to the president when Trump allegedly asked him to drop the Flynn investigation.  Comey’s admission that he asked a friend to disclose the content of one of his memos in order to provoke the appointment of a special counsel leaves him open to accusations that he is a leaker. Law professor Stephen Vladeck of the University of Texas, said Comey didn't break the two laws most often used to prosecute government leakers - the Espionage Act and the federal conversion-of-property statute - because he didn’t disclose classified information relating to the national defense or information that could have pecuniary value.  Even Vladeck, however, said he believes the former FBI director should not have orchestrated the public disclosure of his memo. “It was wrong, just not illegal,” Vladeck told me. Law professor Turley said Comey was  unprofessional  and  damaged goods.   Trump, Kasowitz and their allies, in other words, have plenty of ammunition to use against Comey. But let’s dispense with the idea that the president was entitled to privilege when he talked to the FBI director.  An unfettered sense of privilege may have informed President Trump’s decisions in his former life as a CEO. He doesn't seem to realize that life is over now.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-privilege-idUSKBN1902YA"},

A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Minnesota jury had enough evidence to conclude in 2015 that Toyota was 60 percent liable for the crash and that the driver of the Camry, Koua Fong Lee, was 40 percent liable. Lee was criminally charged in connection with the crash and served nearly three years in prison for vehicular homicide, according to his lawyer, Robert Hilliard. In 2010, when reports of unintended acceleration in other Toyota vehicles surfaced, Lee won a motion to set aside his conviction, and he was released from prison. The car in the accident was not covered by Toyota's recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2010 over acceleration issues.  I'm grateful to the 8th Circuit but I'm also relieved for Mr. Lee's family,  Hilliard said of Friday's decision.  We sympathize with everyone affected by this unfortunate accident from 2006,  Toyota said in a statement.  While we respect the 8th Circuit's decision, we continue to believe the evidence shows that Mr. Lee's 1996 Camry was well-designed and was not the cause of this accident.  A lawyer representing other people injured in the accident could not immediately be reached for comment. The Minnesota trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed on behalf of passengers injured or killed in the 2006 crash in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lee, who later joined the lawsuit, said he was driving his 1996 Toyota Camry when it inexplicably began to accelerate as he approached other vehicles stopped at an intersection. The Camry slammed into an Oldsmobile Ciera, killing the driver, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., as well as his 9-year-old son, according to the 2010 lawsuit. A 6-year-old girl who was also in the car was paralyzed and later died. Two other passengers were seriously injured, according to the lawsuit. Though it upheld the jury's findings, the 8th Circuit on Friday did find that the trial court judge had improperly calculated the damages for Bridgette Trice, mother of the 6-year-old, Devyn Bolton, and ordered that the amount be recalculated.

On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission named Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin as new co-directors of enforcement. In an exclusive interview ahead of the formal announcement, the two said they were deeply concerned about cyber threats and see the topic as a major enforcement priority.  The greatest threat to our markets right now is the cyber threat,  said Peikin, who was still wearing a guest badge because he has not yet received his formal SEC credentials yet.  That crosses not just this building, but all over the country.  The SEC has started to see an  uptick  in the number of investigations involving cyber crime, as well as an increase in reports of brokerage account intrusions, Avakian said. As a result, the agency has started gathering statistics about cyber crimes to spot broader market-wide issues. The kinds of cyber crimes the SEC has been noticing range from stealing information for the purpose of insider trading, to breaking into accounts to either steal assets, trade against them or manipulate markets. Last year, for instance, the SEC accused a U.K.-based man with hacking into numerous accounts, placing unauthorized trades and then profiting by trading the same stocks in his own personal account.  I think we will see the cyber threat continue to emerge,  Avakian said. Avakian has been serving as acting director of enforcement since December. It is her second stint at the agency, having rejoined in 2014 after working in private practice at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. Peikin, a former federal prosecutor, will join the SEC on June 26 from Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm where newly appointed SEC Chairman Jay Clayton also worked. He has represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Barclays PLC, as well as Michael Coscia, the first person to be criminally convicted under a new law that aims to prevent traders from “spoofing” the market by putting in bids with the intent to cancel them. The dual enforcement role can help prevent problems by allowing officials to recuse themselves when conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest exist. During Clayton's confirmation hearing, some lawmakers raised concerns that his prior work at Sullivan & Cromwell could lead him to go easy on Wall Street or create too many recusals that cause the commissioners to deadlock on cases. A similar arrangement was in place under former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and co-enforcement directors Andrew Ceresney and George Canellos. White and Ceresney each came to the SEC from the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. Both Avakian and Peikin stressed that enforcement efforts at the SEC will continue to be  vigorous  and that conflicts will not impede the division's activities.  There is no room for bad actors,  Avakian said. For instance, despite President Donald Trump describing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), an anti-bribery statute, as a  horrible law  that should be changed, the two said they expect the SEC will continue to pursue such cases. They also said they expect the SEC will continue to weigh whether corporate penalties are appropriate in certain cases.  I think it is fair to question whether a particular penalty is actually achieving the result,  Peikin said,  But I wouldn't expect to see...a vacation from corporate fines and penalties.

Recommendations in the highly-anticipated review, aimed at ending a decade of political warfare over climate policy, mean that coal-fired power generation using carbon-capture technology could potentially be used alongside gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar. The blueprint for energy security, presented to federal and state leaders, is expected to drive a compromise on carbon and energy policy, urgently needed to curb power price volatility and end outages that have hurt manufacturers. It was commissioned last October after tornadoes triggered a state-wide blackout in South Australia that came as a wake-up call to politicians as it left homes in the dark for up to eight hours and crippled industry for nearly two weeks.  The lack of a transparent, credible and enduring emissions reduction mechanism for the electricity sector is now the key threat to system reliability,  the review said. The energy crisis has crept up on Australia, despite its rich endowment of coal and gas, as states have promoted rooftop solar and wind power in the absence of stable carbon policy at a federal level, and coal- and gas-fired plants have shut.  More of the same is not an option, we need to aim higher,  Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, the head of the review panel, said in a statement. Finkel called for the government to set a clean energy target to encourage investment in  reliable generation , including coal with carbon capture and storage or gas. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said such a target would work, adding that the recommendation had the virtue of being technology-agnostic.  We are looking at it, giving it very favourable consideration,  he told reporters. Finkel said the recommendation would help cut power prices by 10 percent for households and 20 percent for industry by 2050 compared to if policy was left unchanged. The review advised making new generators have  fast response  capabilities to deal with peak demand, meaning that variable sources like wind farms would need to be teamed with sources such as gas-fired power. It also suggested large generators should give three years' notice before closing to avoid shocking the market. Defying state bans on gas drilling and green group calls for no new gas-fired power, Finkel said gas would be essential for providing reliable electricity. Based on the current energy mix and expected growth, Australia's emissions in 2030 are projected to be about 57 percent higher than its target of 290 million tonnes under the Paris climate accord, the nation's top research body has said. Gas retailers, generators, and industry groups said they hoped the blueprint would provide the certainty needed to drive billions of dollars of investment into new generation.  This blueprint is the last, best hope that Australian energy customers have for a secure, reliable and affordable energy transition,  said Energy Networks Australia head John Bradley.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-power-idUSL1N1J61X2"},

Erdogan vowed to keep supporting Qatar after his rapid approval of the bill, pushed through parliament on Wednesday, and he rejected accusations that it supported terrorism. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran - charges Qatar calls baseless. Several countries followed suit. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to ease their blockade, saying it was causing unintended humanitarian consequences and affecting the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State. Referring to Tillerson's comments on the blockade, Erdogan said in a speech at a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner in Istanbul:  I say it should be lifted completely .  There are those who are uncomfortable with us standing by our Qatari brothers, providing them with food. I'm sorry, we will continue to give Qatar every kind of support.  Until now I have not seen Qatar give support to terror,  he added. Arab states tightened their squeeze on Qatar on Friday by putting dozens of figures with links to the country on terrorism blacklists [nL8N1J61K3]. After an initial deployment of Turkish troops at a base in Doha, Turkish warplanes and ships will also be sent, the mass-circulation Hurriyet newspaper said on its website on Friday.  The number of Turkish warplanes and Turkish warships going to the base will become clear after the preparation of a report based on an initial assessment at the base,  Hurriyet said. A Turkish delegation would go to Qatar in the coming days to assess the situation at the base, where around 90 Turkish soldiers are currently based, it said.  Turkish officials were not available to comment on the report but Hurriyet said there were plans send some 200 to 250 soldiers within two months in the initial stage. Erdogan also approved another accord between Turkey and Qatar on military training cooperation late on Thursday. Both bills were drawn up before the dispute erupted. Turkey has also pledged to provide food and water supplies to Qatar [nL8N1J432D]. Erdogan has said isolating Qatar would not resolve any problems. Erdogan, who has long tried to play the role of a regional power broker, said Ankara would do everything in its power to help end the regional crisis. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The bill did not specify how many troops would go nor when.

The large-scale, long-life assets are next to mines already owned by Glencore, which has predicted continued demand for coal, especially in Asia, despite environmental opposition to the most polluting form of fossil fuel. In January, Rio said it was selling its interest in Coal & Allied Industries Limited (C&A;) to Yancoal Australia Limited (YAL.AX) for $2.45 billion. The terms allowed Rio to engage in negotiations with another party if it made a better offer.  Glencore's proposal is $100 million higher and fully funded, but Rio Tinto has to give Yancoal the chance to make a counter offer, opening the way for a bidding war. Rio said in a statement it had received the offer and would respond  in due course . Analysts say Glencore has long been interested in the assets and predicted its offer could succeed.  We cannot see Rio refusing unless it feels it will hurt its cosy China relationships,  Hunter Hillcoat of Investec said. Glencore's bid, made up of $2.05 billion upfront and $0.5 billion in instalments over five years, will automatically expire on June 26 if a binding sales agreement has not been reached. If the deal is completed, Glencore is also offering to buy minority stakes in Hunter Valley operations from Mitsubishi for $920 million cash. Glencore also said it will stick to a pledge to limit its net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to a maximum of 2:1. It would therefore sell assets worth $1.5 billion, possibly including up to 50 percent of its stake in the C&A; mines, it said. Following a deal, Glencore's combined portfolio would have production capacity of 81 million tonnes per year of high-energy coal, which would meet Asian demand, Glencore said, adding it already had regulatory approval from the Japanese anti-trust authorities. Coal asset sales stalled last year when coal prices hit nearly five-year highs and miners raised their expectations on bids for their assets. Agreeing deals has also been complicated by climate change concerns and shareholders have questioned the long-term financial sustainability of mining portfolios. Glencore says it reviews the sustainability of its assets and has said it sees continued demand for high-quality coal that can still be the cheapest form of baseload power. Japan has been forced to burn more coal following the  Fukushima disaster, which led to the shut down of nuclear capacity. David Neuhauser, managing director at U.S. hedge fund Livermore Partners, which owns Glencore shares, said the offer was strategic.  In the past, they tried to gain producing assets at any cost. Today they're targeting deals that are very prudent, opportunistic and move the needle in terms of their cash flow,  he said. additional reporting by John Tilak in Toronto; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rio-tinto-divestiture-glencore-idUSKBN1902NO"},

May called the snap election confident her Conservative Party would increase its majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit talks. Instead, Thursday's vote damaged her authority and made her negotiating position more vulnerable to criticism.  I'm sorry for all those candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful,  May said on Friday after a surprise resurgence by the main opposition Labour Party under its leftwing leader Jeremy Corbyn.  As I reflect on the results I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.  With all 650 seats declared, the Conservatives had won 318 seats, the Labour Party had 262 seats, followed by the pro-independence Scottish National Party on 34. May now risks more opposition to her Brexit plans from inside and outside her party, though a party source said leading the Conservatives was seen as too much of a poisoned chalice for her to face an immediate challenge.  She's staying, for now,  the source told Reuters. After noon, May was driven from her official Downing Street residence to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government - a formality under the British system. Her office said later that the key finance, foreign, Brexit, interior and defense ministers would remain unchanged. Further announcements were expected on Saturday. The socially conservative, pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party's 10 seats give the right-wing Conservatives a fragile but workable majority, which May said would allow her to negotiate a successful exit from the EU.  Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom,  May said.

Conservative lawmakers on PM MayThe pound hit an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro before recovering slightly after May said she would form a government backed by her  friends  in the DUP. Brexit Timeline DUP leader Arlene Foster's initial comments were non-committal:  The prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.   It was not immediately clear what the DUP's demands might be and one DUP lawmaker suggested support might come vote by vote. British politicians differ widely on what they want from the Brexit negotiating process, seeing it as a way to shift Britain either to the right or left. Some parliamentarians in both the Conservative and Labour parties want to remain in the EU. Business, already struggling with the uncertainties of the two-year Brexit negotiating process, urged party leaders to work together. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip are welcomed by staff inside 10 Downing Street, in London, Britain June 9, 2017.Stefan Rousseau/Pool The last thing business leaders need is a parliament in paralysis, and the consequences for British businesses and for the UK as an investment destination would be severe,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors business lobby. May said Brexit talks would begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day the British parliament is due to reconvene. But  the election result meant it was unclear whether her plan to take Britain out of the bloc's single market and customs union could still be pursued. EU leaders expressed concern that May's loss of her majority would raise the risk of negotiations failing, resulting in a legal limbo for people and business.  Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations',  Donald Tusk, leader of the EU's ruling council, wrote in a tweet. Negotiation Risks  We need a government that can act,  EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.  With a weak negotiating partner, there's a danger that the (Brexit) negotiations will turn out badly for both sides.  Slideshow (18 Images)There was little sympathy for May from some Europeans.  Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,  tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian premier who is the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit process. May's predecessor David Cameron sought to silence eurosceptic fellow Conservatives by calling the referendum on EU membership, expecting Britons to vote to remain. The result ended his career and shocked Europe. Ruth Davidson, leader of Conservatives in Scotland, where the party did well, said the results showed the Conservatives should prioritize good trade relations with the EU.  We must in my view seek to deliver an open Brexit, not a closed one, which puts our country’s economic growth first,  Davidson said. Other Conservatives have emphasized the importance of migration controls, something the EU says is incompatible with open trade. Resurgent Labour Labour's Corbyn, reveling in a storming campaign performance after pundits had pronounced his party all but dead, said May should step down and that he wanted to form a minority government.  The mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence,  he said.  I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  May unexpectedly called the snap election seven weeks ago, three years early, polls predicting she would massively increase the slim majority she inherited from Cameron. Her campaign unraveled after a policy U-turn on care for the elderly, while Corbyn's old-school socialist platform and more impassioned campaigning style won wider support than anyone had foreseen, notably from young voters, say analysts. Late in the campaign, Britain was hit by two Islamist militant attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London, temporarily shifting the focus onto security issues.

The announcement by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain increases pressure on Qatar over allegations that it interferes in the affairs of its neighbors by supporting and financing Islamist groups. The small Gulf Arab state is a critical global supplier of gas and hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East.   The recent joint statement issued by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE regarding a 'terror finance watch list' once again reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact,  the Qatari government said in a statement.  Our position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement - a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authors.  Qatar said it led the region in attacking what it called the roots of terrorism, giving young people hope through jobs, educating hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and funding community programs to challenge extremist agendas. The four Arab countries named in a statement 59 people, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity.

The government left its outlook for both U.S. corn production and yield unchanged in its supply and demand report released on Friday, delaying for at least a month any attempt to assess the problems that the adverse weather may have caused to crop development. The USDA, which gives its first official forecasts for new-crop corn and soybean harvests in May, rarely adjusts its outlook in the June report. In the previous 20 years, it has made changes to the corn production forecast five times and to the yield forecast four times. All June adjustments were made to lower expectations for harvest. The market has begun to account for some bushels being lost to the weather problems even if the USDA has not. Corn futures have rallied 5.4 percent since the start of May. Prices for the new-crop Chicago Board of Trade December corn contract peaked on Thursday at $4.09 a bushel, the highest since June 22, 2016. The USDA's most recent conditions report for the crop, released on June 5, rated the corn crop at 68 percent good to excellent, up 3 percentage points from a week earlier but below the 75 percent reported in early June 2016. The report shows the crop is vulnerable as it heads into its yield-determining phases of development.  If crop conditions stay below 70 percent good to excellent, then that would be a compelling argument to lower yield in the July report,  said Ted Seifried, chief ag market strategist for Zaner Group.  Even when there are signs of stress on the crop, USDA often keeps its powder dry on any changes in the harvest outlook until July. USDA has adjusted its production view in the July report every time during the last 20 years, reflecting acreage adjustments it releases at the end of June.  Yield changes are rarer, with adjustments coming just five times since 1997. The most recent July yield change was in 2012, when an historic drought caused the government to slash its yield outlook by 20 bushels per acre. The heavy rains in the eastern U.S. Midwest this spring that analysts and farmers say washed out some plantings this spring may allow USDA to reduce the harvest forecast without touching yield.  Yield might not change so much, but production may change from acres,  said Karl Setzer, analyst with MaxYield Cooperative. Additional reporting by Renita D.

A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Minnesota jury had enough evidence to conclude in 2015 that Toyota was 60 percent liable for the crash and that the driver of the Camry, Koua Fong Lee, was 40 percent liable. Lee was criminally charged in connection with the crash and served nearly three years in prison for vehicular homicide, according to his lawyer, Robert Hilliard. In 2010, when reports of unintended acceleration in other Toyota vehicles surfaced, Lee won a motion to set aside his conviction, and he was released from prison. The car in the accident was not covered by Toyota's recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2010 over acceleration issues.  I'm grateful to the 8th Circuit but I'm also relieved for Mr. Lee's family,  Hilliard said of Friday's decision.  We sympathize with everyone affected by this unfortunate accident from 2006,  Toyota said in a statement.  While we respect the 8th Circuit's decision, we continue to believe the evidence shows that Mr. Lee's 1996 Camry was well-designed and was not the cause of this accident.  A lawyer representing other people injured in the accident could not immediately be reached for comment. The Minnesota trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed on behalf of passengers injured or killed in the 2006 crash in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lee, who later joined the lawsuit, said he was driving his 1996 Toyota Camry when it inexplicably began to accelerate as he approached other vehicles stopped at an intersection. The Camry slammed into an Oldsmobile Ciera, killing the driver, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., as well as his 9-year-old son, according to the 2010 lawsuit. A 6-year-old girl who was also in the car was paralyzed and later died. Two other passengers were seriously injured, according to the lawsuit. Though it upheld the jury's findings, the 8th Circuit on Friday did find that the trial court judge had improperly calculated the damages for Bridgette Trice, mother of the 6-year-old, Devyn Bolton, and ordered that the amount be recalculated.

The large-scale, long-life assets are next to mines already owned by Glencore, which has predicted continued demand for coal, especially in Asia, despite environmental opposition to the most polluting form of fossil fuel. In January, Rio said it was selling its interest in Coal & Allied Industries Limited (C&A;) to Yancoal Australia Limited (YAL.AX) for $2.45 billion. The terms allowed Rio to engage in negotiations with another party if it made a better offer.  Glencore's proposal is $100 million higher and fully funded, but Rio Tinto has to give Yancoal the chance to make a counter offer, opening the way for a bidding war. Rio said in a statement it had received the offer and would respond  in due course . Analysts say Glencore has long been interested in the assets and predicted its offer could succeed.  We cannot see Rio refusing unless it feels it will hurt its cosy China relationships,  Hunter Hillcoat of Investec said. Glencore's bid, made up of $2.05 billion upfront and $0.5 billion in instalments over five years, will automatically expire on June 26 if a binding sales agreement has not been reached. If the deal is completed, Glencore is also offering to buy minority stakes in Hunter Valley operations from Mitsubishi for $920 million cash. Glencore also said it will stick to a pledge to limit its net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to a maximum of 2:1. It would therefore sell assets worth $1.5 billion, possibly including up to 50 percent of its stake in the C&A; mines, it said. Following a deal, Glencore's combined portfolio would have production capacity of 81 million tonnes per year of high-energy coal, which would meet Asian demand, Glencore said, adding it already had regulatory approval from the Japanese anti-trust authorities. Coal asset sales stalled last year when coal prices hit nearly five-year highs and miners raised their expectations on bids for their assets. Agreeing deals has also been complicated by climate change concerns and shareholders have questioned the long-term financial sustainability of mining portfolios. Glencore says it reviews the sustainability of its assets and has said it sees continued demand for high-quality coal that can still be the cheapest form of baseload power. Japan has been forced to burn more coal following the  Fukushima disaster, which led to the shut down of nuclear capacity. David Neuhauser, managing director at U.S. hedge fund Livermore Partners, which owns Glencore shares, said the offer was strategic.  In the past, they tried to gain producing assets at any cost. Today they're targeting deals that are very prudent, opportunistic and move the needle in terms of their cash flow,  he said. additional reporting by John Tilak in Toronto; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/riotinto-divestiture-glencore-idUSL8N1J65G9"},

Government tax receipts for early 2017 were 3 percent lower than expected, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a May 5 report.  Receipts are coming in somewhat lower, and I think that's in expectation of that we're going to do tax reform,  Mnuchin told a news conference in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, where he met with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau.  I've been consistent in (saying) we hope Congress deals with the debt limit as soon as possible, but in any event, we're not concerned,  he added. The weaker tax revenues have forced the Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit, which is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than it forecast, experts say. Mnuchin wants lawmakers to raise Washington's borrowing limit before they break for a long recess in August. Asked what would happen if Congress did not act before then, he replied:  We will be fine if they (Congress) don't do it beforehand. ... We have plans and back-up plans for funding the government.  Pressed as to what he had in mind, Mnuchin said:  They are Treasury secretary superpowers.  President Donald Trump has made tax reform one of his biggest priorities. He has proposed cutting the corporate income tax to 15 percent, down from the current top corporate rate of 35 percent, though because of loopholes few multinational companies pay that rate.  Nothing is higher on my priority list than getting tax reform done this year. ... It is critical for economic growth,  Mnuchin said. Some Canadian politicians and business leaders are concerned that if Trump cuts corporate taxes, it could make companies north of the border less competitive.  As the U.S. moves forward with their plans, we'll make sure we understand them well to ensure our tax system stays appropriate,  said Morneau, who gave no further details. Morneau said he and Mnuchin also spoke about lumber and trade. Canada softwood lumber exports have emerged as a trade irritant ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Washington in April imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.

The technology sector, which had soared this year and led the market's rally, dropped 2.7 percent, pulling back from steeper declines in the session. Countering those losses was strength in financials and energy, two groups that have lagged the broader rally this year. Energy gained 2.5 percent and financials rose 1.9 percent.  It is a rotation today and it is out of tech into some of the other sectors,  said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 113.85 points, or 1.8 percent, to end at 6,207.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 89.44 points, or 0.42 percent, to 21,271.97, while the S&P; 500 lost 2.02 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,431.77. Apple shares fell 3.9 percent and were the biggest weight on the three major indexes, after a report that upcoming iPhones launched will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Facebook and Alphabet ended down more than 3 percent, Microsoft fell 2.3 percent, while chipmaker Nvidia closed down 6.5 percent at $149.60 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Kepner said the combination of the comments on Nvidia and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about tech stocks was leading to a  little air coming out of the balloon.  Shares of software company Cloudera also tumbled 15.6 percent after its earnings report.  Tech has been on a tear for a very, very long ... time,  said John Praveen, managing director for Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey, adding that investors may be using the earnings report as  an excuse to take some profits.  Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe. U.S. stocks had started the session strong after the results of the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not disruptive to the stock market. Market watchers were concerned the result of the Congressional hearing could have derailed President Donald Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P; 500 up 13.7 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates.  Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation,  Praveen said. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 8.7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The benchmark FTSE 100 .FTSE index of large British multinationals fed off sterling's decline, as earnings from abroad will be worth more from a weaker currency and gained 1 percent. But some sectors seen as particularly sensitive to Brexit instability saw heavy losses, such as homebuilders and real estate investment trusts, which are seen as a barometer of Brexit sentiment due to their holdings of London office space. After an initial plunge, sterling pared losses against the dollar GBP= and euro EURGBP=, while the dollar gained. Safe-haven gold XAU= and prices of U.S. Treasuries drifted lower.

They all fell more than 3 percent, except for Microsoft, which slid 2.3 percent. Investors have relied on almost $2 trillion that central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have pumped into capital markets over the past 12 months, which has driven up asset prices, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.  If there's one metric that I'm going track, to determine whether or not I want to stay engaged in risk-taking, it's going to be that liquidity,  Ablin said.  If I get a sense the Fed or other central banks will start to close up shop on that, we're going to reduce risk.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government backed by a small Northern Irish party after her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a vote on Thursday just days before the EU departure talks begin. The benchmark FTSE 100 .FTSE index of large British multinationals fed off sterling's decline, as earnings from abroad will be worth more from a weaker currency and gained 1 percent. But some sectors seen as particularly sensitive to Brexit instability saw heavy losses, such as homebuilders and real estate investment trusts, which are seen as a barometer of Brexit sentiment due to their holdings of London office space. After an initial plunge, sterling pared losses against the dollar GBP= and euro EURGBP=, while the dollar gained. Safe-haven gold XAU= and prices of U.S. Treasuries drifted lower.

Jurors in federal court in East St. Louis, Illinois, awarded the compensatory damages to Stevie Gonzalez, who was born with spina bifida. His mother, Christina Raquel, said she was not adequately warned about a risk of birth defects when she took Depakote while pregnant. Jurors awarded no punitive damages during a second phase of the trial, according to court papers. The lawsuit was filed against Abbott Laboratories Inc. AbbVie spun out of Abbott in 2013 and assumed all rights and responsibilities for the drug. About 695 injury claims related to Depakote are pending in federal and state courts, according to AbbVie. In a statement, AbbVie said in several prior cases,  juries have unanimously found that Depakote’s label enables doctors to make properly informed decisions about Depakote’s demonstrated benefits and the clearly disclosed risk of birth defects.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In 2012, Abboutt agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve federal and state claims that it promoted Depakote for uses that were not approved by U.S. health regulators. In her lawsuit, Raquel claimed that her child was born in 2007 with birth defects after she took Depakote to treat her bipolar disorder while she was pregnant. The lawsuit said Abbott failed to provide adequate warnings to her psychiatrists regarding the risk of birth defects associated with Depakote use. Lawyers for the company said doctors were warned about the drug's risks. It also argued Raquel cannot prove Depakote caused her child's injuries. Depakote cases have had mixed results in court. In 2015, a Missouri state court jury awarded 24 plaintiffs $38 million. But a federal jury in Ohio in 2015 cleared Abbott and AbbVie of liability in another lawsuit. In February, another federal jury in Ohio returned a defense verdict. The case is E.R.G., a minor, by Christina Raquel, individually as parent and next friend of E.R.G., v.

The company said Schneiderman's allegation it had neglected to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals was  frivolous  and that no  legitimate law enforcement need  would be served by giving his office more documents.  For a prosecutor proceeding in good faith, the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing is grounds for closing an investigation, not expanding it,  Exxon wrote in its filing with the court. Schneiderman's office denied the allegations.  As detailed in our filing last week, the Attorney General's office has a substantial basis to suspect that Exxon's proxy cost analysis may have been a sham,  said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York attorney general.  This office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously and will vigorously seek to enforce this subpoena. We look forward to next week's hearing.  Schneiderman sought more materials from the oil producer as part of an ongoing probe that has already reviewed nearly 3 million documents. He is examining whether Exxon misled the public about its understanding of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the earth's climate. The probe has already revealed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias,  Wayne Tracker,  to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. Testimony Schneiderman made public on June 2 offered more details about how the company handled the  Wayne Tracker  account, which was first created in 2007. Exxon employee Connie Feinstein, an information technology manager for the oil company, told prosecutors changes in the email program Exxon used, along with an automatic process that deleted internal emails after 13 months, may have erased years' worth of  Wayne Tracker  emails.  We realized that the automated file sweeper had not been disabled for a period of time as it should have been,  Feinstein said in the April 26 interview. Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated.

Government tax receipts for early 2017 were 3 percent lower than expected, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a May 5 report.  Receipts are coming in somewhat lower, and I think that's in expectation of that we're going to do tax reform,  Mnuchin told a news conference in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, where he met with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau.  I've been consistent in (saying) we hope Congress deals with the debt limit as soon as possible, but in any event, we're not concerned,  he added. The weaker tax revenues have forced the Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit, which is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than it forecast, experts say. Mnuchin wants lawmakers to raise Washington's borrowing limit before they break for a long recess in August. Asked what would happen if Congress did not act before then, he replied:  We will be fine if they (Congress) don't do it beforehand. ... We have plans and back-up plans for funding the government.  Pressed as to what he had in mind, Mnuchin said:  They are Treasury secretary superpowers.  President Donald Trump has made tax reform one of his biggest priorities. He has proposed cutting the corporate income tax to 15 percent, down from the current top corporate rate of 35 percent, though because of loopholes few multinational companies pay that rate.  Nothing is higher on my priority list than getting tax reform done this year. ... It is critical for economic growth,  Mnuchin said. Some Canadian politicians and business leaders are concerned that if Trump cuts corporate taxes, it could make companies north of the border less competitive.  As the U.S. moves forward with their plans, we'll make sure we understand them well to ensure our tax system stays appropriate,  said Morneau, who gave no further details. Morneau said he and Mnuchin also spoke about lumber and trade. Canada softwood lumber exports have emerged as a trade irritant ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Washington in April imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.

Jurors in federal court in East St. Louis, Illinois, awarded the compensatory damages to Stevie Gonzalez, who was born with spina bifida. His mother, Christina Raquel, said she was not adequately warned about a risk of birth defects when she took Depakote while pregnant. Jurors awarded no punitive damages during a second phase of the trial, according to court papers. The lawsuit was filed against Abbott Laboratories Inc. AbbVie spun out of Abbott in 2013 and assumed all rights and responsibilities for the drug. About 695 injury claims related to Depakote are pending in federal and state courts, according to AbbVie. In a statement, AbbVie said in several prior cases,  juries have unanimously found that Depakote’s label enables doctors to make properly informed decisions about Depakote’s demonstrated benefits and the clearly disclosed risk of birth defects.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In 2012, Abboutt agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve federal and state claims that it promoted Depakote for uses that were not approved by U.S. health regulators. In her lawsuit, Raquel claimed that her child was born in 2007 with birth defects after she took Depakote to treat her bipolar disorder while she was pregnant. The lawsuit said Abbott failed to provide adequate warnings to her psychiatrists regarding the risk of birth defects associated with Depakote use. Lawyers for the company said doctors were warned about the drug's risks. It also argued Raquel cannot prove Depakote caused her child's injuries. Depakote cases have had mixed results in court. In 2015, a Missouri state court jury awarded 24 plaintiffs $38 million. But a federal jury in Ohio in 2015 cleared Abbott and AbbVie of liability in another lawsuit. In February, another federal jury in Ohio returned a defense verdict. The case is E.R.G., a minor, by Christina Raquel, individually as parent and next friend of E.R.G., v.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) came in a close second to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Sunday's election in State of Mexico, claiming it had been robbed of victory. MORENA candidate Delfina Gomez finished some 170,000 votes adrift of PRI contender Alfredo del Mazo in the state of some 16 million people, according to a preliminary official tally. Lopez Obrador told a news conference electoral authorities should annul five districts where the PRI was 240,000 votes ahead of MORENA due to what he claimed was voter fraud. If those districts were discounted, MORENA would be the victor, he said.  We don't accept the official result ... we maintain that Delfina Gomez won,  said Lopez Obrador, who has led early polls in the run-up to the 2018 presidential election. Twice a runner-up for the presidency, Lopez Obrador has a long record of claiming voter fraud in Mexico, where elections are frequently marred by such allegations. He has yet to succeed in overturning a major vote. Earlier this week Lopez Obrador said he would demand a vote-by-vote recount in the state but authorities have not granted that. His critics say his party is no cleaner than others. The State of Mexico, the country's most populous region, is home to one in eight Mexican voters and it has long been a source of strength and financing for the PRI. The election was tarnished by widespread accusations of fraud, ranging from intimidation of voters to vote buying. Prosecutors are probing the situation.

The Outlook is Stable. The department's EUR500 million EMTN programme has been affirmed at 'AA'. The affirmation reflects Bouches du Rhone's track record of sound operating performance, moderate debt levels, proactive management and a diversified economy. The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the department will keep budgetary and debt metrics compatible with the ratings in the medium term, despite an expected surge in debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS According to our base scenario, Bouches du Rhone's operating margin should slightly decline in the coming years, but remain sound at an average 12% in 2018-2020 (2016: 13.1% estimated). We expect operating revenue to increase 0.2% a year in 2017-2020 (at the same scope of competencies) as tax dynamism should be offset by sharp cuts in state transfers in 2017. A key item will be property transfer duties (15.2% of estimated operating revenue in 2016), which has seen robust growth in recent years and should continue to grow in 2017, but may be volatile. We expect operating expenditure to grow by less than 1% a year in 2017-2020 as the department is implementing sharp cost-cutting measures, including in staff costs, and tightly controls social benefit spending. The number of social benefits beneficiaries declined by around 5% in 2016 in the department. According to Bouches du Rhone's investments programme, capital expenditure should average EUR450 million a year in 2017-2020 (around 18% of total expenditure), compared with an estimated EUR436.5 million in 2016 (Fitch-adjusted). We expect the department's self-financing capacity to average 70% in 2017-2020 (2016: 77.4% estimated), thus leading to an increase in debt. Bouches du Rhone's direct debt grew significantly in recent years to EUR727.9 million at end-2016 (32.5% of estimated current revenue), from EUR223.7 million at end-2011 (10.6%). According to our base case scenario, it will continue to grow to around EUR1.2 billion at end-2020, but remain reasonable at around 55% of current revenue. We expect the department's debt sustainability to remain strong with a direct risk payback ratio of around five years over the medium term: (2016: 2.6 years estimated). Debt service (capital plus interest) should remain well-covered and represent less than 40% of operating balance in the coming years. Bouches du Rhone is a largely populated department with around 2 million residents. Its economy is strong from an international perspective, underpinned by a high level research centre, strong international communication networks and a diverse tax base. However, the department's socio-economic indicators are below the national average. The poverty rate was 18.4% in 2013, compared with 14% in metropolitan France, and the unemployment rate is also above average (11.8% in 4Q16 vs. 9.7% for metropolitan France). This translates into high social benefit expenditure (23.3% of estimated operating expenditure in 2016). Bouches du Rhone benefits from strong governance, evidenced by accurate budget planning and debt management. The department's administration implemented strong cost-cutting measures in 2016 in light of cuts in state transfers and aims to continue to do so in 2017. Fitch will monitor the department's ability to achieve its objectives in the coming years. The solvency of French subnationals is underpinned by the quality of their financial and administrative framework, which makes debt servicing one of their highest spending priorities. French departments' fiscal autonomy is higher than that of the regions, but lower than municipalities, as their rate-setting power is limited to the property tax (20% expected of their current revenue in 2016; 16.3% estimated in Bouches du Rhone). On the expenditure side, departments have less flexibility than other French LRGs as their main compulsory responsibility is the implementation of social welfare measures passed by parliament. RATING SENSITIVITIES A deterioration of the direct risk-to-current balance to six years could lead to a downgrade (2016: 2.6 years estimated). An upgrade could be triggered by a direct risk-to-current balance ratio around two years on a sustained basis, provided the sovereign's rating (AA/Stable/F1+) is also upgraded.

Fitch has also affirmed the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F2'. The ratings on the senior unsecured outstanding bonds have been affirmed at 'BBB'. The affirmation reflects La Rioja's significantly improved fiscal performance in 2016 from a rather weak result in 2015, a high debt burden as well as financial support from the central government. The ratings also take into account the region's economic outperformance versus the national economy. The Stable Outlook incorporates our expectations that the region's fiscal performance will continue improving while direct debt will rise but remain below 140% of current revenues until 2019. KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Budgetary Performance In Fitch's base case scenario, the region's operating margin will range between 6% and 8% in  2017 and 2019, up from 4.6% at end-2016. We expect operating revenue to continue to grow in 2017, driven by improving national economy. The regional government approved the 2017 draft budget in March, but this is subject to EUR14 million of additional revenue from the funding system from the initial allocation estimated in the draft budget. Operating expenditure is estimated to grow 2.5%-3.5% in 2017, or an accumulated 12% from 2014. After four consecutive years of posting negative current balances, the regional government has achieved, according to 2016 preliminary accounts, a positive current balance equivalent to 2.9% of current revenue (-1.7% in 2015). This was boosted by larger revenue from the funding system from 2016 of EUR75 million and by interest subsidy from Spain's liquidity support mechanism in 2015. In Fitch's base case scenario, the current balance will be positive over the medium term at 5%-6% of current revenue. Rising Direct Debt In Fitch's base case scenario, direct debt is expected to increase to over EUR1.5 billion and EUR1.6 billion between 2017 and 2019, although expected improvement in current revenue will drive direct debt-to-current revenue ratio below 140% until 2019. Direct debt-to-current revenue fell to 143% in 2016 from 147% in 2015 and debt servicing-to-current revenue fell to 30% from 48% over the same period. Pressure on debt servicing is high, with overall debt repayments for the next three years totaling EUR678 million, or 46% of outstanding direct debt at end-2016. However, refinancing risk on market debt is mitigated by 19% of the direct debt being contracted through the state support mechanism, at subsidised interest rates. Central Government Support The central government continues to provide financial support to autonomous communities. As a result, interest costs for La Rioja declined in 2016 to EUR19 million from EUR32 million in 2014. La Rioja's average life of debt is short at three years. Nevertheless, the regional government has large access to external liquidity so that it can roll over debt in the medium term. In 2016, it funded its annual deficit and debt maturities through capital market debt and bank loans bearing moderate interest rates. Regional Economy Recovering La Rioja shows a better-than-average economic profile, with a GDP per capita 7.2% above Spain's average and a higher employment rate of 51.2% in 2016, compared with the national average of 47.6%. La Rioja's economy grew by a more moderate 1.8% in 2016, to an estimated nominal GDP of EUR8 billion, compared with national growth of 3.6%. The labour market also improved in December 2016 as job creations increased 8% since December 2013, after 12.6% jobs were lost in the preceding five years. In 2016, 20% of the regional population (total population of 0.3 million) was over 65 years old (up 17% since 2002), which translates into more pressure on social public services. RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative operating balance, possibly driven by higher-than-expected operating expenditure growth, or direct debt exceeding 150% of current revenue could trigger a negative rating action. The ratings could be upgraded if the regional government continues to report a positive current balance and reduces direct debt towards 110% of current revenue (2016: 143.3%). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to the Spanish autonomous communities over the medium term, in particular, through the liquidity mechanism. Discussions on the regional financial system are ongoing in Spain, and changes are likely over the medium term. However, Fitch does not factor such changes into La Rioja's IDRs.

The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Altai will maintain sound budgetary performance and low indebtedness over the medium-term. The ratings also take into account below-national average wealth metrics of the local economy, Altai's modest fiscal capacity and as well as a weak institutional framework for Russian sub-nationals. Fitch forecasts a sound operating balance of 13%-15% of operating revenue over the medium term. Operating performance materially improved in 2016, when the region's operating margin soared to 20.7% from a 7.6% average during 2012-2015. This was driven by the government's tight cost control leading to a 6% decline in operating expenditure while operating revenue grew 10%. Revenue growth was mainly driven by exceptionally high proceeds from corporate income tax and excises in 2016. This came on the back of favourable changes in excise rates on oil-refinery products and higher profits in the financial sector and processing industry. We expect tax revenue to decline in 2017 due to changes in tax regulation and elimination of the base effect. However, overall operating revenue should still demonstrate modest growth due to an increase of federal transfers. Exceptionally strong fiscal performance led to a surplus before debt variation of 5.7% of total revenue in 2016 after a modest deficit averaging 2.3% in 2012-2015. Based on our expectation of a lower operating balance and high capex, we forecast a budget deficit of about 2% of total revenue in 2017. However, the forecasted deficit will be fully covered by the region's available cash. Historically the region's debt has been low, with subsidised federal budget loans being the sole debt instrument since 2007. Altai's direct risk accounted for a low RUB2.2 billion or 2.8% of current revenue in 2016, while cash balance was strong at RUB6.7 billion, leading to a positive net cash position. We expect Altai's direct risk to remain low by national and international standards, corresponding to higher-rated peers. In Fitch's view, despite a high number of public sector entities (PSEs) the government's oversight of the regional public sector companies is adequate, limiting Altai's exposure to material contingent risk. The region's contingent liabilities are limited to a single outstanding guarantee (for a negligible RUB4.7 million at end-2016) and the moderate indebtedness of its PSEs. Fitch assesses Altai's economy as weak by international standards due to the region's low economic output per capita. Its 2015 gross regional product (GRP) per capita was 63% of the national median. This is in part due to the high proportion of agriculture and food processing in the local economy. A modest tax base resulted in a below-median fiscal capacity and high dependence on transfers from the federal budget. The latter averaged 45% of operating revenue in 2011-2016. The region's credit profile remains constrained by the weak institutional framework for Russian local and regional governments (LRGs), which has a shorter record of stable development than many of their international peers. Weak institutions lead to lower predictability of Russian LRGs' budgetary policies, which are subject to continuous reallocation of revenue and expenditure responsibilities within government tiers. RATING SENSITIVITIES Consolidation of the region's strong budgetary performance with a sustained operating margin of about 15% while maintaining low direct risk could lead to upgrade. A downgrade could result from significant deterioration in operating performance, coupled with a significant increase in the region's overall risk.

The affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation that the city's sound operating performance will continue in the medium term, supporting the city's strong self-funding capacity. The IDRs factor in healthy debt service and debt payback ratios in the medium term, as well as the city's low level of debt. The IDRs also reflect substantial indirect risk stemming from the high level of liabilities of Centrale Electrica de Termoficare SA (CET), the city-owned former heating service provider, which is currently under bankruptcy procedure. KEY RATING DRIVERS According to Fitch's base case scenario, Brasov's operating balance will remain sound in 2017-2019, averaging 20% of operating revenue, which would be in line with the historical average from 2012-2016. This will be supported by the city authorities' continued cost-control measures and tax revenue growth, aided by the projected growth of the national economy. This should result in a nominal operating balance averaging RON130 million, which should be sufficient to fund the city's investment plan. In 2016, Brasov's operating balance was high at RON178 million or 30.2% of operating revenue (2015: RON146 million or 25.6%), and above our expectations. Consequently, the city reported a surplus before debt of 26%, improving the city's cash position to RON256 million at end-2016 (2015: RON102 million). Fitch envisages the city's budgetary deficit to average 10% of total revenue in the medium term following the rollout of new investments. We estimate the city's capital expenditure to average RON200 million in 2017-2019 (28% of total expenditure; 2012-2016: average RON113 million or 21%). The city's high cash buffer, high self-financing capability, as well as the availability of EU and state investment grants to Romanian local governments should keep the city's debt financing needs limited in the medium term. Fitch forecasts the city's debt will continue its declining trend until end-2018, with direct risk falling below RON60 million or 10% of current revenue (2016: RON92 million or 16%). Although Brasov does not include any new borrowing in its financial planning for 2017-2020, Fitch assumes that the city may resort to debt from 2018, once investments under the 2014-2020 EU budget are in their final stages. Fitch expects the city's debt service and debt payback ratios to remain healthy. Debt service, projected to average RON20 million annually, is likely to be covered more than 6x by the operating balance. The debt-to-current balance ratio is likely to be around one year, well below the city's final debt maturity of 10 years. Brasov operates five fully owned public sector entities (PSE), which based on preliminary data had a total RON504 million of debt outstanding at end-2016. The majority (79%) relates to CET. Fitch assumes the city is liable for the debt of its companies. However, according to Romanian law, the owner is only liable to the extent of its joint capital (in CET's case it is RON175 million paid in full). Romania's highly centralised budgetary system ensures adequate support and control from the central government. Under the austerity measures implemented during the national economic contraction in 2011 and 2012, the state ensured budgetary rebalancing in local government finances through subsidies and regulatory measures, including expenditure control. Located in central Romania, Brasov is the capital of and the largest city in Brasov County and has over 290,000 inhabitants. The city is a popular tourist destination and has a strategic location in the heart of the country. Fitch expects real GDP growth of 4.8% in 2017 and 3.9% in 2018 for Romania. The local economy is diversified and comparatively wealthy by national standards. In addition to locally generated tax revenue, the city's budget also benefits from central government transfers. RATING SENSITIVITIES Brasov's ratings are constrained by  those of the sovereign (BBB-/Stable). Positive rating action would be triggered by an upgrade of the sovereign's ratings providing no changes to our base case. A negative action on Romania's ratings will be reflected in Brasov's ratings. A downgrade could also result if the city's operating performance falls below 10%-12%, leading to sustained weaker debt payback and debt service above 50% of the operating balance, or if there is a significant rise in Brasov's net indirect debt.

Fitch has also upgraded the city's National Long-Term Rating to 'AA-(pol)' from 'A+(pol)'. The Outlook on the National Rating is Positive. Fitch has also affirmed Plock's PLN48 million and PLN86.9 million outstanding senior unsecured bonds at 'BBB', while upgrading the bonds' National long-term rating to 'AA-(pol)' from 'A+(pol)'. Today's rating action reflects Fitch's base case scenario that Plock will continue to improve its operating performance over the medium term, with the operating margin growing to around 11% and the debt-to-current balance ratio (debt payback ratio) strengthening to about six years. KEY RATING DRIVERS The key rating drivers and their relative weights on Fitch's decision are presented below: HIGH Fitch expects that over the medium term Plock will report an operating balance of about PLN90 million-PLN95 million which translates into an operating margin of around 11%. The projected operating balance will be 1.6x higher than annual debt service (instalments and interests). For 2017 Plock's operating results are estimated to be exceptionally high with an operating balance of above PLN100 million and operating margin of over 13%, supported by an already received additional CIT revenue of PLN30 million. In 2016 the city's operating results improved for the second year in a row and exceeded Fitch projections. Its operating balance rose to PLN97 million (2015: PLN68 million) and accounted for 11.9% (2015: 9.4%) of operating revenue. The 2016 results, however, were additionally supported by a PLN10m one-off revenue from VAT returned to the city. Adjusting for this item and also the inflating effects of the Family 500+ transfers going through city's budget in 2016, the operating margin would have been 11.4%, still well above the 2015 results. MEDIUM The improved operating performance was mainly due to the city's more cost-oriented approach and operating expenditure growth being maintained below operating revenue growth.  In 2016 operating expenditure grew 3.3%, slower than operating revenue growth of 5.7% (after excluding Family 500+ transfers and one-offs for comparison). Fitch views the revised approach to financial management as a supportive rating factor. Fitch takes a positive view of the city's revised debt policy of attracting long-term loans on favourable terms from the European Investment Bank (EIB). In 2017-2019 Plock plans to take up a PLN150 million EIB loan with a five-year grace period and a 15-year repayment. The city's liquidity has also improved with cash of PLN28 million between January and April 2017, compared with PLN10 million in 2016. In the medium term Fitch expects the city's debt to remain moderate and stable at below 60% of current revenue. In nominal terms it may reach around PLN500 million in 2019 (2016: PLN479 million) when the city will take up the EIB loan to co-finance its investment programme. We expect the city's capital expenditure to rise to above PLN200m annually in 2017-2018 from about PLN90 million in 2016. However, the investments are likely to be  financed by capital revenue (more than 50%), mainly EU grants, and from the current balance (40%), thus limiting the city's debt needs. Fitch also projects that over the medium term the city's debt payback ratio will improve to about six years, which is below the city's final debt maturity of 13 years. The city's ratings also reflect the following key rating drivers: Plock enjoys much greater financial flexibility than cities of similar size, due to its wealthy tax base. Petrochemical companies' large property estates result in high property tax revenue, which represented 52% (PLN215 million) of the city's tax revenue in 2016, followed by personal income tax (PLN166 million or 40%). With a population of 122.000 in 2016, Plock is a medium-sized city by Polish standards, and located in the Mazowieckie Region (BBB+/Stable). In 2014 the Plocki sub-region's gross regional product per capita was 148% of the national average, by far exceeding the average for much larger Polish cities. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be upgraded if Plock's strong operating performance is sustained, and if continued debt recourse reduction results in a further improvement of the debt-to-current balance ratio to below 10 years.

Researchers examined data on more than 279,000 patients, including nearly 17,000 who reported having neurological disorders, like epilepsy, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis or other conditions like headaches or cerebrovascular disease.  They found that black patients were 28 percent less likely to see neurologists for outpatient care than white patients. Hispanic patients were 39 percent less likely to see neurologists, the study also found.  “Previous studies have focused on specific neurologic diseases such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease,” said lead study author Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurology chief resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  “This is the first study to look beyond individual neurologic diseases and show racial disparities among a broad range of neurologic illnesses, regardless of insurance, socioeconomic or health status,” Saadi said by email.  “This is a much larger issue than previously documented,” she added. Neurologic illness is common, affecting about 14 percent of American households, researchers note in the journal Neurology. Stroke, for example, is a leading cause of disability and the third most common cause of death in the U.S., and rates of other neurologic disorders like Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are projected to soar as the population ages.  Saadi’s team examined data collected from 2006 to 2013 from a nationally representative survey of medical expenditures. Across the entire study population, just 6 percent reported having a neurological disorder. About 2 percent, or 5,890 patients, received a total of 13,685 outpatient neurology visits. People who had at least one outpatient visit with a neurologist were more likely to be female, older, white, nonimmigrant, more educated and affluent and to have health benefits through Medicare or private insurance, the study found.  Patients with certain neurologic diagnoses such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson disease were more likely to see specialists than people with other types of neurologic conditions, the study also found.  Among participants with known neurologic conditions, blacks were more likely to be cared for in the emergency department, to have more hospital stays, and to have higher per capita inpatient expenditures than their white counterparts. For every 100 patients with neurological disorders, 12.55 black patients went to the emergency room for care rather than seeing a neurologist in an outpatient clinic, compared with 7.66 Hispanic patients and 7.70 white patients.  Geography may explain some of these disparities, because outpatient neurological services are more widely available in regions like the Northeast, while there are fewer specialists in parts of the Southeastern U.S. where far more people have neurologic disorders requiring specialty care, the authors note.  One limitation of the study is that excludes people living in nursing homes and other institutional settings where many patients with seizures and dementia may reside, the authors point out. Researchers also lacked data on individual patient or physician choices or preferences about care, which might have influenced whether some people received outpatient neurology services.  Even so, the findings suggest that insufficient outpatient care may be disproportionately driving certain racial groups to the emergency room, said Dr. Jorge Burneo, a neurology researcher at Western University in London, Ontario, who wasn’t involved in the study.  These emergency department visits may also become more costly for people who didn’t get outpatient care or waited until symptoms got severe to seek help, Burneo said by email.  “If a patient visited his or her neurologist on a regular basis, there would be better control of the neurological problem, which would avoid an emergency room visit and admission to a hospital,” Burneo added.

In an interview with talkSPORT radio broadcast on Friday, the flamboyant liquor and aviation tycoon said he remained in for the long haul despite his legal problems with the Indian government.  There have been no conversations with Brabham, I haven’t even met them,  he said.  Bernie and me are good friends, will always continue to be good friends and there is absolutely no talk whatsoever on a sale of this team.  Ecclestone owned the now-defunct Brabham team, founded by Australia's late triple world champion Jack Brabham, in the 1970s and 1980s. Britain's Autocar magazine reported last month that the champion's son David, an ex-Formula One driver, could buy Force India as part of a project to bring Brabham back to the sport for the first time since 1992. Other reports suggested that 86-year-old billionaire Ecclestone was involved in the bid. Mallya, being pursued by Indian authorities over unpaid loans tied to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, was arrested in London in April and is due in court next week for an  extradition hearing. India had asked Britain to extradite Mallya to face trial after he fled there last March following a move by banks to recover about $1.4 billion that Indian authorities say Kingfisher owes. Mallya, who has not left the country in more than a year and was able to attend only the British Grand Prix last season, has repeatedly dismissed the charges against him and defended himself in messages on Twitter.  These extradition proceedings are based on various allegations made by the government of India and now the matter (is) before a UK judge, I am not going to comment further,  he told talkSPORT.  As far as the ownership of Force India is concerned, whether I continue to live in the UK or am sent back to India, the ownership structure of the team does not change at all.   These extradition proceedings have nothing to do with either the ownership or the management of the team.   Mercedes-powered Force India are currently fourth in the championship after six of 20 races.

The 347-year-old company, known as HBC, announced jobs cuts across North America late on Thursday. It is the latest department store chain to unveil plans to try to address industry-wide turmoil amid intense competition in a saturated market. A shift in shopping trends to online retailers led by Amazon.com Inc has left many traditional department operators struggling to boost sales and cut costs.  We know we can do better and we are taking bold decisive action,  said Chief Executive Officer Gerald Storch in a conference call, as HBC shares plunged to record lows.  Rather than chase the rapid industry trends, our transformation plan will reposition HBC to get ahead and stay ahead,  he said. HBC operates Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and other chains. Under the plan announced on Thursday, the company said it will decrease its number of vendors for back-office operations such as buying computers and marketing, centralize store operations, and move toward a  shared services  structure to standardize processes across department stores. Shares tumbled 9.6 percent, to C$8.70 in early afternoon trading, recovering from a record low of C$8.44 after the company posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday. Speaking on the conference call, Executive Chairman Richard Baker also reiterated the possibility HBC would sell additional equity in its real estate joint venture assets, or potentially launch an initial public offering of one or both joint ventures, a move investors have been waiting for since the transactions were announced in early 2015. But Veritas Investment Research analyst Kathleen Wong questioned whether monetizing its real estate would help the company.  If you get market value for the real estate, you have to rent it back at market rent,  said Wong.  If your retail operation is not doing well, how can you afford to pay the market rent?  On Thursday, HBC said it was cutting 2,000 positions in North America, or about 3 percent of its more than 66,000 global employees.  The nature of the business right now is that you have declining store traffic and you have a brutal competition on price and promotion taking place,  Storch said on the conference call. U.S. department store operator Nordstrom Inc said Thursday that members of the Nordstrom family were exploring the possibility of taking the company private, potentially facilitating its own restructuring efforts. HBC, an iconic Canadian brand and North America's oldest company, said its restructuring was centered on North America, but that its team in Europe was also focused on managing costs. Unlike some of its competitors, HBC has no plans to shutter stores as part of its overhaul and is planning to move ahead with growth plans, company executives said.  There are no stores we can close to make our business better,  Baker said. He added that the company was looking carefully at opening any stores it did not presently have commitments for, however. HBC did say its plans for Saks Fifth Avenue were intact and that it remained committed to Montreal, where it will open Canada's largest Saks store in fall 2018. Reuters reported earlier that the company had yet to file for a construction permit with the city for that location.

The Swiss 2015 champion hit a staggering 87 winners as he avenged last year's semi-final defeat by the world number one to set up a showdown with nine-times champion Rafa Nadal. Murray absorbed everything Wawrinka threw at him for most of the four hour and 34 minute contest but after winning a tense fourth set, Wawrinka steamed ahead in the decider as the Briton's game finally buckled. The third seed, at 32 the oldest man to reach the Roland Garros final since a 33-year-old Niki Pilic finished runner-up in 1973, was sometimes flummoxed by Murray's knack of retrieving lost causes but never lost faith. Wawrinka had not lost a set on the way to the semis and was a touch unlucky to lose the first and third sets on Friday. But despite Murray's heroics, he ran out a deserved winner.  There are two ways of seeing things and I chose to be positive, knowing that I was dominating,  said Wawrinka, who has won the three grand slam finals he has contested. Related CoverageMurray blames mid-match dip for grueling defeat by WawrinkaAggression pays off for relentless Wawrinka It was an amazing match. I enjoyed it. But for sure when you win it's better.  Murray, who arrived in Paris on the back of a woeful claycourt season, said he had run out of power but was still proud of his showing which sets him up nicely for Wimbledon.  I'm proud of the tournament I had. I did well considering. I was one tiebreak away from getting to the final,  said the Scot, who was runner-up to Novak Djokovic last year.   When I came here I was really struggling. I turned my form around really well and ended up having a good tournament.

He suffered a meltdown in the eighth, though, and Wawrinka pounced to steal his serve. Point of the Tournament Murray broke straight back to eventually force a tiebreak that featured a couple of scintillating exchanges that would be in the running for the 'point of the tournament'. Wawrinka moved to set point with a backhand volley after a close-quarters rally at the net but put a backhand into the net as Murray leveled for 6-6. Slideshow (6 Images)On the following point, the Scot was forced to defend again and he turned the rally around with a jaw-dropping defensive lob before finishing the point with a forehand winner.  The Swiss then netted a forehand as Murray bagged the opening set. Wawrinka did not dwell on that setback and earned three break points in the seventh game of the second set, converting the first with a trademark backhand winner down the line. Murray could not hold his following service game either, and a sublime inside-out forehand gave Wawrinka the second set. A seven-game winning streak put Wawrinka 3-0 ahead in the third but Murray regained his composure to break back, only for Wawrinka again to move 4-2 in front. Scrapping like a dog Murray hit back again and then pulled off a decisive break for 6-5, holding to take the lead in the match when a red-faced Wawrinka netted a backhand. The fourth set went with serve, Wawrinka always just ahead, but the Swiss played a superb tiebreak, winning a brutal rally at 4-3, then capitalising on a rare Murray error before walloping away a forehand return winner. Murray looked spent as the decider began and Wawrinka was merciless as he marched to victory to level his grand slam record against Murray to 3-3 with yet another backhand winner.

The burly Swiss is not nicknamed  Stanimal  for no reason, however, and he eventually overpowered the world number one 6-7(6) 6-3 5-7 7-6(3) 6-1 to reach his second French Open final in three years -- this time against Rafa Nadal. In truth, the third seed, who flung down 87 winners throughout a captivating four hour 34 minute duel, could have made things far easier for himself. He faltered when serving at 5-3 in the first set and wasted a set point in the tiebreak before Murray conjured some magic to snatch the opener. He then led 3-0 and 4-2 in the third set before again being ambushed by a Murray counter-attack. Wawrinka, who produced a spellbinding display to beat Novak Djokovic in the 2015 final but lost to Murray in last year's semis, never lost belief though and after winning the a tense fourth-set tiebreak with a rasping forehand winner he surged through the decider against a broken opponent. There is a telling statistic about 32-year-old Wawrinka -- the oldest French Open finalist since Niki Pilic in 1973. Before his 28th birthday his record against top 10 opposition in grand slams was a dismal 3-15. Since then it is 13-6.

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsEven when he slipped two sets to one behind on Friday, Wawrinka did not panic -- playing with controlled aggression to first soften up Murray, then crush him into the dust.  I think it was a mentally tough battle today, especially in five sets against Andy,  Wawrinka told reporters.  But I'm happy with what I did on court, the way I was fighting, even if I was down. The way I was trying to keep my line, trying to keep being aggressive, keep going even if I lost a lot of points by some incredible defense from him.  When you play in a semi you have to accept it. You just need to keep fighting and keep going for it.  We had some crazy points with some good rallies.  Wawrinka faces a slightly different challenge in the final where he will try and stop Nadal becoming the first player in the professional era to win the same grand slam 10 times. He said it is a daunting task but there will be no sense of inferiority when he walks on court against the man he beat to claim the Australian Open title - his first major - in 2014.  To play Rafa on clay in the French Open in a final is probably the biggest challenge you can have in tennis,  Wawrinka said.  He's the best player ever on clay. He's going for his 10th Roland Garros, so it's something really impressive, something tough. But the pressure is on both players.  We both want to win the title, and we both going to give it all on the court.

While Sirius XM has a strong presence in the auto market, where its channels are offered in most new cars in the United States, it has trailed Pandora and other music providers in mobile and streaming content. The relationship could give Sirius expertise in expanding its listening base outside of the car.   We believe there are future opportunities to accelerate Pandora's growth and further increase stockholder value,  Sirius XM Chief Executive Officer Jim Meyer said in a statement. While the companies did not provide details about how they would work together, Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said Sirius XM could bundle Pandora services to its customers, similar to how Amazon (AMZN.O) sells HBO and Showtime subscriptions.   Pandora CEO Tim Westergren said the investment  infuses resources to help Pandora continue to grow and innovate.  Pandora's shares have lost more than 30 percent over the past 12 months, and the company has never turned a profit on an annual basis. As of Friday, Pandora's market capitalization of approximately $2 billion was dwarfed by Sirius XM's $25 billion.    Sirius XM, controlled by media mogul John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (FWONA.O) will receive three board seats and appoint the chairman. Sirius is prevented from buying additional Pandora stock for 18 months and will not buy more than 31.5 percent of Pandora after that period. A person holds a smart phone with the Pandora app showing in New York U.S., June 9, 2017.Shannon StapletonThe deal ends a strategic review by Pandora and should ease pressure from activist investor Corvex Management LP that goes back more than year. The deal is a  new opportunity  for Pandora that raises its value, Corvex CEO Keith Meister told CNBC on Friday.  The investment also ends an earlier agreement for KKR & Co (KKR.N) to make an equity investment. KKR will get a $22.5 million termination fee.  Reuters first reported on Thursday that Sirius XM was looking to invest in Pandora after their merger negotiations fell apart, citing sources. While Sirius XM agreed to a standstill agreement for 18 months, it probably does not rule out an outright acquisition of Pandora later, analysts said. Sirius XM's owner Liberty Media, controls a media empire that includes big stakes in sports teams, cable and internet companies. It took full control of Sirius XM in 2013, five years after it first bought a stake. Liberty owns more than 60 percent of Sirius.  The latest investment by Sirius is convertible into Pandora common stock at $10.50 per share, a 23.8 percent premium to its Wednesday close. Pandora also said on Friday it will sell its ticketing firm Ticketfly to Eventbrite for $200 million, less than half of the $450 million it paid last year.  Shares of Pandora were up 1.1 percent at $8.51 in afternoon trading, while Sirius was off 3.4 percent at $5.22 per share.

Nordstrom said on Thursday the family group, which owns 31.2 percent of the 116-year-old retailer, was studying ways to take the company private. The group is now looking for help in funding an offer that would convince the company's other shareholders to back the deal. The family group started talks with private equity firms this week, and is expected to spend at least a couple of weeks to select an equity partner, the sources said on Friday, without identifying which firms are in talks with Nordstrom. Once the group has secured equity financing, it will begin to make arrangements for a debt financing package, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Nordstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nordstrom shares were trading up 6.2 percent at $47.40 on the news in afternoon trading in New York on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of close to $8 billion. The family group that is considering a bid for the company comprises Nordstrom Chairman Emeritus Bruce Nordstrom, his sister Anne Gittinger, President James Nordstrom and Nordstrom co-Presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom. Nordstrom operates 354 stores in 40 states, which includes its Nordstrom branded full-line stores and off-price discount chain Nordstrom Rack. The company also operates stores in Canada and Puerto Rico. Seattle-based Nordstrom has long been viewed as the jewel of the department store industry. Its affordable high-end price point distinguishes it from less-expensive peers, such as Macy's Inc, without making it too exclusive.  However, like many mall-based retailers, Nordstrom has been hit by the rise of internet shopping, and has been seeking to downsize its department store footprint while boosting its e-commerce presence. Nordstrom reported first-quarter same-store sales last month that fell short of estimates, triggering a drop in its shares. Nordstrom has closed fewer stores than its peers. James Nordstrom said on Nordstrom's first-quarter earnings call in May that the company will consider store closures on a case-by-case basis, rather than through any sweeping measures. Some private equity firms may be apprehensive about adding too much debt on Nordstrom.  Competitor Neiman Marcus Group, which is owned by buyout firm Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), offers a cautionary tale; it has been working with a financial restructuring adviser this year to cope with its $4.7 billion debt pile, much of which is down to its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013.

Employers added 54,500 jobs last month, Statistics Canada said on Friday, far exceeding forecasts for a gain of 11,000. Driven by full-time hiring, this was the biggest increase since September. With hiring in both the service and goods-producing sectors, the report adds to evidence of economic momentum after strong growth in the first quarter, analysts said. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Thursday he was comforted by recent signs of strength. The unemployment rate rose to 6.6 percent, as expected, as more people looked for work.  Certainly, the Bank of Canada will find it difficult to ignore a fairly steady stream of positive indicators we are seeing for the economy and the labor market,  said BMO Capital Markets senior economist Sal Guatieri.  Clearly the odds are shifting toward an earlier Bank of Canada rate increase.  A separate report showed first-quarter industrial capacity utilization rose to its highest since 2007. The jobs data led traders to raise their bets modestly for an interest rate hike by the end of the year, with markets pricing a 26.2 percent probability of an increase by December. The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback . Nonetheless, many economists expect the bank to wait until 2018 to raise rates, particularly given policy uncertainty from the United States, Canada's biggest trading partner. Friday's report showed average hourly wages rose 1 percent from a year earlier after annual growth of 0.5 percent in April. The Bank of Canada has pointed to muted pay growth as a sign of slack in the economy. While wage growth is still slow, economists said the trend was at least improving.  We're carving out a bottom on wage growth,  said Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt. Statistics Canada's website went down shortly after the data was released. A water leak from an air-conditioning unit led to a shutdown of an emergency data center, affecting services including the main website, Communications officer Laurence Beaudoin-Corriveau said. The agency is working to restore services, she said. The website has been plagued by outages and delays in recent months. The government said in March hackers had broken into a web server at Statistics Canada. They were stopped before they stole any data.

Futures discounts to initial cash prices limited market losses, they said.     June         closed down 0.125 cent per pound to 131.250 cents, and August         down 0.175 cent at 123.850 cents.     Nebraska's market-ready, or cash, cattle on Friday sold lightly at $136 to $136.50 cents, steady to $1.50 lower than a week ago there, said feedlot sources.     They said packer bids for other cattle in the U.S. Plains were $134 to $135 per cwt against $140 to $142 asking prices.      A few animals at Thursday's Fed Cattle Exchange, on average, brought $136.75 per cwt. Last week's average top price at the exchange was $132.17.     Processors might pay steady-to-better prices for supplies than last week as long as their margins and wholesale beef demand hold up, an analyst said.                               He said tight cattle supplies emboldened feedlots to hold out for more money for their animals.     Beef demand is expected to diminish the closer retailers come to finalizing Father's Day meat purchases.          Short-covering and this week's sharply higher cash feeder cattle prices lifted CME feeder cattle futures.     August feeders         ended up 0.225 cent per pound higher at 154.175 cents.      HOGS EXTEND GAINS         CME lean hogs gained for a second straight day, with the aid of buy stops and traders that bought hog futures and simultaneously sold live cattle contracts, said traders.     They said Friday morning's soft cash and wholesale pork prices capped market advances.

A few packers may have lowered cash bids after they bought enough hogs for near-term production, traders and analsyts said.     They said tightening seasonal supplies might again force some processors to compete for hogs next week.

Attorneys for Karim Baratov, a Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, had said at a bail hearing on Monday that evidence submitted by prosecutors suggested he played only a minor role in any plot but Justice J.A. Miller rejected that argument.  At the end of the day, Mr. Baratov remains a significant flight risk and is alleged to have committed a serious offence,  the ruling from Justice J.A. Miller released on Friday said.  The application is dismissed.  Baratov was arrested in March on U.S. charges that he was paid to break into at least 80 email accounts by Russian intelligence agents who masterminded the 2014 theft of data from some 500 million Yahoo Inc YHOO.O user accounts. At the bail appeal hearing early this week, arguments focused on whether Baratov was merely a small-time hacker-for-hire or a key player in the scheme, the first time the U.S. government had criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offenses. Baratov's lawyers said the indictment only presented evidence of Baratov receiving $104.20 into his PayPal account from a Russian intelligence agent for breaking into seven email accounts.  Whether the applicant was paid nothing or was paid millions ... the alleged conduct remains a destabilizing attack on the integrity of systems that are vital to all of our wellbeing,  Miller wrote. At the time of his arrest, Baratov's social media accounts presented the image of a wealthy young man wealth who loved expensive cars. Baratov and his family were disappointed with the decision but focusing on fighting the extradition process and defending against the allegations, his lawyer said.

Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, in a more than 2,100-word letter to the White House, asked Trump to rescind unprecedented guidance that told executive agencies they do not have to honor requests for information from lawmakers in the minority party, currently the Democrats. This week in hearings all over Capitol Hill members of both parties have criticized the information block. Democrats have posited that the Trump administration is trying to hide mistakes, problems or wrongdoing from them. Grassley, who has served in the Senate since 1981, called the guidance  nonsense  and described it as  a bureaucratic effort by the Office of Legal Counsel to insulate the executive branch from scrutiny by the elected representatives of the American people.   The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Justice Department and its Office of Legal Counsel, which published the guidance last month. Grassley said it goes against the U.S. Constitution by misrepresenting how Congress functions and trying to tell the legislative branch how to do its job. It also impedes Democratic lawmakers' ability to check up on the president, a responsibility also laid out in the constitution, Grassley wrote in a letter replete with footnotes and case citations.  I know from experience that a partisan response to oversight only discourages bipartisanship, decreases transparency, and diminishes the crucial role of the American people’s elected representatives,  he wrote.  Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability.   The Justice Department declined to comment on Grassley's letter or the guidance. The White House did not return a request for comment. The Office of Legal Counsel has not explained the impetus for publishing the opinion. The guidance did not single out Democrats by name. Instead, it addressed information requests to executive agencies from the highest-ranking lawmaker from the minority party sitting on congressional committees, called ranking members. The Republicans hold the majority in both the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives and therefore chair all the committees, with Democrats as ranking members.  The opinion said that agencies only have to respond to  information requests from committee chairs. Ranking member requests  do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings,  it said.

Palladium hit the highest level in 16 years as the short-covering rally pushed the metal through long-term chart resistance.     The backwardation in the market - a formation in the forward curve in which the price of metal for future delivery is below the spot price - can suggest a near-term shortage of metal. It  recently steepened, prompting a wave of buying.       That pushed prices through the 16-year declining trendline at $868 an ounce, triggering a further surge that took them to their highest since early 2001 at $914.70 an ounce. Spot palladium        was at $889.50 an ounce by 3:02 p.m. EDT (1902 GMT), up 4.3 percent.      The background for palladium is for good industrial demand and likely a significant market deficit this year, and on top of course you've got this speculative squeeze,  Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said.      The backwardation has got a lot steeper in the last day. Metal for immediate delivery is very tight, and that is being reflected in those forward rates moving into an even steeper backwardation.      Traders reported a reluctance to lend the metal, suggesting tightness in near-term supply. However, chart patterns indicate that the metal is vulnerable to a sell-off from these elevated levels, technical analysts said.     Gold fell for a third day, meanwhile, after British elections failed to deliver a clear majority for Prime Minister Theresa May, knocking the pound sharply lower and helping lift the dollar index to its highest since late May.       Spot gold        was down 0.7 percent at $1,270.17 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery settled at $1,271.40. Prices were down nearly 1 percent for the week, the first weekly percentage decline in five weeks.       In my mind, two things have been buoying the gold market this year - one has been the weaker dollar and other is the need for lots of monetary accommodation in Europe and Japan in particular, especially given political risk,  said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.      That risk has eased, even with the hung parliament out of the UK election, it's not enough to derail Europe ... the underpinnings of the gold market are being whacked away and unless there is more geopolitical risk premium or global economic risk, I think it was about time for the selloff in gold.      Sterling-denominated gold            rose to a near two-month high of 1,007.98 pounds an ounce as the British currency fell as much as 2.5 percent. Along with a drop in the euro, that helped lift the dollar half a percent versus a currency basket.      Meanwhile the FTSE share index, composed largely of companies that earn foreign currencies and benefit from a weaker pound, rose 1 percent, undermining potential demand for gold as a haven from risk.     Among other precious metals, silver        was down 1 percent at $17.21 an ounce, while platinum        was 0.8 percent higher at $939.25.

The conservative bloc, which has enough members to stymie legislation in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, will play a key role in efforts to agree on a 2018 fiscal plan that could determine whether President Donald Trump and Congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the Reagan era. The caucus has already called on Republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping Congress in session through August, when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break.    We need to get tax reform done sooner than later, and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July,  Representative Chairman Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a Heritage Foundation forum. Meadows recommended that Republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan to move the tax debate forward.  A border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the U.S. trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit.

The conservative bloc, which has enough members to stymie legislation in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, will play a key role in efforts to agree on a 2018 fiscal plan that could determine whether President Donald Trump and Congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the Reagan era. The caucus has already called on Republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping Congress in session through August, when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break.    We need to get tax reform done sooner than later, and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July,  Representative Chairman Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a Heritage Foundation forum. Meadows recommended that Republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan to move the tax debate forward.  A border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the U.S. trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit. Trump, however, did not include a border adjustment tax in his proposed budget. Representative Jim Jordan, Freedom Caucus co-founder, said tax reform could have trouble moving forward because House Republicans are having trouble agreeing on a budget with reconciliation instructions needed to allow Republicans to bypass Democrats in passing a tax overhaul.

A former ally of President Nicolas Maduro, the prosecutor Luisa Ortega has turned against him during opposition protests that have led to at least 67 deaths, thousands of injuries, hundreds of arrests and widespread destruction.  She has accused security forces of excessive violence, opposed pro-Maduro decisions by the Supreme Court and National Election Council, and said the president's plan for a new congress threatens democracy and late leader Hugo Chavez's legacy.  Though the bespectacled, 59-year-old Ortega has not joined the opposition, anti-Maduro leaders have been applauding her actions - and a growing backlash is underway within government.  This woman, with that malicious behavior, has given manifest proof of mental insanity,  prominent Socialist Party lawmaker Pedro Carreno said, calling for a psychiatric evaluation.  This woman could cause a civil war.  State television gave big coverage to a businessman accusing Ortega of improperly using a plane for personal use, while Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello said junior prosecutors were being threatened with dismissal if they opposed her.   You've Lost the Plot!  Venezuela's chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz displays a tear gas canister as she talks to the media during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela May 24, 2017.Marco BelloVarious officials have also accused her of turning a blind eye to opposition violence while launching probes into alleged abuses by security forces battling anti-Maduro demonstrators daily since early April.  Mrs. Prosecutor ... you are biased ... you've lost the plot!  Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello thundered on his weekly television program on Thursday, saying she could not prove opposition accusations that the latest fatality from protests, 17-year-old Neomar Lander, was killed by a tear gas cannister. Officials said a homemade mortar blew up in Lander's hand. Slideshow (7 Images)Another official Jesus Faria, who is stepping down from a ministry to run for the new constituent assembly, accused Ortega of aligning herself with the socialists' ideological foe the United States.  Treason is the most outrageous and miserable conduct,  he said.  This woman, with her comments, is inciting these armed insurrectional movements.  Ortega, who was often lauded by Maduro's mentor Chavez, has not responded in detail to the mounting accusations against her.     But she is leading a push to stall the constituent assembly, appearing on the steps of the Supreme Court on Thursday to urge public opposition.   They say 'those who don't accept the constituent assembly are traitors, fascists or terrorists',  she said.  We cannot live in a country like that.  Maduro says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela, but opponents say a scheduled July 30 election is a sham designed purely to keep him in power. They want to bring forward the next presidential vote due at the end of 2018.

Police said there were indications that JBS and controlling shareholder FB Participações SA gained an unfair advantage in trading stocks, currency futures and forwards in April and May.  There is evidence these dealings occurred with the use of privileged information, generating undue advantages in capital markets in a context in which almost all investors incurred financial losses,  the police said in an emailed statement. JBS and its parent company J&F; Investimentos have denied any wrongdoing. The police operation follows several investigations by securities regulator CVM on trades made before the revelation of a plea deal by top JBS executives, which triggered a financial market selloff last month.

The board of the Genoa-based bank held the vote after its top investor, Vittorio Malacalza, said he no longer backed Bastianini, who took the helm in April 2016 after Malacalza removed his predecessor.  The majority of Banca Carige's board has approved the removal of the powers assigned to Guido Bastianini as CEO and general manager,  the bank said in a statement, adding that it would move to  define a new governance layout  without delay.  According to local media, Malacalza's no-confidence motion was backed by eight board members, while four voted against it.   Bastianini's departure is likely to create more uncertainty over the bank's future and add to pressure on the government, which is already negotiating a state bailout for larger rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and two Veneto-based lenders. Loss-making Carige, heavily exposed to the northwestern Liguria region where it is based, saw its bad debts swell during and after Italy's deep economic recession, which ended in 2014 and has been followed by a weak recovery. The bank said in the statement it would push ahead with the implementation of its restructuring plan to achieve the objectives set in compliance with authorities.  However, analysts have said Bastianini's exit could delay a rights issue and other actions included in the restructuring and may require renewed negotiations with European authorities.  The European Central Bank has told Carige to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster a core capital that lags behind the ECB's minimum requirements. Carige is working to shed bad debts and plans to raise 450 million euros ($504 million) this summer in its third cash call since 2014.  Malacalza, a local businessman who has a 17.6 percent stake in Carige, had also criticised the bank's chief financial officer. Carige shares have slumped more than 80 percent since Malacalza became its top investor in 2015.  According to regional newspaper Il Secolo XIX, the ECB had asked the bank for a capital increase of around 600 million euros instead of the 450 million euros planned by the lender.  The paper said Malacalza had complained he had not been informed about this. Carige could not be reached for comment on the report.

The Rating Outlook is Stable Posadas' ratings are supported by the company's business position as a leading hotel chain in Mexico, solid brand equity, good operating performance and broad brand portfolio. The use of multiple hotel formats allows the company to target both domestic and international, business and tourist travellers from different income levels, diversifying its revenue base. Consistent product offering and presence in all major urban and costal locations in Mexico have resulted in occupancy levels that are above the industry average. Conversely, Fitch incorporates into Posadas' ratings its high leverage levels and the industry's high correlation to economic cycles, which negatively affect operating trends in downturns and increases volatility of operating results. The 'RR3' Recovery Rating assigned to the senior notes issuances indicates good recovery prospects given default. 'RR3' rated securities have characteristics consistent with historically recovering 51%-70% of current principal and related interest. KEY RATING DRIVERS Solid Business Position: Posadas' ratings are supported by the company's business position in Mexico, solid brand name and multiple hotel formats. The company's diversified revenues are generated from owned and leased properties, managed hotels and vacation club membership sales and annual fees. The ratings incorporate the industry's high correlation to economic cycles, which negatively affect operating trends in downturns and increases volatility of operating results. The use of multiple hotel formats allows the company to target domestic and international business travellers of different income levels, in addition to tourists, thus diversifying its revenue base. Geographic diversification is limited as Posadas' operations are primarily located in Mexico. Good Operating Performance: Consistent product offering and quality brand image have resulted in occupancy levels that are above the industry average in Mexico. Occupancy has been relatively stable for the past couple of years at around 65%, above the 2016 and 2015 year-end country averages of 60.3% and 59.6%, respectively. The company's diverse brand portfolio allows it to offer luxury, upscale, midscale, extended-stay and economy rooms nationwide. The change in sales mix, supported by robust market demand and the strength of the U.S.-dollar-denominated rates, has contributed to increased ADRs and, despite steady occupancy rates, resulted in year-over-year sales growth of 9.2% for the LTM ended March 2017. Cash Flow from Operations Supports Capex investments: Fitch expects capex levels to reach up to MXN1billion in 2017 and then decrease to MXN750 million for the next few years. Capex is mainly related to the Vacation Club project in Los Cabos as well as the remodelling of rooms. These investments are expected to be funded with internally generated cash flows, which will result in no additional debt for the company. Going forward, Fitch believes Posadas' strategy will continue to be focused on managed hotels, as opposed to owned hotels. Fitch estimates that the recently announced tax settlement payments will not have an adverse impact on Posadas' credit profile despite reducing the company's cash flow generation. The company has resolved all audits, fiscal credits and observations related to the fiscal years 2007 to 2013 in a conclusive manner. Posadas has agreed to pay MXN612 million in 2017, and annual payments of around MXN309 million from 2018-2023. Management has stated that payments will be covered by operating cash flows and should not affect projects and investment forecasts in the following years. FX Exposure: The company has a natural hedge to exchange rate risk in servicing its debt, since U.S. dollar revenues are used to cover USD31.5 million of interest expense annually. Around 25% of the company's revenues are denominated in USD, since their hotels in coastal destinations and some urban locations have rates in this currency. The remaining revenues are not directly denominated in USD, but increases in hotel daily rates tend to follow movements in the USD/MXN exchange rate. Fitch expects that the company will maintain around 30% of its cash and equivalents denominated in USD in the mid term. As of March 31, 2017 the company's USD cash balance was USD40.2 million and 100% of its debt balance was denominated in USD.. Fitch calculates that if prices were to remain unchanged, net leverage, measured as net debt/EBITDA, would increase from 3.2x to 3.3x. In 2015-2016 the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation on Posadas' leverage was partially offset by improved EBITDA margins, as a result of higher ADRs and occupancy levels, resulting in improved RevPAR as well as increased sales from the vacation club segment. Leverage Remains High: Fitch does not expect reductions in Posadas' outstanding debt balance; the slight strengthening of leverage ratios should come from improvements in EBITDA margins. Posadas increased its USD-denominated senior notes outstanding in mid-2016 to USD400 million from USD350 million after a reopening in May of that year. No further debt increases are expected, as the company deploys its growth strategy using primarily internally generated cash flows. Fitch expects higher EBITDA margins from an increase in the amount of managed hotels in the portfolio. Adjusted debt/EBITDA is expected to remain close to 5.0x in the short term, but improve to around 4.5x as EBITDA margins strengthen to above 20%. DERIVATION SUMMARY Posadas is the largest hotel operator in Mexico, with 155 hotels, resorts and vacation properties in its portfolio with about 24,714 rooms. The company's hotels are located in a mix of urban and costal destinations serving both leisure and business travellers, with approximately 83% of rooms located in urban destinations and 17% in costal destinations. Posadas owns only one hotel outside the Mexican territory; it is located in Laredo, Texas, and represents less than 1% of the available rooms. The company operates under multiple formats: owned, leased and managed hotels. Fitch estimates the total number of rooms will grow to around 30,000 by year end 2019. Less than 2% of these rooms will be incorporated as a wholly owned hotel. Posadas' development plan, focused mainly on managed hotels, will allow the company to keep capex levels low, as growth could be funded by third parties. Fitch estimates that cash flows generated by operations and cash on hand will be enough to cover maintenance capex and annual tax settlement payments. Posadas is well positioned in the domestic market in Mexico; its size and geographic diversification are smaller than global hotel operators; operating metrics are in line with industry players such as NH Hotel Group S.A. ('B'/Positive) although the latter has higher leverage (Dec. 2016 adjusted net debt/EBITDAR of 6.6x). Business models are different, since Posadas has migrated to an asset-light structure where strategic hotels are owned and growth is coming mostly from managed hotels, while NH leans more towards owning and leasing the properties. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Posadas include: --Future growth focuses on managed properties, resulting in the portfolio mix moving away from owned and leased properties; --Sales for the vacation club segment increase from the addition of a new property; --Broadly stable operating indicators in the short- to medium-term; --EBITDA margins improve slightly based on the increase in managed properties; --Capital expenditures reflect pipeline of one owned hotel and recurring maintenance/remodelling Capex. --Tax settlement payments of MXN612 million paid in 2017 and MXN309 million paid from 2018-2023; --The company does not issue additional debt, gross leverage levels remain between 5.0x and 4.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Stable EBITDA generation across cycles in conjunction with a strengthening in the margin. --Consolidating gains in operating indicators. --A proven track record of stronger and stable credit metrics, such as adjusted debt/EBITDAR consistently below 4.5x. --Strong liquidity in the form of robust cash balances complemented by available committed credit lines. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Weakening operating trends or decreases in RevPAR that could lead to lower EBITDA and cash flow levels. --Contingent liabilities that affect the issuer's ability to generate cash. --Cash outflows or incurring debt that result in adjusted debt/EBITDAR consistently higher than 5.0x. LIQUIDITY Liquidity is robust. The only debt maturity is the senior notes due in 2022. Cash balances as of March 31, 2017 were MXN1,982, before the MXN612 million payment related to the tax settlement. Cash and equivalents include a USD position worth USD40.2 million. As of March 31, 2017, the company has an unused committed secured credit line of MXN200 million, which provides additional support to liquidity. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Grupo Posadas, S.A.B. de C.V. -- Local and Foreign Long-Term IDRs at 'B'; -- National Scale Long-Term Rating at 'BB+(mex); -- USD400 million senior notes due 2022 at 'B+/RR3'.

Bombers and gunmen killed 17 people in Iran's parliament and near the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, on Wednesday, in rare strikes on the capital that exacerbated regional tensions. The Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Shi'ite Muslim state. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message read at the funeral, said the raids would increase hatred for Saudi Arabia, the region's main Sunni power, and America.

Slideshow (5 Images)The raids were the first claimed by Islamic State inside tightly controlled Iran, one of the powers leading the fight against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Iran's Intelligence Ministry said on Thursday five of the attackers were Iranian nationals recruited by Islamic State who had fought in the militants' main strongholds in Syria and Iraq. On Friday, the ministry said 41 suspects had been arrested around the country in connection with the attacks.   With the help of security forces and families of the suspects, 41 people linked to the attacks and to Daesh (Islamic State) have been arrested in different provinces,  state TV quoted the interior ministry as saying.   Lots of documents and weaponry have been seized as well.  Two Sunni militant groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been waging an insurgency in Iran, mostly in remote areas, for almost a decade.

The board of the Genoa-based bank held the vote after its top investor, Vittorio Malacalza, said he no longer backed Bastianini, who took the helm in April 2016 after Malacalza removed his predecessor.  The majority of Banca Carige's board has approved the removal of the powers assigned to Guido Bastianini as CEO and general manager,  the bank said in a statement, adding that it would move to  define a new governance layout  without delay.  According to local media, Malacalza's no-confidence motion was backed by eight board members, while four voted against it.   Bastianini's departure is likely to create more uncertainty over the bank's future and add to pressure on the government, which is already negotiating a state bailout for larger rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and two Veneto-based lenders. Loss-making Carige, heavily exposed to the northwestern Liguria region where it is based, saw its bad debts swell during and after Italy's deep economic recession, which ended in 2014 and has been followed by a weak recovery. The bank said in the statement it would push ahead with the implementation of its restructuring plan to achieve the objectives set in compliance with authorities.  However, analysts have said Bastianini's exit could delay a rights issue and other actions included in the restructuring and may require renewed negotiations with European authorities.  The European Central Bank has told Carige to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster a core capital that lags behind the ECB's minimum requirements. Carige is working to shed bad debts and plans to raise 450 million euros ($504 million) this summer in its third cash call since 2014.  Malacalza, a local businessman who has a 17.6 percent stake in Carige, had also criticised the bank's chief financial officer. Carige shares have slumped more than 80 percent since Malacalza became its top investor in 2015.  According to regional newspaper Il Secolo XIX, the ECB had asked the bank for a capital increase of around 600 million euros instead of the 450 million euros planned by the lender.  The paper said Malacalza had complained he had not been informed about this. Carige could not be reached for comment on the report.

The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.37 percent at 97.273, after rising to a 10-day high of 97.5 earlier in the session. The index had fallen to a seven-month low midweek on caution ahead of U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey and the British election. But on Friday, it added to gains from the previous session.  Comey on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation of possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia, but did not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice.

U.S. short-term yields also advanced, with two-year Treasuries touching a four-week peak. Investors largely shrugged off Thursday's UK election, which resulted in a hung parliament for Britain, as they did scathing congressional testimony by former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey. Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia. Guy Pecho, global macro portfolio manager at Atlanta-based Voya Investment Management, said dysfunction in Washington has virtually been priced out.  When the market saw the (Trump) impeachment story and reacted with such intensity, I think that was the height of hysteria around the administration. From there, we're now in a denouement, a sort of post-Trump world where the market can now accept the administration's volatility and vicissitudes without being perturbed.  Treasuries briefly rallied following the UK election, with benchmark 10-year note yields dropping as low as 2.16 percent, but yields have since risen as part of an overall consolidation. Britain's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in an election debacle days before talks on Britain's EU departure are due to begin.  Our key takeaway from the day's events was that we saw the weakening in Treasuries as largely technical,  said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. He said the sell-off in Treasuries suggested the market was preparing for a crowded U.S. auction calendar next week. The U.S. Treasury next week will auction 3-, 10- and 30-year debt totaling $56 billion. Ahead of an auction, traders typically sell Treasuries to make way for the new supply of government debt, leading to higher yields. Investors were also anticipating another rate increase by the Fed at the conclusion of a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. In late trading, U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last down 3/32, yielding 2.204 percent, compared with 2.194 percent on Thursday. Ten-year yields earlier hit a one-week high of 2.228 percent. U.S. 30-year bonds slipped 2/32 to yield 2.857 percent, up from Thursday's 2.855 percent. Earlier in the session, 30-year yields rose to one-week peaks of 2.883 percent. On the front end, U.S. two-year yields were at 1.338 percent, rising from 1.322 percent late Thursday after reaching a four-week high of 1.351 percent.

Walgreens, Rite Aid and the FTC all declined comment. Walgreens has 8,175 stores, and Rite Aid has about 4,600. CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) is the nation's largest drugstore chain with more than 9,600 stores. Walgreens has indicated it may sell as many as 1,200 stores to smaller chain Fred's as a way to resolve antitrust problems under the proposed merger. David Balto, a former FTC official, said the agency would have a  compelling case  if it sued to stop the deal and noted that the agency had stopped other big transactions, including a bid by Staples Inc (SPLS.O) to buy Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), which was scrapped last year.  Rite Aid and Walgreens have been waiting for FTC approval since Walgreens made its initial offer in October 2015. In that time, the closing date of the deal has been postponed repeatedly and the offer price has been reduced to $6.50-$7.00 per share, down from $9. In late afternoon trading on Friday, shares of Rite Aid were down 13.6 percent at $3.05, while Walgreens shares were off 0.4 percent at $81.11 The deal would help Walgreens widen its U.S. footprint and negotiate for lower drug costs.

A spokesman for Democratic Governor John Carney Jr. said on Friday he supported the rights and protections afforded under Roe v. Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a woman's right to abortion.  For that reason, he signed the bill into law,  said the spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, noting that the law takes effect immediately. Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion.  States have responded by seeking to write Roe V. Wade into their own laws, with Delaware the first to do so successfully.  Abortion rights advocates on Friday cheered the Delaware law, which  codifies at the state level provisions of Roe v. Wade.  We applaud Governor Carney for sending a strong message that state policymakers will protect women's access to critical reproductive health services in the face of threats at the federal level,  said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights.

It says to women that you are important, you have the ability to decide when to have a child and the state supports you in making the decision that is best for you and your family,  Nash said.  Abortion opponents had lobbied against the legislation.  This abortion law is a tragedy for Delaware,  Delaware Right to Life spokeswoman Moira Sheridan said in an email message.  (Carney) ignored the voices of Delawareans who rallied in opposition to this legislation, which now makes us the First State for Unrestricted Abortion.     Carney's signature of the law on Thursday came just days after the state House voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to pass the bill, which was approved by the state Senate 11-7 on May 9. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it.  In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult. Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts.  In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,  the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island. An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter. Automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers  urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results  of the ongoing review.  A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,  California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.     The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office. Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The technology sector, which has soared this year and led the market's rally, dropped 3.6 percent. Apple shares fell 4.8 percent and were the biggest weight on the three major indexes, after a report that upcoming iPhones launched will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet all were off more than 3 percent, while chipmaker Nvidia traded down 8.8 percent at $147.60 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Shares of software company Cloudera tumbled 16.7 percent after its earnings report.  Tech has been on a tear for a very, very long period of time,  said John Praveen, managing director for Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey, adding that investors may be using the earnings report as  an excuse to take some profits.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 17.02 points, or 0.08 percent, to 21,165.51, the S&P; 500 lost 15.88 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,417.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 166.89 points, or 2.64 percent, to 6,154.87. Countering tech's slide, financials rose 1.4 percent and energy shares gained 2.3 percent as oil prices moved higher. Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe. U.S. stocks had started the session strong after the results of the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Market watchers were concerned result of the Congressional hearing could derail Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P; 500 up more than 13 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates.  Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation,  Praveen said. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The failure of the two business partners to resolve tensions comes as uncertainty spikes over the make-up of the groups bidding for the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, less than a week before Toshiba is to announce a winner. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the business, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. Toshiba is aiming to announce its pick of a preferred bidder on Thursday.  Some sources see Western Digital, which jointly operates a key flash memory chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, as key to any successful deal.  The two firms are, however, at loggerheads over the auction, with Western Digital pursuing an international arbitration claim that says Toshiba has breached the joint venture contracts by entertaining outside bids, and arguing that the sale cannot proceed without its consent. Milligan and Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa met at Toshiba headquarters on Friday afternoon.  Toshiba listened to Western Digital's thinking, but our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. A Western Digital spokeswoman confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to comment further. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoWestern Digital on Wednesday proposed a consortium led by a Japanese state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, and including U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (KKR.N), sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media. A source familiar with Western Digital said the revised proposal included a significantly increased deal value as well as an investment in Toshiba Memory's convertible debt that could help smooth the regulatory process. The Japan-backed consortium also has commitments in place that Toshiba's essential technology will stay in Japan, the source added.    This group is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Toshiba favors the Broadcom bid as it is higher and would avoid antitrust concerns triggered by Western Digital, which overlaps heavily with Toshiba on NAND chips. Antitrust Concerns A senior Toshiba executive said after Friday's meeting that even a minority stake by Western Digital would make it hard to clear antitrust review.  In its bid, Western Digital initially sought a majority but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease Japan's government. The bid price is still short of Toshiba's threshold 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and lower than Broadcom's offer of 2.2 trillion yen, they said. Attention is now focused on last-ditch efforts to salvage the government-Western Digital bid.  Two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday the Japanese state-backed fund was in talks with U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital about teaming up in a bid. One of the sources said Bain would replace KKR as the main partner for the state-backed fund. In the previous round of bidding, Bain partnered with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (000660.KS).

The failure of the two business partners to resolve tensions comes as uncertainty spikes over the make-up of the groups bidding for the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, less than a week before Toshiba is to announce a winner. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the business, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. Toshiba is aiming to announce its pick of a preferred bidder on Thursday.  Some sources see Western Digital, which jointly operates a key flash memory chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, as key to any successful deal.  The two firms are, however, at loggerheads over the auction, with Western Digital pursuing an international arbitration claim that says Toshiba has breached the joint venture contracts by entertaining outside bids, and arguing that the sale cannot proceed without its consent. Milligan and Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa met at Toshiba headquarters on Friday afternoon.  Toshiba listened to Western Digital's thinking, but our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. A Western Digital spokeswoman confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to comment further. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoWestern Digital on Wednesday proposed a consortium led by a Japanese state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, and including U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (KKR.N), sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media. A source familiar with Western Digital said the revised proposal included a significantly increased deal value as well as an investment in Toshiba Memory's convertible debt that could help smooth the regulatory process. The Japan-backed consortium also has commitments in place that Toshiba's essential technology will stay in Japan, the source added.    This group is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Toshiba favors the Broadcom bid as it is higher and would avoid antitrust concerns triggered by Western Digital, which overlaps heavily with Toshiba on NAND chips. Antitrust Concerns A senior Toshiba executive said after Friday's meeting that even a minority stake by Western Digital would make it hard to clear antitrust review.  In its bid, Western Digital initially sought a majority but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease Japan's government. The bid price is still short of Toshiba's threshold 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and lower than Broadcom's offer of 2.2 trillion yen, they said. Attention is now focused on last-ditch efforts to salvage the government-Western Digital bid.  Two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday the Japanese state-backed fund was in talks with U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital about teaming up in a bid. One of the sources said Bain would replace KKR as the main partner for the state-backed fund. In the previous round of bidding, Bain partnered with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (000660.KS).

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's (BA.N) complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.  Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the  low bar  for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales.  Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing’s claim is without merit,  Nadolski said by email. A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a  customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses.  Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada  will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved.  Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country.     Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend its aerospace industry.  We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing,  Lawrence said by email. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737.

Bombardier, which described Boeing's $19.6 million figure as  absurd,  has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7.

But the story behind the swing to the opposition Labour Party in this quiet corner of England, forever associated with The Canterbury Tales of Middle Ages poet Geoffrey Chaucer, helps explain why the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority. Young voters in the historic cathedral and university city appear, like elsewhere, to have taken revenge on Prime Minister Theresa May over what they see as her pursuit of a hard Brexit -- a clean break from the European Union's single market. Many turned in frustration in Thursday's election to the opposition Labour Party which, led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, favors a  softer  Brexit and has promised an end to austerity and university tuition fees. Conservative Julian Brazier lost the seat he had held for three decades to Labour's Rosie Duffield -- by 187 votes. He had won the previous election by a huge margin, with 42.9 percent of votes to Labour's 24.5 percent.   Everyone who voted Labour did an excellent job. The youth vote was incredible. I'm ecstatic,  said 19-year-old Toby French, who is studying politics and international relations at the University of Kent, which has a Canterbury campus. He had initially planned to vote Conservative but said he was put off by May's Brexit plans, what he saw as the party's arrogance and a feeling he was being taken for granted.   I voted with my heart and my head. I didn't feel Theresa May and the local Conservative representative for Canterbury were up to the job. They were outdated. Brexit negotiations will suffer with a Conservative government,  French said.  Some youths may also have taken revenge on their parents and grandparents for supporting Brexit -- support for leaving the EU was much higher among older generations in the referendum a year ago on whether Britain should leave the EU. Data on how the different age groups voted and turnout among each generation is not yet available for Thursday's election, but a Labour source said the party's polling  suggested that young people were coming out in significantly larger numbers . Malia Bouattia, president of the National Union of Students, said early reports suggested 72 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds had voted. University of Kent student Rachel-Lee Allen, who voted Labour in the 2017 UK general election, poses for a photograph on campus in Canterbury, Britain June 9, 2017.Martinne Geller Without a doubt, this 2017 General Election will ... be recalled as the event that captured the imagination of a new generation of young people who announced their return to the electoral stage in a way not seen in decades,  said Professor Matt Henn, an expert in young people and politics at Nottingham Trent University.  As the country moves into the next Brexit phase in 10 days’ time, any new government will need to ensure that they keep a watchful eye on a new youth voting block which has flexed its muscles and who have seen that their participation in elections can make a real difference.  Going Forward Into the Future  There was also a big swing in the northern London constituency, or voting district, of Southgate where Labour's Bambos Charalambous won 24,989 votes to oust Conservative David Burrowes by 4,355 votes. The Labour vote was up nearly 13 percent on the previous  election in 2015 and the Conservative vote was down 7 percent. In the EU referendum, voters in Southgate had voted strongly to stay in the EU, with 62 percent backing remain and 38 percent leave though Burrowes had campaigned to leave.  I think after Brexit I was so angry with what I saw as the older generation selling us out. My generation are going to have to deal with the consequences, not them,  said Marcus Hawley, a 21-year-old student who voted for Labour.  I’m happy that May hasn’t got the result she needed, hopefully this will stop her going along with a hard Brexit which will ruin this country. When I see older people voting for the Tories (Conservatives) or Brexit I see completely different values. They want to send this country back 50 years but I want us to go forward into the future not backwards.  Some young voters said Labour had campaigned better than the Conservatives on social media. May's lack of popularity among young people was also highlighted by the popularity of a song which shot up the pop charts labeling May a liar. Hitting out at government spending cuts,  Liar Liar GE2017  by Captain SKA stitched together samples of May's speeches with a chorus of  She's a liar liar, no you can't trust her .  We all know politicians like telling lies / Big ones, little ones, porky pies / Saying they're strong and stable, won't disguise / We're still being taken for a ride,  reads one verse.

In fact, at ages 3 and 5 years, kids born as a result of these techniques had greater verbal cognitive ability than those born through natural conception, though this gap diminished with time. Researchers say that the older, better educated and more financially well-off parents of ART kids may play an important role in this difference at early ages.  “In the last decade, we’ve seen a huge increase in the use of ART and discussions about the outcomes and child development,” said lead author Anna Barbuscia, a sociology researcher at the University of Oxford.  The first “test tube baby” was born in the UK in 1978. And globally, about 5 million children have been conceived with ART since then, according to the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “We’re finding that this way of birth is not linked to problems, and in fact, could show consistent better cognitive development in early childhood years,” Barbuscia told Reuters Health. “We were surprised about the results.” She and her Oxford colleague Melinda Mills analyzed data on 15,218 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which follows infants born in 2000 and 2001. All had been tested on vocabulary, verbal ability and reading at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years. Within this group, 186 children had been conceived through ART. The research team found that children conceived through ART had higher verbal ability scores at ages 3 and 5 years, but the difference decreased over time and disappeared by age 11.  “We want to be very clear that our results don’t show that ART is better but that it has no impact overall on cognitive abilities,” Barbuscia said. “We’re doing additional studies now to see what the comparison is after age 11.” One limitation of the study is the small number of ART-conceived children included. In addition, the research team writes in the journal Human Reproduction, more study is needed to understand the higher verbal skills scores among ART children at early ages.  Parental socioeconomic status, education and home environment may play a large part, for example, if those who can afford ART spend more time or money on early education efforts, the authors suggest. “It’s perhaps surprising that the differences do not persist, but as the authors note, other factors external to the home may have more influence as the children grow up,” said Claire Carson of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford.  Carson, who wasn’t involved in the current study, has conducted similar research on the same Millennium Cohort Study population and found no differences in cognitive abilities for 3- and 5-year-olds, as well as some evidence of mental health issues among ART kids at ages 7 and 8. “Cognitive outcomes are only one area of research into child outcomes after fertility treatment that is being conducted globally,” she told Reuters Health by email. “There are still evidence gaps with regard to long-term health and development that need to be addressed.” To try to fill those gaps, Carson is looking at long-term health in a study of more than 200,000 children, which should include enough ART-conceived kids to assess a range of outcomes, she said.  Barbuscia and colleagues are also currently studying new data for children up to age 14, and examining influences such as socioeconomic status and parenting style. “When it comes to fertility, medicine has to keep up with society, not the other way around,” said Dr. Jacques Balayla of the University of Montreal. Balayla, who wasn’t involved with the current work, has done similar research on ART-conceived babies in Canada. In a study published earlier this year, he found no differences from other children in the cognitive abilities of 2-year-olds born through ART. (reut.rs/2rU0NWK) “Women are delaying motherhood, which is associated with higher risks for fertility, and we’re seeing an increasing need to use ART,” he told Reuters Health. “Understanding the consequences - not only in the short-term and for the mother, but for the long-term and in the children - is of paramount importance.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sHYdmL Human Reproduction, online May 24, 2017.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has requested more materials from the oil producer as part of an ongoing probe that has already reviewed nearly 3 million documents. The attorney general, who also wants to interview Exxon employees, has said Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew. In a court filing on Friday, Exxon blasted what it called  reckless and false allegations  from Schneiderman and said it has not withheld information.  For a prosecutor proceeding in good faith, the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing is grounds for closing an investigation, not expanding it,  Exxon wrote in its filing with the court. The Texas-based company accused Schneiderman of abusing the power of his office and using the probe to advance his political ambitions.  Lacking any basis in the facts or in proportionality, these subpoenas cannot be allowed to stand,  Exxon said in a request to the court. Schneiderman's office denied the allegations.  As detailed in our filing last week, the Attorney General's office has a substantial basis to suspect that Exxon's proxy cost analysis may have been a sham,  said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York attorney general.  This office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously and will vigorously seek to enforce this subpoena. We look forward to next week's hearing.  Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated and abusive to the company.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult. Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts.  In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,  the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island. An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter. Automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers  urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results  of the ongoing review.  A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,  California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.     The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office. Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The blockade is also hindering U.S. military action in the region and its campaign against Islamic State, he said. More than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are at al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, from which more than 100 aircraft operate.  At the same time, Tillerson said Qatar has a history of supporting groups across a wide political spectrum, including those that engage in violence, and that the emir of Qatar had made progress in halting financial support for terrorism but that he must do more.

We're absolutely stoked, that was a tough race,  Artemis Racing skipper Nathan Outteridge said on BT Sport immediately after clinching the series 5-3. The first-to-five playoff final begins on Saturday in Bermuda's Great Sound. The winner will challenge holders Oracle Team USA for the oldest trophy in international sport in the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Match starting on June 17. Artemis Racing's billionaire backer Torbjorn Tornqvist leapt aboard the state-of-the art blue and yellow catamaran to congratulate Outteridge and the six-man crew following their deciding win over SoftBank Team Japan. Related CoverageBarker bows out of another America's Cup sailing with pride We're really happy to take it through to the next round ... It's a big family team here,  Outteridge said. Friday's race against the Japanese crew was tight, hinging on a tactical mistake by their skipper Dean Barker who was forced to a standstill by Outteridge when he tried to get past them in the middle of their head-to-head encounter.  That was obviously the key moment,  an elated Outteridge said of the way the race unfolded in high winds and choppy seas. Although Barker, who was skipper of the losing New Zealand America's Cup crew in San Francisco in 2013, tried everything he could to catch Sweden, he was unable to close the gap in time and Artemis Racing romped home with a comfortable lead.  We are disappointed not to be going into the final, but we are very proud of what we have achieved,  Barker said in a live television interview on board SoftBank Team Japan's sleek black 50-foot (15 meter) catamaran. Sponsor SoftBank has said it wants to bring the  Auld Mug  to Japan and teamed up with holders Oracle Team USA, buying a design package to save costs on building its multi-million dollar craft.  We have been very fortunate with our relationship with Oracle,  Barker said. While SoftBank Team Japan is new to the America's Cup, Artemis Racing is one of the most established teams, backed financially by Tornqvist, the Swedish co-founder of oil trading giant Gunvor[GGL.UL].

The Islamic Jihad Palestinian militant group said the man killed was a member of their armed wing. An Israeli military spokeswoman said hundreds of Palestinians had gathered along the fence and were throwing stones and burning tyres.  Soldiers on the Israeli side of the border opened fire after their calls to the Palestinians and warning shots were ignored, she said. Israel and the Islamist Hamas movement which rules Gaza have fought three wars since 2008, though the border has been largely quiet in recent months. On Friday, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the main U.N. aid agency in Gaza, said it had discovered part of a tunnel running under two of its schools in a refugee camp in the enclave. UNRWA said it had protested over the finding to Hamas, which in a 2014 war had used a network of cross-border tunnels to launch attacks inside Israel.   UNRWA condemns the existence of such tunnels in the strongest possible terms. It is unacceptable that students and staff are placed at risk in such a way,  a written statement said.  Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum denied the tunnel belonged to his or any other Gaza militant group. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the enclave, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014. At least 249 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have been killed since a wave of sporadic violence began in 2015 in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Israel says at least 167 of those killed were carrying out stabbings, shootings or car-ramming attacks. Others died during clashes and protests. Thirty-seven Israelis, two American tourists and a British student have been killed in the violence, which has slowed in recent months but not stopped.

While Sirius XM has a strong presence in the auto market, where its channels are offered in most new cars in the United States, it has trailed Pandora and other music providers in mobile and streaming content. The relationship could give Sirius expertise in expanding its listening base outside of the car.   We believe there are future opportunities to accelerate Pandora's growth and further increase stockholder value,  Sirius XM Chief Executive Officer Jim Meyer said in a statement. While the companies did not provide details about how they would work together, Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said Sirius XM could bundle Pandora services to its customers, similar to how Amazon (AMZN.O) sells HBO and Showtime subscriptions.   Pandora CEO Tim Westergren said the investment  infuses resources to help Pandora continue to grow and innovate.  Pandora's shares have lost more than 30 percent over the past 12 months, and the company has never turned a profit on an annual basis. As of Friday, Pandora's market capitalization of approximately $2 billion was dwarfed by Sirius XM's $25 billion.    Sirius XM, controlled by media mogul John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (FWONA.O) will receive three board seats and appoint the chairman. Sirius is prevented from buying additional Pandora stock for 18 months and will not buy more than 31.5 percent of Pandora after that period. A person holds a smart phone with the Pandora app showing in New York U.S., June 9, 2017.Shannon StapletonThe deal ends a strategic review by Pandora and should ease pressure from activist investor Corvex Management LP that goes back more than year. The deal is a  new opportunity  for Pandora that raises its value, Corvex CEO Keith Meister told CNBC on Friday.  The investment also ends an earlier agreement for KKR & Co (KKR.N) to make an equity investment. KKR will get a $22.5 million termination fee.  Reuters first reported on Thursday that Sirius XM was looking to invest in Pandora after their merger negotiations fell apart, citing sources. While Sirius XM agreed to a standstill agreement for 18 months, it probably does not rule out an outright acquisition of Pandora later, analysts said. Sirius XM's owner Liberty Media, controls a media empire that includes big stakes in sports teams, cable and internet companies. It took full control of Sirius XM in 2013, five years after it first bought a stake. Liberty owns more than 60 percent of Sirius.  The latest investment by Sirius is convertible into Pandora common stock at $10.50 per share, a 23.8 percent premium to its Wednesday close. Pandora also said on Friday it will sell its ticketing firm Ticketfly to Eventbrite for $200 million, less than half of the $450 million it paid last year.  Shares of Pandora were up 1.1 percent at $8.51 in afternoon trading, while Sirius was off 3.4 percent at $5.22 per share. Sirius XM was advised by Allen & Co and Bank of America, while Pandora was advised by Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley. Reporting by Liana B.

Neither the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama nor the Democrats of Lulzim Basha managed in 2013 and 2009 elections to win the 70 seats needed for a parliamentary majority.  The Socialist Integration Movement (SIM) party of Ilir Meta became the unavoidable king-maker, first in alliance with the Democrats and later jumping ship to govern with the Socialists. Rama and Basha thrashed out a deal in May agreeing to work on constitutional and electoral reform and back Albania's EU bid with one voice, but have not been clear if that means any form of government coalition. Now Rama is appealing to voters to give him a big enough mandate to rule alone, without  someone ... who grabs the steering wheel and moves it at whim .

Researchers matched 43 older adults with dogs to another 43 without dogs and measured their time spent walking. Compared to those without canine companions, dog owners walked on average 23 minutes more a day - enough to meet U.S. and international exercise recommendations for substantial health benefits, the research found.  “It’s very difficult to find any other intervention that produces this size of effect,” said senior author Dr. Daniel Simon Mills, a professor of veterinary behavioral medicine at the University of Lincoln in England. “It’s good evidence that dog ownership amongst the elderly increases physical activity in a meaningful and healthy way,” he said in a video call. Participants in the study were 65 to 81 years old, lived independently in one of three counties in England and wore monitors that measured their movements for three one-week periods over the course of a year. The time periods were designed to capture participants’ steps in different seasons and under varied weather conditions, researchers reported in BioMed Central Public Health.  Dog owners and participants who did not own dogs were matched by gender, height, weight, health conditions and walking abilities. All were white British, and nearly two-thirds were women. The average participant was at least slightly overweight. The average dog in the study was nearly eight years old.  Dog owners walked on average 21 minutes more than those without dogs at an at-least moderate pace, the study found.  “Virtually all of the increased exercise is not just dawdling,” Mills said. “It’s marching.” Over the course of a week, the additional 147 minutes dog owners spent walking at a moderate pace would in itself be just three minutes shy of World Health Organization recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous weekly physical activity, the study authors note.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week.  By matching dog owners to people without dogs, Mills said he believes the new study clarifies that the benefits of dog ownership stem from having dogs, rather than from dog owners being more active in the first place. But Marcia Stefanick, a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, hesitated to ascribe all the benefits to the dogs. “Despite ‘successful matching’ on what the authors consider key variables, a person who is ready and willing to walk a dog at least twice a day is more likely to get a dog than one who sees that commitment as too challenging,” said Stefanick, who researches disease prevention and was not involved in the study.  “On the other hand, once a person has a dog, the motivation and likelihood that he or she would at least walk around the block, with several stops along the way, would clearly be higher,” she said in an email. The study confirms previous studies in which dog owners reported walking more than people without dogs. It also shows that the additional walking was at a moderate clip.  “We saw a big increase in healthy activity and at a level that is considered to be health promoting,” Mills said.  “If you’d like to get a dog, don’t be put off by the fact you’re elderly,” he said. “It’s good for the dog, and it’s good for you.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s0YN1Y BioMed Central Public Health, online June 8, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elderly-dogs-idUSKBN1902PO"},

This would be the result of the appetite of some investors to selectively increase their exposure in emerging countries, in conjunction with the interest of Mexican mid-sized banks to strengthen their financial and competitive positions in the face of the broad growth opportunities that the local market offers, given the low financial intermediation in the country. The completion of these events will largely depend on the evolution of the operating environment and the performance of the mid-sized banks under the relatively challenging conditions prevailing in Mexico. Banco del Bajio's recent IPO is a clear example of the possibilities Fitch envisions. Fitch notes that mid-sized banks, those with market shares of between 0.5% and 2% of the total assets of the system, show an appetite for strengthening the size of their franchises and business profiles. These banks usually grow faster than the industry average. As of March 2017, their credit portfolios have grown at levels close to 18% YoY, compared to 12% for the total system. Although the mid-sized banks rated by Fitch still show adequate capitalization indicators (Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets average 13.5% as of March 2017), Fitch believes that, with the current loan growth rate and still moderate internal capital generation, one of the main challenges for these entities is to avoid that its capital bases are substantially pressured and approach the minimum regulatory limits. Given their track record, performance, and maturity, some Mexican medium-sized banks have contemplated the possibility of conducting an IPO. Some of them have an operating history of between 15 and 20 years. However, the decision and timing to access capital markets will depend on their assessment of the conditions in those markets in a global context. Investors' growing interest in political conditions and events may also play an important role in the possibility of new IPOs, especially in the run-up to the presidential election in Mexico set for June 2018. Investor appetite for these types of entities has been relatively proven through access to local debt issues, and, selectively, access to capital markets by some medium-sized banks, and even certain NBFIs (non-bank financial institutions). Fitch believes that some of these banks still have the challenge of demonstrating consistent and attractive returns for investors. For some others, Fitch believes they are building or strengthening their scale, franchise, or business model, before assessing the possibility of accessing the capital markets. The complex global environment in the last two years has reduced investor appetite in some emerging countries, specifically in those most exposed to commodity cycles. This could benefit investors' appetite for the expected issues of Mexican mid-sized banks, given the more diversified nature of the Mexican economy, and also the relatively limited supply of capital investment alternatives in the Mexican financial sector. Mexican financial entities that have accessed capital markets in recent years, either with IPOs or additional offers, include Grupo Financiero Banorte, Santander Grupo Financiero, Grupo Financiero Inbursa, Banregio Grupo Financiero, Grupo Financiero Interacciones and even non-bank intermediaries like Unifin, and previously Credito Real and Financiera Independencia. In addition to the positive effects of the prior IPOs of these entities on their capital adequacy, Fitch believes that these also have positive effects on levels of institutionalization, transparency, and corporate practices.

Under pressure from business groups and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump officials and congressional leaders still need to decide how much to slash tax rates and if the package should increase the federal budget deficit, administration and congressional sources said. The future of a border adjustment tax, or BAT, proposal from House of Representatives Republicans, meant to boost exports and discourage imports, could also be decided within the next two to three weeks, the administration official said. President Donald Trump has pledged to make a tax overhaul a priority. But after 20 weeks in power and numerous distractions, he has yet to offer a tax bill to Congress. Expectations for legislation have slipped repeatedly, from spring to summer and now after the U.S. Labor Day holiday.   Still, stocks are up since Trump's November election win and companies and wealthy Americans are positioning themselves to realize more income in 2018, betting lower taxes are coming. The head of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of three-dozen conservatives capable of stalling legislation, on Friday called on Republicans to acknowledge a lack of consensus on the BAT and produce a tax proposal by the end of July. Trump and fellow Republicans pledged in the election campaign last year to tackle in 2017 the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era. But that agenda has been slowed by infighting over dismantling Obamacare and probes of possible ties between Trump's campaign and alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobbying group that represents chief executives, wrote to Trump and congressional leaders this week calling for a  shift from listening to action  on tax reform. Broad Agreement The administration official, who asked not to be named, said there is broad agreement among participants in the talks on the need to cut taxes, simplify the code, eliminate tax breaks, end taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits and repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in corporate profits held overseas.  But key details remain open to question. More meetings are expected among U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and their staff, the official said. After their third meeting on Tuesday, officials had not decided whether to adopt full expensing for corporations, the administration official said. The policy would allow companies to write off the cost of capital investments such as equipment immediately and plow the money back into their businesses.  The official said the aim of the talks is to agree on a framework by mid-year and release legislation soon after lawmakers' long August recess. A key decision awaits the House Republicans' export-boosting BAT, intended to help pay for reforms while dissuading companies from moving assets, profits and jobs abroad. The BAT, which would tax imports but exempt export revenues from taxation, has run afoul of many Republicans and drawn criticism from the administration. Officials in Congress and the administration are examining options to the BAT that could reduce erosion of the federal tax base, including rules and a minimum corporate tax. Decisions on BAT, revenue neutrality and expensing will help decide if Congress can cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent, as Trump seeks, or 20-25 percent as envisioned by the House Republicans' tax plan.

Jurors in federal court in East St. Louis, Illinois, awarded the compensatory damages to Christina Raquel, who said she was not adequately warned about a risk of birth defects when she took Depakote while pregnant. Jurors will now consider whether to award punitive damages, a court official said. Her lawsuit was filed against Abbott Laboratories Inc, from which AbbVie was spun off. AbbVie has assumed all rights and responsibilities for the drug. It has a mixed record in lawsuits over birth defects that plaintiffs have blamed on the drug. Lawyers for Raquel did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did representatives for AbbVie. In 2012, Abboutt agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve federal and state claims that it promoted Depakote for uses that were not approved by U.S. health regulators. Product liability lawsuits primarily focused on birth defects have mounted over the drug, and about 695 injury claims related to Depakote are pending in federal and state courts, according to AbbVie, which Abbott spun off in 2013. In her lawsuit, Raquel claimed that her child, known in papers as E.R.G., was born in 2007 with birth defects after she took Depakote to treat her bipolar disorder while she was pregnant. Raquel said Abbott failed to provide adequate warnings to her psychiatrists regarding the risk of birth defects associated with Depakote use. Lawyers for the company said doctors were warned about the drug's risks. It also argued Raquel cannot prove Depakote caused her child's injuries. Depakote cases have had mixed results in court. In 2015, a Missouri state court jury awarded 24 plaintiffs $38 million. But a federal jury in Ohio in 2015 cleared Abbott and AbbVie of liability in another lawsuit. In February, another federal jury in Ohio returned a defense verdict. The case is E.R.G., a minor, by Christina Raquel, individually as parent and next friend of E.R.G., v.

Bearish bets on the loonie ramped up in May to a record high as Canada's largest alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc nearly collapsed in April. But short-sellers are battling a decline in volatility that has hit stock, bond and foreign exchange markets over recent months and which implies that the Canadian dollar will not fall very far. The decline in volatility could leave sellers sitting on positions that are no longer working and looking for an exit all at once if a positive catalyst for the currency emerges.  Canadian dollar sellers are expecting an aggressive Canadian dollar move and the market is saying it is not going to happen,  said Adam Button, currency analyst at ForexLive. Investors typically pay more in the options market for downside than upside protection in the Canadian dollar because the commodity-linked currency tends to weaken fast when appetite for risk declines. But the drop in Canadian dollar volatility has helped reduce the premium that investors are willing to pay for puts versus calls on the currency, known as the price of a  risk reversal,  to a nearly 2-year low.  It is more of a risk-on environment than a risk-off environment and people are not afraid that there is going to be a rapid depreciation of the Canadian dollar,  said Simon Côté, managing director, risk management solutions, National Bank Financial. A Reuters poll last week showed that foreign exchange strategists expect the loonie to dip to C$1.36 to the U.S. dollar, or 73.53 U.S. cents, in the short term but to recover some ground in a year as a strengthening domestic economy encourages the Bank of Canada to prepare the market for interest rate hikes. The currency was trading around C$1.3430 on Friday after strong domestic jobs data. The central bank has not raised its policy rate, which sits at 0.5 percent, since 2010 but struck a more upbeat tone in May than investors had expected.  The May meeting was a game changer in terms of viewing the currency pair from a strategic perspective,  said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities. The grind lower in risk reversals could indicate that market participants have become less bearish on the outlook for the Canadian dollar over the multi-month horizons that contracts in the option market tend to be written, Issa added. The loonie has been the weakest performer among G10 currencies this year as oil prices fell and the Trump administration started the countdown toward renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Investors have also worried that record high borrowing by Canadians will weigh on the country's economy if a red-hot housing market slows. But a positive development for the Canadian dollar, such as a rally in oil prices, could put pressure on often-leveraged speculators to cover short positions and accelerate any move higher in the currency.  We are advising our U.S. dollar purchasers to be ready if we go back to C$1.28 ... because we might get this and it might happen fast,  National Bank Financial's Côté said.

The cleric, Ahmad Musa Jebril, who had been living in the Detroit area for some years, is one of several described by authorities as online propagandists who could have influenced the three attackers, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. Jebril was first identified on Sunday as a possible inspiration for the London attacks when the British Broadcasting Corporation ran an interview by its Asian Network with a former friend of one of the attackers, whom he said listened to Jebril's sermons posted on the internet.  I have heard some of this stuff, and it's very radical,  the former friend said.  I am surprised this stuff is still on YouTube and is easily accessible,  the man said. He said he had phoned a British government anti-terrorism hotline to report what he had heard and seen. Several attempts by Reuters to find Jebril to obtain comment were unsuccessful. Jebril is a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent. Nobody answered several calls to a Dearborn, Michigan telephone number listed for Jebril and it did not accept voice mail messages. A lawyer who represented Jebril in an insurance fraud criminal case has retired and could not be reached for comment. Floral tributes are left at a plinth on London Bridge,London, Britain, June 8, 2017.Marko DjuricaThe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit had no comment on Jebril's activity. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack by men who drove a truck into pedestrians on London Bridge and then stabbed revelers in nearby pubs, killing seven people and wounding dozens. Police shot dead three attackers. Laith Alkhouri of Flashpoint, a private company that monitors militant internet activity, said Jebril had sent condolence messages to the family of a British militant who died fighting in 2013 in Syria, where Islamic State has lost territory in recent months.  It comes as no surprise to me that one of the London attackers would have been listening  to Jebril, Alkhouri said. Jebril was convicted in 2005 in Michigan for fraudulent insurance claims on properties he and his father owned. Court documents submitted by the government at his sentencing said Jebril and his father had involvement with Islamist militant groups. In 2014, a judge ordered restrictions on Jebril's use of computers and online access after prosecutors said he had violated conditions of his early release from prison. The restrictions expired in 2015 and were not renewed. Jebril has not posted new Twitter messages since 2014. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College in London described Jebril in a 2014 report as one of two English-speaking  spiritual authorities  who had become inspirational figures for foreigners fighting in Syria.

Our expectation is that these countries will immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation and put forth a good faith effort to resolve their grievances they have with each other,  Tillerson said. The blockade is also hindering U.S. military action in the region and its campaign against Islamic State, he said.

The conservative HDZ party struck a coalition deal with the liberal Croatian People's Party (HNS), representatives of national minorities and a few smaller parties to remain in power and avert a second snap poll in less than a year.  I believe we have now secured stability for the functioning of the government and (state) institutions,  Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told reporters. During the parliamentary debate the opposition severely criticized the deal between the HDZ and liberals, saying it was deceiving voters since the HNS party had won parliamentary seats as part of a pre-election deal with the Social Democrats, the second-strongest parliamentary party. Four of nine liberal parliamentary deputies dissented, refusing to endorse the cooperation with HDZ. The liberals said they entered the ruling coalition because their goal was to preserve political stability. They will run two ministries, those for construction and education.

Under pressure from business groups and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump officials and congressional leaders still need to decide how much to slash tax rates and if the package should increase the federal budget deficit, administration and congressional sources said. The future of a border adjustment tax, or BAT, proposal from House of Representatives Republicans, meant to boost exports and discourage imports, could also be decided within the next two to three weeks, the administration official said. President Donald Trump has pledged to make a tax overhaul a priority. But after 20 weeks in power and numerous distractions, he has yet to offer a tax bill to Congress. Expectations for legislation have slipped repeatedly, from spring to summer and now after the U.S. Labor Day holiday.   Still, stocks are up since Trump's November election win and companies and wealthy Americans are positioning themselves to realize more income in 2018, betting lower taxes are coming. The head of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of three-dozen conservatives capable of stalling legislation, on Friday called on Republicans to acknowledge a lack of consensus on the BAT and produce a tax proposal by the end of July. Trump and fellow Republicans pledged in the election campaign last year to tackle in 2017 the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era. But that agenda has been slowed by infighting over dismantling Obamacare and probes of possible ties between Trump's campaign and alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobbying group that represents chief executives, wrote to Trump and congressional leaders this week calling for a  shift from listening to action  on tax reform. Broad Agreement The administration official, who asked not to be named, said there is broad agreement among participants in the talks on the need to cut taxes, simplify the code, eliminate tax breaks, end taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits and repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in corporate profits held overseas.  But key details remain open to question. More meetings are expected among U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and their staff, the official said. After their third meeting on Tuesday, officials had not decided whether to adopt full expensing for corporations, the administration official said. The policy would allow companies to write off the cost of capital investments such as equipment immediately and plow the money back into their businesses.  The official said the aim of the talks is to agree on a framework by mid-year and release legislation soon after lawmakers' long August recess. A key decision awaits the House Republicans' export-boosting BAT, intended to help pay for reforms while dissuading companies from moving assets, profits and jobs abroad. The BAT, which would tax imports but exempt export revenues from taxation, has run afoul of many Republicans and drawn criticism from the administration. Officials in Congress and the administration are examining options to the BAT that could reduce erosion of the federal tax base, including rules and a minimum corporate tax. Decisions on BAT, revenue neutrality and expensing will help decide if Congress can cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent, as Trump seeks, or 20-25 percent as envisioned by the House Republicans' tax plan.

(Reuters) - Kaliesha Andino has spent the last year running from gunshots. At night, she flashes back to her hiding spot behind a bar in a Florida nightclub, where a bullet ripped through her arm during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The date her life shattered, June 12, 2016, is tattooed in Roman numerals on her other arm, along with images of clouds and an eye to memorialize a friend who was among the 49 people killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Like others who got out alive, Andino, 20, has spent the year since the attack navigating the line between victim and survivor. Her physical wounds have healed. But she searches for exits in crowded rooms and has not been working.   I will never have closure,  she said, adding:  I've got to live right now. I have to cope with the situation.  The death toll in the attack marked the worst in a spate of U.S. shooting rampages in recent years - from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut to an office party in San Bernardino, California - that stoked debate about gun control and left communities grappling with deep emotional and physical wounds. Counseling and medical needs have consumed many survivors working to establish a new normal after gunman Omar Mateen opened fire at Pulse during Latin music night. Some saw their trauma magnified when the tragedy at the gay club outed them as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). One survivor recently had a lodged bullet removed. Others have struggled at times to leave home after the rampage, which also left more than 50 people injured. Mateen held hostages inside for three hours before he died in an exchange of gunfire with police.   They are still so raw,  said attorney Antonio Romanucci, who is suing Mateen's ex-employer and widow on behalf of dozens of victims, including Andino and relatives of some of the deceased.  They are still living it.   Approximately 300 people who were at the club or directly tied to the victims still receive support services from the Orlando United Assistance Center. That is down from the more than 800 helped in the immediate aftermath, said Michael Aponte, director for the resource hub, which involves government and community groups.

People from around the world have left mementos and scrawled notes, now fading in the sun.  Never stop dancing,  reads an inscription on a parking lot barrier. To honor the one-year mark on Monday, June 12, Pulse owner Barbara Poma plans to open the club gate so survivors and victims' relatives can gather inside at 2:02 a.m., when the first shots were fired.   Everybody is still in very different places,  Poma said.  I would not say there is anybody that is ready to move on.  Slideshow (3 Images)At unexpected moments, 31-year-old Juan Jose Cufiño's thoughts return to the night that started as a celebration with friends two days before he was to return to his native Colombia.  He hears bullets pounding the floor and people screaming, he said in Spanish through a translator. He smells blood. The first shot to hit him struck his right arm. Two more tore into his legs. Falling to his knees, Cufiño waited for a fatal blow. A fourth shot pierced his back. When police arrived waving flashlights, the former physical education teacher mustered all his strength to signal that he was alive. He remembers an officer dragging him out by an arm.

A final survey backed other opinion polls in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the Conservatives had widened their lead following a tricky campaign in which their support appeared at times to be ebbing away.  But as many as one in five voters was still undecided this week after a seven-week campaign overshadowed in the later stages by two Islamist attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London in less than two weeks. Most polling stations had increased security as they opened at 0600 GMT, with armed police expected to reinforce regular officers at some locations. May smiled but did not speak to media as she and her husband Philip voted in the village of Sonning on the River Thames in her Maidenhead constituency.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn grinned broadly and gave the thumbs-up to reporters and party workers as he voted in Islington, north London.  I'm very proud of our campaign,  he said.    An Ipsos MORI poll for the London Evening Standard on Thursday put the Conservatives on 44 percent and Labour on 36 percent, a wider lead than a week ago but one which would not give the landslide win foreseen when May called the election seven weeks ago.  The Conservatives had a wobble last week, but have regained a clear lead in the last few days,  said Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI. Headline rates for sterling, hit two-week highs in morning trade in London after the latest polls before later slipping back on concern the election was too close to call.    Market bets on how volatile the pound will be over the next 24 hours surged to their highest in a year.   The market has not bet everything on having a nice clear outcome - it knows we might get a surprise,  said Societe Generale chief macro strategist Kit Juckes.  The only outcome that's got enough clarity to get short-covering is a bigger Conservative majority.  Related CoverageFinal UK opinion poll shows PM May's Conservatives' lead wideningFactbox: How will the United Kingdom election work?From landslide for May to upset defeat - scenarios for UK electionVoting ends at 2100 GMT and an exit poll will be issued then. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT, with the vast majority of the 650 constituencies due to announce results between 0200 GMT and 0500 GMT on Friday morning. Both main parties were on the defensive after Saturday's van and knife attack in the heart of London. May faced questions over cuts in the number of police officers during her six years as interior minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn drew criticism for, among other things, voting against some counter-terrorism legislation. Police investigating the London attacks said they had arrested three more suspects late on Wednesday. Two of the men, aged 27 and 29, were held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism while the third was detained over suspected drugs offences.  In the final hours of campaigning, both leaders returned to their core campaign messages.  If we get Brexit right, we can build a Britain that is more prosperous and more secure, a Britain in which prosperity and opportunity is shared by all,  May said in a last appeal to voters to trust her to  knuckle down and get the job done . After becoming prime minister without an election in the turmoil that followed last year's EU referendum, May wants a personal mandate and a parliamentary majority bigger than the one she inherited from predecessor David Cameron. Basing her campaign on the slogan of  strong and stable leadership , she has said she alone could face the 27 other EU leaders and clinch a deal that would give Britain control over immigration policy while ensuring favorable trading terms. Britain's Primer Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip leave a polling station in Sonning, Britain, June 8, 2017.Eddie KeoghShe has portrayed Corbyn as the weak and hapless leader of a spendthrift party that would hit voters with a  tax bombshell , crash the economy and flounder in the Brexit negotiations. Corbyn has hit back that Conservative fiscal austerity imposed since 2010 has hurt the poor and widened social inequalities. Views from Brussels May's campaign has not gone to plan, and as the poll leads of 20 points or more she was enjoying when she called the early election in April have shrunk, talk of a landslide victory has faded and her personal standing has taken a hit. As a result, the extent of her control over her fractious party and of her margin for maneuver going into the Brexit talks will hinge on the size of her majority, and on whether it is perceived to be a significant improvement on Cameron's. Provided she wins, she will have averted at least one risk: by pushing back the date of the following election to 2022 rather than 2020 as originally planned, she has ensured she will not face crunch time in the Brexit talks at the same time as an election. Slideshow (35 Images)Some in the EU are hoping May does increase her majority, on the basis that the main risk for the bloc is a collapse in talks, and that is more easily avoided with a British government that is not vulnerable at home.  We need a government strong enough to negotiate,  a senior EU lawmaker told Reuters. But others have sought to downplay the impact of the election regardless of the outcome, suggesting that it was little more than a domestic political sideshow.  Will the election of more Tory (Conservative) MPs give May a greater chance of securing a better Brexit deal? For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance,  wrote Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, in an opinion column in the Guardian newspaper.  Maybot  May's troubles began on May 18, when she announced a new policy on care for the elderly that quickly proved unpopular. She backtracked days later, prompting opposition critics to pour scorn on her central claim to offer strong leadership. Opponents were quick to remind voters that May had campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU before embracing Brexit after the referendum, and that she had insisted for months an election would not be in the national interest before calling one. May has reacted by sticking to her campaign messages, endlessly repeating the same slogans and appearing mostly at tightly controlled events - prompting many in the media to deride her as an uninspiring  Maybot . Meanwhile, veteran left-winger Corbyn, who was written off as a no-hoper by most political analysts, surprised on the upside with a policy-rich campaign that drew large, fervent crowds to his events - although skeptics say his appeal in the broader electorate is limited. He proposes building a fairer society through policies such as raising taxes for the richest 5 percent, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure - plans which the Conservatives say are fiscally irresponsible.  Labour’s campaign has already changed the face of British politics,  Corbyn said in a final campaign rally.  As we prepare for government, we have already changed the debate and given people hope. Hope that it doesn't have to be like this, that inequality can be tackled, that austerity can be ended, that you can stand up to the elites and the cynics.  There was only one point of agreement between May and Corbyn, which was that the strongest signal that Britons could send to show they were not cowed by the recent spate of attacks would be to go out and vote.

The advance follows an escalation of tensions between the United States and the Syrian government with its backers over control of the southeastern frontier with Iraq.  The first units of the army and its allies arrived to the Syrian-Iraqi border northeast of al-Tanf,  said the non-Syrian commander in a military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. The area is seen as crucial to Assad's Iranian allies and could open an overland supply route from Tehran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon - a major concern to U.S. allies in the region. A range of Iranian-backed militias from the region, including the Lebanese Hezbollah group, have supported the Syrian government in the six-year war against rebel groups. The Tanf base lies in the Syrian Badia, a vast sparsely populated desert territory that stretches to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders. Damascus has declared the Badia region a military priority. Months of advances by U.S.-backed rebels against Islamic State have allowed them to secure swathes of territory in the Badia, alarming the Syrian government and its allies. The Americans had blocked them through rebel groups in the area, the commander said, so the Syrian army and allied forces opened a new route and pressed on to the border.  It's a message to everyone,  he said without elaborating.  The pro-Assad alliance had threatened this week to hit U.S. positions in Syria, warning that  self-restraint  over American air strikes would end if Washington crossed  red lines . The U.S. launched air strikes on Tuesday against pro-government forces that it said posed a threat to American forces and the Syrian rebel groups they support in the area, the second such strike in recent weeks. Hezbollah's al-Manar television channel said on Friday the army and its allies had  expanded their area of control  in the Badia.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group, said dozens of soldiers and pro-government forces had arrived at the border. They reached a point nearly 50 km north of al-Tanf, after going through the desert around the area held by U.S.-backed rebels, it said.

The British world number one lost seven games in a row from leading 3-2 in the second set, having snatched the opener in a tense tiebreak, and though he recovered to move two sets to one ahead, Wawrinka roared back to claim victory. His only win against one of his biggest rivals at a slam since beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final came in Paris last year when he edged out Wawrinka in the semis. To Murray's credit he was subjected to a more than four-hour barrage by third seed Wawrinka who threw the kitchen sink at his fellow three-times grand slam champion, and only in the fifth set when his legs began to buckle did he crumble.  I lost my way a little bit in that period,  Murray said of the seven-game run that gave Wawrinka renewed vigor.  Over four hours, four-and-a-half hours, there are going to be periods in the match where you're not hitting the ball as well and your opponent is going to be playing well.  And you need to try and ride out the storm a little bit. I didn't do that, that period of the match, for whatever reason.  Murray endured a disappointing claycourt season leading into Roland Garros -- suffering early defeats in Madrid and Rome -- but rediscovered his verve in Paris where his run included victories over Juan Martin del Potro and Kei Nishikori. Wawrinka proved a far more dangerous beast though, striking 87 winners as he twice battled back from a one-set deficit to avenge his defeat by Murray a year ago. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 9, 2017   Great Britain’s Andy Murray during his semi final match against Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka   Reuters / Gonzalo FuentesMurray said he will move on to the grasscourt season in good heart, despite missing out on a 12th grand slam final.  I'm proud of the tournament I had. I did well considering. I was one tiebreak away from getting to the final when I came in really struggling. So I have to be proud of that,  he said.  Maybe the lack of matches hurt me a little bit in the end today. That was a very high intensity match. A lot of long points. When you haven't been playing loads, over four, four-and-a-half hours, that can catch up a little bit.  Murray got within four points of victory in the fourth set but a misjudged dropshot helped Wawrinka grab the tiebreak and at the same time break Murray's resistance.  Physically I didn't feel my best at the end. It is more like I didn't have enough weight on my shot at the end of the match to put him under any real pressure,  Murray, who covered 4.5km in heart-pumping sprints throughout the encounter, said. He will now focus on trying to defend his Wimbledon title and the number one ranking in the second part of the season.  I do feel like having an event like this can give me a boost, and hopefully have a strong grasscourt season and try to understand what worked well this event and what worked well in the sort of 10 days in the build-up,  he explained.  Hopefully I finish the year strong.  Reporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Martyn Herman and Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-frenchopen-murray-idUSKBN1902LT"},

I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans,  Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence.  Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge.  Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything,  the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) chief executive said.  That part takes all of us.

Before the election there had been widespread speculation in the British media that May would replace Hammond if she won a large majority. As well as Hammond, foreign minister Boris Johnson, interior minister Amber Rudd, defense secretary Michael Fallon and Brexit minister David Davis will also remain in their posts.  No further appointments will be made this evening,  May's office said. Hammond's reappointment makes it less likely that the government will significantly relax its grip on public spending after the left-wing Labour Party secured a better-than-expected election result with a plan to invest more in public services.  Hammond, 61, was named chancellor of the exchequer by May shortly after she took over as prime minister nearly a year ago, in the wake of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. British media have reported strains between their teams since then, and their relationship has been more distant than the one between former prime minister David Cameron and his finance minister George Osborne.  Hammond took the blame for a policy U-turn in March when he quickly dropped a plan to raise social security tax for self-employed workers after Conservative lawmakers protested that it broke promises made by the party before an election in 2015. May did not repeat those promises ahead of this year's campaign. Hammond also annoyed many Conservatives who want a clean break with the EU by repeatedly stressing the need for a Brexit deal that allows companies to keep on hiring the migrant workers they need.  In terms of fiscal policy, Hammond has slowed the push to turn Britain's budget deficit into a surplus, but he is wary about significantly relaxing the government's grip on spending or cutting taxes. Media reports before the election mentioned interior minister Rudd and defense minister Fallon as potential replacements of Hammond.   Markets would prefer to have ‘Spreadsheet Phil’ if either of those were the alternative,  said Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services. Before taking over at the finance ministry, Hammond served as foreign minister and defense minister.

After announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that Mexico ships to the United States, officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation. At issue is a new right of first refusal granted to Mexico to supply all U.S. sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders. A coalition of American sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Mexican producers, will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap. They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running. The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated U.S. sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.  The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers.  The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated  settlement of its anti-dumping case, and U.S. sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Workers spray fertilizer in a sugar cane field in Zacatepec de Hidalgo, in Morelos state, Mexico, May 31, 2017. Picture taken May 31, 2017.Edgard GarridoWhile the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact.  Petitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this,  Perry said.  They would rather have anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports.  A Commerce spokesman said that Ross hoped the U.S. sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry-specific concerns to help reach its larger NAFTA goals of reducing U.S. trade deficits. The U.S. sugar industry must probably present evidence of new Mexican dumping before going back to Commerce for more changes to the deal, said Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute and former International Trade Commission chairman.  They would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works,  Pearson said, noting that it raises prices and keeps U.S. refiners well-supplied with raw sugar. Mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative U.S. market, agreeing to ship no less than 70 percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to U.S. refineries. It gave ground on nearly all of the U.S. producers' demands.  American Sugar Alliance spokesman Phillip Hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the USDA, not Mexico, can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports. But Juan Cortina, head of Mexico's main sugar trade group,  said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar, as Mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade.

Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government with help from Northern Irish unionists, despite having failed to win the stronger mandate she had sought to conduct exit talks with the rest of the European Union. While sterling registered its biggest daily fall in eight months, the slump appeared to be checked by expectations from some investors that the government may pursue a softer stance on Brexit and even loosen the purse strings to assuage an austerity-weary electorate.   Faced with this uncertainty, the immediate market response seems fairly reasonable: a modest sell-off in the pound,  PIMCO's head of sterling portfolio management, Mike Amey, said.  Looking ahead, assuming a base case of easier fiscal policy and a  softer  Brexit, we would expect...stability returning to the pound.   Others, though, have argued that without a strong Brexit mandate, the government's hand in negotiations may have been weakened. The pound touched an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro, before recovering some ground later in the day. GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 London's main FTSE 100 stock index .FTSE, composed of multinational companies that largely earn in foreign currency and therefore benefit when the pound falls, climbed as much as 1.3 percent, before closing up 1 percent on the day. [.L] The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index .FTMC, meanwhile, whose constituents are vulnerable to sterling weakness, recovered from an earlier loss to close slightly higher on the day. Housebuilders suffered and gold miners climbed as investors rushed to safety and ditched stocks more exposed to domestic instability. Shares in some British utilities rose on diminishing concerns that energy prices would be capped, as planned by the Conservatives. United Utilities (UU.L) and SSE (SSE.L) were both up 0.2 percent. Challenger banks Metro (MTRO.L) , OneSavings (OSBO.L) and Virgin Money (VM.L), which analysts said were most sensitive to domestic growth, fell particularly sharply. Blue-chip bank RBS (RBS.L) also fell. A five pounds banknote is seen in front of displayed stock graph in this picture illustration taken June 9, 2017.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationBritish 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR fell nearly 3 basis points to 1.01 percent as investors bet on political uncertainty keeping Bank of England rates on hold for longer.  Given the degree of uncertainty that's been unleashed by this election about what will happen next with the Brexit negotiations and how stable this government will be, the prospect of the Bank of England raising rates is pretty much non-existent. People are pushing it back to perhaps 2020,  said Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services. UK credit default swaps (CDS) - which reflect the cost of buying protection against a government defaulting - were trading around their highest since late April. Sterling Skids Slideshow (3 Images)Having slid over 2.5 percent to as low as $1.2636 in early European trade, sterling had recovered to $1.2737 by 1540 GMT. That still left sterling down 1.7 percent against the dollar on the day and on track for its biggest one-day fall since October, though that move was dwarfed by an almost 8 percent dive the day after last June's EU referendum. The pound was almost back to where it had been trading before May called the election on April 18 gave it a boost. The one-month sterling-dollar risk reversal GBP1MRR=, a measure of the balance of bets on the pound rising or falling in the next month, had touched its lowest level since September overnight, indicating a bias for further sterling weakness. But it recovered to reach a one-week high. Some analysts have argued the Conservatives' failure to secure a majority might weaken the case for a  hard  Brexit, in which Britain leaves the EU's single market and customs union, a matter of deep concern for businesses. Talks begin on June 19.  Clearly political uncertainty is the overriding theme here, this is why sterling dropped significantly on the exit poll last night,  said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.  But the fact that it hasn’t weakened as much as many commentators had anticipated I think can be attributed to the discussion about a soft Brexit.

Bearish bets on the loonie ramped up in May to a record high as Canada's largest alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc nearly collapsed in April. But short-sellers are battling a decline in volatility that has hit stock, bond and foreign exchange markets over recent months and which implies that the Canadian dollar will not fall very far. The decline in volatility could leave sellers sitting on positions that are no longer working and looking for an exit all at once if a positive catalyst for the currency emerges.  Canadian dollar sellers are expecting an aggressive Canadian dollar move and the market is saying it is not going to happen,  said Adam Button, currency analyst at ForexLive. Investors typically pay more in the options market for downside than upside protection in the Canadian dollar because the commodity-linked currency tends to weaken fast when appetite for risk declines. But the drop in Canadian dollar volatility has helped reduce the premium that investors are willing to pay for puts versus calls on the currency, known as the price of a  risk reversal,  to a nearly 2-year low.  It is more of a risk-on environment than a risk-off environment and people are not afraid that there is going to be a rapid depreciation of the Canadian dollar,  said Simon Côté, managing director, risk management solutions, National Bank Financial. A Reuters poll last week showed that foreign exchange strategists expect the loonie to dip to C$1.36 to the U.S. dollar, or 73.53 U.S. cents, in the short term but to recover some ground in a year as a strengthening domestic economy encourages the Bank of Canada to prepare the market for interest rate hikes. The currency was trading around C$1.3430 on Friday after strong domestic jobs data. The central bank has not raised its policy rate, which sits at 0.5 percent, since 2010 but struck a more upbeat tone in May than investors had expected.  The May meeting was a game changer in terms of viewing the currency pair from a strategic perspective,  said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities. The grind lower in risk reversals could indicate that market participants have become less bearish on the outlook for the Canadian dollar over the multi-month horizons that contracts in the option market tend to be written, Issa added. The loonie has been the weakest performer among G10 currencies this year as oil prices fell and the Trump administration started the countdown toward renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Investors have also worried that record high borrowing by Canadians will weigh on the country's economy if a red-hot housing market slows. But a positive development for the Canadian dollar, such as a rally in oil prices, could put pressure on often-leveraged speculators to cover short positions and accelerate any move higher in the currency.  We are advising our U.S. dollar purchasers to be ready if we go back to C$1.28 ... because we might get this and it might happen fast,  National Bank Financial's Côté said.

Rate-future yields reflected the perception of a nearly 90 percent probability that the bank would lower the benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points to 9.5 percent at its July monetary policy meeting.     Many investors unwound bets on a lesser 50-basis point reduction, an outlook that had gained traction after the central bank said last month it could reduce the pace of interest rate cuts due to growing political uncertainty. The bank cut rates by 100 bps in May.     In foreign exchange and stock markets, Brazilian traders were monitoring the deliberations of the country's top electoral court in a case that could unseat President Michel Temer if judges rule he used illegal campaign funding in 2014.      Even though the court seemed poised to toss out the case, the president faces a separate corruption investigation, stoking investor caution as Brazil's stocks and currency slipped.     Shares of meatpacker JBS SA were among the biggest decliners after federal police raided offices of the company to investigate the alleged use of insider information in financial market dealings between April and May.     Trading was subdued in other Latin American markets, with caution warranted following weaker Chinese factory gate prices that again cast doubts on economic growth.

Air power has helped Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) gain the upper hand since last year in Libya's conflict between rival groups vying for power.   The panel of experts which reports on violations of U.N. sanctions across Libya said Haftar's forces had received aircraft as well as military vehicles from the United Arab Emirates, and had built up an air base at Al Khadim. The annual U.N. report provides rare detail on the level of outside intervention in Libya, where foreign backing for rival armed camps is widely seen as having exacerbated conflict.   Friday's report said there had been a general increase in direct foreign support to armed factions in Libya, breaching a U.N. arms embargo imposed during the country's 2011 uprising and tightened in 2014. Much of the section on recent transfers of materiel or other assistance was taken up by the development of the LNA air force and reports of UAE assistance.   The United Arab Emirates have been providing both material support and direct support to the LNA, which have significantly increased the air support available to the LNA,  it said.  The panel said its requests for information from the UAE had received no response.  Competition for power and wealth between broad and shifting coalitions of armed groups has thrown Libya into turmoil over the past six years. A collection of Islamist-leaning militias took control of the capital, Tripoli, in 2014, installing a self-declared government as their opponents set up a rival administration in the east. The eastern government is aligned with Haftar, who has close relations to the UAE and Egypt and has rejected a third, U.N.-backed Libyan government that moved to Tripoli in March 2016. Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army has extended its control over towns, military bases and oil facilities in eastern and central Libya since last year. Air power has played a key role in those advances, analysts say. The U.N. report included satellite imagery of Al Khadim air base, about 105 km (65 miles) east of Benghazi, between July 2014 and March 2017, showing a gradual build-up of infrastructure and aircraft, including drones  most probably  operated by the UAE.   The U.N. panel said it received information that attack helicopters were delivered to the LNA in April 2015. One Mi-24p helicopter was traced back to Belarus, which confirmed it had delivered four of the aircraft to the UAE in 2014. It also published a photo of an AT-802i single engine plane which it said was based in eastern Libya. The plane, originally designed for agricultural or firefighting use, was repurposed in the United States for counter-insurgency and sold to the UAE, the report said.  The panel said it had confirmed a delivery of 93 armored personnel carriers and 549 armored and non-armored vehicles to the LNA in the eastern city of Tobruk in April 2016. The personnel carriers likely included Panther T6 and Tygra models, both made by companies based in the UAE, the report said, and were delivered by ship from Saudi Arabia. It said it had received information on further large deliveries of Toyota pick-up trucks and armored 4x4 cars to Tobruk in January and April 2017, on a ship that had passed through Port Said in Egypt.

Swift, one of the world's best-selling pop stars, also made her music available on Pandora, Amazon.com and Tidal streaming services, her management team said. Her catalog had previously only been available on Apple Inc's Music service. The pop star's management said the latest decision to return to all streaming services was taken to celebrate her album  1989  selling over 10 million copies worldwide.  Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services at midnight,  her management's Instagram account called Taylor Nation said late on Thursday. The move coincided with the release on Friday of  Witness,  a new album by Perry, Swift's pop industry rival with whom she has a long-running personal feud. Swift, 27, has no new album to promote.

The announcement by Swift may ramp up rivalry with Perry, 32, who released her new album's first single,  Swish Swish,  last month. She told talk show host Jimmy Fallon the song was  a great anthem for people to use whenever somebody's trying to hold you down or bully you.  Swift's 2014 single  Bad Blood  has been seen as directed at Perry, and the  Firework  singer admitted recently that the two were not friends.  That's true, there is a situation. Honestly, it's really like she (Swift) started it and it's time for her to finish it,  Perry told talk show host James Corden in May.

The IOC's executive board also agreed to add mixed doubles in table tennis, mixed team events in judo, shooting and archery and a mixed team triathlon. IOC President Thomas Bach said the new disciplines would make the games  more youthful, more urban and will include more women . An IOC statement said Tokyo would include a 4 x 400 mixed relay in athletics and a 4 x 100 medley mixed relay in swimming. Swimming would also include two further new events - a men's 800 metres and women's 1500 metres freestyle race. The world athletics body (IAAF) described the mixed relay as a  delightfully chaotic  event. It was staged for the first time at an IAAF event at the world youth championships in Cali, Colombia, in 2015 and was won by South Africa. Another was staged at the world relays in Bahamas in April.

The IOC said that men's and women's madison would be added to track cycling and Freestyle Park to BMX cycling. Boxing, canoeing and rowing had agreed to reduce the number of men's events in exchange for more women's events. The IOC has already agreed to introduce five new sports at the Tokyo Games - baseball, softball, surfing, sports climbing and skateboarding. It said there would be a net increase of 15 events, an overall reduction of 285 athletes compared to Rio in 2016 and  the highest representation of female athletes in Olympic history .

As he expected, Dogus, a Kurdish restaurateur who organizes the British Kebab Awards, was defeated in Thursday's general election.  But after a strong showing in a parliamentary seat long held by the governing Conservatives, he sees a chance of a Labour revival under Jeremy Corbyn, the leader who many in the party had written off as an out-of-date socialist. Dogus sharply closed the gap on the sitting member of parliament from Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency - home to Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and the British capital's financial centre.  The seat is now a marginal for Labour to gain,  Dogus told Reuters after raising Labour's share of the vote by 11 percentage points to 38.4 percent. Dogus is willing to credit Corbyn.  Jeremy's proven everyone wrong ... he ran such a brilliant campaign,  he said.  We've got a new dawn for social democracy ... and I will carry on fighting.  Corbyn, a 68-year-old leftist, has not only survived attempts by some members of his own party to oust him but has also now led Labour to unexpected electoral gains against the Conservatives - something that could change or at least temper the direction of talks May says she will lead to leave the European Union.  I think we've run a great and positive campaign and made a difference,  said Dogus. Just seven weeks ago, any positive messages from what was a deeply divided Labour party were few and far between. A newcomer to running for parliament under the red banner of Labour, Dogus was careful not to criticize Corbyn, crediting him with being the first lawmaker he met when, at 17, he spoke about his Kurdish heritage at his college. But Dogus, who arrived in Britain in his teens from Turkey, was also keen to make his campaign about himself, using his experience with setting up and running small businesses to win over voters, rather than focusing on the Labour leader. Dogus didn't go as far as some Labour candidates who distanced themselves from Corbyn - one even wrote to reassure voters that she understood their misgivings about Corbyn, who the Conservatives bet would be  toxic  to Britons due to his associations with militant groups. If he was to some, almost 13 million Britons who voted Labour on Thursday disagreed. Divisions FILE PHOTO: Supporters wait for Britain's opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at an election rally in Colwyn Bay, Britain June 7, 2017.Phil Noble/File PhotoCorbyn was elected Labour leader almost two years ago on a groundswell for change - a shift mirrored across Europe, where center-left parties have lost support to anti-establishment movements that have emerged since the 2008 crisis. But he was soon challenged by more centrist lawmakers, who felt Corbyn's left-wing agenda was too radical a departure from the business-friendly centre ground that handed them power in 1997 under Tony Blair. After months of slurs bandied between both sides of the party, several centrist lawmakers launched a coup against Corbyn last year. But they failed to unseat him, forcing some to quit the party and others to decide against running when May sent parties scrambling by calling an early election. After lagging behind in the opinion polls in the run up to Thursday's election, several murmured about the possibility of unseating Corbyn after the vote if he had done badly - a suggestion that has been put to rest, at least for now. Chuka Umunna, a one-time favorite for the leadership and a center-left lawmaker, quit Labour's top team of advisers soon after Corbyn became leader, clashing over membership of the European Union, which the veteran leftist was cool over. Slideshow (2 Images) He's confounded lots of people's expectations, my expectations, his expectations,  Umunna told ITV television.  I think he has done a really, really good job getting across a hopeful optimistic vision and set of policies.  Policy Heaven Corbyn drew large crowds to his events, offering voters a promise to build a fairer society through policies such as raising taxes for the richest 5 percent, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure - plans the Conservatives said were uncosted. A source close to the leader told Reuters that while May tried to make the election about Britain's departure from the EU, Labour offered  policies that people overwhelmingly support, policies they have supported for 30-40 years  but had not had a chance to vote on. The source also said that while May stuck to the campaign discipline dictated by her election team, the Labour leader was kept  front and centre  of Labour's campaign, holding public rallies and taking questions from all comers.  Surprised at the amount of detailed policy Labour had prepared, some in May's campaign team also expressed a grudging admiration for Labour's strategy, which they said had managed to speak to many of those who voted for Brexit last June - just the electorate that the Conservatives wanted to target. Instead of heading to the Conservative party, many Brexit supporters turned instead to Labour, attracted by the pledge to renationalise the railways, mail and some energy providers, the Labour source said. For Dogus, who arrived in Britain in 1994 aged almost 14 and took his first job in a Turkish restaurant in the upmarket Mayfair of his constituency, he is keen to build on his political future.  I will carry on fighting. I want to see a fairer Britain,  he said.  This was the start.

Still, all three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, when the central bank is near certain to raise interest rates. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.8 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P; 500. The financial index's 1.7 percent rise topped the gainers among the 11 S&P; 500 sectors, followed by a 1.6 percent gain in energy on the back of higher oil prices. The technology sector was off 1.5 percent, led by declines in Microsoft and Apple. The index is on track to fall for the first time in three days. At 12:49 p.m. ET (1649 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 81.28 points, or 0.38 percent, at 21,263.81, the S&P; 500 was up 4.45 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,438.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 44.28 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6,277.48. U.S. stocks started the session strong after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered.  The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue,  said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. The market's was concerned that the testimony could derail the Trump administration's push to fulfill its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations – promises that were partly behind a post-election rally that drove U.S. stocks to record highs. Investors also looked past the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Chipmaker Nvidia hit a new record high, before reversing course to trade down 4.5 percent at $152.80 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,918 to 898. On the Nasdaq, 1,716 issues rose and 1,089 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

After announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that Mexico ships to the United States, officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation. At issue is a new right of first refusal granted to Mexico to supply all U.S. sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders. A coalition of American sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Mexican producers, will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap. They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running. The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated U.S. sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.  The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers.  The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated  settlement of its anti-dumping case, and U.S. sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Workers spray fertilizer in a sugar cane field in Zacatepec de Hidalgo, in Morelos state, Mexico, May 31, 2017. Picture taken May 31, 2017.Edgard GarridoWhile the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact.  Petitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this,  Perry said.  They would rather have anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports.  A Commerce spokesman said that Ross hoped the U.S. sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry-specific concerns to help reach its larger NAFTA goals of reducing U.S. trade deficits. The U.S. sugar industry must probably present evidence of new Mexican dumping before going back to Commerce for more changes to the deal, said Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute and former International Trade Commission chairman.  They would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works,  Pearson said, noting that it raises prices and keeps U.S. refiners well-supplied with raw sugar. Mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative U.S. market, agreeing to ship no less than 70 percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to U.S. refineries. It gave ground on nearly all of the U.S. producers' demands.  American Sugar Alliance spokesman Phillip Hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the USDA, not Mexico, can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports. But Juan Cortina, head of Mexico's main sugar trade group,  said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar, as Mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade.

As he expected, Dogus, a Kurdish restaurateur who organizes the British Kebab Awards, was defeated in Thursday's general election.  But after a strong showing in a parliamentary seat long held by the governing Conservatives, he sees a chance of a Labour revival under Jeremy Corbyn, the leader who many in the party had written off as an out-of-date socialist. Dogus sharply closed the gap on the sitting member of parliament from Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency - home to Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and the British capital's financial centre.  The seat is now a marginal for Labour to gain,  Dogus told Reuters after raising Labour's share of the vote by 11 percentage points to 38.4 percent. Dogus is willing to credit Corbyn.  Jeremy's proven everyone wrong ... he ran such a brilliant campaign,  he said.  We've got a new dawn for social democracy ... and I will carry on fighting.  Corbyn, a 68-year-old leftist, has not only survived attempts by some members of his own party to oust him but has also now led Labour to unexpected electoral gains against the Conservatives - something that could change or at least temper the direction of talks May says she will lead to leave the European Union.  I think we've run a great and positive campaign and made a difference,  said Dogus. Just seven weeks ago, any positive messages from what was a deeply divided Labour party were few and far between. A newcomer to running for parliament under the red banner of Labour, Dogus was careful not to criticize Corbyn, crediting him with being the first lawmaker he met when, at 17, he spoke about his Kurdish heritage at his college. But Dogus, who arrived in Britain in his teens from Turkey, was also keen to make his campaign about himself, using his experience with setting up and running small businesses to win over voters, rather than focusing on the Labour leader. Dogus didn't go as far as some Labour candidates who distanced themselves from Corbyn - one even wrote to reassure voters that she understood their misgivings about Corbyn, who the Conservatives bet would be  toxic  to Britons due to his associations with militant groups. If he was to some, almost 13 million Britons who voted Labour on Thursday disagreed. Divisions FILE PHOTO: Supporters wait for Britain's opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at an election rally in Colwyn Bay, Britain June 7, 2017.Phil Noble/File PhotoCorbyn was elected Labour leader almost two years ago on a groundswell for change - a shift mirrored across Europe, where center-left parties have lost support to anti-establishment movements that have emerged since the 2008 crisis. But he was soon challenged by more centrist lawmakers, who felt Corbyn's left-wing agenda was too radical a departure from the business-friendly centre ground that handed them power in 1997 under Tony Blair. After months of slurs bandied between both sides of the party, several centrist lawmakers launched a coup against Corbyn last year. But they failed to unseat him, forcing some to quit the party and others to decide against running when May sent parties scrambling by calling an early election. After lagging behind in the opinion polls in the run up to Thursday's election, several murmured about the possibility of unseating Corbyn after the vote if he had done badly - a suggestion that has been put to rest, at least for now. Chuka Umunna, a one-time favorite for the leadership and a center-left lawmaker, quit Labour's top team of advisers soon after Corbyn became leader, clashing over membership of the European Union, which the veteran leftist was cool over. Slideshow (2 Images) He's confounded lots of people's expectations, my expectations, his expectations,  Umunna told ITV television.  I think he has done a really, really good job getting across a hopeful optimistic vision and set of policies.  Policy Heaven Corbyn drew large crowds to his events, offering voters a promise to build a fairer society through policies such as raising taxes for the richest 5 percent, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure - plans the Conservatives said were uncosted. A source close to the leader told Reuters that while May tried to make the election about Britain's departure from the EU, Labour offered  policies that people overwhelmingly support, policies they have supported for 30-40 years  but had not had a chance to vote on. The source also said that while May stuck to the campaign discipline dictated by her election team, the Labour leader was kept  front and centre  of Labour's campaign, holding public rallies and taking questions from all comers.  Surprised at the amount of detailed policy Labour had prepared, some in May's campaign team also expressed a grudging admiration for Labour's strategy, which they said had managed to speak to many of those who voted for Brexit last June - just the electorate that the Conservatives wanted to target. Instead of heading to the Conservative party, many Brexit supporters turned instead to Labour, attracted by the pledge to renationalise the railways, mail and some energy providers, the Labour source said. For Dogus, who arrived in Britain in 1994 aged almost 14 and took his first job in a Turkish restaurant in the upmarket Mayfair of his constituency, he is keen to build on his political future.  I will carry on fighting. I want to see a fairer Britain,  he said.  This was the start.

The pace of those additions has slowed with a decline in crude prices over the past two months, with the average total added over the past four weeks falling to just 7. U.S. crude futures were trading around $46 a barrel, putting the front-month on track to decline for a third straight week, on widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tighten the market.

The proposal by the largest U.N. contributor is an opening bid in negotiations by the 193-member General Assembly budget committee, which has to agree funding for 13 peacekeeping missions and a logistics support office by the end of June. Reuters reviewed a document compiling the peacekeeping budget proposals by states and regional groups. The U.S. proposal of an annual budget of $6.99 billion was the lowest made - nearly $1 billion less than U.N. chief Antonio Guterres' proposal and almost $570 million less than the recommendation by the world body's budget advisory experts. Under the U.S. proposal, Washington would have to pay $1.99 billion compared with $2.25 billion for the current year. While Trump has described U.S. funding for the United Nations as  peanuts  compared to its  important work,  he complains its share of the peacekeeping bill, currently 28.5 percent, is  unfair.  In his 2018 budget proposal he requested Congress approve only $1.2 billion for U.N. peacekeeping.  This is $1 billion less than the U.S. peacekeeping bill for the 12 months to June 30, 2017, when the total peacekeeping budget was $7.9 billion. Washington currently owes $417 million for peacekeeping, U.N. officials said. Ultimately the U.S. Congress sets the federal government budget and will decide how much money is made available for U.N. peacekeeping. Republicans, who control both houses, and Democrats have said they do not support drastic cuts proposed by Trump. Under the U.S. proposal to the U.N. budget committee, the largest cuts would be made to some of the most expensive operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Sudan's Darfur, according to the document seen by Reuters. The 193 U.N. member states are working to negotiate a compromise by the end of the month between the U.S. proposal, at the low end of the scale, and the highest suggestion of $7.72 billion by the African Group, according to the document. Trump also wants to enforce a 25 percent cap on the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping. The U.N. General Assembly is due to negotiate next year new levels of contributions by countries for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The United States also pays 22 percent of the $5.4 billion U.N. core budget. Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.

At the U.S. Transportation Department, Trump said his goal was to solve  one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately-needed infrastructure – and that is the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build.  Trump said the White House is moving ahead with  massive permit reform  and setting up a new council to help project managers navigate bureaucratic hurdles.  This Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process,  Trump said. He said the council will make sure that any federal agency that  consistently delays projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties. We will hold the bureaucracy accountable.  The White House is also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality  to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal, state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way.  Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the department is asking for public input on other changes it can make to speed approvals.

The Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting.  It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes,  Trump said.

How can a country prosper under such restraints?  Trump asked.  Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? I was not elected to continue a failed system – I was elected to change it.  The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending.

The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a U.S. tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier. The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests. It found that one U.S. subsidy program, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had  adverse effects , involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland. Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State.  The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding,  the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said.      European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint.  The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities,   Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state. Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet. In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy. That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal.    The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing. Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster U.S. tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company.

Machado left Wednesday's game in Baltimore against the Pittsburgh Pirates with left wrist soreness. He was injured in the second inning when Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen slid into Machado on a steal of third. The Orioles star left the game in the top of the fourth and was replaced at third by Ruben Tejada.  I think we will have a better idea tomorrow,  manager Buck Showalter said of Machado's condition after a 6-1 loss Thursday.  We were challenged the last two nights.  Chris Davis, normally a first baseman, was in the lineup starting at third for the Orioles at Washington. Machado walked into the Orioles clubhouse around 4 p.m. Thursday with a soft brace on his left wrist. He then went into the office of manager Buck Showalter, and Machado's name was not on the lineup card that was posted about 5 p.m.  The MRI (report) was good; it is just sore and hopefully it is day-to-day and will see if it loosens up,  Showalter said before the game.  He didn't dodge the slide ... but we have dodged more extensive damage.  Machado is hitting .213 with 12 homers and 27 RBIs in 221 at-bats, with a .430 slugging mark and a .289 on-base average.

Manager Buck Showalter said after the game he wanted to give Jones a break as the Orioles are in the midst of 20 games in 20 days, with a series starting Friday in New York against the Yankees. 3B Chris Davis started at third base Thursday and continues to struggle at the plate. He was hitless in four at-bats and struck out twice, and he now has a .228 average. 1B Mark Trumbo, normally the DH, made a rare start at first Thursday in a National League park in Washington. Manager Buck Showalter said he was none too pleased about moving players around as Chris Davis made the start at third in place of the injured Manny Machado.

On Wednesday, he made throws from 120 feet in a long toss session. Rodriguez was injured last Friday when he fell down the bullpen steps in Baltimore and this development is viewed as  pretty good advancement,  according to manager John Farrell. 2B Dustin Pedroia (left wrist sprain) took early batting practice in the hitting cage Thursday and remains scheduled to be activated from the disabled list Friday against Detroit. Manager John Farrell said Pedroia cleared all  physical markers  in his recovery work, which included seeing live pitching from RHP Carson Smith, who is rehabbing from last year's Tommy John surgery.

LHP Jon Lester (3-4) allowed four runs at Wrigley Field for the first time since Sept. 20, 2015, against St. Louis, snapping a run of 23 home starts allowing three or fewer runs. That was the longest streak in Wrigley Field history. He also suffered his first loss at home since May 15, 2016, snapping a 12-game winning streak. LHP Brett Anderson was moved to the 60-day disabled list on Thursday. Anderson, listed as having lower back strain, was placed on the 10-day disabled list on May 7 and had started rehab work. He's 2-2 with an 8.18 ERA in six starts.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-playerwatch-idUSMTZED69AHXP0O"},

Keuchel, who was a late scratch for a Wednesday start at Kansas City, returned Thursday to Houston to be examined.  I know there's going to be some conspiracy theories on how this all went down, but I'll give you the exact timeline,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  Right before the anthem (Wednesday) it was told to me that he was feeling weak and wasn't feeling right. He wasn't looking right. At that point we scratched him from the start and brought him in. There was a scurry in the dugout getting everybody ready. (Dayan) Diaz had to get down to the bullpen, the rest of the relievers had to get ready a little bit sooner. In the evaluation inside, he started to reveal that he had neck soreness during his warm-up routine. That built the idea that we had to get him back to Houston to get him evaluated by our doctors. He did, and I don't know whether the sickness led to more symptoms in his neck, or whether they just helped each other come to the surface. It's unfortunate that we lose him. Him having been sick for a couple of days and not throwing, we sent him to the DL. We're concerned because we're going to have to put him on the DL so he'll miss at least one start.  RHP Collin McHugh was transferred from the 10-day disabled list to the 60-day disabled list. McHugh opened the season on the 10-day DL with right shoulder tendinitis and suffered a right elbow impingement during his first rehab appearance. He was initially scheduled to be sidelined for a minimum of six weeks. RHP Joe Musgrove, who was placed on the disabled list May 27 with shoulder pain, threw 20-to-25 pitches in a bullpen session and experienced no problems. He could come off the disabled list and start Monday.  It will be important to see how I react (Friday) after getting off the mound for the first time in two weeks,  Musgrove said.  I feel really good. Right now it's just a waiting game until tomorrow to see how I feel. I don't expect not to be sore after my first time back. The next two weeks I'll have to listen to my body.  RHP Francis Martes, who is ranked as the Astros' No. 1 prospect, was called up from Triple-A Fresno, where he was 0-2 with a 5.29 ERA in eight starts. In a June 1 start, Martes gave up seven runs, four earned, on six hits in 2 2/3 innings. Martes was in the bullpen Thursday but was not used. If RHP Joe Musgrove is unable to go on Monday, he could start.  Martes is here for the first time,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  It was great to see him. He had a big smile on his face. We're fortunate that we brought him up. He has great stuff, high-end stuff. He's had some trouble inside the strike zone and finding the strike zone in Triple-A. This level can make him raise his standards a little bit.  RHP Lance McCullers took a no-hitter into the seventh inning before giving up a one-out triple to Royals CF Lorenzo Cain.  They were swinging early,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said on why McCullers was so effective.  I think some of that is a credit to his pitch repertoire. They've got to watch out for his breaking ball, so when he was starting with his fastball and change-up, they wanted to swing. (That) was to his favor when he was locating his pitches. That's the best part of having three different ways to get you out. You can feed off their aggressiveness, get ahead and then the put-away breaking ball was there for him.

This time he made it hold up as he fanned a career-high 12 batters and got the win over the Orioles as he allowed one run in 7 1/3 innings.

Werth is hitting .262 with eight homers and 18 RBIs. INF Stephen Drew, who had two hits and drove in two, was the only position player on either team who didn't strike out. The Orioles fanned 15 times, and 26 of the 51 outs came via a punchout. 1B Ryan Zimmerman was not in the starting lineup Thursday as he got a rest after a west coast road trip. Zimmerman entered the day leading the National League in hitting. 2B Daniel Murphy was not in the starting lineup against the Baltimore Orioles as manager Dusty Baker rested several of his starters.

He leads all major-leaguers with 22 doubles and has more two-base hits than he had all last season (21). Herrera has doubled in six straight games, tying the franchise record, and became only the third player in franchise record to accomplish the feat. RHP Ben Lively went seven innings for the second straight start. He became the first Philadelphia player to go at least seven in each of his first two career starts since Carlton Loewer in 1998. He struck out Tyler Flowers for his first career punchout; he did not strike out a batter in his debut. RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-3, 4.50 ERA) will make his 13th start of the season Friday against St. Louis.

On the verge of being removed, Ramirez retired three straight batters in the fourth after giving up back-to-back singles.

Two children have been paralyzed in the last few months in Islamic State-held Deir al-Zor in the first polio cases in Syria since 2014 and in the same eastern province bordering Iraq where a different strain caused 36 cases in 2013-2014. Vaccinating even 50 percent of the estimated 90,000 children aged under 5 in the Mayadin area of Deir al-Zor would probably not be enough to stop the outbreak and might actually sow the seeds for the next outbreak, WHO's Oliver Rosenbauer said. Immunisation rates need to be closer to 80 percent to have maximum effect and protect a population, he told a briefing.  Are we concerned that we're in fact going to be seeding further future polio vaccine-derived outbreaks? ... Absolutely, that is a concern. And that is why this vaccine must be used judiciously and to try to ensure the highest level of coverage,  Rosenbauer said.  This is kind of what has become known as the OPV, the oral polio vaccine paradox,  he said. The new cases are a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, a rare type which can emerge in under-immunised communities after mutating from strains contained in the oral polio vaccine.   Such vaccine-derived strains tend to be less dangerous than wild polio virus strains, they tend to cause less cases, they tend not to travel so easily geographically. That's all kind of the silver lining and should play in our favor operationally,  he said. All polio strains can paralyze within hours. Syria is one of the last remaining pockets of the virus worldwide. The virus remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

DuPont Fabros's shares rose as much as 14.6 percent to hit a record high of $63.46, just below the offer price of $63.60 based on Thursday's close.     Washington-based DuPont Fabros operates 12 data centers in three major U.S. markets, including Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia, while Digital Realty operates 145 data centers globally. Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros, which rent out space that companies use for data centers, have also benefited from the surge in demand for data and video. The combined company would be the  home to the cloud,  Digital Realty Chief Executive William Stein said on a conference call on Friday. The deal, which would add companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Yahoo Inc YHOO.O to Digital Realty's customer base, is expected to close in the second half. DuPont Fabros shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.545 Digital Realty shares per share held, the companies said. Based on Digital Realty's Thursday close, the offer is worth $63.60 per share, a premium of 14.9 percent to DuPont Fabros's close. The implied price per share is $64.32, according to a Digital Realty presentation. The equity value of the deal is about $4.95 billion based on DuPont Fabros's 77.8 million shares outstanding as of April 2, according to Thomson Reuters data.       The addition of (DuPont Fabros) should enhance (Digital Realty's) growth prospects, as it's acquiring an asset that's growing at plus 10 percent per year, with recent momentum including a 28.8 MW lease signed by who we believe to be (Apple),  Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a client note.     The deal has the potential to realize up to $18 million of annualized overhead savings, the companies said.     San Francisco, California-based Digital Realty has been acquiring companies to boost growth. The company said in May last year that it would buy eight data centers from Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) and in October 2015 bought Telx Group Inc. Digital Realty said it had a fully committed bridge loan facility from BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup to finance the DuPont Fabros deal. BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are Digital Realty's financial advisers while Goldman Sachs is advising DuPont Fabros. DuPont Fabros's shares were up 12 percent in morning trading, while Digital Realty's stock was little changed at $116.77.

Under terms of the plan, which are under analysis by Oi's executives and financial advisers, new stock would be offered to shareholders and, if some of them forgo the chance to subscribe, to other investors, Schroeder said in an interview. He declined to elaborate on the plan.  That would come on top of a revised proposal laid out in March, which offers financial creditors 25 percent of its equity or convertible bonds to be called in three years, at which point they could own up to 38 percent of its shares. Creditors have not yet extended a counteroffer to that plan, Schroeder said.  The new money would be used entirely to bolster Oi's balance sheet, enabling Brazil's fourth-largest mobile carrier to undertake more investments in fiber optic and connectivity, Schroeder said. He expects to present the plan to the company's board before the end of the month. The Oi reorganization process, which began almost a year ago and remains Brazil's largest bankruptcy protection case to date, has been marked by a series of disputes between creditors and shareholders over the fate of Brazil's No. 4 wireless carrier. The government has threatened to intervene should Oi stakeholders fail to reach an agreement. Common shares rose 1 percent in early afternoon trading, extending gains to nearly 50 percent so far this year. Schroeder is confident that differences among creditors and shareholders will eventually ironed out. He wants to propose a final vote on Oi's amended in-court reorganization plan by about September, well ahead of the bankruptcy court's deadline of February 2018.  It's a constant work of fine-tuning the proposal, until most parties involved consider it fair and valuable,  Schroeder said. Orascom TMT Holdings SAE and a group of bondholders have repeatedly given management and shareholders of Oi additional time to amend the latter's original reorganization plan.  Other creditors and investors, including billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp, have also presented their own reorganization proposals in recent months.

A peace deal signed last year between the government and the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) ended half a century of conflict. The accord has seen about 7,000 FARC fighters leave their strongholds and gather in 26 demobilization zones where so far rebels have surrendered about a third of their weapons to the United Nations. But now a new battle is on: to preserve Colombia's forests that are under threat from farmers seeking grazing land and criminal gangs cutting down trees for illegal gold mining. Colombia is home to a swathe of rainforest roughly the size of Germany and England combined. It is in war-torn areas like Caqueta where deforestation is on the rise following the FARC demobilization, and where Colombia - in partnership with Norway - is focusing efforts to halt forest loss with a scheme that offers former fighters training and jobs as forest guardians. As FARC fighters abandon their jungle strongholds, once no-go conflict areas are opening up for business. Farmers are pushing deeper into forests, cutting down more trees to make way for grazing land for cattle and agriculture.  We are seeing early signs of this already in Colombia so that is definitely a concern,  Vidar Helgesen, Norway's environment minister, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  With peace and with the prospect of FARC handing in their arms, existing farmers are ... more offensive in their approaches, they are more daring in that they are also expanding and engaging in practices that are not sustainable,  Helgesen said this week on a visit to Colombia to launch the new forest conservation program. Norway is donating about $3.5 million over two years to the pilot project it hopes will stem deforestation by offering paid jobs to ex-FARC fighters and communities to safeguard forests. When forests are degraded or destroyed, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, with deforestation accounting for 10 to 15 percent of carbon emissions worldwide.  We hope this project can be the way for more activities whereby peace comes with green dividends,  Helgesen said. Ex-Combatants  About 1,100 ex-FARC fighters, as well as villagers in Caqueta, will be trained in how to track and report illegal logging, along with sustainable farming methods and eco-tourism projects - a way of helping them integrate back into civilian society. Some jobs will be offered as forest guardians in national parks, others in local government environment agencies.  Reintegration is very important for the return to civilian life and when giving economic opportunities there's a bigger chance that the reconciliation process will succeed,  Helgesen said. Joshua Mitrotti, head of Colombia's reintegration agency, said integrating thousands of ex-guerrillas into society requires access to education and training, and on businesses and rural communities willing to give them a second chance.  This program is the first initiative that combines environmental protection with reincorporation .. while protecting land and creating income generation,  Mitrotti said. Many former fighters have spent most of their lives fighting in the jungle and have few other skills and little education. The first challenge is getting ex-fighters back in schools, said Christian Visnes at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), the aid agency carrying out the project on the ground. A survey of about 6,300 FARC fighters by NRC this year showed about 10 percent are illiterate and only two in five have finished primary school. By providing skills training and jobs, rebels are less likely to pick up a weapon again and join other criminal groups.  It's about creating opportunities to take away the incentive to become part of another (criminal) group,  said Visnes, Latin America director of NRC. Paid to Protect Forests Colombia has declared the goal of zero net deforestation by 2020 and halting the loss of all natural forest by 2030. Norway is also helping Colombia and other countries to stem forest less through the United Nations program aimed at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).  Countries participating in REDD+ receive payouts for meeting verified emission reduction targets for slowing deforestation over several years. The payments are usually distributed to farmers, grassroots communities and indigenous groups working on forest protection. Under the REDD+ program, Colombia on Wednesday received a payment of $10 million from Norway aimed at promoting sustainable rural development in war-torn regions. This follows the first payment of $6 million last year from Norway, Britain and Germany for reducing emissions from deforestation in its Amazon rainforest in 2013 and 2014. Rich from offshore oil, Norway is the biggest donor to REDD+, and is also financing projects to help protect forests from Ethiopia and Liberia to Peru and Guyana, as well as projects worth $1 billion each for Indonesia and Brazil. But the program has struggled to attract private funding and governments need to do more to get businesses on board, Helgesen said. According to a 2015 report by U.S.-based environmental group Forest Trends, REDD+ is  significantly short  of estimates indicating at least $20 billion per year is needed to reduce global deforestation by 50 percent.  We are way short of where we should be in terms of funding,  Helgesen said.

The Russian and U.S. special envoys for Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev and Michael Ratney, and other officials have met at least twice in the Jordanian capital Amman in the past two weeks and will talk again soon, the officials and diplomats said. The talks are at an early stage of discussing the boundaries of the proposed de-escalation zone in Deraa province, on the border with Jordan, and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, they said.  Diplomats say the talks could represent a major new attempt by Washington and Moscow, Syria's main foreign backer, to reach an understanding on how to end six years of conflict which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, estimates has killed close to half a million people. Iran, Russia and Turkey brokered a deal in the Kazakh capital, Astana, in May to create four de-escalation zones in Syria. But the United States wants no role in the southwest, Russia's ally in the war, the diplomats said. Washington has misgivings about the Astana talks and wants to forge a bilateral understanding with Moscow in an area of strategic interest to the United States and its allies, Jordan and Israel.  The Americans are talking to the Russians and proposing a deconfliction zone outside the Astana process without the Iranians and their proxies,  said one senior diplomat.  The United States is proposing a de-escalation zone covering areas held by both rebel and government forces that could eventually turn into a safe area, the envoys and officials said.   The two sides are in the process of drafting its borders... and which outside forces will be on the ground. But there are many flaws on how to implement it,  said a regional intelligence official who is familiar with the talks but is not authorized to speak publicly.     Time may be of the essence. Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran, is expanding its foothold in the southwest and dozens of raids this week by the Syrian army and new troop deployments by Hezbollah in Deraa city were intended to pre-empt or wreck any agreement, a Western intelligence source said.  The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A U.S. State Department official said:  We have nothing to announce regarding reports of discussions about southern Syria. The United States remains committed to supporting a diplomatic resolution to the Syrian conflict, one which can bring about a more representative and peaceful Syria, free of terrorism.  A Free Syrian Army fighter takes a position in the eastern part of the rebel-held town of Dael in Deraa Governorate, Syria, June 8, 2017.Alaa Al-Faqiru.s. Mistrust of Iran  Under the Astana accord, de-escalation was envisaged as the halt of hostilities between government forces and opposition groups and the creation of conditions for humanitarian access, medical assistance, the return of displaced civilians to their homes and restoration of damaged infrastructure. Safe zones should be guaranteed by all parties to a conflict.  U.S. officials have told the Russian negotiators that the Syrian army and Iranian-backed troops are exploiting the Astana agreement to free up additional troops for other battles, the source familiar with the negotiations said.  The United States has taken a tough stance against Tehran under President Donald Trump. But Iran and allied militias are integral to groups supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Although Trump has voiced support for safe zones in Syria, Washington opposes Iran's involvement as a guarantor of the de-escalation zones set out in the Astana accord, and regards Assad's track record in upholding previous agreements as poor. In the talks with Moscow, Washington has proposed a halt in military offensives by Western-vetted rebels who control swathes of Deraa and Quneitra, a regional intelligence official said. Jordan's role in the deal is important because of its leverage over rebels in that area. Deraa and Quneitra are home to tens of thousands of people and form a center of the insurgency against Assad. They are a potential launchpad for rebel attacks on the Syrian capital Damascus, 40 miles (64 km) to the north. U.S. enthusiasm to push the deal depends on Russia forcing the Iran-backed militias to leave the area.  Iran and its proxies have to be out of this zone. This is key to the deal being proposed,  he said.  Regional tensions are on the rise and the warfare in southern Syria has worsened, pitting Western-backed rebels around the Tanf base near the border with Iraq against Syria's army and militias backed by Iran. There are doubts in the West that Russia can rein in the growing involvement in the region of Iran and its allies, two senior diplomats familiar with the talks said.  There are other difficulties. Jordan wants a deal that keeps the Deraa front quiet and eases the plight of civilians under the threat of army bombardment.

Here is a guide to how the election will work. Election Basics Polls open at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) and close at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT), though anyone who is in the queue to vote when the polls close may do so. Voting is not compulsory. Britain is a parliamentary democracy, meaning that the government is formed from lawmakers rather than being separately elected. The defining principle for any prospective government is that it has the support of a majority of lawmakers in the elected lower chamber of parliament, the House of Commons. The national election is thus the election for the House of Commons. Voters are asked to elect a member of parliament for their local constituency, which on average have about 72,000 voters. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means a winner-takes all situation. There is no system of proportional representation for candidates who come second in each constituency. For the election to produce a majority government, the biggest party theoretically must win at least 326 seats of the 650 regional constituencies. But in practice, the threshold for a majority is around 323, because the Irish republican Sinn Fein party does not take up any seats it wins in Northern Ireland. A party which wins a majority will seek to implement policy proposals which it set out during the campaign. By convention, the unelected upper house, called the House of Lords, will not block or hinder policies that were pledged during the campaign. If the government has a small majority or needs to enter coalition, its ability to run the country will be typically tested by a vote on the Queen's Speech -- a speech at the start of a parliament setting out a legislative agenda which has been prepared by the prospective government and is read out by Queen Elizabeth. The Electorate Turnout at national elections in Britain has fallen since the 1950s, when it used to be over 80 percent. The number of register voters in the 2015 general election was 46.4 million. Turnout was 66.4 percent, the highest turnout since 1997.  Turnout was higher at the 2016 referendum on EU membership, with 72.2 percent of an electorate of 46,500,001 voting. The deadline to register to vote was Monday May 22. On one day alone, the electoral commission received 622,000 applications. The greatest spike in applications to register was among young people, with nearly 250,000 applications from under 25s on the day of the deadline. In 2015, turnout among those aged 18-24 was just 43 percent. The opposition Labour Party polls better with younger voters, while May's Conservatives are more popular with older generations. In all, more than one million people under 25 have registered to vote since the election was announced in April, compared to around 700,000 in the same time period ahead of the 2015 election. Fewer over 55s have registered this time around compared to two years ago. However, the Electoral Commission said that approximately 30 percent of under 34s had not been registered compared to 4 percent of over 55s. Estimates from 2015 suggest that approximately 85 percent of the eligible population are registered to vote. Who Is in Charge Now? Parliament was officially dissolved on May 2 and all 650 seats declared vacant.  Prime Minister Theresa May and her team of ministers remain in charge of their departments and retain their ministerial decision-making power. But, by convention, the government refrains from taking major policy decisions, entering new long-term commitments or making high-profile appointments. If a national emergency forces the government to act quickly, it may consult with the opposition informally to discuss the best course of action. When a new parliament is formed, it may be required to endorse actions taken during the interim period. What's the Likely Outcome? Theresa May's Conservatives currently hold a working majority of 17, and she called the early election in the hope of increasing it. The polls indicate she will win, though it is  unclear by how much. There is a large discrepancy between the pollsters, even as the consensus is that May wins while Labour has closed the gap on the Conservatives. Polling firms widely predicted there would be no overall majority in 2015, with Labour possibly the largest party. The Conservative victory - and majority - came as a shock to pollsters and has prompted soul-searching.  From the pollsters' point of view this is an experimental election,  YouGov's Anthony Wells said in a blog post.  We all got it wrong in 2015 and we are all trying different methods to get it right this year.  Wells said that polls in 2015 over-estimated how likely young voters were to vote, and the difference between the pollsters this time around stems from the varied approaches to the problem that the firms are taking this time around The Role of the Queen Queen Elizabeth has the power to dismiss a prime minister or to make a personal choice of successor but a monarch has not exercised this right since 1834 and the tradition is considered archaic. By long-standing convention the queen does not get involved in party politics, and the formation of the next government is left to the parties to resolve amongst themselves.

The party with the most female lawmakers is the opposition Labour party with nearly half of its elected members of parliament (MPs) women, while the smaller Green Party's only elected MP is a woman. However the announcement on Friday that Prime Minister Theresa May would form a new government with support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), after her Conservative party fell short of a parliamentary majority, raised concerns from LGBT and women's rights campaigners. The DUP, one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe, has fought to maintain tight restrictions on abortion and opposes gay marriage. The vote returned a small increase in women MPs from 191 in the last election in 2015 after which Britain ranked 46th in an index of parliaments based on the number of female lawmakers, behind many European countries and others such as Rwanda, Cuba and Belarus.  We are moving forward at a snail's pace and this is embarrassingly slow,  Sam Smethers, chief executive of women's rights organization the Fawcett Society, said in a statement.  If the UK only improves by this much at each election, we will not see equal representation in parliament until 2062,  she said. The election saw a record number of openly gay, lesbian or bisexual people elected, and a record number of transgender people stand for election. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights groups said there could be as many as 44 openly gay, lesbian or bisexual elected MPs.  Representation of LGBT people in positions of power is extremely important. It demonstrates how much progress Britain has made,  Bex Stinson, head of trans inclusion for LGBT rights charity Stonewall told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Having LGBT people visible in public life helps foster an inclusive society, and provides strong role models for those who don't yet feel able to be themselves and for young LGBT people.  But several members of Northern Ireland's DUP have come under fire after making homophobic comments. In 2015, Northern Ireland health minister and DUP senior member Jim Wells resigned after police started an investigation into comments he made linking gay marriage to child abuse.  You don't bring a child up in a homosexual relationship. That child is far more likely to be abused and neglected,  Wells told a campaign event in the last election. Many LGBT rights supporters took to social media to voice their concern.  We share the concerns of countless LGBT people, and our friends, of all political persuasions who are deeply anxious about the potential Democratic Unionist Party involvement in the new government,  Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, wrote in a blog.  It's important to remember that our values are defined as much by who we stand with as what we stand for,  she added. Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Ros Russell.

USDA boosted its forecast for U.S. winter wheat production to 1.250 billion bushels from 1.246 billion. It raised its yield projection in Kansas by 2 bushels per acre to 44.0 bushels per acre. The government also said in its monthly supply and demand report that soybean stocks will swell by more than expected due to weakening soymeal usage that forced processing plants to slow down their crushing pace. USDA left its outlook for corn stocks and production unchanged despite concerns about adverse weather hindering development of the recently seeded crop. Domestic wheat ending stocks for the 2017/18 marketing year that began on June 1 were pegged at 924 million bushels, 10 million bushels higher than the government's May estimate. The 2017/18 winter wheat production forecast was raised to 1.250 billion bushels from 1.246 billion. Analysts had predicted the report would show winter wheat production sliding to 1.239 billion bushels, according to the average of estimates in a Reuters poll. U.S. wheat stocks for 2017/18 had been expected to come in at 911 million bushels. USDA also raised its 2017/18 world wheat stocks projection to 261.19 million tonnes, above the high end of a range of analysts' estimates, largely due to a bump of 2 million tonnes to its Russian production forecast. For soybeans, USDA pegged U.S. 2016/17 ending stocks at 450 million bushels, up 15 million bushels from its May outlook and bigger than the average of analysts' estimates.  It cut its outlook for the 2016/17 soy crush by 15 million bushels to 1.910 billion bushels. Soymeal usage was lowered to 33.150 million tons from 33.500 million tons. The government also raised its 2017/18 soybean ending stocks forecast by 15 million to account for the bigger carry-in from the 2016/17 crop year. Global soybean ending stocks for 2016/17 were raised to 93.21 million tonnes, above analysts' expectations. USDA raised its estimate of Brazil's soybean crop to 114 million tonnes from 111.60 million tonnes.  U.S. corn ending stocks for both 2016/17 and 2017/18 were left unchanged at 2.295 billion bushels and 2.110 billion bushels, respectively.

The FTSE 100 gained 1 percent after Britons dealt the governing Conservative party a punishing blow, denying May the increased mandate she had gambled on and forcing her into an alliance with Northern Ireland's DUP party to command a majority in parliament. Individual winners and losers were largely driven by currency, and some sectors seen as particularly sensitive to Brexit instability also saw heavy losses. But a buoyant U.S. market added fuel to British shares as investors largely shrugged off the political turmoil, with traders highlighting volume and volatility were subdued compared with the Brexit vote and U.S. election. Money managers eyed medium-term tailwinds from the shock result.  It's not being seen as a global risk-off event, it's being seen as a domestic political event,  said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. Sterling fell as much as 2.4 percent before recovering some of its losses. It boosted the internationally focused, exporter-heavy blue chip index, while stocks with greater domestic exposure were under pressure. BP, Smurfit Kappa and Diageo, which derive most of their earnings overseas, were top gainers. Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Development and Persimmon all fell 1.3 to 3.3 percent in a reaction to the domestic uncertainty. Banks RBS and Lloyds also weighed. Their more internationally focused peers HSBC and Standard Chartered gained. Gold miner Fresnillo jumped more than 3 percent as investors rushed to the safe haven asset. Large caps suffered their first weekly loss since late April, however, as hesitant trading earlier in the week took its toll. Mid caps, which derive a larger part of earnings from the UK, pulled out of their dive with an hour of trading to go. Investors snapped up stocks that had sunk earlier as concern around economic instability swirled.  Unless we see signs the bottom is falling out of UK consumer spending and/or the pound, these moves are an opportunity to buy a quality business trading below intrinsic value,  said Gary Paulin, head of global equities at Northern Trust. The FTSE 250 ended 0.1 percent higher. Challenger banks Metro Bank, OneSavings Virgin Money, meanwhile, saw some of the sharpest falls as analysts pointed to their high gearing to domestic lending. Pub chain Wetherspoons fell more than 3 percent, along with large-caps Whitbread and IAG, in a wobble among stocks exposed to consumer sentiment which tends to be dented by political turmoil. Real estate investment trusts (REITs), seen as a barometer of sentiment on Brexit due to their holdings of London office space, were the biggest FTSE all-share fallers on the day.  There's a lot of emotional trading on the back of news such as this,  said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva.  I would guard against reading too much into these moves.  And silver linings were found as some investors, including star fund manager Neil Woodford, predicted the election would yield a softer Brexit, improving the outlook for British stocks in the medium term.

The backwardation in the market - a formation in the forward curve in which the price of metal for future delivery is below the spot price, can suggest a near-term shortage of metal and has recently steepened, prompting a wave of buying.   That pushed prices through the 16-year declining trendline at $868 an ounce, triggering a further surge that took them to their highest since early 2001 at $914.70 an ounce. Spot palladium was at $884.60 an ounce at 1345 GMT, up 3.7 percent.   The background for palladium is for good industrial demand and likely a significant market deficit this year, and on top of course you've got this speculative squeeze,  Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said.  The backwardation has got a lot steeper in the last day. Metal for immediate delivery is very tight, and that is being reflected in those forward rates moving into an even steeper backwardation.  Traders reported a reluctance to lend the metal, suggesting tightness in near-term supply. Chart patterns indicate that the metal is vulnerable to a sell-off from these elevated levels, however, technical analysts said. Gold fell for a third day, meanwhile, after British elections failed to deliver a clear majority for Prime Minister Theresa May, knocking the pound sharply lower and helping lift the dollar index to its highest since late May.   Spot gold was down 1 percent at $1,265.91 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures for August delivery were $10.90 an ounce lower at $1,268.60. Sterling-denominated gold rose to a near two-month high of 1,007.98 pounds an ounce as the British currency fell as much as 2.5 percent. Along with a drop in the euro, that helped lift the dollar half a percent versus a currency basket.  Meanwhile the FTSE share index, composed largely of companies that earn foreign currencies and benefit from a weaker pound, rose 0.5 percent, undermining potential demand for gold as a haven from risk.  A lot of the financial markets haven't moved as much as you might have thought,  Oxford Economics analyst Daniel Smith said.  The dollar's a little bit stronger, and that's going to weigh on gold,  he said.  It's not just about risk appetite, it's about what people are thinking on the dollar.

This Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process,  Trump said.

Boston Dynamics and Schaft could eventually be vested with the Vision Fund, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters  Schaft, a University of Tokyo spinoff, develops bipedal robots designed to negotiate uneven terrain.  Robotics as a field has great potential, and we're happy to see Boston Dynamics and Schaft join the SoftBank team to continue contributing to the next generation of robotics,  an Alphabet spokesperson said. Boston Dynamics has produced a number of robots that mimic human and animal movement, including Atlas, a humanoid model that co-ordinates motion and balance using its arms and legs and can pick itself up off the ground when knocked over. It is best known for building robots that look as if they belong in science-fiction movies and are often co-developed or funded by the U.S. military. Its military projects would mean the acquisition is likely to be subject to regulatory approval from Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company was acquired by Google in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, but the team struggled to find its place within the tech giant after Rubin's departure, former Boston Dynamics employees said.  They're advancing the state of the art in independent robotics. They are probably the leader in the U.S.,  said Arnis Mangolds, a robotics expert who has worked with Boston Dynamics.  But the problem is it's not ready for prime time, and very few people have a tolerance for that.

Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.P), is set to become the leading supplier to the fast growing automotive chip market following the deal, the largest-ever in the semiconductor industry. The European Commission listed a raft of concerns about the combined company's ability and incentives to squeeze out rivals and jack up prices. It said the company may bundle its products, excluding rivals in baseband chipsets and near field communication (NFC) chips. The combined entity would also have the ability and the incentive to change NXP's intellectual property licensing practices, in particular the NFC technology, by tying this to Qualcomm's patent portfolio, the EU watchdog said. It also voiced concerns about reduced competition in semiconductors used in cars. The Commission will decide on the deal by Oct. 17.  Qualcomm said it was confident of allaying the EU's worries and that it still expects to close the deal by the end of the year. U.S. antitrust enforcers gave the green light for the deal in April without demanding concessions. Reuters reported on June 2 that Qualcomm may face a lengthy EU investigation after it declined to offer concessions to address the bloc's concerns in a preliminary review.

One justice on Brazil's seven-member Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) voted to annul the election victory of former president Dilma Rousseff and her then vice-president Temer. But four justices signaled they will vote to acquit them, which would keep Temer in office.  Even if acquitted, Temer is likely to soon face separate charges for corruption and obstruction of justice in a case involving allegations of hush money paid to a potential witness in a massive graft scandal. The Supreme Court also opened an investigation into the president late last month. Temer, a third of his Cabinet and dozens of powerful congressmen are under investigation for corruption, jeopardizing the prospects of the congressional passage of the government's economic austerity package.  The measures, aimed at chopping the gaping budget deficit, are seen as critical to shore up investor confidence in Brazil. Temer took office as president a year ago following the impeachment of Rousseff for breaking budget laws, which she and her supporters say was a soft coup orchestrated by Temer and his allies in an effort to thwart the corruption investigations. President of the Superior Electoral Court Gilmar Mendes attends a session where Brazil's electoral court will take up a 2014 case that could unseat President Michel Temer, in Brasilia, Brazil June 9, 2017.Adriano MachadoExcluded Testimony The TSE voted 4-3 on Thursday to not allow plea-bargain testimony from 77 executives at builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] to be used as evidence in the election case. That testimony includes accusations that the company funneled millions of illegal funding to the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket.    Slideshow (3 Images)The exclusion of that evidence strengthened Temer's line of argument, and analysts think that was a strong signal that the court will rule in his favor and maintain the 2014 election result. The head of the electoral court, Gilmar Mendes, said that each of the remaining justices would have about 20 minutes on Friday to lay out their reasoning for their votes in the trial, which is being broadcast live on television. If the court sticks to that plan, a final verdict is expected by the afternoon. The separate investigation by prosecutors of Temer includes a secret recording of a conversation with an executive of meatpacker JBS SA. In it, the president appears to condone paying bribes to an imprisoned former lawmaker to keep him from turning state's witness and providing potentially devastating testimony about graft. Temer has denied any wrongdoing. But a one-time top aide to the leader, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, was caught on a police video released last month picking up a bag with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash from a JBS executive.

The senior unsecured €250m eight non-call three note, upsized by €10m from the originally planned €240m, priced at 6%, the tight end of initial price talk at 6%-6.25%, but only after the deal's covenant package was amended. The notes initially included covenants that allow the company's restricted subsidiaries to make investments in its unrestricted subsidiaries, something which could have enabled Superior Industries, an autoparts manufacturer, to insulate assets from creditors. Those assets could also be used as collateral to back new debt.  They have a J Crew-style provision in the documents that allows the company to siphon off key assets through unrestricted subsidiaries,  one investor said at the early stages of marketing. US retailer J Crew transferred valuable intellectual property into a Cayman Islands  unrestricted subsidiary  in December last year. This allowed it to alter its debt and liens covenants to the detriment of bondholders. The possible inclusion of a similar provision in a European deal for the first time raised the question of whether or not bond terms are facing the risk of further erosion. However, the controversial clause was then removed from the notes' documents entirely. A market source said the provision was not purposefully included in the bond's documents but was carried over from a US precedent that had been used to draft them. TPG, J Crew's private equity owner, also holds preferred equity in Superior Industries. The source added that the term was ultimately removed to keep investors happy, particularly given Superior Industries' position as a debut issuer in the market. Increasing Resistance? The deal comes as another demonstration of increasing resistance from investors against aggressive deal terms, which have flourished of late in the supply-short high-yield market, where buyers are crying out for deals. Superior Industries follows bureau de change operator Travelex, which was forced to sweeten the terms of its €360m bond to convince investors in late April, tweaking an aggressive covenant package, as well as extending call protection.  Travelex, together with Superior Industries, to me shows a change. There is a shift, putting more power, more negotiating power, in investors' hands with regard to covenants when the book isn't filling quickly enough,  said Sabrina Fox, head of European research at credit research firm Covenant Review. However, with both Superior Industries and Travelex widely seen as challenged credits, it remains to be seen whether or not investors will be able to push back on less problematic names. While Travelex's business model had come under fire for the declining demand for currency exchange services, investors questioned Superior Industries' first-quarter sales and the state of the auto market. Several investors said they were not focused on the deal's covenants. A second investor said the primary issue was the company's weak prospects for cashflow generation and leverage level, rather than the covenants.  The covenants are something that would put us off if we liked the credit. The first thing we do is decide if we like the credit, then we go into the covenants. The covenants are not make or break for me,  he said. Another investor said the covenants did not affect his fund's decision, given the small amount purchased and a rare juicy yield on offer.  People should have been furious,  the first investor said.  The risk with controversial deals from a credit perspective is that people don't like the credit from the beginning and don't read the prospectus. That's what makes it so difficult to push back.  Timing Fox added that timing has been playing a key role in limiting investor ability to push back on deal terms, with accounts often having no more than a day or two to review a transaction between announcement and pricing and getting to grips with the terms on offer. Drive-by trades, where a deal prices on the day of its announcement, have also not been uncommon in the high-yield market of late. The most recent issuers to go down such a route have been UPC and Ardagh. Some drive-by deals follow non-deal roadshows, where issuers are supposed to hold discussions with investors without marketing a transaction.  I do wonder whether it (non-deal roadshows) will become more of a theme if banks and law firms keep seeing the push-back,  Fox said.  Is it going to be a way of them avoiding making changes once the deal comes out, because they've already filled the book before the prospectus has been distributed?  With European interest rates eventually bound to rise, several bankers told IFR they are pushing issuers to come to the market and lock in cheap rates while they can. Against that backdrop, companies are likely to remain keen to close deals as soon as possible. Despite the trade's challenging nature, market reaction to Superior Industries' deal was positive, with the note trading up to a bid price of 101.540 to yield 5.722% less than a day after it priced, according to Tradeweb data. Proceeds from the bond will be used to refinance the bridge loan Superior Industries took out to acquire Germany-based automotive parts company Uniwheels.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index ended the session 0.3 percent higher, having moved in and out positive territory throughout the day, while the UK's internationally-facing blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index outperformed with a gain of 1 percent.  Whilst a hung parliament was not the specific outcome that many expected, asset prices in the UK and to a certain extent globally, already discounted a period of extended political uncertainty given the complexity of delivering on the outcome of last year's EU referendum,  said Paras Anand, CIO European Equities at Fidelity International.    Simply put, that we are facing a period of political uncertainty is nothing new,  he added. After hitting their highest level in nearly two years in May on the back of a surprisingly strong earnings seasons and record inflows, European equities have been moving sideways with investors seeking fresh catalysts to extend the rally.         British voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in a snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. That prompted sterling to fall as much as 2.5 percent, which in turn gave a strong boost to British companies which sell outside their country. Among them were packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (SKG.L), miner Antofagasta (ANTO.L), bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and oil major BP (BP.L), all up between 2.5 and 5 percent. In turn, companies that make most of their revenues in the UK were hit with Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) down 1 percent and  supermarket Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) down 1.8 percent. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013.Stefan WermuthSome investors said May's failure to get a strong hand in parliament lowered the chances of a so called  hard Brexit , a development which could ultimately boost the pound.  The outcome is a clear near-term market negative, but in the medium-term the probability of shifting the UK towards a 'softer' Brexit position and less fiscal tightening have increased,” Deutsche Bank FX strategist George Saravelos said in a note to clients. On the broader European market, Italian bank UBI Banca (UBI.MI) rose 3.5 percent, among top gainers on the STOXX, as investors were upbeat about a possible rescue of two troubled regional lenders. Traders also cited an upbeat note from local broker Equita which upgraded the stock to  buy , saying that the market had underestimated the benefits of an acquisition.  Basic resources stocks also helped lift the STOXX as copper prices rose, helped by supply concerns in Chile and recent data pointing to robust import demand from China. Back in the UK, utilities including Centrica (CNA.L) and SSE (SSE.L) all rose before trimming gains as prospects of a hung parliament diluted risks of harsher regulation - the Conservatives and Labour party have both proposed tariff caps. Stocks linked to the British housebuilding industry were the biggest STOXX fallers. Builders merchant Travis Perkins (TPK.L) fell 3 percent, Howden Joinery (HWDN.L) dropped 2.8 percent and housebuilder Berkeley Group (BKGH.L) was down 3.6 percent. UK travel stocks and pub companies also fell, while the domestically exposed FTSE 250 .FTMC index recovered to end 0.1 percent higher.  So lots of uncertainties and the domestic political and economic path forward is murky. However for UK equities the outlook is more measured and we will be looking for selective buying opportunities,  said Richard Colwell, Head of UK Equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

American football lags far behind soccer and basketball in China, but the huge potential market of 1.4 billion people has caught the attention of the National Football League.     This year's Super Bowl championship was streamed live for the first time in China, where 1.5 million mostly young fans watch weekly NFL games on digital platforms.      NFL stars are pitching in to help build the fan base. Tom Brady, a five-time Super Bowl winning quarterback, will visit Beijing and the commercial hub of Shanghai later in June.             Essence of America      GSG initially wanted to set up an adult league, but spotted the youth niche five years ago, said co-founder Michael Jin. Today it has 5,000 players whose parents spend between $1,700 and $3,000 annually for training, uniforms and equipment.    Parents like football because it stresses discipline, team skills and exposes their pre-teen children to a new culture.  A lot of parents think football is actually the essence of American culture,  Jin said.     At a recent Friday night game, a father cheering for his son said he appreciated the toughness of the sport.  It's very manly and the kids like it a lot,  he said. Parents at the game said they were not overly concerned about the risk of injury, which has fueled a safety debate in the United States.  They’re not running that fast or hitting that hard,  said one parent, who sought anonymity.  It's not a big risk.

GSG has expanded to Shanghai and the eastern city of Hangzhou and will soon open a franchise in eastern Qingdao. It aims to reach 10,000 players in two years.       GSG is not profitable but the funds say they are patient.       If you get in a hurry and compromise your service, it hurts your reputation,  said Pan Shijian, a partner at Kaixing, which set up a 10-billion-yuan sports fund last year with property developer Kaisa Group.  The one-year old Future League is a key part of GSG’s effort to build its brand.     Taking a page from American high school football, Future League games are held on Friday nights, complete with uniformed referees, cheering fans and a camera crew for post-game interviews.  This year GSG began livestreaming games in partnership with sports media company LeSports, drawing about 200,000 to watch the winning score by the Eagles' Li against the Sharklets.

A ceasefire between the Turkish state and the PKK broke down in July 2015, plunging Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast into some of the worst violence in decades. The autonomy-seeking PKK first took up arms against the state in 1984. It is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.

Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government with help from Northern Irish unionists, despite having failed to win the stronger mandate she had sought to conduct exit talks with the rest of the European Union. While sterling registered its biggest daily fall in eight months, the slump appeared to be checked by expectations from some investors that the government may pursue a softer stance on Brexit and even loosen the purse strings to assuage an austerity-weary electorate.   Faced with this uncertainty, the immediate market response seems fairly reasonable: a modest sell-off in the pound,  PIMCO's head of sterling portfolio management, Mike Amey, said.  Looking ahead, assuming a base case of easier fiscal policy and a  softer  Brexit, we would expect...stability returning to the pound.   Others, though, have argued that without a strong Brexit mandate, the government's hand in negotiations may have been weakened. The pound touched an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro, before recovering some ground later in the day. GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 London's main FTSE 100 stock index .FTSE, composed of multinational companies that largely earn in foreign currency and therefore benefit when the pound falls, climbed as much as 1.3 percent, before closing up 1 percent on the day. [.L] The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index .FTMC, meanwhile, whose constituents are vulnerable to sterling weakness, recovered from an earlier loss to close slightly higher on the day. Housebuilders suffered and gold miners climbed as investors rushed to safety and ditched stocks more exposed to domestic instability. Shares in some British utilities rose on diminishing concerns that energy prices would be capped, as planned by the Conservatives. United Utilities (UU.L) and SSE (SSE.L) were both up 0.2 percent. Challenger banks Metro (MTRO.L) , OneSavings (OSBO.L) and Virgin Money (VM.L), which analysts said were most sensitive to domestic growth, fell particularly sharply. Blue-chip bank RBS (RBS.L) also fell. A five pounds banknote is seen in front of displayed stock graph in this picture illustration taken June 9, 2017.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationBritish 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR fell nearly 3 basis points to 1.01 percent as investors bet on political uncertainty keeping Bank of England rates on hold for longer.  Given the degree of uncertainty that's been unleashed by this election about what will happen next with the Brexit negotiations and how stable this government will be, the prospect of the Bank of England raising rates is pretty much non-existent. People are pushing it back to perhaps 2020,  said Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services. UK credit default swaps (CDS) - which reflect the cost of buying protection against a government defaulting - were trading around their highest since late April. Sterling Skids Slideshow (3 Images)Having slid over 2.5 percent to as low as $1.2636 in early European trade, sterling had recovered to $1.2737 by 1540 GMT. That still left sterling down 1.7 percent against the dollar on the day and on track for its biggest one-day fall since October, though that move was dwarfed by an almost 8 percent dive the day after last June's EU referendum. The pound was almost back to where it had been trading before May called the election on April 18 gave it a boost. The one-month sterling-dollar risk reversal GBP1MRR=, a measure of the balance of bets on the pound rising or falling in the next month, had touched its lowest level since September overnight, indicating a bias for further sterling weakness. But it recovered to reach a one-week high. Some analysts have argued the Conservatives' failure to secure a majority might weaken the case for a  hard  Brexit, in which Britain leaves the EU's single market and customs union, a matter of deep concern for businesses. Talks begin on June 19.  Clearly political uncertainty is the overriding theme here, this is why sterling dropped significantly on the exit poll last night,  said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.  But the fact that it hasn’t weakened as much as many commentators had anticipated I think can be attributed to the discussion about a soft Brexit.

The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a U.S. tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier. The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests. It found that one U.S. subsidy program, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had  adverse effects , involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland. Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State.  The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding,  the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said.      European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint.  The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities,   Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state. Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet. In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy. That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal.    The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing. Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster U.S. tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company.

Swimming would also include two further new events - a men's 800 metres and women's 1500 metres freestyle race. The world athletics body (IAAF) described the mixed relay as a  delightfully chaotic  event.

Voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in an election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. May was attempting to form a working relationship with unionists from Northern Ireland. The three biggest firms - Fitch, Moody's and S&P; Global - all have a negative outlook on their respective ratings for Britain. There are what decide at what cost Britain can borrow. While none changed their rating on Friday, they all issued statements warning of the risks the new political questions  pose on Britain, the world's fifth biggest economy.       The UK general election result creates uncertainty over the policy platform, political cohesion and longevity of the next UK government,  Fitch said in a statement.  This will have implications for Brexit and potentially fiscal policy.  Fitch added that the hung parliament increased the range of possible outcomes to British talks on leaving the European Union - including a disorderly exit and potentially a  softer  deal.  S&P; Global said the election won't immediately affect the country's credit ratings but warned it could create further uncertainty by potentially delaying Brexit negotiations.  In our view, the lack of a majority for any party is likely to delay Brexit negotiations, scheduled to start very soon,  S&P; Global said in an emailed statement.  Furthermore, we do not exclude the possibility of another snap election. These considerations are reflected in our current negative outlook on the long-term ratings.  S&P; Global and Fitch downgraded the sovereign to AA immediately after a vote last June by the country to leave the European Union.  Fiscal Plans The opposition Labour party ate into the ruling Conservative's majority in Thursday's vote by campaigning left-wing on an anti-austerity, pro-social spending platform. Analysts say this may encourage the government to relax its grip on spending, especially as there is a lack of momentum in the economy. But that could be a worrying sign for ratings firms.  Moody's said that the UK's rating would depend upon the outcome of Brexit and fiscal developments given the country's budget deficit and rising public debt.  It said it was  monitoring the UK's process of forming a new government and will assess the credit implications in due course . Moody's ranks the UK one notch above the other two agencies at Aa1, a rating it has held since February 2013. Fitch also added that the loss of 21 seats by the Scottish National Party reduced the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.

The JPMorgan chief executive is losing his leading successor candidate, Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames. Granted, the bank’s division heads are all more than capable executives, but age or inexperience probably means they’d be interim CEOs at best.  Zames is both young and well-traveled. Now 46, he was head of fixed-income trading before Dimon in 2012 asked him to clean up the mess left when the bank’s chief investment office lost $6 billion in the infamous “London Whale” fiasco. His duties as COO then grew. He wants, though, to go back to running a business, he told the New York Times on Thursday – possibly in financial technology. Zames is the latest top executive to leave the bank in recent years as Dimon, 61, extends his now 11-and-a-half-year reign at the top.  Former investment banking bosses Jes Staley and Bill Winters now run Barclays and Standard Chartered, respectively. Frank Bisignano, Zames’s co-COO for a time, now heads up First Data, while one-time retail chief Charlie Scharf stepped down last fall after four years as boss of Visa. JPMorgan’s board is by no means bereft of alternatives now that Zames is joining the exodus. Trouble is, none of them is an obvious candidate to run the bank long term. Gordon Smith has had great success overseeing the consumer and community bank, not least in keeping the retail-banking and credit-card division’s tech skills ahead of the pack. But at 58 he’s only three years younger than Dimon, who has no intention of leaving any time soon.  Daniel Pinto has kept the investment bank powering ahead, but has little experience in other parts of the organization. The same applies to asset-management boss Mary Erdoes. Commercial bank chief Doug Petno used to be an investment banker, but has a relatively low profile in a smaller part of the company. There is one other candidate: Marianne Lake, who has shone as finance chief and is well known to investors. She, though, has never run a major business. Handing her the reins to the CIO is a start. If Dimon gives her a larger P&L; to manage, it’ll send a strong signal that she’s the next anointed one.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

We have completed the 5th rescue and now have 716 people onboard. Unfortunately, for one person we arrived too late,  the group said.  No details were immediately available about the identity of the dead person or those rescued. Most of the people reaching Italy by sea are from sub-Saharan Africa and some 15 percent are from Bangladesh.

Voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in a ballot she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. May was attempting to form a working relationship with unionists from Northern Ireland to stay in power. The three biggest firms - Fitch, Moody's and S&P; Global - all have a negative outlook on their respective ratings for Britain. Ratings influence at what cost a government can borrow money in financial markets. While no agency changed their rating on Friday, they all issued statements warning of the risks the new political questions pose on Britain, the world's fifth biggest economy.  The UK general election result creates uncertainty over the policy platform, political cohesion and longevity of the next UK government,  Fitch said in a statement.  This will have implications for Brexit and potentially fiscal policy.  Fitch added that the hung parliament increased the range of possible outcomes to British talks on leaving the European Union - including a disorderly exit and potentially a  softer  deal. S&P; Global said the election won't immediately affect the country's credit ratings but warned it could create further uncertainty by potentially delaying Brexit negotiations.  In our view, the lack of a majority for any party is likely to delay Brexit negotiations, scheduled to start very soon,  S&P; Global said in an emailed statement.  Furthermore, we do not exclude the possibility of another snap election. These considerations are reflected in our current negative outlook on the long-term ratings.  S&P; Global and Fitch downgraded the sovereign to AA immediately after a vote last June by the country to leave the European Union. Fiscal Plans The opposition Labour party ate into the ruling Conservative's majority in Thursday's vote by campaigning left-wing on an anti-austerity, pro-social spending platform. Analysts say this may encourage the government to relax its grip on spending, especially as there is a lack of momentum in the economy. But that could be a worrying sign for ratings firms. Moody's said that the UK's rating would depend upon the outcome of Brexit and fiscal developments given the country's budget deficit and rising public debt. It said it was  monitoring the UK's process of forming a new government and will assess the credit implications in due course . Moody's ranks the UK one notch above the other two agencies at Aa1, a rating it has held since February 2013. Fitch also added that the loss of 21 seats by the Scottish National Party reduced the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.

Two children have been paralyzed in the last few months in Islamic State-held Deir al-Zor in the first polio cases in Syria since 2014 and in the same eastern province bordering Iraq where a different strain caused 36 cases in 2013-2014. Vaccinating even 50 percent of the estimated 90,000 children aged under 5 in the Mayadin area of Deir al-Zor would probably not be enough to stop the outbreak and might actually sow the seeds for the next outbreak, WHO's Oliver Rosenbauer said. Immunisation rates need to be closer to 80 percent to have maximum effect and protect a population, he told a briefing.  Are we concerned that we're in fact going to be seeding further future polio vaccine-derived outbreaks? ... Absolutely, that is a concern. And that is why this vaccine must be used judiciously and to try to ensure the highest level of coverage,  Rosenbauer said.  This is kind of what has become known as the OPV, the oral polio vaccine paradox,  he said. The new cases are a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, a rare type which can emerge in under-immunised communities after mutating from strains contained in the oral polio vaccine.   Such vaccine-derived strains tend to be less dangerous than wild polio virus strains, they tend to cause less cases, they tend not to travel so easily geographically. That's all kind of the silver lining and should play in our favor operationally,  he said. All polio strains can paralyze within hours. Syria is one of the last remaining pockets of the virus worldwide. The virus remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index ended the session 0.3 percent higher, having moved in and out positive territory throughout the day, while the UK's internationally-facing blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index outperformed with a gain of 1 percent.  Whilst a hung parliament was not the specific outcome that many expected, asset prices in the UK and to a certain extent globally, already discounted a period of extended political uncertainty given the complexity of delivering on the outcome of last year's EU referendum,  said Paras Anand, CIO European Equities at Fidelity International.    Simply put, that we are facing a period of political uncertainty is nothing new,  he added. After hitting their highest level in nearly two years in May on the back of a surprisingly strong earnings seasons and record inflows, European equities have been moving sideways with investors seeking fresh catalysts to extend the rally.         British voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in a snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. That prompted sterling to fall as much as 2.5 percent, which in turn gave a strong boost to British companies which sell outside their country. Among them were packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (SKG.L), miner Antofagasta (ANTO.L), bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and oil major BP (BP.L), all up between 2.5 and 5 percent. In turn, companies that make most of their revenues in the UK were hit with Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) down 1 percent and  supermarket Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) down 1.8 percent. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013.Stefan WermuthSome investors said May's failure to get a strong hand in parliament lowered the chances of a so called  hard Brexit , a development which could ultimately boost the pound.  The outcome is a clear near-term market negative, but in the medium-term the probability of shifting the UK towards a 'softer' Brexit position and less fiscal tightening have increased,” Deutsche Bank FX strategist George Saravelos said in a note to clients. On the broader European market, Italian bank UBI Banca (UBI.MI) rose 3.5 percent, among top gainers on the STOXX, as investors were upbeat about a possible rescue of two troubled regional lenders. Traders also cited an upbeat note from local broker Equita which upgraded the stock to  buy , saying that the market had underestimated the benefits of an acquisition.  Basic resources stocks also helped lift the STOXX as copper prices rose, helped by supply concerns in Chile and recent data pointing to robust import demand from China. Back in the UK, utilities including Centrica (CNA.L) and SSE (SSE.L) all rose before trimming gains as prospects of a hung parliament diluted risks of harsher regulation - the Conservatives and Labour party have both proposed tariff caps. Stocks linked to the British housebuilding industry were the biggest STOXX fallers. Builders merchant Travis Perkins (TPK.L) fell 3 percent, Howden Joinery (HWDN.L) dropped 2.8 percent and housebuilder Berkeley Group (BKGH.L) was down 3.6 percent. UK travel stocks and pub companies also fell, while the domestically exposed FTSE 250 .FTMC index recovered to end 0.1 percent higher.  So lots of uncertainties and the domestic political and economic path forward is murky. However for UK equities the outlook is more measured and we will be looking for selective buying opportunities,  said Richard Colwell, Head of UK Equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government with help from Northern Irish unionists, despite having failed to win the stronger mandate she had sought to conduct exit talks with the rest of the European Union. While sterling registered its biggest daily fall in eight months, the slump appeared to be checked by expectations from some investors that the government may pursue a softer stance on Brexit and even loosen the purse strings to assuage an austerity-weary electorate.   Faced with this uncertainty, the immediate market response seems fairly reasonable: a modest sell-off in the pound,  PIMCO's head of sterling portfolio management, Mike Amey, said.  Looking ahead, assuming a base case of easier fiscal policy and a  softer  Brexit, we would expect...stability returning to the pound.   Others, though, have argued that without a strong Brexit mandate, the government's hand in negotiations may have been weakened. The pound touched an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro, before recovering some ground later in the day. GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 London's main FTSE 100 stock index .FTSE, composed of multinational companies that largely earn in foreign currency and therefore benefit when the pound falls, climbed as much as 1.3 percent, before closing up 1 percent on the day. [.L] The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index .FTMC, meanwhile, whose constituents are vulnerable to sterling weakness, recovered from an earlier loss to close slightly higher on the day. Housebuilders suffered and gold miners climbed as investors rushed to safety and ditched stocks more exposed to domestic instability. Shares in some British utilities rose on diminishing concerns that energy prices would be capped, as planned by the Conservatives. United Utilities (UU.L) and SSE (SSE.L) were both up 0.2 percent. Challenger banks Metro (MTRO.L) , OneSavings (OSBO.L) and Virgin Money (VM.L), which analysts said were most sensitive to domestic growth, fell particularly sharply. Blue-chip bank RBS (RBS.L) also fell. A five pounds banknote is seen in front of displayed stock graph in this picture illustration taken June 9, 2017.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationBritish 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR fell nearly 3 basis points to 1.01 percent as investors bet on political uncertainty keeping Bank of England rates on hold for longer.  Given the degree of uncertainty that's been unleashed by this election about what will happen next with the Brexit negotiations and how stable this government will be, the prospect of the Bank of England raising rates is pretty much non-existent. People are pushing it back to perhaps 2020,  said Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services. UK credit default swaps (CDS) - which reflect the cost of buying protection against a government defaulting - were trading around their highest since late April. Sterling Skids Slideshow (3 Images)Having slid over 2.5 percent to as low as $1.2636 in early European trade, sterling had recovered to $1.2737 by 1540 GMT. That still left sterling down 1.7 percent against the dollar on the day and on track for its biggest one-day fall since October, though that move was dwarfed by an almost 8 percent dive the day after last June's EU referendum. The pound was almost back to where it had been trading before May called the election on April 18 gave it a boost. The one-month sterling-dollar risk reversal GBP1MRR=, a measure of the balance of bets on the pound rising or falling in the next month, had touched its lowest level since September overnight, indicating a bias for further sterling weakness. But it recovered to reach a one-week high. Some analysts have argued the Conservatives' failure to secure a majority might weaken the case for a  hard  Brexit, in which Britain leaves the EU's single market and customs union, a matter of deep concern for businesses. Talks begin on June 19.  Clearly political uncertainty is the overriding theme here, this is why sterling dropped significantly on the exit poll last night,  said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.  But the fact that it hasn’t weakened as much as many commentators had anticipated I think can be attributed to the discussion about a soft Brexit.

The probe threatens to cast a shadow over the first round of a parliamentary election on Sunday, though it and other misconduct allegations appear not to have hurt Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM). Opinion polls show the party on course to win a landslide majority.  The prosecutor's office said the preliminary investigation follows a letter received from a former Modem employee who said he was paid in 2010-2011 in part by parliamentary funds for work he carried out for the party. The affair is awkward for Macron, who has picked two ministers from Modem, Justice Minister Francois Bayrou and European Affairs Minister Marielle de Sarnez. Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said any minister put under formal investigation for improper conduct must resign. A formal investigation follows a preliminary inquiry if the prosecutor sees grounds for a full-blown probe.  I don't think his position is weakened,  Philippe said of Bayrou on Europe 1 radio.  On Thursday, Modem said in a statement that it had  respected all the rules and all the obligations of an employer.  It did not immediately react to news of the investigation. In March, the Paris prosecutor began a preliminary investigation into 19 European parliament lawmakers, including de Sarnez, following a complaint from an opponent. De Sarnez denies any wrongdoing.

The Outlook is Negative.  A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR and NATIONAL RATINGS DBN's Long and Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs, National Ratings, Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) are driven by Fitch's assumption of a high probability of support from the Namibian sovereign (BBB-/Negative) for the bank in case of need.  The Negative Outlook on the bank's Long-Term IDRs and National Long-Term Rating mirror the Negative Outlook on the sovereign. Fitch's assessment of the high probability of sovereign support for DBN considers (1) the bank's important and long-lasting role in funding the government's economic policy and objectives, (2) its 100% state-ownership (3) significant funding guarantees from the state. In our view, DBN is strategically important to Namibia as the country's primary development bank, incorporated by an act of parliament with a mandate to finance socio-economic development. Its mandate is clearly outlined in the bank's act establishing it as an independent legal entity and incorporated as a public company. The bank provides infrastructure finance to both private and public enterprises in key economic sectors. It also undertakes special tasks if requested by the government, such as financing projects/entities of national importance. DBN's strategy is fully aligned with government policy and public missions, including the National Development Plan. DBN is a 100%-owned entity and comes under the oversight of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). There is a strong record of support for the bank including significant state funding guarantees (around 90% of DBN's debt was guaranteed at end-March 2017) and regular, albeit becoming more limited, equity injections (equity financed around 40% of assets at end-March 2017). The bank was previously fully funded by the government but has since diversified its funding. DBN has good access to capital markets and is entirely wholesale-funded, including loans and facilities from domestic banks, international development banks as well as domestic debt issuance. In our view, the burden of supporting DBN would be moderate for Namibia given the bank's fairly small size relative to both GDP (DBN's assets/GDP of around 5%) and sovereign external reserves. DBN can only be dissolved by parliament and therefore its creditors are unable to put the bank into bankruptcy without it being passed by parliament. We believe that state support for the bank, if required, would be made available before the bank is liquidated under normal bankruptcy proceedings applicable to companies under local commercial laws. DBN's National Ratings reflect Fitch's opinion of the bank's creditworthiness relative to the Namibian sovereign and universe of issuers and issues within the country and South Africa. Namibian issuers are rated on the South African National Rating scale. VIABILITY RATING As is usual for development banks, Fitch does not assign a Viability Rating (VR) to DBN. This is because its business model depends on state support and, in our view, would not be viable on a commercial basis. This is reflected by DBN's dedicated policy role and non-competitive status. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SR, SRF and NATIONAL RATINGS DBN's IDRs, National Ratings and SRF are directly linked to that of Namibia. Consequently, any rating action relating to the sovereign is likely to affect the bank's IDRs, National Ratings and SRF. A downgrade of Namibia's sovereign rating would trigger a downgrade of DBN's SR, while only a multi-notch upgrade of Namibia's sovereign rating would result in an upgrade of DBN's SR. Other negative sensitivities for the bank's IDRs, National Ratings, SR and SRF include; -Change in DBN's clearly defined policy role and status and therefore diminished strategic importance; -A material reduction in the bank's government's ownership, oversight and control; -A material reduction in government funding guarantees; -Change in Fitch's assessment of DBN's creditworthiness relative to the sovereign or other Namibian and South African issuers, which would lead to a change in the National Ratings. The rating actions are as follows: Long-term Foreign Currency IDR assigned at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR assigned at 'F3' Long-Term Local Currency IDR assigned at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative Short-Term Local Currency IDR assigned at     'F3' Support Rating assigned at '2' Support Rating Floor assigned at 'BBB-' National Long-term Rating assigned at 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Negative National Short-term Rating assigned at 'F1+(zaf)' Contact: Primary Analyst Mahin Dissanayake Director +44 20 3530 1618 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Andrew Parkinson Director +44 20 3530 1420 Committee Chairperson James Longsdon Managing Director +44 20 3530 1076 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.P), is set to become the leading supplier to the fast growing automotive chip market following the deal, the largest-ever in the semiconductor industry. The European Commission listed a raft of concerns about the combined company's ability and incentives to squeeze out rivals and jack up prices. It said the company may bundle its products, excluding rivals in baseband chipsets and near field communication (NFC) chips. The combined entity would also have the ability and the incentive to change NXP's intellectual property licensing practices, in particular the NFC technology, by tying this to Qualcomm's patent portfolio, the EU watchdog said. It also voiced concerns about reduced competition in semiconductors used in cars. The Commission will decide on the deal by Oct. 17.  Qualcomm said it was confident of allaying the EU's worries and that it still expects to close the deal by the end of the year. U.S. antitrust enforcers gave the green light for the deal in April without demanding concessions. Reuters reported on June 2 that Qualcomm may face a lengthy EU investigation after it declined to offer concessions to address the bloc's concerns in a preliminary review.

Macron said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatizations to help fund a 10 billion euro ($11.2 billion) government drive to boost industry and innovation. If he gets the parliamentary majority pollsters expect on June 18, he could go for a quick first deal that could raise funds for ailing French nuclear group Areva (AREVA.PA).  Shares in ADP, which runs Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports outside Paris, are trading near record highs, and the government's 50.6 percent stake, worth nearly 7 billion euros, could be put on the block by state investment group APE within weeks or months of the election, the sources said.  We think that APE have made plans so that ADP is on top of the stack for the government,  said one of the sources who has previously been involved in deals involving the French state. None of the sources could say for sure the government would sell ADP soon, nor whether all or part of the stake would be up for auction. But a second source said APE had  very likely organized things  for ADP to be the first privatization.  ADP, the finance ministry, the president's office and the APE all declined to comment. Despite its strong recent share price performance, ADP has an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 13 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), below an average of around 16 times for recent sector transactions.  The 2015 sell-off of Nice and Lyon airports, overseen by Macron himself as economy minister at the time, achieved multiples of 23 and 19 times respectively. European and Chinese investors are interested in ADP, a banking source said. However, French infrastructure group Vinci (SGEF.PA), which already holds 8 percent and has made airport operation a core business, is seen as the most serious candidate, sources and analysts said. Aside from the two Paris hubs, ADP manages or has stakes in 23 airports around the world, including in Belgium, Georgia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. It said on Friday it would increase its stake in Turkish airport operator TAV Airports (TAVHL.IS) to 46 percent for $160 million and expand with TAV in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Central Asia regions. Through public bank Caisse des Depots and holding companies Bpifrance and APE, the state has stakes in some 1,750 French companies with a combined value of nearly 100 billion euros, of which shares worth about 77.4 billion euros were listed on the stock exchange at the end of 2016.     Pro-Business, but Hands on Investment bankers expect the sale of the state's corporate holdings to be spread over time and that it may not be a smooth process under Macron, given his interventionist approach during previous negotiations over deals involving state.         These include the government's surprise move to increase its stake in carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) in 2015 and a stand-off between Macron and business tycoon Martin Bouygues during talks between Orange (ORAN.PA) and Bouygues (BOUY.PA) in 2016.    Macron will no doubt be more authoritarian, and will not hesitate to intervene in certain industrial situations,  a Paris-based investment banker said.      We will not have a wave of fierce liberalism. But we will certainly have a more business-friendly government than the previous one . Macron has gathered a team around him that has experience in managing state portfolios. Alexis Kohler, appointed secretary general of the Elysee palace, the most powerful role among presidential staff, spent a part of his career at APE.     In the government, Antoine Saintoyant, who also worked at APE, has been named economy, finance and industry adviser to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.      Yes, it will be a fairly business-friendly government, but I am not sure that discussions on the next deal involving a move of headquarters out of France would be easier than they have been in the past. On the contrary!  another banker said.

One justice on Brazil's seven-member Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) voted to annul the election victory of former president Dilma Rousseff and her then vice-president Temer. But four justices signaled they will vote to acquit them, which would keep Temer in office.  Even if acquitted, Temer is likely to soon face separate charges for corruption and obstruction of justice in a case involving allegations of hush money paid to a potential witness in a massive graft scandal. The Supreme Court also opened an investigation into the president late last month. Temer, a third of his Cabinet and dozens of powerful congressmen are under investigation for corruption, jeopardizing the prospects of the congressional passage of the government's economic austerity package.  The measures, aimed at chopping the gaping budget deficit, are seen as critical to shore up investor confidence in Brazil. Temer took office as president a year ago following the impeachment of Rousseff for breaking budget laws, which she and her supporters say was a soft coup orchestrated by Temer and his allies in an effort to thwart the corruption investigations. President of the Superior Electoral Court Gilmar Mendes attends a session where Brazil's electoral court will take up a 2014 case that could unseat President Michel Temer, in Brasilia, Brazil June 9, 2017.Adriano MachadoExcluded Testimony The TSE voted 4-3 on Thursday to not allow plea-bargain testimony from 77 executives at builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] to be used as evidence in the election case. That testimony includes accusations that the company funneled millions of illegal funding to the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket.    Slideshow (3 Images)The exclusion of that evidence strengthened Temer's line of argument, and analysts think that was a strong signal that the court will rule in his favor and maintain the 2014 election result. The head of the electoral court, Gilmar Mendes, said that each of the remaining justices would have about 20 minutes on Friday to lay out their reasoning for their votes in the trial, which is being broadcast live on television. If the court sticks to that plan, a final verdict is expected by the afternoon. The separate investigation by prosecutors of Temer includes a secret recording of a conversation with an executive of meatpacker JBS SA. In it, the president appears to condone paying bribes to an imprisoned former lawmaker to keep him from turning state's witness and providing potentially devastating testimony about graft. Temer has denied any wrongdoing. But a one-time top aide to the leader, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, was caught on a police video released last month picking up a bag with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash from a JBS executive.

The 10-episode  Planet of the Apps,  an unscripted show with similarities to ABC's  Shark Tank,  is part of an effort to add exclusive video programing to Apple's music streaming service to help attract new subscribers. The first episode will be available for streaming around the globe starting at 9 p.m. PDT on Tuesday (midnight EDT/0400 GMT).    Hollywood has been awaiting the entry of deep-pocketed Apple into original TV series, a field crowded with award-winning dramas and comedies from outlets such as Netflix and Time Warner Inc's HBO.    The first  Apps  episode will be free to anyone who wants to see it on iTunes and the show's website. Subsequent episodes will be released each Tuesday on Apple Music and available only to the streaming service's subscribers.     On the show, developers try to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The advisers help contestants build their products and prepare appeals for funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, the first investor in Snapchat.      The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,  Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview.  Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what's involved. This really shows how that's possible.     FILE PHOTO --  The audience assembles before the start of Apple's annual developer conference in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.Stephen Lam/File PhotoApple's future programing plans include an adaptation of comedian James Corden's  Carpool Karaoke  segment from his CBS show that will begin airing in August, as well as a documentary about Sean Combs in June and another about Clive Davis in a few months, Cue said.     Planet of the Apps  came from musician will.i.am, who with producer Ben Silverman had shopped the series to traditional TV players before approaching Apple. Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses.     I felt like this was a great way to show that app developers or business people are not just white dudes in suits, or white dudes coding,  Alba said.    In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept. Another developer feels overwhelmed by will.i.am's rapid-fire list of ideas.     At the show's end, viewers are told they can download the apps from Apple's App Store. The show itself will be promoted on the Apple.com home page, on iTunes and elsewhere.     All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another,  Cue said.

That is of course beyond the author's control, but also creates the nagging impression that life already has sped past this literary journey's destination. Readers of  Wild Ride: Inside Uber's Quest for World Domination  are in safe hands with Fortune magazine's executive editor at the wheel. Lashinsky's 228-page volume is as efficient and effective as most car journeys using Uber's app. The events – at least the ones that already had occurred – unfold at a mile a minute. And the basic backstory of the firm and Travis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive, are unlikely to change, even if richer and more-detailed accounts should someday emerge. Hard-fought access to the  cocksure  Kalanick, however, turns out to be more flash than substance. The first approach from Lashinsky in 2014, two years after he published a book on Apple, was not only denied, but threatened. Kalanick said he was a fan and flattered, but that it was the wrong time to tell his story.  I'm not sure if you're planning to write the book anyways,  he wrote in an email quoted by Lashinsky,  but I will make it clear to the folks I know not to cooperate and if you are still persistent, I will find another writer to write an authorized book with full access to us to compete with yours.  The intimidation tactics turn out to be among the more revealing comments from Kalanick. Later, Lashinsky embarks on a rather uneventful trip to China with the Uber boss and the two men take a stroll around San Francisco one evening. Kalanick mainly sees the conversations as an opportunity to build his own mythology, boasting about boyhood pancake-selling skills and rhapsodizing about the details of his company's headquarters. Kalanick's braggadocio and Uber's many self-inflicted wounds make it easy to forget what an achievement the company is. In that sense,  Wild Ride  helpfully chronicles the early ideas, the $4 million valuation and the fits and starts that ultimately led to astronomical growth and a $68 billion price tag – at least on paper – just six years later. The nitty gritty of Kalanick's first two ventures and his angel-investing-cum-mentoring  JamPad  provide some glimpses of what follows. Like all new ventures, Uber's arc from idea to elite limousine service to global juggernaut involves comedic missteps, too. A phone number posted on the website, for example, connects 3 a.m. calls from customers wondering where their cars are to an early employee's mobile phone. Uber's stumbles grow in scale and significance. Taxi drivers and customers are infuriated, respectively, by the company's legal oversteps and surge pricing. There are big problems with Uber's culture and, in particular, its approach to women. Data privacy issues erupt into scandal. Local authorities, both in the United States and abroad, fight back. The obsession with worldwide dominance, including in markets like China where cutthroat competition quickly springs up, becomes exceedingly costly. All along the way, Kalanick's ambitions are undercut by his aggressive approach to pretty much everything.  He seemed incapable, in public or private, of holding back, as if his outspokenness were a DNA-imprinted aspect of who he was, like the pigment in his eyes or the pitch of his voice,  Lashinsky writes.  His widely quoted whoppers sometimes had an intellectually defensible ring to them. Yet they suggested a shocking lack of empathy or, at the very least, an inability to know when to keep quiet.  None of this impeded Kalanick's salesmanship with investors, however. He has turned over virtually every stone in the financial world. Silicon Valley venture capitalists, mutual-fund managers, New York private-equity firms, Middle Eastern funds, Wall Street banks and billionaires like Jeff Bezos have forked over some $17 billion to Uber. Whether they all will receive a return now hangs in the balance. In just the last few months, the pressure on Uber has intensified. It has been forced to defend itself against charges of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property from Alphabet's Waymo in a case that could imperil all-important self-driving initiatives. Uber also could be facing a criminal probe over software it used to evade transportation regulators, according to Reuters.  The company's president and heads of finance, ride-sharing, maps, artificial-intelligence research, product and growth, autonomous vehicles and communications have departed. Multiple investigations, including into claims of discrimination and harassment, are ongoing, having already led to at least 20 employees being fired. Kalanick's mother also died tragically last month in a boating accident. Combined, these issues could be existential, especially for an enterprise burning so much cash. They also make one of Lashinsky's assessments sound downright quaint.  Like any company,  he writes,  Uber remains a work in progress.  The latest siege conditions, and whether the firm and Kalanick can withstand them, may make for an even better book.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Among the six teams vying for the oldest trophy in international sport in Bermuda this month, 26 crew members have competed in the Olympics, many winning medals in sailing and others in sports such as rowing and cycling. And although Britain's Ben Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor ever, counts for nearly 1 in five of the medals with his four and one silver, the other America's Cup Olympians have amassed another 22 between them, a Reuters survey shows. Some of the crews competing in Bermuda for the  Auld Mug  have a greater Olympic concentration than others and Groupama Team France, with only one on board, was eliminated in the Louis Vuitton America's Cup qualifiers. Of the other four teams hoping to challenge Oracle Team USA, Sweden's Artemis Racing has a total of eight Olympians in its sailing squad, while Emirates Team New Zealand has six and SoftBank Team Japan and Britain's Land Rover BAR, who were knocked out in their semi-final, four apiece. The America's Cup defender has three athletes who have competed in the Olympics, including tactician Tom Slingsby who won gold for Australia in the Laser dinghy in 2012. The British and Swedish crews each have a total of eight medals, the New Zealand Team seven, Japan two and the U.S. one. New Zealand's hotshot Peter Burling, the youngest helmsman in the event at 26, and British tactician Giles Scott, 29, both jumped straight back into the America's Cup boats after winning gold medals in Rio last year.

New Zealand rower Joe Sullivan won gold in the double sculls in 2012, while cyclist Simon Van Velthooven picked up bronze in the Keirin event the same year. The New Zealand team brought Van Velthooven on board as their secret weapon to power a revolutionary pedaling system, with  cyclors  replacing the winch grinders used by other crews.

Emirates Team New Zealand successfully harnessed the power of rower Rob Waddell, who won gold in the single sculls in Sydney in 2000, as a grinder. But the physical demands of racing the power-hungry 50-foot America's Cup Class foiling catamarans, which have a crew of six, requires a new mix of strength, speed and stamina. Iain Percy, who won two golds and a silver in successive Olympics, said communicating with his heart rate pumping near its maximum while  grinding  the winches is as tough as it gets. Oracle Team USA hired former open water Olympic swimmer and iron man Ky Hurst to fill one of its  grinder  positions, while Artemis Racing has Anders Gustafsson, who competed in four games in the canoe sprint.  The  grindfest , its very demanding for a 41-year-old ... it hurts,  Artemis Racing's team manager and tactician Percy Percy told Reuters in a recent interview.

The combination of a lack of economic momentum and the heightened uncertainty about how Prime Minister Theresa May can advance her plans for Brexit might prompt her new government to relax its grip on spending, some analysts said. Industrial output rose 0.2 percent on the month in April after falling for three months. It was much weaker than a forecast 0.8 percent, and over a three-month period it contracted for the first time since November, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. Manufacturing, which is part of overall industrial output, also saw output rise 0.2 percent in April, compared with a forecast of 0.9 percent in the Reuters poll. The construction sector was much weaker than expected too. After last year's shock decision by voters to pull Britain out of the European Union, Britain is now facing more political upheaval after May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority.  There is clearly a risk that today's election result causes growth to weaken towards the end of the second quarter,  Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said.  That said, this is unlikely to spell disaster since the economy has proved pretty resilient to political uncertainty in the recent past.  Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2017, making it the worst performer among the Group of Seven nations after outpacing its peers in 2016, despite the shock of the Brexit vote. As well as rising inflation and slow wage growth weighing on consumers, the economy now has to contend with heightened political uncertainty about Britain's ability to proceed with its plan to leave the European Union. Britain's economy grew by a below-par 0.2 percent in the three months to May, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: A worker uses a soldering iron at the Mec Com Ltd factory near Stafford, central England December 15, 2016.Phil Noble/File Photo The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung parliament into sharp relief,  NIESR director Jagjit Chadha said.  People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages.  Boe Back in Action? Investors are watching closely to see if May responds to the increase in support for the opposition Labour Party by relaxing her grip on public spending, something which would boost the economy. Chris Iggo, fixed income chief investment officer at AXA Investment Managers, said that if the government failed to boost the economy, the Bank of England might resort to reviving its massive bond-buying program again. The BoE said before the election that it expected some of the impact of slower consumer spending would be eased by stronger exports driven by the pound's fall since the Brexit vote last year. ONS data showed on Friday that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed by more than expected to 10.4 billion pounds ($13.2 billion) in April.  But the smaller deficit was due to a sharp fall in goods imports with volumes in monthly terms down more than 5 percent in April, almost reversing a surge in March. Exports edged down. Over the three months to April, goods exports rose 2.1 percent while imports were flat. But the ONS said there was no sign yet that exporters were taking advantage of sterling's weakness to cut their foreign-currency prices and strengthen their competitive advantage.  Britain won't enjoy a trade boost until exporters reduce margins and seek greater market share instead,  Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. The ONS said construction output in April fell by 1.6 percent from March and was down 0.6 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent on the month but a fall of 0.4 percent compared with April last year.

Bharti had filed its complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) saying Jio, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, had engaged in  predatory pricing  after entering the market with temporary offers of free voice and data, with certain caps. CCI said Jio's offers did not amount to anti-competitive behaviour given the telecom provider was a new entrant and hence did not have a dominant position in India, nor was it preventing others from offering similar services.  Free services cannot by itself raise competition concerns unless the same is offered by a dominant enterprise and shown to be tainted with an anti-competitive objective of excluding competition/competitors,  CCI said in an order published on its website. Bharti Airtel declined to comment on the CCI order. Jio's entry has pushed rivals such as Bharti, the India unit of Vodafone Group Plc and Idea Cellular to lower prices, resulting in a decline in their profits. Jio, which had signed up 72 million paying customers under its Prime plan by the end of March, has cut down on free services since April as it shifts towards securing more profits.

Macron said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatizations to help fund a 10 billion euro ($11.2 billion) government drive to boost industry and innovation. If he gets the parliamentary majority pollsters expect on June 18, he could go for a quick first deal that could raise funds for ailing French nuclear group Areva (AREVA.PA).  Shares in ADP, which runs Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports outside Paris, are trading near record highs, and the government's 50.6 percent stake, worth nearly 7 billion euros, could be put on the block by state investment group APE within weeks or months of the election, the sources said.  We think that APE have made plans so that ADP is on top of the stack for the government,  said one of the sources who has previously been involved in deals involving the French state. None of the sources could say for sure the government would sell ADP soon, nor whether all or part of the stake would be up for auction. But a second source said APE had  very likely organized things  for ADP to be the first privatization.  ADP, the finance ministry, the president's office and the APE all declined to comment. Despite its strong recent share price performance, ADP has an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 13 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), below an average of around 16 times for recent sector transactions.  The 2015 sell-off of Nice and Lyon airports, overseen by Macron himself as economy minister at the time, achieved multiples of 23 and 19 times respectively. European and Chinese investors are interested in ADP, a banking source said. However, French infrastructure group Vinci (SGEF.PA), which already holds 8 percent and has made airport operation a core business, is seen as the most serious candidate, sources and analysts said. Aside from the two Paris hubs, ADP manages or has stakes in 23 airports around the world, including in Belgium, Georgia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. It said on Friday it would increase its stake in Turkish airport operator TAV Airports (TAVHL.IS) to 46 percent for $160 million and expand with TAV in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Central Asia regions. Through public bank Caisse des Depots and holding companies Bpifrance and APE, the state has stakes in some 1,750 French companies with a combined value of nearly 100 billion euros, of which shares worth about 77.4 billion euros were listed on the stock exchange at the end of 2016.     Pro-Business, but Hands on Investment bankers expect the sale of the state's corporate holdings to be spread over time and that it may not be a smooth process under Macron, given his interventionist approach during previous negotiations over deals involving state.         These include the government's surprise move to increase its stake in carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) in 2015 and a stand-off between Macron and business tycoon Martin Bouygues during talks between Orange (ORAN.PA) and Bouygues (BOUY.PA) in 2016.    Macron will no doubt be more authoritarian, and will not hesitate to intervene in certain industrial situations,  a Paris-based investment banker said.      We will not have a wave of fierce liberalism. But we will certainly have a more business-friendly government than the previous one . Macron has gathered a team around him that has experience in managing state portfolios. Alexis Kohler, appointed secretary general of the Elysee palace, the most powerful role among presidential staff, spent a part of his career at APE.     In the government, Antoine Saintoyant, who also worked at APE, has been named economy, finance and industry adviser to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.      Yes, it will be a fairly business-friendly government, but I am not sure that discussions on the next deal involving a move of headquarters out of France would be easier than they have been in the past. On the contrary!  another banker said.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. Automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.  In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,  the state attorneys wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island. The EPA did not immediately comment. The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. Trump told an audience of cheering union workers in March he would  ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories... The assault on the American auto industry is over.  The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration finalized the rules just before leaving office in January. Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-autos-idUSL1N1J611E"},

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday introduced the HomePod, a voice-controlled speaker that can make music suggestions and adjust home temperatures, taking aim at Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Alexa feature and Echo devices. The move is the first into a completely new area by Apple for more than two years as the world's most valuable technology company looks to make up for a dip in iPhone sales and new ways to get customers to use more of its money-making apps and services. Apple's Siri assistant will be integrated into the $349 speaker, and can make music recommendations that pair with the company's Apple Music service, send text messages, check news and sports scores and control compatible home gadgets like lightbulbs and thermostats. HomePod users may initially be constrained by Siri's lack of capabilities as compared to Alexa, which also boasts the ability to order millions of Amazon products as well as food from restaurants like Domino's.  Apple is expected to announce plans this week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, but initial changes were expected to add just a small number of capabilities. The HomePod speaker stands just under seven inches (18 cm) tall and is covered in fabric mesh that will come in white or gray. A computer processor will tune sound to the room and beam specific parts of music, like a singer's voice, toward the listener.  Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December.  The speaker, while expected by some industry watchers, marked Apple's first new product announcement since the Apple Watch in September 2014. As a music-playing device, it will also be a challenger to Sonos, whose wifi-controlled speakers are used by many smartphone users for home entertainment.

The technology, a feature of the wildly successfully smartphone game Pokemon Go, overlays digital information on real-world images and is seen as an area in which the keenly awaited 10th-anniversary iPhone can stand out from competitors.  New indoor maps of areas like malls and airports indicated that Apple might be laying groundwork to display information over images of those places in the future. The company also rolled out tools for developers to create augmented reality applications for iPhones and iPads. To show the tools off, Apple invited Wingnut AR, the company formed by  Lord of the Rings  director Peter Jackson, on stage.

The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F1' and the Short- Term senior unsecured debt rating at 'F1'. The ratings reflect Unibail's geographically diverse portfolio of prime shopping centres that generate robust rental income. Unibail's operating performance remains solid, reflecting occupancy rates of about 97%, strong rent renewal increases and high tenant retention, mitigating comparatively short average lease maturities. The group also benefits from strong liquidity and wide access to capital markets. We expect Unibail's published loan-to-value (LTV), currently at 33%, to remain well below 40% in 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Property Diversification: Unibail's properties span 11 countries across Europe and encompass retail (82% of rent), office (10%) and exhibition centres (7%), providing strong geographic diversification. The company has exposure to both mature markets, such as France and Holland, and strongly emerging retail consumer markets, such as Poland. Strong Fundamentals: The like-for-like rental growth of Unibail's shopping centre portfolio remained high at 3.4% in 2016, supported by prime assets, high tenant quality and occupancy rates exceeding 97%. While 2016 sales of Unibail tenants fell below national indices - mainly owing to terror attacks in Paris and weather affecting fashion sales - Unibail's tenants have historically outperformed the indices (2015 was 240bp higher). Dominant Centres Outperform: Large shopping centres, with more than six million visitors (97% of the retail portfolio) continue to outperform smaller assets, posting a EUR1.6 billion revaluation gain. Smaller asset valuations remained flat in 2016. Large assets outperformed, both in terms of yield impact (valuation impact of +3.8% for large assets, 1.3% for smaller assets) and rent assumptions (impact of +2.6% compared to -0.9%). Fitch expects e-commerce growth to widen the gap between the two. LTV Lower through Revaluation: Over the last three years, Unibail's revaluation gains on its property portfolio exceeded EUR4 billion, mainly driven by yield compression, which helped the company reduce its published LTV. Nonetheless, Unibail compares favourably with some REITs, as the revaluation gains linked to rent impact nearly equals the impact from yield compression over the current cycle. Lower Cost, Longer-term Debt: In-line with previous years, Unibail has lengthened the average debt maturity from 4.3 years in 2010 to 7.0 years in 2016 and reduced the average cost of debt from 3.9% in 2010 to 1.6% in 2016. Most notably, the company issued several long-dated bonds in 2016 and 2017 (up to 20 years) and is further diversifying its funding sources through three private placements (EUR, SEK and HKD) while also accessing the US commercial paper market. High Cash Flow Leverage: Unibail's low interest costs and its improving published LTV (down to 33% in 2016) are offset by high cash flow leverage at this rating level (net debt to EBITDA above 9x in 2016). Fitch positively notes some modest improvement, both in terms of LTV and net debt to EBITDA. DERIVATION SUMMARY Unibail is the highest rated property company within the Fitch EMEA universe. Unibail benefits from superior scale (EUR30 billion plus), strong quality of assets and a high degree of diversification. The company also has access to a wider range of financing instruments than peers. While leverage is in the higher part of the range for the current rating, Unibail better managed its balance sheet through the last cycle than most EMEA peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Moderate indexation and increase in rent at renewals, with flat occupancy ratio for shopping centres. - Pay-out ratio in-line with the group policy and within a range of 85-95% of net recurring result. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A very significant decrease in leverage, assuming the current operating profile. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Significant rise in tenant defaults and lease arrears, leading to a material fall in total rents. - LTV adjusted for minorities above 40% on a sustained basis and a deviation from managing this ratio conservatively through-the-cycle. - EBITDA NIC below 2.5x on a sustained basis. LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity: The company currently has EUR5,995 million of undrawn committed lines and EUR400 million of cash on balance sheet. This more than covers EUR3.1 billion debt maturing over the next 24 months at year-end 2016, including EUR1.2 billion of commercial paper. It also covers the EUR0.9 billion committed capex. The company also recently raised EUR1 billion of bonds in May 2017 (proceeds will mostly be used for refinancing).

Among the six teams vying for the oldest trophy in international sport in Bermuda this month, 26 crew members have competed in the Olympics, many winning medals in sailing and others in sports such as rowing and cycling. And although Britain's Ben Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor ever, counts for nearly 1 in five of the medals with his four and one silver, the other America's Cup Olympians have amassed another 22 between them, a Reuters survey shows. Some of the crews competing in Bermuda for the  Auld Mug  have a greater Olympic concentration than others and Groupama Team France, with only one on board, was eliminated in the Louis Vuitton America's Cup qualifiers. Of the other four teams hoping to challenge Oracle Team USA, Sweden's Artemis Racing has a total of eight Olympians in its sailing squad, while Emirates Team New Zealand has six and SoftBank Team Japan and Britain's Land Rover BAR, who were knocked out in their semi-final, four apiece. The America's Cup defender has three athletes who have competed in the Olympics, including tactician Tom Slingsby who won gold for Australia in the Laser dinghy in 2012. The British and Swedish crews each have a total of eight medals, the New Zealand Team seven, Japan two and the U.S. one. New Zealand's hotshot Peter Burling, the youngest helmsman in the event at 26, and British tactician Giles Scott, 29, both jumped straight back into the America's Cup boats after winning gold medals in Rio last year.

New Zealand rower Joe Sullivan won gold in the double sculls in 2012, while cyclist Simon Van Velthooven picked up bronze in the Keirin event the same year. The New Zealand team brought Van Velthooven on board as their secret weapon to power a revolutionary pedaling system, with  cyclors  replacing the winch grinders used by other crews.

Emirates Team New Zealand successfully harnessed the power of rower Rob Waddell, who won gold in the single sculls in Sydney in 2000, as a grinder. But the physical demands of racing the power-hungry 50-foot America's Cup Class foiling catamarans, which have a crew of six, requires a new mix of strength, speed and stamina. Iain Percy, who won two golds and a silver in successive Olympics, said communicating with his heart rate pumping near its maximum while  grinding  the winches is as tough as it gets. Oracle Team USA hired former open water Olympic swimmer and iron man Ky Hurst to fill one of its  grinder  positions, while Artemis Racing has Anders Gustafsson, who competed in four games in the canoe sprint.

Prices have fallen more than 10 percent to below $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed on May 25 to prolong a deal to cut about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March. The deal was initially due to run during the first half of 2017. Even a political dispute between Gulf states, the source for most of OPEC's crude, has failed to drive prices higher. Instead, eyes are trained on Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC states that were excluded from the regime of cuts to help them recover from years of unrest that had hurt production. Both now report rising output. This is adding to concerns among some in OPEC about the effectiveness of the accord to reduce output, whose impact is already being eroded by surging U.S. shale production. One OPEC delegate told Reuters that a deal to curb production  without freezing Libya and Nigeria is useless.  Nigeria's exports are expected to reach a 15-month high in June of about 1.75 million bpd. Libyan output has hit its highest since October 2014, rising above 800,000 bpd. At the May meeting, OPEC discussed whether to assign output caps to Nigeria and Libya but agreed not to. The group also considered a larger production cut, an idea that it could revive in future, delegates have told Reuters. A second OPEC delegate also said on Friday that it was not clear that the level of existing cuts was enough.  It's difficult to say. We hope so,  the delegate said.  We need to wait another month to see how it develops. There are a lot of factors involved.  A third delegate said oil-market fundamentals were improving, indicating the current drop in prices was not driven by supply and demand but rather by speculators. However, two other delegates said the oil price drop was temporary and the current supply cut pact was enough.  It is not a cause for alarm - it is normal,  one of them said of the price fall, adding that he believed the market would still rebalance in the second half of the year. Oil prices have recovered from below $30 a barrel in 2016, helped by the pact. But with the price hovering below $50 now, it is half its level of mid-2014 and less than the $60 top exporter Saudi Arabia has said it would like to see.

The siren  rang all of a sudden while we were picking grass, so that scared me,  said Taison Ito, a 10-year-old fifth grader.  It's something close to our daily lives,  said parent Kanako Ono, adding that news about North Korea and missile tests is always in newspapers and on TV. Sunday's evacuation drill in this town of 3,500 people some 760 km (475 miles) west of Tokyo involved a simulated North Korean missile attack as more Japanese towns and cities take steps to brace for what they hope will never happen. North Korea has been increasing the number of its missile test launches in recent months, launching 12 so far this year and three last month, with many splashing into the Sea of Japan, some inside Japan's exclusive economic zone, which extends up to 200 miles from its shores. Tokyo has repeatedly condemned the test launches, which are in violation of U.N. resolutions. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government earlier this year instructed municipalities to hold evacuation drills, heightening a sense of urgency among the public.

Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERSSecurity experts say the drills won't necessarily protect everyone from ballistic missiles, but going through the evacuation procedure in a simulated situation will help people survive in an actual attack.  It's hard to say how many people will be saved and how much effect it will have. But, with awareness raised and basic procedure understood, the survival rate will definitely be higher,  retired Vice Admiral Yoji Koda said.

It is estimated that it would take about 10 minutes for a North Korean missile to reach Japan, but it would take a few minutes for the government to alert local authorities and the public about the launch. At Abu, school officials told the children they were able to evacuate into the gymnasium in around three minutes.  It was a good way to understand how to evacuate,  said parent Ono.

Lying on the Gulf of Oman along the approaches to the Straits of Hormuz, the port of Chabahar is central to India's hopes to crack open a transport corridor to Central Asia and Afghanistan that bypasses arch-rival Pakistan.  Graphic on Silk Road: bit.ly/2rdsFDt India committed $500 million to speed development of the port after sanctions on Iran were lifted following a deal struck between major powers and Tehran to curb its nuclear program in 2015.  But the state-owned Indian firm that is developing Chabahar is yet to award a single tender for supplying equipment such as cranes and forklifts, according to two government sources tracking India's biggest overseas infrastructure push.  U.S. President Donald Trump denounced the nuclear agreement on the campaign trail, and since taking office in January has accused Iran of being a threat to countries across the Middle East.  Swiss engineering group Liebherr and Finland's Konecranes (KCRA.HE) and Cargotec (CGCBV.HE) have told India Ports Global Pvt Ltd, which is developing the deep water port, they were unable to take part in the bids as their banks were not ready to facilitate transactions involving Iran due to the uncertainty over U.S. policy, the two officials said in separate conversations with Reuters.  These firms dominate the market for customized equipment to develop jetties and container terminals. One official said the first tender was floated in September, but attracted few bidders because of the fear of renewed sanctions. That fear has intensified since January.   Now the situation is that we are running after suppliers,  one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of matter.  A Konecranes spokeswoman declined to comment beyond confirming the company was not involved in the project.  Cargotec and Liebherr did not respond to requests for comment.  Some tenders have been floated three times since September because they failed to attract bidders. A Chinese firm, ZPMC, has since come forward to supply some equipment, the same Indian official said.  Threat of Sanctions  Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major world powers restricting Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting of sanctions  the worst deal ever negotiated .

Uncertainty over U.S. policy is already causing long delays in contracts that Iran has sought with international firms to develop its oil fields and buy planes for its aging airlines.  The lifting of United Nations and European Union sanctions in 2016 partly reconnected Iran with the international financial system crucial to trade.  But large international bankers with exposure to the United States remain unwilling to facilitate Iranian deals for fear of running afoul of narrower, unilateral U.S. sanctions that remain outside the nuclear deal and uncertainty over whether wider sanctions relief will continue.  FILE PHOTO: A general view of an oil dock is seen from a ship at the port of Kalantari in the city of Chabahar, 300 km (186 miles) east of the Strait of Hormuz, Iran January 17, 2012.Raheb Homavandi/File PhotoIndia's ambassador to Iran said the process of procuring equipment for the Chabahar port was under way and that some of the customized cranes needed up to 20 months to build. The banking situation was slowing improving, he added.   Tenders are re-floated for a variety of reasons including technical specifications not being met, etc. Banking channels, in recent months, have in fact somewhat eased,  Saurabh Kumar said in an emailed response to Reuters from Tehran.  If some companies do not participate, it really is their business.   India has been pushing for the development of Chabahar port for more than a decade as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan. Access to those countries is currently complicated by India's fraught relationship with Pakistan.  Bureaucratic delays, difficult negotiations with Iran and the risk of incurring Washington's displeasure during the financial embargo in Tehran had meant there was little progress on the port until now.  But, prodded in part by China's development of Gwadar port, which lies barely 100 km (60 miles) from Chabahar on the Pakistani coast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has unveiled massive investment plans centered around the Iranian port, offering to help build railways, roads and fertilizer plants that could eventually amount to $15 billion.  So far, even an initial credit line of $150 million that India wants to extend to Iran for development of Chabahar has remained a non-starter as Tehran has not been able to do its part of work.   They have not sought the loan from us because they haven't awarded the tenders, either because of lack of participation or banking problems,  said the second government official.  Ambassador Kumar said the Iran had indicated it would be sending proposals shortly to tap the credit line.  Meena Singh Roy, who heads the West Asia center at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a New Delhi think-tank, said increasing tension between Washington and Tehran would have an impact on the port project.

The status referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967, is unlikely to change the island's label as a U.S. territory, a move that would require an act of the U.S. Congress. But the vote is culturally important and timely for an island whose hazy political status has contributed to an economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Sunday's plebiscite will offer voters three options for Puerto Rico: to become a U.S. state; to remain a territory; or to become an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the U.S. Congressional apathy  doesn't mean the vote's not worth doing, because this kind of vote is the only way out of a colonial situation,  said Columbia Law School Professor Christina Duffy Ponsa, an expert on Puerto Rico territory issues who supports statehood.  Hamstrung by $70 billion in debt and a 45-percent poverty rate, Puerto Rico is battling woefully underperforming schools, and near-insolvent pension and health systems. Its 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote for U.S. presidents or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like Medicaid. Best Hope Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned on holding a referendum and believes U.S. statehood is the island's best hope. His PNP party, which controls Puerto Rico's government, is premised on a pro-statehood stance. The opposition PPD supports versions of the current territory status. Ramon Rosario Cortes, a Rossello spokesman, told Reuters the governor will push Congress to respect the result,  and we expect they will respect the will of 3.5 million American citizens.  But Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington and  Congress won't do anything,  said U.S. Rep.

It's not that we're ignoring the plebiscite; we're ignoring the plight of Puerto Ricans,  he said. Support for independence is more prevalent among the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States than in Puerto Rico itself, where that option historically earns just a few percentage points in referenda. Rossello had hoped to fund Sunday's vote with federal dollars in order to make it harder for Congress to ignore the result. Congress authorized $2.5 million for a Puerto Rico status referendum in 2014, but required the Justice Department to approve the ballot's language in order to release the funds.

The last referendum, in 2012, used a two-step structure, first asking voters whether they wanted Puerto Rico to remain in its current status, then asking them to pick a preference among non-territory alternatives.

Across the euro zone, safe-haven bond yields were pinned near multi-month lows after Thursday's snap election in Britain left the ruling Conservative party without a majority in parliament just as talks to exit the European Union loom. In contrast, the prospect of early elections and political uncertainty in Italy - the euro zone's third biggest economy - appear to have ebbed this week, boosting sentiment towards Italian assets. The head of the country's ruling Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, said he was pessimistic over the chances of reaching a new cross-party pact on a reform of the electoral law. That came a day after a deal between Italy's top four parties unravelled in parliament. President Sergio Mattarella, the only figure with the power to dissolve parliament, has demanded new voting rules be drawn up because at present there is too much divergence between the systems for electing members in the upper and lower chambers.  There has been a lot of pressure on Italian bonds over the last few weeks because the idea of going to elections this year was not welcome for investors,  said UniCredit strategist Luca Cazzulani in Milan.  Because this is now being put under question, the move is retracing.  Italy's 10-year government bond yield tumbled over 8 basis points (bps) to a three-month low of 2.085 percent , adding to a 12 bps fall on Thursday. That meant yields fell almost 17 bps in the week, 20 bps on Thursday and Friday - the biggest two-day slide since October 2015. The gap between Italian and German bonds yields, a gauge of how investors view relative risks, narrowed to around 183 bps. That's down from more than 200 bps earlier this week. Signs this week of progress in addressing weakness in Italian banks and comfort that the European Central Bank shunned talk of unwinding its stimulus scheme at a policy meeting on Thursday also lifted sentiment towards Italian assets.  We've had some good news on the banking sector this week, a shrinking likelihood of snap elections and a positive ECB meeting, so all of this is helping BTPs,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government backed by a small Northern Irish party after her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a vote on Thursday just days before the EU departure talks begin. After an initial plunge, sterling pared losses against the dollar and euro, while the dollar gained. Safe-haven gold and prices of U.S. Treasuries drifted lower. The pound shed more than 2 percent against the dollar, dropping as low as $1.2636 before trimming losses. The impact of the British election on the U.S. markets was limited.  Markets are celebrating gridlock again, which is a reversal of what we saw after the U.S. election,  said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Ablin said over the past 12 months, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have pumped almost $2 trillion into capital markets, which has driven asset prices higher.  If there's one metric that I'm going track, to determine whether or not I want to stay engaged in risk-taking, it's going to be that liquidity. If I get a sense the Fed or other central banks will start to close up shop on that, we're going to reduce risk,  Ablin said. Equity market rallied, with European shares closing higher after early signs of skittishness. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 1 percent, and the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares rose 0.36 percent to 1,534.20. MSCI's all-country stock world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.27 percent. Stocks on Wall Street set new intra-day highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.34 points, or 0.46 percent, to 21,280.87. The S&P; 500 gained 10.14 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,443.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.30 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,325.06. The dollar rose to a 10-day high against a basket of currencies. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.42 percent at 97.322. The euro was down 0.24 percent to $1.1185 against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank closed the door on more interest rate cuts. Oil prices steadied after falling sharply earlier in the week on pressure from widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts to curb supply led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Brent crude oil rose 47 cents to $48.33 a barrel, U.S. crude gained 40 cents to $46.04. U.S. Treasury long-dated yields rose to one-week highs as investors consolidated positions ahead of next week's government debt auctions and a widely expected interest rate increase by the Fed. U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last down 7/32 in price to yield 2.2198 percent.

The chairman of the Czech Football Association (FACR), Miroslav Pelta, resigned earlier this week after police charged him with abuse of power, breaching fiduciary duties and favoritism in public tenders. The official denied any wrongdoing. The Gambrinus brewery, controlled by Asahi Group Holdings, has sponsored Czech football on all levels since 1997. The top league bore its name until 2014.  The cases around top football and the long-term unwillingness of the FACR leadership to take substantial steps to improve its reputation are damaging us, too,  Gambrinus's marketing manager, Marek Dvorak, said on the brewery's website.  We will continue to support football on lower levels, where we feel there is true joy of the game and fair play,  Dvorak said. The football association has struggled with corruption and match-fixing allegations in the past. Several managers and players have faced sentences for criminal convictions, but never a sitting chairman.

At the U.S. Transportation Department, Trump said his goal is to solve  one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately-needed infrastructure – and that is the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build.  Trump said the White House is setting up a new council to help project managers navigate bureaucratic hurdles.  This Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process,  Trump said. He said the council will make sure that any federal agency that  consistently delays projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties. We will hold the bureaucracy accountable.  The White House is also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality  to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal, state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way.  Trump said it took  four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam – but today it can take 10 years just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project.  The Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting.  It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes,  Trump said.  How can a country prosper under such restraints?  Trump asked.  Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? I was not elected to continue a failed system – I was elected to change it.  The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer has said the budget cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several Cabinet departments, however, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending.

Here are a selection of the quirky moments that captured the attention of the British public. Who Are the Dup? Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party emerged as unlikely kingmakers from Thursday's election after British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives entered talks with them about forming a government after failing to win a majority. The announcement created a surge of interest in the DUP, the most searched topic on Google UK on Friday morning. The increased traffic led to the DUP website crashing. The Curse of the Oscars Struck After reading out the list of votes for each candidate, the returning officer in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, then announced Labour’s Alan Meale the winner. She promptly corrected herself, announcing that Conservative Ben Bradley had in fact triumphed amid barracking shouts from the crowd. The moment recalled the mix-up that saw the wrong Best Picture award-winner announced at this year’s Oscars ceremony. Lord Buckethead British politics is no stranger to eccentric characters and Thursday’s election was no exception.  A man known only as Lord Buckethead, dressed in a homemade Darth Vader-style costume capped with a large bucket, ran against Prime Minister Theresa May in her Maidenhead constituency with fellow costume wearers Howling 'Laud' Hope and Bobby 'Elmo' Smith.  Buckethead appeared on stage with May as results were announced and he celebrated his 294-vote tally. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's Labour Party tries to exchange a high five with Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry at Britain's general election counting centre in Islington, London, June 9, 2017.Darren StaplesMay was not the only leader to share the stage with unconventional rival. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron edged Conservative and Labour opponents as well as one Mr Fishfinger for the northwest English seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale.  Thin Majorities With the competition for some seats fierce, some candidates made it to parliament by the thinnest of margins. The Scottish National Party’s Stephen Gethins won the Fife North East seat by a mere two votes, while his colleague Pete Wishart defeated Conservative Ian Duncan in the Perth & North Perthshire race by only 21 votes. Further south, Conservative Zac Goldsmith ousted Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney with a 45-vote majority, in a race that saw more than 60,000 votes cast. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May waits for the result of the vote in her constituency at the count centre for the general election in Maidenhead, June 9, 2017.Toby MelvilleCorbyn’S High-Five Misfire Despite a better-than-expected performance for his party at the polls, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did have one embarrassing moment on election night. A failed attempt at a high-five resulted in Corbyn slapping colleague Emily Thornberry in the chest, an image that was widely shared on social media. Twitter Fail As news the result spread, Twitter were quick to react to May's Conservative Party losing its parliamentary majority, with a Tweets-per-minute spike of 12,633 greeting the exit poll just after 10 pm.  May's most retweeted message of the campaign was a post from May 20 (@theresa_may) in which the prime minister warned:  If I lose just six seats I will lose this election and Jeremy Corbyn will be sitting down to negotiate with Europe .

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.46 percent at 97.364. The index had fallen to a seven-month low midweek on caution ahead of U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey and the British election. But on Friday, it added to gains from the previous session. Comey on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation of possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia, but did not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. The euro was down 0.24 percent to $1.1185 against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank closed the door on more interest rate cuts.  The overall sentiment is that regardless of what is going on elsewhere, the U.S. is a safe haven for investors and traders,  said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.  That's why you are seeing the (U.S.) stock market up and the dollar stronger,  he said. Traders will turn their attention to next week's U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver this year's second rate hike.  We had weak jobs data last week, but I think they are really on path to hike rates,  Trang said.  Everyone will be looking at the verbiage, in particular with the Fed's balance sheet and some of the outlook.  Britain's pound tumbled after an election that denied any party a majority in Parliament and fomented a sense of political chaos just days before Brexit talks begin. The result - flagged by some analysts as the worst possible election outcome due to uncertainty - caused the pound to fall as much as 2.5 percent to $1.2635 in early European trade, its lowest level since May called the election on April 18. It recovered a little to trade down 1.68 percent to $1.2733. The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart, recovering from an earlier 1-week low as strong domestic jobs data supported the view that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates earlier than previously thought.

The status referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967, is unlikely to change the island's label as a U.S. territory, a move that would require an act of the U.S. Congress. But the vote is culturally important and timely for an island whose hazy political status has contributed to an economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Sunday's plebiscite will offer voters three options for Puerto Rico: to become a U.S. state; to remain a territory; or to become an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the U.S. Congressional apathy  doesn't mean the vote's not worth doing, because this kind of vote is the only way out of a colonial situation,  said Columbia Law School Professor Christina Duffy Ponsa, an expert on Puerto Rico territory issues who supports statehood.  Hamstrung by $70 billion in debt and a 45-percent poverty rate, Puerto Rico is battling woefully underperforming schools, and near-insolvent pension and health systems. Its 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote for U.S. presidents or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like Medicaid. Best Hope Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned on holding a referendum and believes U.S. statehood is the island's best hope. His PNP party, which controls Puerto Rico's government, is premised on a pro-statehood stance. The opposition PPD supports versions of the current territory status. Ramon Rosario Cortes, a Rossello spokesman, told Reuters the governor will push Congress to respect the result,  and we expect they will respect the will of 3.5 million American citizens.  But Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington and  Congress won't do anything,  said U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat of Puerto Rican descent, who supports making the island an independent nation.  It's not that we're ignoring the plebiscite; we're ignoring the plight of Puerto Ricans,  he said. Support for independence is more prevalent among the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States than in Puerto Rico itself, where that option historically earns just a few percentage points in referenda. Rossello had hoped to fund Sunday's vote with federal dollars in order to make it harder for Congress to ignore the result. Congress authorized $2.5 million for a Puerto Rico status referendum in 2014, but required the Justice Department to approve the ballot's language in order to release the funds. In April, the department rejected initial ballot language that would have excluded the option to remain a territory, prompting Rossello to change it. But Justice  has not reviewed or approved the current  language, a department spokesman told Reuters.      The Commonwealth Conundrum    Since referenda are usually organized by pro-statehood groups who oppose the status quo, the question of how to treat the territory option is sticky. If organizers do not include a territory option on the ballot, as Rossello initially did not, they risk being seen as politically inequitable to roughly half the population that supports territory status. Yet including the option, which organizers believe is tantamount to colonialism, runs counter to their objective of changing the island's status. The last referendum, in 2012, used a two-step structure, first asking voters whether they wanted Puerto Rico to remain in its current status, then asking them to pick a preference among non-territory alternatives. While statehood won, PPD leaders instructed constituents to leave blank hundreds of thousands of ballots, calling the result into question.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), social conservatives who favor Northern Ireland's continued inclusion in the United Kingdom, have enough seats to keep May in power after her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority -- just 10 days before the formal divorce talks start. But a deal between the DUP and Conservative Party would  risk destabilizing the political balance in Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. The Conservative Party's 318 lawmakers and the 10 Westminster seats of the DUP would allow May's minority government to pass legislation more easily.  We will continue to work with our friends and allies in the Democratic Unionist Party in particular,  May said on Friday outside her official Downing Street residence in London.  Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.  Jeffrey Donaldson, a DUP member of parliament, said the election outcome created the  perfect territory  to secure concessions from the Conservatives. These would be likely to include increases in funding for Northern Ireland. The party said it would be willing to negotiate with May but declined to comment on reports a deal had already been reached. While the DUP are deeply euroskeptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-call hard Brexit -- a clean break from the EU's single market -- and talks will inevitably touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland, an important plank of its election manifesto.   We want to make sure that Brexit is properly introduced and we will be the effective and possibly sole voice in parliament from Northern Ireland on Brexit,  Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP member of parliament, told BBC television.   We'll be making sure we get the best deal for all of Northern Ireland.  Irish Border? The British province's largest party was among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for Brexit and wants Britain to leave the EU's customs union, but its manifesto focused heavily on maintaining the benefits of membership. It called for a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland,  ease of trade  with the rest of the EU and a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement with the bloc once Britain leaves in 2019.  Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster addresses journalists in Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 9, 2017.Liam McBurneyThe DUP also called for a safeguarding of the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom.  It's wrong to say we're not in favor of a soft Brexit,  DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC, saying he was against a deal that would restore a  hard border  that would cause significant barriers to movement between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We want a situation where the best deal is arranged for Northern Ireland.  But Dodds said the DUP would block any attempt to give Northern Ireland a  special status  within the EU to avoid a hard border, something Irish nationalist rivals Sinn Fein is seeking.   The DUP does support proponents of hard Brexit on the scrapping of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is seen among some unionists as being more favorable to Irish nationalists than British courts. Slideshow (5 Images)United Kingdom? A deal with the Conservatives would put one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe in government. The DUP has fought to maintain tight restrictions on abortion and opposes gay marriage.  The DUP also sees Thursday's election result as a victory for pro-British unionists in the struggle with Irish nationalists. Party leader Arlene Foster described the election as  a good night for the union.  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams described his nationalist party's rise from four to seven of Northern Ireland's seats as a  historic result for the party , but it has said it will maintain its policy of not taking seats in Britain's parliament. Unionists appeared to have been sidelined when Sinn Fein pulled out of Northern Ireland's devolved assembly in January and surged at resulting regional elections, depriving Foster of her position as First Minister in the power-sharing government created by a 1998 peace deal.  This is a dramatic and significant event for Ireland,  political commentator Noel Whelan said of the election result.  Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster are now the most significant figures in Brexit talks on the island of Ireland.   The shift also threatens to deepen a crisis in regional politics in the province of 1.8 million people.  The DUP and Sinn Fein were due to restart talks on Monday on the formation of a new assembly, but a DUP deal could raise questions about the British Conservative Northern Ireland Minister James Brokenshire as an honest broker.  A deal between May and the DUP could involve her accepting demands which make a deal on the formation of a new assembly impossible. The DUP has called for former Irish nationalist militants to be denied the status of victims and for increased status for former members of the British armed services.   If ...the DUP try to prop up a paper thin majority with a hard Brexit, there is no way I would think that Sinn Fein would even entertain the thought of setting up an executive with them,  said political commentator Alex Kane.

Trump,Kate McBride,Scott Puritz,Donald J. Trump,Kate McBride,Scott Puritz,USA,MILLER/RETIREMENTADVICE,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"Starting on June 9, all financial advisers providing guidance on retirement accounts must adhere to the new U.S. Department of Labor rule requiring that they act in your best interest rather than their own. The controversial rule survived a bruising seven-year battle against entrenched interests in the financial services industry, which were seeking to protect excess fees that cost retirement savers $17 billion a year - a full percentage point in annual returns, according to U.S. government estimates during the Obama administration. Most recently, the rule survived a 60-day delay by the new administration under President Donald Trump, which has considered repealing or revising it. The Trump administration may yet try to weaken or undo parts of the so-called fiduciary standard, and several important parts of the rule are due for completion in January. These include details on adviser exemptions and disclosures that must be made to consumers. For now, the rule has teeth. It permits consumers to sue advisers if they do not think they have met their fiduciary obligations. What will the rule mean for retirement savers, and how can you take advantage of its protections? The following are some key issues to consider: What Has Changed? The fiduciary rule imposes requirements on advisers who were previously not required to act in clients' best interest. If you are surprised to learn that all advisers were not already required to do this, you are not alone. A survey released in April by Financial Engines, which advises workplace savers, found that 53 percent of Americans mistakenly thought that all financial advisers already adhered to a best interest standard. Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) are already fiduciaries; now broker-dealers and insurance company representatives will have to act in your best interest whenever tax-advantaged retirement accounts are involved. Previously, they were governed by a far weaker  suitability  standard that allowed them to sell higher-cost products that might otherwise fit your investment goals. Do a Check-Up If you already work with an adviser, expect to receive a contract spelling out that the relationship is now governed by the new rule and specifying that advice will be in your best interest, costs will be no more than reasonable and that no misleading statements are permitted. The rule is limited to tax-advantaged retirement accounts - such as IRAs and 401(k) accounts - including rollovers from workplace plans to IRAs. But do not stop there. Insist that any adviser you work with accepts fiduciary responsibility. An easy way to separate wheat from chaff is by asking an adviser to sign the Committee's fiduciary oath, a legally enforceable contract that commits advisers to put your interests first. (To download the fiduciary oath, click: here) Scott Puritz, managing director of Rebalance IRA, a low-fee fiduciary advisory firm that manages retirement investments, recommends requiring any prospective adviser to provide a detailed accounting of all expenses applied to your retirement accounts, including adviser, fund, marketing and distribution and transaction costs. Also request a detailed accounting of any one-time expenses, such as front-end loads on mutual funds plus exit or surrender penalties. You also want full disclosure of any conflicts of interest that an adviser may have that could impact her advice to you. Be Informed Finally, ask for a copy of the firm's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form ADV Part 2, which requires brokers to disclose the types of services provided, fee schedules, disciplinary information and any conflicts of interest. It is also important to conduct a thorough background check on anyone you intend to hire, advises Kate McBride, former chair of The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, a group of industry practitioners and experts. Do a search of FINRA's Brokercheck database (brokercheck.finra.org/), and a Google search for news on the adviser’s firm.  Be on the lookout for firms that have paid big fines in the past five years for wrongdoing or over-charging,  McBride says.  If there are more than a handful of cases, think carefully about whether you want to use that firm.  The Pittsburgh-based Centre for Fiduciary Excellence maintains a database of roughly 200 vetted fiduciary advisory firms around the United States that have subjected themselves to extensive audits of their investment practices and client files. (To access the free database, click here: here)  People will spend more time looking for a contractor to fix their sinks than they do hiring an adviser,  McBride adds.  You have to do your homework.

Fragile states that are poor and depend heavily on agriculture are most at risk of violent uprisings since they struggle to cope with climate change, according to a study published this week in the Journal of Peace Research.   We've already started to see climate change as an issue that won't just put the coasts under water, but as something that could cause food riots in some parts of the world,  said study co-author Bear Braumoeller from The Ohio State University. The last time the world saw a severe food crisis was in 2007 and 2008, when extreme weather events hit major grain producing regions the year earlier, causing spikes in the demand and cost of food. The higher prices led to social and political unrest in Morocco, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Indonesia, according to a 2016 report by Global Footprint Network and United Nations Environment Programme. Drought is becoming more frequent and severe in places like eastern and southern Africa, and that – combined with the recent El Nino phenomenon – is taking a heavy toll on rural lives and economies. Last April, a rice farmer in the Philippines was killed during protests demanding government assistance after drought linked by some to El Nino hit hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland.  El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, is linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.  Moreover, the US-based Center for Climate and Security on Friday said factors like global water shortages, displacement or migration caused by climate change, and rising sea levels also posed serious threats to international security. Braumoeller said having a stable government was key to placating growing civil unrest and violence in the face of food shortages caused by climate change.   A capable government is even more important to keeping the peace than good weather,  he said in a statement.  Less vulnerable countries can better handle the problems that droughts or food price fluctuations create.  Braumoeller said fragile states needed to address instability and invest in sustainable,  greener  industries to increase their economic growth, in order to cope with food shortages due to climate change.  Development aid is important now and it is likely to be even more important in the future as we look for ways to increase climate resilience,  he said.

Stanford University and Georgetown University business schools are planning to offer  fintech  courses for business school students for the first time this fall. New York University is planning a new course for undergraduates after launching a fintech specialization in its business school last year. They join the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Columbia University's business school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management, which all launched similar programs in recent years.  The new courses are being driven by student demand, officials from those universities told Reuters in interviews.  A number of prominent startups have exploded onto the fintech scene in recent years, fostering interest in mobile payment apps like Venmo, digital loan platforms like SoFi and robotic wealth managers like Betterment.  Ten years ago everyone wanted to go into investment banking or in the trading side,  said Reena Aggarwal, Director of the Georgetown Center for Financial Markets and Policy.  Now the students are much more interested in innovation.  NYU's undergraduate course, for instance, attracted enrollments from twice as many students as expected. Cyclists traverse the main quad on Stanford University's campus in Stanford, California, U.S. on May 9, 2014.Beck Diefenbach/File PhotoBut the burgeoning industry is so diverse that academics said it is difficult to construct a syllabus for financial technology 101. There are no textbooks and few professors have fintech expertise.  For fintech, some people mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; some people mean the technology JPMorgan uses for trading,  said Angela Lee, Columbia Business School's chief innovation officer.  Everyone thinks it's sexy, and a lot of people use it colloquially without knowing what it is.  Instead of developing traditional syllabuses, universities have been teaching students how markets are disrupted by new technology, helping them develop business ideas or offering classes on narrower topics. For instance, MIT taught a course on blockchain, the technology that first emerged as a system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin. Stanford's course will focus on financial inclusion, or designing affordable products and services for disadvantaged customers, said Kenneth Singleton, a management professor who will teach the class. Universities have also invited financial technology executives to lecture.  There is no ready-made teaching material that you can put together,  Antoinette Schoar, a professor of finance at MIT Sloan, said in an interview.  You have to try your own curriculum or develop real life cases.   Those involved with the programs said learning about fintech can help students' careers, whether they join traditional Wall Street firms or launch their own companies. They said it has also helped attract high-quality students. One Wharton student, David Gogel, enrolled after developing an interest in fintech while working at American International Group Inc (AIG.N). He is now co-president of the FinTech Club, one of the largest professional organizations at the school, with 260 members.  Part of the reason I chose Wharton was because of its investment in fintech,  he said in an interview.

May said she would form a new government with help from her  friends  in the DUP after an election debacle in which she unexpectedly lost her majority, days before talks on Britain's departure from the European Union are due to begin. The DUP - which defends Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom and takes a conservative approach to social issues - indicated that no deal was done, even though May asked Britain's Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government.  The prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge,  DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters. A deal between the DUP and the Conservatives would risk destabilising the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland and could significantly complicate talks due to start next week to restore the province's power-sharing agreement.  It has made the possibility of successful talks more remote,  said Naomi Long, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance Party.  There is now no credibility for the Tory government to be an independent chair, putting the entire process in real danger of collapsing.  The shock result thrust the DUP into the role of kingmaker, with its 10 seats giving May a fragile but workable partnership. While votes were still being counted, one of its members of parliament, Jeffrey Donaldson, called it  perfect territory  for the party, eyeing up a  very, very strong negotiating position.  Donaldson suggested the DUP could support the government on a vote-by-vote basis, meaning a so-called  confidence and supply  arrangement was more likely than a formal coalition. Foster, who did not take any questions from journalists, gave little away about what the DUP would demand in return for its support or how, as a fellow pro-Brexit party, it may seek to shape May's plans to leave the EU. She said the union binding England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be at the forefront of their minds, describing it as the party's  guiding star . That was in stark contrast to Irish nationalists Sinn Fein which won seven of the remaining eight seats, although it does not take up its seats in Britain's national parliament. Sinn Fein described its best ever result in a national election as a further boost to the party's ultimate goal of the British province one day joining a united Ireland.

Wade,USA,ABORTION/DELAWARE (WRAPUP 1,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Delaware's governor has signed into law a bill ensuring abortion remains legal in the state, the first such move in the United States since President Donald Trump was elected on a pledge to overturn the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationally. Abortion rights advocates on Friday cheered the move by Governor John Carney Jr., who a day earlier approved the bill to codify at the state level provisions of Roe v. Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a woman's right to abortion.  We applaud Governor Carney for sending a strong message that state policymakers will protect women's access to critical reproductive health services in the face of threats at the federal level,  said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion.  This new law is important because it says to women that you are important, that you have the ability to decide when to have a child and the state supports you in making the decision that is best for you and your family,  said Elizabeth Nash, an analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy. Abortion opponents had lobbied against the legislation.  People in the pro-life movement are very disappointed that this would happen in Delaware,  said Rob Krebs, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington.  Many feel this will make late-term abortions much more common in our state,  he said. Carney's signature of the law on Thursday came just days after the state House voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to pass the bill, which was passed by the state Senate 11-7 on May 9. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats and Carney is a Democrat. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it. In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-abortion-delaware-idUSL1N1J60XI"},

Manning came out as transgendered shortly after her sentencing, but the military denied her request for hormone therapy treatment while behind bars. She was placed in solitary confinement after attempting suicide twice. Manning continued to fight for the treatment, and the authorities ultimately relented.

The 20-year-old, looking to become the first unseeded woman to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since 1933, blazed her way to the final, hitting winners and errors with reckless abandon. Third seed Halep, instead, dug herself into her second French Open final, showing the classical claycourt skills that marked her out as many people's pre-tournament favorite. Nowhere was her tenacity and ability to soak up punishment more apparent than in the quarter-finals when she trailed Elina Svitolina by a set and 5-1 but somehow found a way to win. Should she win on Saturday she will be the first player since Justine Henin in 2005 to win a singles' title at Roland Garros after saving a match point. With so many big names absent from the draw this could be Halep's best chance to land a first grand slam -- but that is not all that is at stake.

I love the pressure,  the 25-year-old, who began the tournament with doubts over her ankle, said. If anything the pressure is off Ostapenko. Former men's champion Mats Wilander described the final as a  bonus  match for the young woman from Riga who thrashed 50 winners in the semi-final against Timea Bacsinszky. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 8, 2017   Romania's Simona Halep celebrates winning her semi final match against Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova   Reuters / Christian HartmannShe is the youngest French Open finalist since Ana Ivanovic in 2007 and the first unseeded women's finalist since Mima Jausovec lost to Chris Evert in 1983. She also has the chance to emulate the darling of Roland Garros, Gustavo Kuerten, by making the French Open her first career title -- the feat the Brazilian achieved in 1997 on the day Ostapenko was born. The stars seem aligned for the Latvian, whose style is reminiscent of that of Monica Seles. She goes for the throat on every shot, always looking for the lines.  She is young, almost careless,  said her semi-final opponent Bacsinszky.  She's not afraid of anything. She's a big hitter. She's a baby. The way she hits is fascinating.  The average speed of Ostapenko's forehand is indeed higher than men's world number one Andy Murray at this year's tournament, a frightening prospect for most of her opponents. But Halep is the wall.  The Romanian has the nagging ability to force her rivals to go for the extra shot, causing them to take even more risks.  She puts every ball back,  her semi-final opponent, Karolina Pliskova, herself a big hitter, said.  The Czech has little doubt on the issue of the contest.  (Ostapenko) is a dangerous player for everybody, I think, but I would bet everything I have on Simona,  she said.

Quick feet, quick swings, high velocity - that is the way the 20-year-old from Riga goes about her business. The livewire Latvian has electrified Roland Garros this year with a refreshingly simple game plan. While other players take the slow waltz to victory, Ostapenko is a woman in a hurry. Claycourt tennis can often become a battle of wills - two players waiting patiently for the other to make a false step. Ostapenko, the youngest French Open finalist since Ana Ivanovic 10 years ago, takes a riskier approach, striking every ball as if she is trying to separate it from its fluffy coat. Pundits have been taken aback by Ostapenko's carefree approach in only her second French Open - one that saw her clock up 50 clean winners in her semi-final victory over Timea Bacsinszky, having belted 38 past former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the previous round. In six rounds, she has executed 245 clean winners - 26 percent of all the points she has played. Romanian claycourt specialist Simona Halep, who stands between her and an inprobable first grand slam title on Saturday, has hit 118. The perception is that Ostapenko, coached by Spain's former top-20 player Anabel Medina Garrigues, has a game plan limited to trying to belt every ball to oblivion. But that would be doing her a disservice. There is method in the apparent madness and while she did commit 45 unforced errors against Bacsinszky, they are all part of the package. While there are the occasional meltdowns - she looks, in the words of former champion Maria Sharapova,  like Bambi on ice  when asked to volley from close quarters - the pressure her attacking style puts on her opponents is immense. There is barely a second to catch a breath - such is the barrage hurtling across the net. Some doubt whether such an approach can seriously upset Halep, especially in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a French open final with the eyes of the world watching.  She came out like a thunderstorm in that third set (against Bacsinszky),  seven-times champion Chris Evert said.  But not many players win their first final in a grand slam. I would be surprised if she came out and can hit winners all over the court like she has been. But I might be wrong.  World number 47 Ostapenko's average forehand speed at the French Open is 76mph - only a couple of clicks behind Rafa Nadal's and ahead of men's world number one Andy Murray.  Since I started to play tennis, I had a possibility to play aggressive,  Ostapenko, who celebrated her birthday on Thursday, told reporters.  That's my game style. But yesterday when I knew that my forehand was faster, I was a little bit surprised.  Tennis players rarely make headline news in the Baltic state of Latvia, where ice hockey and basketball are more popular. Ernests Gulbis enjoyed some fame when he reached the semi-finals in Paris but Ostapenko has taken it to a whole new level after becoming her country's first grand slam finalist. She even received a phone call from Latvia's president.  He actually called my mom. So that's what she told me. I mean, because nobody knows my phone number.  Win on Saturday and the phone might be ringing non-stop. Reporting by Martyn Herman; editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-frenchopen-ostapenko-idUSKBN19028W"},

Executives told analysts in a conference call that the company, which operates Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and other chains, plans to decrease its number of vendors and move toward a  shared services  structure to standardize processes across department stores. The shares tumbled C$1.08, or 11.2 percent, to C$8.55, and earlier touched a record low of C$8.44.

The company said its team in Europe was also focused on managing costs, but that the restructuring was centered on North America. Storch said employees in Europe were unionized and the agreement when it purchased the Kaufhof department store chain included limits to job cuts in the first several years of operation.

Fragile states that are poor and depend heavily on agriculture are most at risk of violent uprisings since they struggle to cope with climate change, according to a study published this week in the Journal of Peace Research.   We've already started to see climate change as an issue that won't just put the coasts under water, but as something that could cause food riots in some parts of the world,  said study co-author Bear Braumoeller from The Ohio State University. The last time the world saw a severe food crisis was in 2007 and 2008, when extreme weather events hit major grain producing regions the year earlier, causing spikes in the demand and cost of food. The higher prices led to social and political unrest in Morocco, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Indonesia, according to a 2016 report by Global Footprint Network and United Nations Environment Programme. Drought is becoming more frequent and severe in places like eastern and southern Africa, and that – combined with the recent El Nino phenomenon – is taking a heavy toll on rural lives and economies. Last April, a rice farmer in the Philippines was killed during protests demanding government assistance after drought linked by some to El Nino hit hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland.  El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, is linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.  Moreover, the US-based Center for Climate and Security on Friday said factors like global water shortages, displacement or migration caused by climate change, and rising sea levels also posed serious threats to international security. Braumoeller said having a stable government was key to placating growing civil unrest and violence in the face of food shortages caused by climate change.   A capable government is even more important to keeping the peace than good weather,  he said in a statement.  Less vulnerable countries can better handle the problems that droughts or food price fluctuations create.  Braumoeller said fragile states needed to address instability and invest in sustainable,  greener  industries to increase their economic growth, in order to cope with food shortages due to climate change.  Development aid is important now and it is likely to be even more important in the future as we look for ways to increase climate resilience,  he said.

ENI has launched production from the integrated oil and gas development project in the OCTP block, off Ghana's western coast, in just two and half years, and three months ahead of schedule,  the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The government of President Nana Akufo-Addo hopes OCTP will more than double domestic gas supply and help restore rapid economic growth in a country that also produces gold and cocoa.  The gas is fuelling the production vessel and the excess will be reinjected as output rises after commissioning, said an ENI spokesman who declined to be identified.

Upstream trader Vitol [VITOLV.UL] holds 35.56 percent while state oil company Ghana National Petroleum Corporation has a combined carried and participating interest of 20 percent.

All three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates. Traders are pricing in a 99.6 percent chance of a rate hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.9 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in shares of both JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P; 500 index. The financial index's 1.46 percent rise topped the gainers among the major S&P; 500 sectors. Investors also looked beyond the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. May, however, said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish party to provide political certainty.  While Britain is a bit of a hung parliament at this time, it's not so severe that the Conservatives lose all their power so the Brexit conversation could still be a slow, methodical process,  said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. At 10:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 99.36 points, or 0.47 percent, at 21,281.89 and the S&P; 500 was up 11.14 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,444.93. The Nasdaq Composite was up 19.04 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,340.81. Investor sentiment also got a boost after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered.  The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue,  said Blancato. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs. Chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.6 percent after brokerages reiterated their bullish view on the stock. The stock was the biggest boost on the Nasdaq. DuPont Fabros Technology jumped 13 percent to $62.55 after Digital Realty Trust said it would buy the fellow data center operator for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion.

The company refuted allegations that the bank loan was unpaid and accused the CBI of  concerted harassment , saying the move had been spurred by unhappiness over NDTV's coverage. The raids have drawn criticism from opposition political parties, journalist groups such as the Editors' Guild of India, Press Club of India and All India Newspaper Editors' Conference, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has been accused of intolerance toward dissenting views.  It is one of those times when we have to forget our organizational and institutional affiliations. This is an issue that concerns the mother of all our institutions - the free press,  said Shekhar Gupta, a veteran journalist and commentator.     The NDTV raid has also shone a spotlight in the fiercely competitive TV news industry. Analysts say some channels have also tested the boundaries of responsible journalism, especially in prime-time talk shows that often turn rowdy. India's Information and Broadcasting minister Venkaiah Naidu dismissed the allegations that the NDTV searches were an encroachment on press freedom. Senior officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office and members of his nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have told Reuters they consider NDTV to be the least government-friendly channel.

Spot prices for July delivery LNG-AS edged up by five cents to $5.45 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), while August traded at the same level. Supply was available from a number of projects in Australia, Malaysia and Angola, which offered two cargoes via spot tender this week. India's GPSC cancelled a tender to buy an LNG cargo in July, likely as a result of unsatisfactory price offers, while Pakistan also pushed back deliveries of four cargoes sought via tender to October from September. Nigeria sold three cargoes via tender this week, and Argentina was to award its 16-cargo buy tender.  Everyone was playing the Qatar crisis down this week. Qatar has enough shorts to mitigate the crisis,  a Singapore-based trader said, referring to the producer's outlets in Europe. Trafigura's Golar Glacier tanker, carrying Qatari LNG, has moored nearby to Egypt's Ain Sukhna import terminal but has not unloaded yet. Traders do not expect Egypt to impose any restrictions on tankers carrying LNG from Qatar. Two Qatari LNG tankers diverted away from the Suez Canal on Thursday - which traders had expected to arrive in Britain - are now both on a heading to sail around Africa, shipping data shows. Diversions in the Gulf of Aden left Britain facing a lack of deliveries for the rest of June, lifting prices at the UK's National Balancing Point trading hub, and driving speculation of potential links to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. But their revised heading indicates that Qatar may have opted at the last-minute to take the ships the long way around Africa, instead of via Egypt's Suez Canal - delaying their arrival in the UK. Shipping analysts Kpler estimate both tankers will arrive at the UK's South Hook import terminal in the first week of July. Demand from Japanese utilities has been muted this summer because Japanese consumers have asked producers to supply more cargoes from their long term commitments ahead of likely nuclear restarts later in the year, a second trader from a Japanese trading firm said. These requests have displaced traditional Japanese summer demand for spot cargoes, the trader added. South Korea remains the key Asian buyer this summer, market participants said, with Komipo launching a tender seeking an early-July cargo this week. On the demand side, India's Torrent Power unveiled demand for 36 LNG cargoes across a three-year period from 2018, and invited suppliers to provide price offers.

Stanford University and Georgetown University business schools are planning to offer  fintech  courses for business school students for the first time this fall. New York University is planning a new course for undergraduates after launching a fintech specialization in its business school last year. They join the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Columbia University's business school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management, which all launched similar programs in recent years.  The new courses are being driven by student demand, officials from those universities told Reuters in interviews.  A number of prominent startups have exploded onto the fintech scene in recent years, fostering interest in mobile payment apps like Venmo, digital loan platforms like SoFi and robotic wealth managers like Betterment.  Ten years ago everyone wanted to go into investment banking or in the trading side,  said Reena Aggarwal, Director of the Georgetown Center for Financial Markets and Policy.  Now the students are much more interested in innovation.  NYU's undergraduate course, for instance, attracted enrollments from twice as many students as expected. Cyclists traverse the main quad on Stanford University's campus in Stanford, California, U.S. on May 9, 2014.Beck Diefenbach/File PhotoBut the burgeoning industry is so diverse that academics said it is difficult to construct a syllabus for financial technology 101. There are no textbooks and few professors have fintech expertise.  For fintech, some people mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; some people mean the technology JPMorgan uses for trading,  said Angela Lee, Columbia Business School's chief innovation officer.  Everyone thinks it's sexy, and a lot of people use it colloquially without knowing what it is.  Instead of developing traditional syllabuses, universities have been teaching students how markets are disrupted by new technology, helping them develop business ideas or offering classes on narrower topics. For instance, MIT taught a course on blockchain, the technology that first emerged as a system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin. Stanford's course will focus on financial inclusion, or designing affordable products and services for disadvantaged customers, said Kenneth Singleton, a management professor who will teach the class. Universities have also invited financial technology executives to lecture.  There is no ready-made teaching material that you can put together,  Antoinette Schoar, a professor of finance at MIT Sloan, said in an interview.  You have to try your own curriculum or develop real life cases.   Those involved with the programs said learning about fintech can help students' careers, whether they join traditional Wall Street firms or launch their own companies. They said it has also helped attract high-quality students. One Wharton student, David Gogel, enrolled after developing an interest in fintech while working at American International Group Inc (AIG.N). He is now co-president of the FinTech Club, one of the largest professional organizations at the school, with 260 members.  Part of the reason I chose Wharton was because of its investment in fintech,  he said in an interview.

The military's social media-monitoring team identified 63 accounts under fake names that it believed were being used by the Islamic State-allied Maute group and its sympathizers.  They are spreading lies, they are spreading misinformation and they are creating more problems in our fight against the terrorists,  spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera told a news conference in Marawi City, where at least 200 militants are still holed up 18 days after their attempt to capture the town. Officials said an estimated 500-1,000 civilians were trapped in the built-up area occupied by the fighters, which came under heavy aerial bombardment on Friday.  Some civilians were being held as human shields, while others hiding in their homes fear capture by the militants and have no running water, electricity or food, said Zia Alonto Adiong, a politician involved in evacuation efforts. Fake accounts are not permitted under Facebook, and in recent months the company has launched several initiatives against fake news.  Our Community Standards do not allow groups or people that engage in terrorist activity, or posts that express support for terrorism,  a Facebook representative said in an email response to a request for comment.  Fake accounts are also prohibited. We will remove accounts and content that violate these policies when we are made aware of them.  One of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer on the insurgency-plagued island of Mindanao that analysts say is more sophisticated and media-savvy than more established groups.  Part of what we are looking at is radicalization in social media. This is used to radicalize the youth,  Herrera said.  We see massive misinformation and use of social media to facilitate propaganda activities.  Evacuees gather in an open area of the evacuation center in Saguiran village at Lanao Del Sur, Philippines June 9, 2017.Romeo RanocoIndependence Day Deadline The seizure of Marawi City has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear Islamic State, facing setbacks in Syria and Iraq, is establishing a stronghold in Mindanao that could threaten the whole region. About 40 foreigners have fought alongside the Philippine militants in Marawi City, most of them from Indonesia and Malaysia though some came from the Middle East. Slideshow (5 Images)The Philippines is largely Christian, but Mindanao has a significant population of Muslims and Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. Maute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia  emir . Military officials said they believed Hapilon and the two founding brothers of the Maute group were still in the town. Officials said the army was chipping away at the territory held by the militants. The volume of fire coming from the rebel side had dropped and their sniper firing had become more selective. However, the army had to proceed carefully because civilians were being held in mosques and madrasas, or religious schools, and the fighters had prepared for a long siege, stockpiling arms and food in tunnels and basements. According to the latest official figures, 138 militants had been killed, with the death tolls for security personnel and civilians at 40 and 20, respectively. Military spokesman Restituto Padilla said the aim was to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines' independence day.  The chief of staff made an announcement, hoping, that by Monday we can freely wave our flags in every corner of Marawi and we are working feverishly to do that,  he said.

U.S. short-term yields also advanced, with two-year Treasuries touching a four-week peak. Investors largely shrugged off Thursday's results of the UK election, which resulted in a hung parliament for Britain, and scathing testimony from former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey at the Senate. Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia. U.S. Treasuries initially rallied in the aftermath of the UK election, with benchmark 10-year note yields dropping as low as 2.16 percent, but yields have since risen as part of an overall consolidation. The UK's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in an election debacle days before talks on Britain's EU departure are due to begin.  Our key takeaway from the day's events was that we saw the weakening in Treasuries as largely technical,  said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. He said the sell-off in Treasuries suggested the market was preparing for a crowded U.S. auction calendar next week. The U.S. Treasury will hold an auction of 3-, 10- and 30-year debt next week. Ahead of an auction, traders would typically sell Treasuries to make way for the new supply of government debt, leading to higher yields. Investors were also anticipating another interest rate increase by the Fed on Wednesday, at the conclusion of a two-day monetary policy meeting. In late morning trading, U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last down 9/32 in price, with yields at 2.225 percent, compared with 2.194 percent on Thursday. Ten-year yields earlier hit a one-week high of 2.228 percent. U.S. 30-year bonds fell 16/32 in price, yielding 2.879 percent, rising from Thursday's 2.855 percent. Earlier in the session, 30-year yields rose to one-week peaks of 2.883 percent. On the front end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields were at 1.350 percent, up from 1.322 percent late on Thursday after hitting a four-week high of 1.351 percent.

For market leader NLMK (NLMK.MM) and competitors such as Severstal (CHMF.MM), the Moscow government's plan to build 20 million square meters of residential space over the next 15 years is now a chance to win new product sales in a weak market. Reuters calculations, based on estimated requirements of around 85 kilograms of steel per square meter of residential space provided by producers, analysts and traders, indicate the scheme will require between 1.5-2 million tonnes of crude steel. Russian steel demand totaled 40 million tonnes in 2016 and is seen increasing by up to 3.5 percent this year after three years of decline. Whilst comparatively small, the additional volumes in Moscow will provide an important boost to the recovering market, traders said.   Of course, the demand will help the market. But mostly in the long term,  said one trader who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.  In general figures, the Moscow renovation will return demand to pre-crisis levels.  The Moscow city government has said it plans to spend around 3 trillion rubles ($53 billion) on the resettlement program, which is intended to move people from aging Soviet-era buildings into modern apartments. But thousands of Muscovites have protested against the plans, with some living in buildings scheduled for demolition saying they do not want to move unless they have guarantees about where they will be resettled.      Moscow city government said it could not comment on the project's steel requirements or the prospects of individual companies as final plans were not yet confirmed and contracts would be awarded via a competitive tender process.

The best-positioned companies to take these orders, that's going to be NLMK and Severstal for sure.  he said.  NLMK is closest to Moscow and Severstal is also not that far away.  Slideshow (2 Images)Competitor MMK (MAGN.MM) also produces large amounts of long products but its plant site is in Magnitogorsk, an ex-Soviet industrial center 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, means it will struggle to meet the orders, Chuyko said. In contrast, NLMK operates a mill specializing in steel products for the construction industry in the city of Kaluga, just 150 km (93 miles) south-west of the Russian capital.  To take part in all this, you need warehouses and logistics, which only NLMK has in Moscow,  the trader said. A company spokeswoman said the NLMK's plant in Kaluga was the leading producer of rebar in the area and could reroute supplies currently going to other regions if demand in Moscow increased on the back of the government's construction plans.  Severstal said its mills in Cherepovets and Balakovo, 390 km (242 miles) and 760 km (472 miles) from Moscow respectively, and its wide range of products would allow it to compete for the volumes.  Severstal has the strongest positions to become one of the major suppliers for the residential homes renovation program in Moscow,  the company told Reuters.

There was concern that a weak minority administration and a possible leadership challenge to May after her electoral gamble backfired might mean further delay to the start of talks scheduled for June 19. But the prime minister said her new government would now prepare for discussions in 10 days time. However, Guenther Oettinger, the German member of the EU executive, was among those warning that a weak British leader may be a problem once talks start.  We need a government that can act,  he told German radio.  With a weak negotiating partner, there's a danger the negotiations will turn out badly.  Oettinger's boss, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, said his Brexit negotiating team under Michel Barnier was ready:  The clock is ticking,  Juncker said. Barnier sounded conciliatory:  Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready,  he tweeted.  Timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal.  Donald Tusk, the former Polish premier who will oversee the process as chair of EU national leaders' summits, also stressed there was  no time to lose  and a need for London and Brussels to cooperate to minimize disruption for people, businesses and governments across Europe when Britain walks out in 22 months.  Our shared responsibility and urgent task now is to conduct the negotiations ... in the best possible spirit, securing the least disruptive outcome,  said Tusk, who warned last month that emotions stirred up on either side of the English Channel during the British election campaign were jeopardizing agreement. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was quick to scotch a suggestion Britain might do a U-turn and ask to stay in the bloc - something that would need EU agreement - and a Commission spokesman resisted a barrage of questions at a press briefing on whether the Union might agree to extend the two-year deadline. Related CoverageEU tells May 'no time to lose' on Brexit talksEU's Juncker urges London not to delay Brexit talksBrexit forever? How May's failed election gamble changes BrexitFew Europeans voiced much sympathy for May. Some compared her to her predecessor David Cameron, who sought to silence Eurosceptic fellow Conservatives by calling the referendum on EU membership which ended his career and shocked Europe.  Yet Another Own Goal   Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,  tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the liberal former Belgian premier who is the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit process. German conservative Markus Ferber, an EU lawmaker involved in discussions on access to EU markets for Britain's financial sector, was scathing:  At the most untimely point,  he said,  The British political system is in total disarray. Instead of strong and stable leadership we witness chaos and uncertainty.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the Conservative Party's Headquarters after Britain's election in London, June 9, 2017.Peter NichollsMay, who had campaigned against Brexit last year, delivered her terms for withdrawal on March 29 that included a clean break from the EU single market. She then called a snap election hoping for a big majority to strengthen her negotiating hand. That was also the broadly desired outcome in Brussels, where leaders believed that a stronger May would be better able to cut compromise deals with the EU and resist pressure from hardline pro-Brexit factions in her party to walk out without a deal. European leaders have largely given up considering the possibility that Britain might change its mind and ask to stay, something May made clear was not her intention. Most now appear to prefer that the bloc's second-biggest economy leave smoothly and quickly. Having recovered from last year's shock, Germany, France and other powers see Brexit as a chance to tighten EU integration without the awkward British.  As news of British mayhem broke, Juncker was launching a new push for an expanded EU defense project which Britain has long opposed, fearing a clash with the U.S.-led NATO alliance. Fear of Collapse A breakdown in negotiations could mean Britain ceasing to be an EU member without having in place the legal agreements that would avoid a chaotic limbo for people and businesses. That would also make it improbable that Britain could secure the rapid free trade agreement it wants with the EU after it leaves. In a note to clients, UBS wrote that a breakdown in talks was now more likely and would make it harder to reach a trade deal:  A tighter political balance could make it easier for Eurosceptics ... to prevent the government from offering the compromises needed to secure a trade deal.  Barnier aims to start with talks on residence rights for expatriates, on how much Britain will owe the Union on departure and on EU-UK border arrangements in Northern Ireland. He hopes outline agreements on those issues by the end of this year can open the way for discussion on a future trade deal. However, May and her allies have questioned the EU's negotiating proposals. May's reappointment and determination to soldier on without a clear majority has muted talk of a different ruling coalition taking power with a mission to seek a  softer  Brexit than May is pursuing, possibly seeking to remain in the single market. While the other 27 states would quite possibly be willing to extend to Britain the same kind of access to EU markets they offer to Norway or Switzerland, they have made clear that would mean Britain continuing to pay into the EU budget and obey EU rules, including on free migration across the bloc, while no longer having any say in how the Union's policies are set.  Maybe there won’t be a hard Brexit,  Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende said.  Maybe Britain will have to show greater flexibility in the negotiations.  But EU officials question how any British government could persuade voters to accept a Norway-style package and so would be wary of starting down the path of negotiating it for fear of ending up without a deal that both sides could ratify in 2019.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $15.3 billion of debt at March 31, 2017. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Elevated Leverage to Decline: Mylan is in the process of deleveraging from its partly debt-financed acquisition of Meda in August 2016. This company's diverse product portfolio, which benefits from relatively reliable demand and generally defensible margins, should drive consistently positive free cash flow (FCF). Fitch expects Mylan will pay down sufficient debt to reduce gross leverage (total gross debt/EBITDA) to below 3.5x by year-end 2017, despite some litigation and pricing headwinds. Longer term, Mylan will likely maintain its acquisitive posture, focusing on targets that improve the breadth and depth of its existing portfolio or adjacent opportunities. Diversified, Scaled Operations: Mylan is a well-diversified top-three global generic drug firm. Scale and diversification are important for generic drug firms to maintain stable and durable margins, particularly given the consolidation of industry customers. Mylan's operating profile also benefits from the company's focus on relatively difficult-to-manufacture, chemically complex generic or near-generic drugs. Aggressive Capital Deployment: In recent years, Mylan has taken a more aggressive acquisitive posture. Most recently, the company acquired Meda for about $10 billion including assumed debt, driving pro forma gross leverage above 4.0x. However, Fitch expects the company's near-term M&A; activity will be limited to targeted transactions, and will be financed in accordance with the goal of maintaining its investment-grade ratings. In addition, any such deals will likely fit into Mylan's areas of core competence, limiting integration risk. EpiPen Pressure: Mylan introduced its own generic version of the company's branded EpiPen product in late 2016. The branded and generic products will provide incrementally lower EBITDA contributions going forward. Furthermore, uncertainties related to ongoing legal and government investigations and the recently announced Medicaid settlement add potential event risk to the credit profile. Constructive Industry Outlook: Fitch's outlook for global generic pharma, especially the largest players, is favorable for volume growth, partly offset by pricing pressure. Growth opportunities exist because of increasing generic penetration in many European markets, aging populations in developed markets, and improving access to healthcare in emerging markets. DERIVATION SUMMARY Mylan N.V.'s rating of 'BBB-' reflects the company's favorable position relative to smaller industry peers on the basis of scale, geographic end-markets and the level of differentiation of its products.  Mylan continues to increase its focus on difficult-to-manufacture, chemically complex drugs, which generally command relatively more defensible prices and margins. The company has been a consistent generator of positive FCF. Partly offsetting the strong operating profile are the continued prospects of pricing pressure on less differentiated products and the company's acquisitive posture. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Relatively flat top-line organic performance in 2017 with recent acquisition-related revenue more than offsetting pricing headwinds and generic competition to EpiPen to generate strong double-digit reported revenue growth. --Higher EBITDA margins in 2017 driven by improved operational efficiency and acquisition-related synergies, partly offset by lower EpiPen sales and margins. --Operating cash flows of approximately $2.7 billion in 2017, with capex of $470 million, resulting in FCF of $2.2 billion, excluding litigation payments. --Targeted M&A; within the context of de-leveraging to below 3.5x by year-end 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --An upgrade to 'BBB' is unlikely over the ratings horizon, given the firm's demonstrated willingness to add meaningful leverage to the balance sheet for M&A;, and ongoing EpiPen uncertainties. --Top-line growth and/or margin expansion exceeds Fitch's base case, particularly from successful launches of key products such as generic Advair, depending on capital deployment in the meantime. --The company commits to operating with debt leverage near 2.5x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Management abandons its commitment to operating within the context of investment-grade ratings, demonstrated by a willingness to sustain gross debt/EBITDA near 3.5x. --The company fails to launch meaningful new products or experiences greater competitive/pricing pressures than currently contemplated, including additional large cash outlays. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity, Well-staggered Maturities: Mylan presently has sufficient liquidity, including a $2 billion revolving credit facility, undrawn as of March 31, 2017. LTM FCF is greater than scheduled debt maturities in 2017 and 2018, and Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Mylan N.V. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating affirmed at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-'; The Rating Outlook is Stable. Mylan N.V. Fitch has assigned the following ratings. --Short-Term IDR 'F3'; --Commercial Paper 'F3'. Mylan, Inc. --Senior unsecured bank facility affirmed at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-'. Mylan, Inc. Fitch has assigned the following rating: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The risk of write-down in these junior securities has been underpriced,  said Puneet Sharma, head of credit strategy in investment management at Zurich Insurance.  This is a very significant event. I don't think the market is taking it as that, but I think investors need to price a higher probability of write-down.  Regulators' decision to effectively treat all of Popular's subordinated debt equally came as a surprise to some in the market and showed that in distressed situations, all capital is fair game.  Wiping out the Tier 2 definitely makes you understand what subordination means,  said Matthew Rees, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.  If a bank is in trouble, you need to work your way through the capital stack. There should be an element of decompression between where the weaker and stronger banks' subordinated debt trades as people are reminded of the risk and we have a more muscular ECB and SRB [Single Resolution Board].  Some of this decompression was in evidence this week with some of Spain's smaller lenders subordinated debt dropping by multiple price points, while instruments issued by stronger banks remained largely unaffected. The €300m 10 non-call five-year Tier 2 issued by Banco de Credito Social Cooperativo (the parent of Cajamar) lost 10 points over the week. It was quoted at a 90 cash price on Friday, according to Tradeweb. Liberbank's €300m 10NC5, which priced in March, had dropped to 85.4 on Friday, over 18 points lower than where it was on Tuesday. The Known Unknown But it is not just the pricing of Europe's smaller lenders' debt that is likely to be impacted. Investors will have to reassess the risk of regulatory intervention and how to price it while the various triggers and features that were included in bank capital instruments to appease investors appeared meaningless.  When approaching the point of non-viability, it doesn't matter whether the instruments are high or low strike,  said Filippo Alloatti, a credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management.  When a bank is in a difficult situation and has no access to the public market, it doesn't matter what the common equity tier 1 is.  For Popular, like other banks during the financial crisis, it was liquidity that proved to be the Spanish lender's downfall while its equity ratio looked relatively solid. And AT1 debt, which is meant to act as so-called  going-concern  capital, failed to fulfil that role.  After all the regulatory efforts to design AT1s as a form of capital that can absorb losses early on, Popular AT1s never missed a single coupon,  analysts at BNP Paribas wrote. And while Popular's senior debt was left unscathed, market participants questioned what would have happened if the lender had started to build a cushion of senior loss-absorbing debt as required under new global and European rules.  With the new type of senior non-preferred, holdco debt, next time around, I am not sure that senior debt will be spared and that part of the market should be more cognisant of that risk,  said Sharma.

Macron said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatisations to help fund a 10 billion euro ($11.2 billion) government drive to boost industry and innovation. If he gets the parliamentary majority pollsters expect on June 18, he could go for a quick first deal that could raise funds for ailing French nuclear group Areva. Shares in ADP, which runs Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports outside Paris, are trading near record highs, and the government's 50.6 percent stake, worth nearly 7 billion euros, could be put on the block by state investment group APE within weeks or months of the election, the sources said.  We think that APE have made plans so that ADP is on top of the stack for the government,  said one of the sources who has previously been involved in deals involving the French state. None of the sources could say for sure the government would sell ADP soon, nor whether all or part of the stake would be up for auction. But a second source said APE had  very likely organised things  for ADP to be the first privatisation. ADP, the finance ministry, the president's office and the APE all declined to comment. Despite its strong recent share price performance, ADP has an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 13 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), below an average of around 16 times for recent sector transactions. The 2015 sell-off of Nice and Lyon airports, overseen by Macron himself as economy minister at the time, achieved multiples of 23 and 19 times respectively. European and Chinese investors are interested in ADP, a banking source said. However, French infrastructure group Vinci , which already holds 8 percent and has made airport operation a core business, is seen as the most serious candidate, sources and analysts said. Aside from the two Paris hubs, ADP manages or has stakes in 23 airports around the world, including in Belgium, Georgia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. It said on Friday it would increase its stake in Turkish airport operator TAV Airports to 46 percent for $160 million and expand with TAV in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Central Asia regions. Through public bank Caisse des Depots and holding companies Bpifrance and APE, the state has stakes in some 1,750 French companies with a combined value of nearly 100 billion euros, of which shares worth about 77.4 billion euros were listed on the stock exchange at the end of 2016. $1 = 0.8948 euros Additional reporting by Blandine Henault, Cyril Altmeyer, Jean-Michel Belot, Maya Nikolaeva; Writing by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Andrew Callus and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/adp-privatisation-idUSL8N1IY5K0"},

DuPont Fabros's shares rose as much as 14.6 percent to hit a record high of $63.46, just below the offer price of $63.60 based on Thursday's close.     Washington-based DuPont Fabros operates 12 data centers in three major U.S. markets, including Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia, while Digital Realty operates 145 data centers globally. Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros, which rent out space that companies use for data centers, have also benefited from the surge in demand for data and video. The combined company would be the  home to the cloud,  Digital Realty Chief Executive William Stein said on a conference call on Friday. The deal, which would add companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Yahoo Inc YHOO.O to Digital Realty's customer base, is expected to close in the second half. DuPont Fabros shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.545 Digital Realty shares per share held, the companies said. Based on Digital Realty's Thursday close, the offer is worth $63.60 per share, a premium of 14.9 percent to DuPont Fabros's close. The implied price per share is $64.32, according to a Digital Realty presentation. The equity value of the deal is about $4.95 billion based on DuPont Fabros's 77.8 million shares outstanding as of April 2, according to Thomson Reuters data.       The addition of (DuPont Fabros) should enhance (Digital Realty's) growth prospects, as it's acquiring an asset that's growing at plus 10 percent per year, with recent momentum including a 28.8 MW lease signed by who we believe to be (Apple),  Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a client note.     The deal has the potential to realize up to $18 million of annualized overhead savings, the companies said.     San Francisco, California-based Digital Realty has been acquiring companies to boost growth. The company said in May last year that it would buy eight data centers from Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) and in October 2015 bought Telx Group Inc. Digital Realty said it had a fully committed bridge loan facility from BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup to finance the DuPont Fabros deal. BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are Digital Realty's financial advisers while Goldman Sachs is advising DuPont Fabros.

Governments across Asia - most notably Hong Kong and Singapore - have launched a raft of initiatives to grab a slice of the $100 billion invested in financial technology globally but the regulatory hotchpotch is making it tough for firms to scale up, the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) said in a report on Friday.  The regulatory landscape is very fragmented and a lot of the initiatives, though well-intentioned, are not necessarily well thought through,  said Mark Austen, CEO of ASIFMA. The lobby group, which represents global banks and asset managers such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, has called on Asian regulators to coordinate better and to adopt a consistent set of best practices for fostering fintech in the region.  By not cooperating on fintech, Asian financial centers are putting themselves at a real disadvantage relative to the rest of the world: that traditional competitive dynamic and rivalry between the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore may actually in this case be a disadvantage,  said Hannah Cassidy, partner at Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong, which contributed to the report.  Investors poured $19 billion worldwide into fintech - including P2P lenders, distributed ledger technology and crowdfunding platforms - in 2016 alone and thousands of fintech start-ups continue to proliferate, according to a February report by global regulatory body the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia have launched a range of special programs to attract and foster fintech ventures, from incubators and grants, to temporary license waiver schemes, with competition fiercest between Hong Kong and Singapore.  While all these markets operate well-defined licensing and supervisory regimes for traditional financial firms including banks, brokers, insurance companies and funds, regulators are still struggling to establish clear and consistent regimes for fintech firms because they often operate innovative business models.  Cryptocurrency exchanges, for example, are licensed as money changers and regulated by the customs authority in Hong Kong but they are licensed as online shopping malls, akin to clothes retailers, in South Korea. In Singapore, the central bank has proposed regulating bitcoin exchanges as payment firms.  This makes it very expensive for fintech firms based in places with small domestic markets like Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia to expand into the broader region because they are more or less starting from scratch each time they enter a new country, said Aurelien Menant, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.com.  This is a very important issue for fintech firms in Asia,  he said, adding he would welcome tougher standardized rules for alternative currency exchanges across the region. The lack of regulatory clarity has meant some aspiring fintech firms have struggled to gain licenses in markets like Hong Kong, Reuters reported last year. (here)  We are open to cooperation with regional and global regulators on fintech,  the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement, adding it would be entering into new regulatory cooperations shortly. The SFC added it has taken a leading role in discussions around fintech within IOSCO and conducts dialogue with other watchdogs through a dedicated fintech liaison officer.  A spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the regulator has signed fintech cooperation agreements with 10 counterparties, including in Australia, India, Japan and South Korea.  “These agreements create frameworks for information sharing on fintech trends and regulatory issues, and potential joint innovation projects. They also help to create greater understanding between fintech players in different markets, with the ultimate goal of benefiting consumers and businesses,” the spokeswoman said in an email.

The company said on Thursday that it will use the funding on research and development initiatives aimed at enhancing its technology. Addepar has developed software that helps wealth managers view information on their clients' assets that might be spread out across various accounts.   Ultra-wealthy clients typically hold their assets in family trusts, limited partnerships or in alternative and illiquid investments spread across several banks and accounts. This means financial advisors will often gather and compile information into one spreadsheet through a protracted process rather than meeting with clients.  Wealth managers, especially the ones serving larger and more complex clients, often times have challenges in giving each client an accurate view of everything they own,  said Eric Poirier, chief executive of Addepar, in an interview. The company's platform allows wealth management firms, with client's permission, to gather information from various accounts in one place, Poirer said. Addepar is among the growing group of young technology companies that are seeking to help established financial institutions improve their technology across a wide range of functions, including anti-money laundering checks to client-interface software.  While the firm has so far focused on wealth management firms, Poirier said it had received inquiries from other buy-side companies such as pension funds.  Poirier said the firm has been growing rapidly, with its clients managing more than $650 billion through its platform, up from $300 billion 18 months ago. In January Morgan Stanley (MS.N)  said it was rolling out Addepar's platform to 20 of its top financial advisory teams.

The failure of the two business partners to resolve tensions comes as uncertainty spikes over the make-up of the groups bidding for the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, less than a week before Toshiba is to announce a winner. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the business, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. Western Digital has been seen by some sources as key to any successful deal as it which jointly operates a key flash memory chip plant with Toshiba in Japan. The two firms are, however, at loggerheads over the auction, with Western Digital pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached the joint venture contracts by entertaining outside bids and arguing that the sale cannot proceed without its consent. The Japan-backed consortium is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Toshiba favours the Broadcom bid as it is higher and would avoid antitrust concerns triggered by Western Digital, which overlaps heavily with Toshiba on NAND chips. Ahead of Toshiba's planned decision to pick a preferred bidder on Thursday, attention has focused on last-ditch efforts to salvage the government-Western Digital bid. Western Digital on Wednesday proposed a consortium led by a Japanese state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, and including U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co, sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to the media. But two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday that the state-backed fund was now in talks with U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital about teaming up in a bid. One of the sources said Bain would replace KKR as the main partner for the state-backed fund. In the previous round of bidding, Bain partnered with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix . A representative for SK Hynix declined to comment. A representative for KKR was not immediately available for comment. Milligan and Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa met at Toshiba headquarters on Friday afternoon.  Toshiba listened to Western Digital's thinking, but our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. A Western Digital spokeswoman confirmed that the meeting took place, but declined to comment further. A senior Toshiba executive said after the meeting that even a minority stake by Western Digital would make it hard to clear antitrust review. In its bid, Western Digital initially sought a majority but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease the government, the sources said. The bid price is still short of Toshiba's threshold 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and lower than Broadcom's offer of 2.2 trillion yen, they said. $1 = 110.6800 yen Additional reporting by Yoshiyasu Shida and Taro Fuse in Tokyo and Se Young Lee in Seoul","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-accounting-idUSL1N1J60TI"},

The decision by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Baharain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties this week threatens to hurt Qatar's trade balance, suck deposits from its banks and push out foreign investment. Reflecting this threat, the riyal fell on Friday in the offshore forwards market QAR1Y=W to its lowest level against the dollar since December 2015, when low oil and gas prices raised concern about all the Gulf economies. But the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter is so rich that it could offset the threatened capital outflows by liquidating just a portion of its financial reserves. And as long as it can keep exporting gas, its current account balance is unlikely to go deep into the red. That means the riyal's spot market peg of 3.64 to the dollar QAR= is probably safe for the foreseeable future. Any decision to change the peg would essentially be political rather than economic. At their lowest on Friday, forwards prices implied riyal depreciation of under 2 percent over the next 12 months. Many economists at financial institutions in the Gulf decline to discuss Qatar publicly because of the political tensions, but privately they say they expect Qatar to defend its currency successfully.  We are not looking for the Qatari peg to break,  wrote Chris Turner, global head of strategy at Europe's ING, though he called the pressure on the riyal unprecedented and said other countries' experience in the past 25 years indicated that if the peg did break, the riyal could fall at least 20 percent. Assets Cutting Qatar's credit rating to AA- this week, Standard & Poor's put the government's liquid external assets at 170 percent of gross domestic product, or about $295 billion, based on the International Monetary Fund's estimate of Qatari GDP. Capital outflows could come in several forms. Foreign investors have already started to sell Qatari equities; a complete pull-out could mean an outflow of nearly 10 percent of the stock market, or about $15 billion. Qatari banks had 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) of foreign liabilities in March, most in the form of loans and deposits from foreign banks. Less than half that is from banks in other Gulf states.   Some Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already started to cut their exposure to Qatar, and they could cut aggressively if the diplomatic crisis continues and their governments order them to do so. Riyadh may also try to force foreign banks to choose between the Saudi and Qatari markets. If foreign banks cut two-thirds of their exposure to Qatar in coming months, that could mean an outflow of over $80 billion. Then there is the current account balance. Before the crisis, the IMF predicted firm oil and gas prices would help Qatar run a surplus of $1.2 billion this year, rising gradually to $4.7 billion in 2020, against a deficit of $3.5 billion last year. Ten percent of Qatar's exports, which the IMF has estimated at $70 billion this year, are to countries that have blocked trade, S&P; calculated; import costs are likely to rise because of the closure of the land border with Saudi Arabia.  Costs may also rise as Qatar's isolation forces it to pay higher wages to the foreign professionals and workers who make up the vast majority of the population of about 2.6 million. The result could be a current account deficit of several billion dollars annually while the crisis lasts - a drain on resources, but not a decisive one considering Doha's assets. Because of its small size and the fact that many major banks have links to the government, Qatar would probably find it easier than most countries to impose capital controls if that became necessary to prevent residents from sending large amounts of money abroad. Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said he did not expect the riyal's peg to break. Even Riyadh, which also fixes its currency to the dollar to maintain investor confidence and limit volatility in its oil revenues, might want to avoid driving Qatar to take that step.  After all, if Qatar is forced to devalue, fresh concerns may be raised about other dollar pegs in the region.

The resulting hung parliament threatens to derail talks over Britain's exit from the European Union and dampen consumer confidence, which could puncture a banking sector that many analysts believe is already overextended. Britain's financial sector had pinned its hopes on a strengthened majority for May's Conservative government, expecting it to deliver a more certain economic outlook. But her failure to win outright control of parliament could delay and complicate talks over Britain's exit from the European Union, increasing the likelihood of slowing economic growth.  This is the worst outcome apart from (Labour leader) Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister,  a government relations official at one of Britain's biggest banks said. The more internationally-focused banks fared better in the election aftermath. HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) both rose by 2 percent by 0730 GMT thanks to their lower exposure to the British economy and higher proportion of dollar earnings which rose in value against the pound. Conservative-Led Coalition Analysts said the most favorable outcome now for banks is a Conservative-led coalition, likely with Northern Ireland's pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  FILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district is seen at dusk in London, Britain November 7, 2014.Toby Melville/File Photo The best case for the markets, as it stands now, is a continuity of the current government with outside support from some of the parties,  Chirantan Barua of Bernstein wrote in a research note. The DUP's manifesto makes little mention of banks and the financial sector, but lenders may be heartened by its emphasis on trade and customs relationships in the Brexit negotiations. Banks could still suffer under this scenario with a weakened government unlikely to push too hard for big business.  May had said she would tighten laws on company takeovers and would ensure any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services if she won the election, in a potential blow to dealmaking. Labour-Led Coalition The worst outcome for banks, especially Royal Bank of Scotland, (RBS.L) would be if Corbyn is able to form a coalition government with another party, or win a follow-up election. Labour in its manifesto said it would launch a consultation to break the state-owned lender into smaller regional banks. Other lenders would suffer under a Labour government too, with the party set to hike corporate taxes from 19 percent to 26 percent by 2020 and to restore a separate bank levy. In further measures hostile to banks, Labour could pass laws preventing banks from closing unprofitable branches in places where they are the last branch in town, and intervene to curb profits banks make on variable rate mortgages.

On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission named Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin as new co-directors of enforcement.  In an exclusive interview ahead of the formal announcement, the two said they were deeply concerned about cyber threats and see the topic as a major enforcement priority.  The greatest threat to our markets right now is the cyber threat,  said Peikin, who was still wearing a guest badge because he has not yet received his formal SEC credentials yet.  That crosses not just this building, but all over the country.  The SEC has started to see an  uptick  in the number of investigations involving cyber crime, as well as an increase in reports of brokerage account intrusions, Avakian said. As a result, the agency has started gathering statistics about cyber crimes to spot broader market-wide issues. The kinds of cyber crimes the SEC has been noticing range from stealing information for the purpose of insider trading, to breaking into accounts to either steal assets, trade against them or manipulate markets. Last year, for instance, the SEC accused a U.K.-based man with hacking into numerous accounts, placing unauthorized trades and then profiting by trading the same stocks in his own personal account.  I think we will see the cyber threat continue to emerge,  Avakian said. Avakian has been serving as acting director of enforcement since December. It is her second stint at the agency, having rejoined in 2014 after working in private practice at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. Steve Peikin, co-director of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC),  is shown in this February 11, 2013 handout photo provided June 8, 2017.  Courtesy Sullivan & Cromwell/Handout via REUTERSPeikin, a former federal prosecutor, will join the SEC on June 26 from Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm where newly appointed SEC Chairman Jay Clayton also worked. He has represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Barclays PLC (BARC.L), as well as Michael Coscia, the first person to be criminally convicted under a new law that aims to prevent traders from “spoofing” the market by putting in bids with the intent to cancel them.  The dual enforcement role can help prevent problems by allowing officials to recuse themselves when conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest exist.  During Clayton's confirmation hearing, some lawmakers raised concerns that his prior work at Sullivan & Cromwell could lead him to go easy on Wall Street or create too many recusals that cause the commissioners to deadlock on cases. A similar arrangement was in place under former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and co-enforcement directors Andrew Ceresney and George Canellos. White and Ceresney each came to the SEC from the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. Both Avakian and Peikin stressed that enforcement efforts at the SEC will continue to be  vigorous  and that conflicts will not impede the division's activities.   There is no room for bad actors,  Avakian said. For instance, despite President Donald Trump describing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), an anti-bribery statute, as a  horrible law  that should be changed, the two said they expect the SEC will continue to pursue such cases. They also said they expect the SEC will continue to weigh whether corporate penalties are appropriate in certain cases.  I think it is fair to question whether a particular penalty is actually achieving the result,  Peikin said,  But I wouldn't expect to see...a vacation from corporate fines and penalties.

The latest move by the state-owned subway operator will affirm its control over Vanke, China's second largest property developer, and essentially ends the struggle for boardroom control. Shenzhen Metro has acquired 1.55 billion A-shares in Vanke, equivalent to around a 14 percent stake, from another developer China Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) Hengda Real Estate and its subsidiaries at 18.80 yuan a share, Evergrande said in separate filings to the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges. That brings Shenzhen Metro's stake in Vanke to 29.38 percent, making it the biggest shareholder.  The stake purchase will take advantage of Shenzhen Metro and Vanke's strengths in transportation and property development services,  Shenzhen Metro said in a statement on its website. Vanke has been in crisis since late 2015 as Baoneng built up a 25 percent stake and sought to oust management, but Shenzhen Metro, a key ally, became its largest shareholder in terms of voting rights in March after a proxy agreement with its third-biggest shareholder. Vanke's A-shares listed in Shenzhen will resume trade on June 12 after a suspension since Wednesday. Its shares in Hong Kong have gained more than 4 percent since Wednesday, outpacing the broader Hang Seng Index .HSI.

Lying on the Gulf of Oman along the approaches to the Straits of Hormuz, the port of Chabahar is central to India's hopes to crack open a transport corridor to Central Asia and Afghanistan that bypasses arch-rival Pakistan.  Graphic on Silk Road: bit.ly/2rdsFDt India committed $500 million to speed development of the port after sanctions on Iran were lifted following a deal struck between major powers and Tehran to curb its nuclear program in 2015.  But the state-owned Indian firm that is developing Chabahar is yet to award a single tender for supplying equipment such as cranes and forklifts, according to two government sources tracking India's biggest overseas infrastructure push.  U.S. President Donald Trump denounced the nuclear agreement on the campaign trail, and since taking office in January has accused Iran of being a threat to countries across the Middle East.  Swiss engineering group Liebherr and Finland's Konecranes (KCRA.HE) and Cargotec (CGCBV.HE) have told India Ports Global Pvt Ltd, which is developing the deep water port, they were unable to take part in the bids as their banks were not ready to facilitate transactions involving Iran due to the uncertainty over U.S. policy, the two officials said in separate conversations with Reuters.  These firms dominate the market for customized equipment to develop jetties and container terminals. One official said the first tender was floated in September, but attracted few bidders because of the fear of renewed sanctions. That fear has intensified since January.   Now the situation is that we are running after suppliers,  one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of matter.  A Konecranes spokeswoman declined to comment beyond confirming the company was not involved in the project.  Cargotec and Liebherr did not respond to requests for comment.  Some tenders have been floated three times since September because they failed to attract bidders. A Chinese firm, ZPMC, has since come forward to supply some equipment, the same Indian official said.  Threat of Sanctions  Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major world powers restricting Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting of sanctions  the worst deal ever negotiated .  FILE PHOTO: A general view of the port of Kalantari in the city of Chabahar, 300 km (186 miles) east of the Strait of Hormuz, Iran January 17, 2012.Raheb Homavandi/File PhotoLast month his administration extended relief on Washington's broadest and most punitive sanctions, while carrying out a wider policy review on how to deal with the Islamic Republic.  Uncertainty over U.S. policy is already causing long delays in contracts that Iran has sought with international firms to develop its oil fields and buy planes for its aging airlines.  The lifting of United Nations and European Union sanctions in 2016 partly reconnected Iran with the international financial system crucial to trade.  But large international bankers with exposure to the United States remain unwilling to facilitate Iranian deals for fear of running afoul of narrower, unilateral U.S. sanctions that remain outside the nuclear deal and uncertainty over whether wider sanctions relief will continue.  FILE PHOTO: A general view of an oil dock is seen from a ship at the port of Kalantari in the city of Chabahar, 300 km (186 miles) east of the Strait of Hormuz, Iran January 17, 2012.Raheb Homavandi/File PhotoIndia's ambassador to Iran said the process of procuring equipment for the Chabahar port was under way and that some of the customized cranes needed up to 20 months to build. The banking situation was slowing improving, he added.   Tenders are re-floated for a variety of reasons including technical specifications not being met, etc. Banking channels, in recent months, have in fact somewhat eased,  Saurabh Kumar said in an emailed response to Reuters from Tehran.  If some companies do not participate, it really is their business.   India has been pushing for the development of Chabahar port for more than a decade as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan. Access to those countries is currently complicated by India's fraught relationship with Pakistan.  Bureaucratic delays, difficult negotiations with Iran and the risk of incurring Washington's displeasure during the financial embargo in Tehran had meant there was little progress on the port until now.  But, prodded in part by China's development of Gwadar port, which lies barely 100 km (60 miles) from Chabahar on the Pakistani coast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has unveiled massive investment plans centered around the Iranian port, offering to help build railways, roads and fertilizer plants that could eventually amount to $15 billion.  So far, even an initial credit line of $150 million that India wants to extend to Iran for development of Chabahar has remained a non-starter as Tehran has not been able to do its part of work.   They have not sought the loan from us because they haven't awarded the tenders, either because of lack of participation or banking problems,  said the second government official.  Ambassador Kumar said the Iran had indicated it would be sending proposals shortly to tap the credit line.  Meena Singh Roy, who heads the West Asia center at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a New Delhi think-tank, said increasing tension between Washington and Tehran would have an impact on the port project.   The Chabahar Project has strategic significance for India,  she said.  However ... nothing much seems to be moving due to new uncertainties in the region.

A flurry of new allegations of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and business interests close to President Jacob Zuma this week have piled pressure on the scandal-plagued leader and emboldened opposition parties. Some of more than 100,000 emails leaked to media show a company owned by the Gupta family, friends of Zuma, allegedly earned 5.3 billion rand ($410 million) by acting as an intermediary in a tender to build locomotives for state rail firm Transnet.  We are here because we want to protect the South African purse, which Zuma and his friends have turned into a personal purse,  EFF head Julius Malema said after filing the complaint at Johannesburg's central police station. Gigaba has said he has done nothing wrong. A Gupta family spokesman has said the emails are  fake news . Zuma has not addressed the new allegations but has previously said his relationship with the Guptas does not represent a conflict of interest. The African National Congress (ANC) has become increasingly divided over Zuma's leadership in recent months due to a string of corruption scandals, diminishing public support and economic turbulence caused partly by a cabinet reshuffle in March. Zuma, who has survived calls to resign from sections of the ANC and its political allies in recent months, said on Friday the party must put a stop to public spats and unite to avoid handing the advantage to its opponents.  We must unite and close ranks and find solutions to the challenges we face,  Zuma told veterans of the ANC's military wing.

Qatar holds 14 percent and Saudi Arabia 10 percent of the merged company and both are represented on the supervisory board of what is now the world's fifth biggest container shipping line. The next steps in the merger involve the inclusion of UASC's transport volumes on Hapag-Lloyd's IT platform and the establishment of new headquarters for the Middle East region as well as staff relocations.

The non-compliance complaint, effectively a new trade dispute, could lead to India asking to impose trade sanctions if the United States is found not to have complied.  India brought the original complaint to the WTO in April 2012, after the U.S. Commerce Department set an import duty of nearly 286 percent on a circular welded carbon-quality steel pipe from India to offset government subsidies. The Commerce Department did this after a petition from Allied Tube and Conduit, JMC Steel Group, Wheatland Tube and United States Steel Corp. In the extremely complex case, India argued that the price of the steel pipe was set by the market, but the United States said the iron ore used to make it came from a state-run mining firm, NMDC, effectively subsidizing Indian exporters.

There were no signs so far that the diplomatic crisis would impact the deal, which was struck last month, the senior manager, who is close to the German firm's owners, said. A coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates allege Qatar funds terrorism and is aligning itself with Iran. They have blockaded its borders to cut off food imports and banks have been advised not to do business with Qatari institutions. Qatar holds 14 percent and Saudi Arabia 10 percent of the merged company and both are represented on the supervisory board of what is now the world's fifth biggest container shipping line. The next steps in the merger involve the inclusion of UASC's transport volumes on Hapag-Lloyd's IT platform and the establishment of new headquarters for the Middle East region as well as staff relocations. Hapag-Lloyd's owners are Chile's CSAV, the city of Hamburg, investor Klaus-Michael Kuehne and tourism group TUI, along with some minority investors.

The decision by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties this week threatens to hurt Qatar's trade balance, suck deposits from its banks and push out foreign investment. Reflecting this threat, the riyal fell on Friday in the offshore forwards market to its lowest level against the dollar since December 2015, when low oil and gas prices raised concern about all the Gulf economies. But the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter is so rich that it could offset the threatened capital outflows by liquidating just a portion of its financial reserves. And as long as it can keep exporting gas, its current account balance is unlikely to go deep into the red. That means the riyal's spot market peg of 3.64 to the dollar is probably safe for the foreseeable future. Any decision to change the peg would essentially be political rather than economic. At their lowest on Friday, forwards prices implied riyal depreciation of under 2 percent over the next 12 months. Many economists at financial institutions in the Gulf decline to discuss Qatar publicly because of the political tensions, but privately they say they expect Qatar to defend its currency successfully.  We are not looking for the Qatari peg to break,  wrote Chris Turner, global head of strategy at Europe's ING, though he called the pressure on the riyal unprecedented and said other countries' experience in the past 25 years indicated that if the peg did break, the riyal could fall at least 20 percent. Assets Cutting Qatar's credit rating to AA- this week, Standard & Poor's put the government's liquid external assets at 170 percent of gross domestic product, or about $295 billion (£231.5 billion), based on the International Monetary Fund's estimate of Qatari GDP. Capital outflows could come in several forms. Foreign investors have already started to sell Qatari equities; a complete pull-out could mean an outflow of nearly 10 percent of the stock market, or about $15 billion. Qatari banks had 451 billion riyals (£97 billion) of foreign liabilities in March, most in the form of loans and deposits from foreign banks. Less than half that is from banks in other Gulf states.   Some Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already started to cut their exposure to Qatar, and they could cut aggressively if the diplomatic crisis continues and their governments order them to do so. Riyadh may also try to force foreign banks to choose between the Saudi and Qatari markets. If foreign banks cut two-thirds of their exposure to Qatar in coming months, that could mean an outflow of over $80 billion. Then there is the current account balance. Before the crisis, the IMF predicted firm oil and gas prices would help Qatar run a surplus of $1.2 billion this year, rising gradually to $4.7 billion in 2020, against a deficit of $3.5 billion last year. Ten percent of Qatar's exports, which the IMF has estimated at $70 billion this year, are to countries that have blocked trade, S&P; calculated; import costs are likely to rise because of the closure of the land border with Saudi Arabia.  Costs may also rise as Qatar's isolation forces it to pay higher wages to the foreign professionals and workers who make up the vast majority of the population of about 2.6 million. The result could be a current account deficit of several billion dollars annually while the crisis lasts - a drain on resources, but not a decisive one considering Doha's assets. Because of its small size and the fact that many major banks have links to the government, Qatar would probably find it easier than most countries to impose capital controls if that became necessary to prevent residents from sending large amounts of money abroad. Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said he did not expect the riyal's peg to break. Even Riyadh, which also fixes its currency to the dollar to maintain investor confidence and limit volatility in its oil revenues, might want to avoid driving Qatar to take that step.  After all, if Qatar is forced to devalue, fresh concerns may be raised about other dollar pegs in the region.

The latest move by the state-owned subway operator will affirm its control over Vanke, China's second largest property developer, and essentially ends the struggle for boardroom control. Shenzhen Metro has acquired 1.55 billion A-shares in Vanke, equivalent to around a 14 percent stake, from another developer China Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) Hengda Real Estate and its subsidiaries at 18.80 yuan a share, Evergrande said in separate filings to the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges. That brings Shenzhen Metro's stake in Vanke to 29.38 percent, making it the biggest shareholder.  The stake purchase will take advantage of Shenzhen Metro and Vanke's strengths in transportation and property development services,  Shenzhen Metro said in a statement on its website. Vanke has been in crisis since late 2015 as Baoneng built up a 25 percent stake and sought to oust management, but Shenzhen Metro, a key ally, became its largest shareholder in terms of voting rights in March after a proxy agreement with its third-biggest shareholder.

Fitch has also upgraded the Viability Ratings (VRs) of CAB to 'b' from 'b-', PCBU to 'b-' from 'ccc', Pravex to 'b-' from 'cc' and Ukrsots to 'ccc' from 'cc'. ABU's VR has been affirmed at 'ccc'. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT All five banks' IDRs and National Ratings factor in the likelihood of support they may receive from their foreign shareholders. The affirmations of CAB's, PCBU's and Pravex's 'B-' Long-Term Foreign Currency IDRs reflect the constraint of Ukraine's Country Ceiling of 'B-', which captures transfer and convertibility risks and limits the extent to which support from the majority foreign shareholders of these banks can be factored into the ratings. The Stable Outlooks on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDRs of CAB and PCBU are in line with that on the Ukrainian sovereign. The revision of the Outlook on Pravex's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR to Stable from Negative reflects Fitch's view that the rating at this level is now also underpinned by the bank's VR, following its upgrade to 'b-' from 'cc'. The Long-Term Local Currency IDRs of CAB, PCBU and Pravex at 'B' also take into account country risks. The Stable Outlooks on the Long-Term Local Currency IDRs of CAB and PCBU reflect Fitch's view of the likely evolution of these risks. The Negative Outlook on Pravex's Long-Term Local Currency IDR reflects the potential for the bank to be sold and hence for potential shareholder support to be reduced, in which case this rating would likely be downgraded to the level of the bank's VR. CAB is fully owned by Credit Agricole S.A. (A+/Stable). PCBU is controlled (94% of voting stock) by Germany's ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA (BBB/Stable). Pravex is fully owned by Intesa Sanpaolo (BBB/Stable), but has been managed as a non-core asset from 2014 when it was put up for sale. The affirmation of ABU's and Ukrsots' Long-Term IDRs, National Ratings and ABU's senior debt ratings reflects Fitch's unchanged view of the potential support both banks may receive from other assets of Alfa Group. However, the probability of support is limited due to the banks' indirect relationship with other group assets and the mixed track record of support (for ABU) from the shareholders. ABU and Ukrsots are both ultimately owned by ABH Holdings S.A. (ABHH), which is part of Alfa Group's financial business and is the owner of several other banking subsidiaries, mostly in the CIS, including Russia-based OJSC Alfa-Bank (BB+/Stable). In October 2016, Ukrsots' former owner, UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit, BBB/Stable), transferred its 99.9% share in Ukrsots to ABHH in exchange for 9.9% of ABHH's shares. VRs The upgrades of CAB's, PCBU's, Pravex's  and Ukrsots' VRs reflect reduced pressures on  asset quality mostly due to the more stable Ukrainian economy, the banks' modest growth/deleveraging (except for PCBU) and generally moderate risk appetites since the downturn in Ukraine's economy in 2014. The VR upgrades also consider improved loss absorption capacity following recent bank recapitalisations (Pravex, Ukrsots, PCBU) and/or continued resilience in operating performance (CAB, PCBU) that allowed for stronger coverage of problem assets and more comfortable capital cushions. The VRs of all five banks remain constrained by the challenging operating environment and/or still large stocks of legacy impaired loans (in particular at Pravex, Ukrsots and ABU), which pressure performance. We do not expect material improvements in asset quality metrics in the near term as Ukraine's economic recovery is only moderate; Fitch expects GDP growth of 2% in 2017 and 3% in 2018. The VRs of all five banks also reflect stabilisation of funding profiles, driven by decreased hryvnia volatility, and comfortable liquidity cushions accumulated in a period of low credit growth. Non-deposit funding is limited at these banks. CAB's 'b' VR reflects the bank's stronger standalone creditworthiness than peers'. It is supported by the bank's more balanced business model, benefitting from access to cheap (by market standards) and stable client funding, and a focus on lower-risk lending segments (multinational clients, better performing agro producers, car loans in retail) resulting in more resilient financial metrics. CAB's non-performing loans (NPLs, loans more than 90 days overdue) stood at 14.5% of loans at end-2016, and performing restructured loans were at 10.5% (end-2015: 15% and 12%, respectively). Impaired loans (NPLs plus restructured) were comfortably (74%) covered by impairment reserves; however, the unreserved portion of these amounted to a significant 50% of Fitch Core Capital (FCC). Loss absorption capacity is underpinned by solid pre-impairment profitability (equal to 10% of average gross loans for 2016), and a capital buffer is also available to absorb additional credit losses (FCC ratio of 12.7%). CAB reported a solid 36% return on average equity (ROAE) in 2016 (2015: 27%). PCBU's 'b-' VR factors in the risks associated with a largely unseasoned loan book following the bank's rapid growth in the core SME segment (by 52% in 2016 and 32% in 2015, adjusted for FX effects). Loans, however, have been originated under reasonably strict underwriting criteria with limited inflows of new problem loans to date. PCBU's NPLs and restructured (classified as standard, watch-list and impaired) loans stood at 2.9% and 7.6%, respectively, at end-2016, down from 5.6% and 14.4% at end-2015. Impairment reserves provided moderate (62%) cover for NPLs and restructured loans. The unreserved portion of these moderated to 28% of FCC at end-2016 from 129% at end-2015 following an equity injection in 2016, which also caused the FCC ratio to increase to 14% from 7.3%. Loss absorption capacity is underpinned by reasonable pre-impairment profitability (equal to 6% of average loans in 2016), net of unpaid accruals and non-core revenues. PCBU reported a solid 33% ROAE in 2016 (2015: 18%). Pravex's 'b-' VR reflects progress in the clean-up of the bank's balance sheet. NPLs decreased to 25% of loans at end-1Q17 from 72% at end-2015 after write-offs, and the remaining NPLs were fully covered by specific reserves. Restructured loans were a moderate 6% of loans at end-2016 (or 18% of FCC) and weakly provisioned. Apart from loans (a low 18% of the balance sheet at end-1Q17), other assets were of moderate- to low risk, and mostly liquid assets (cash and equivalents and short-term investments into National Bank of Ukraine securities) which were equal to around 86% of customer deposits. Pravex's solid capital buffer (FCC ratio of 22% at end-2016) should be seen in the context of the bank's still weak operational performance (annualised pre-impairment loss amounted to 18% of FCC in 1Q17), constrained by a low share of high-earning assets and a still sizable cost base. ABU's and Ukrsots' 'ccc' VRs factor in both banks' high levels of NPLs (end-2016: ABU: 35% of loans, 74%-covered by reserves; Ukrsots: 75% and 82%, respectively) and restructured loans (ABU: 33%; Ukrsots: 15%). The unreserved portions of these problem exposures were high at both banks (ABU: 5x FCC; Ukrsots: 2x FCC) and the FCC ratio was low at ABU (7.9%), but stronger at Ukrsots (25.2%) supported by the equity contribution provided by UniCredit before the bank's sale in 2016. ABU also expects to receive moderate capital support of USD60 million in 2017 (equal to 0.6x FCC or 5% of risk-weighted assets at end-2016). Both banks were deeply loss-making in 2016 (ROAE of -170% at ABU and -131% at Ukrsots, which reported pre-impairment losses in 2015-2016), due to a large share of weakly performing assets, low margins on the restructured portfolio (Ukrsots) and high provisioning needs at both banks. Performance prospects will depend on the ability to generate new healthy business (currently less evident for Ukrsots) and avoid new credit losses. Liquidity is comfortable at both banks and managed jointly suggesting some fungibility between the banks' balance sheets. The buffers of liquid assets (calculated as liquid assets net of near-term wholesale funding repayments) were equal to 17% of customer deposits at ABU and 33% at Ukrsots at end-4M17. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The IDRs of CAB, PCBU and Pravex could be upgraded if Ukraine's sovereign ratings are upgraded and the Country Ceiling revised upwards, and downgraded in case of a sovereign downgrade. An upgrade of ABU's and Ukrsots' IDRs and Support Ratings would require a strengthening of the support track record for both banks. A significant weakening of the ability and/or propensity of shareholders to provide support could also result in downgrades. A sale of Pravex to a weaker investor would result in a downgrade of its support-driven Long-Term Local Currency IDR and National Long-Term Rating. VRs The VRs could be downgraded if additional loan impairment recognition undermines capital positions without sufficient support being made available. Upside for banks' VRs is currently limited.

The backwardation in the market - a formation in the forward curve in which the price of metal for future delivery is below the spot price, can suggest a near-term shortage of metal and has recently steepened, prompting a wave of buying.   That pushed prices through the 16-year declining trendline at $868 an ounce, triggering a further surge that took them to their highest since early 2001 at $914.70 an ounce. Spot palladium was at $884.60 an ounce at 1345 GMT, up 3.7 percent.   The background for palladium is for good industrial demand and likely a significant market deficit this year, and on top of course you've got this speculative squeeze,  Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said.  The backwardation has got a lot steeper in the last day. Metal for immediate delivery is very tight, and that is being reflected in those forward rates moving into an even steeper backwardation.  Traders reported a reluctance to lend the metal, suggesting tightness in near-term supply. Chart patterns indicate that the metal is vulnerable to a sell-off from these elevated levels, however, technical analysts said. Gold fell for a third day, meanwhile, after British elections failed to deliver a clear majority for Prime Minister Theresa May, knocking the pound sharply lower and helping lift the dollar index to its highest since late May.   Spot gold was down 1 percent at $1,265.91 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures for August delivery were $10.90 an ounce lower at $1,268.60. Sterling-denominated gold rose to a near two-month high of 1,007.98 pounds an ounce as the British currency fell as much as 2.5 percent. Along with a drop in the euro, that helped lift the dollar half a percent versus a currency basket.  Meanwhile the FTSE share index, composed largely of companies that earn foreign currencies and benefit from a weaker pound, rose 0.5 percent, undermining potential demand for gold as a haven from risk.  A lot of the financial markets haven't moved as much as you might have thought,  Oxford Economics analyst Daniel Smith said.  The dollar's a little bit stronger, and that's going to weigh on gold,  he said.  It's not just about risk appetite, it's about what people are thinking on the dollar.  Among other precious metals, silver was down 0.8 percent to $17.23 an ounce, while platinum was 0.6 percent higher at $938.80.

Sibanye spokesman James Wellsted said about 3,900 workers were striking against the company's drive to root out illegal mining from its operations, which has included the arrest of employees accused of collusion with criminal elements and a policy of not allowing any food to be taken underground. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.  The Cooke mines have been at the center of illicit activities at Sibanye's operations and Wellsted said that before this week 101 illegal miners had been arrested there and 58 employees accused of collusion had also been arrested.   Since the strike began Tuesday, 71 illegal miners have come to the surface and been arrested because they were no longer being provided with food,  Wellsted said. Illegal miners can spend weeks underground, which requires large amounts of food and water - which is why Sibanye has banned its employees from taking any food underground. Sibanye said  the strike has been associated with a significant amount of threats and intimidation  and that dismissal procedures had been started against striking employees. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said in a statement the 16 assaulted miners were its members and that four of them were in a critical condition in hospital but Sibanye could not confirm that. NUM, which is the majority union at Cooke, blamed the assaults on its arch-rival the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). A spokesman for AMCU said he could not immediately comment. A turf war for members between the two unions has triggered periodic wildcat strikes and triggered violence that has killed scores of miners over the past five years.

Previous secessionist challenges in Catalonia - a populous and wealthy region in northeastern Spain which has its own language and Barcelona as its capital - were blocked by Spain's conservative government and the Constitutional Court.  The question will be: 'Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic',  Carles Puigdemont, the head of the regional government, said. He said attempts to agree a date and the wording of the question with the Madrid government - which is vehemently opposed to allowing Catalonia to split from Spain - had failed.  We have always made very diverse offers and all of them have been rejected without any exception,  Puigdemont said. Related CoverageSpanish government says will block any independence vote in CataloniaMadrid said that it would block any attempt to hold a vote as soon as the referendum announcement was formally rubber-stamped by Catalan authorities.  That referendum will not take place because it is illegal,  government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told a news conference.  This is just another strategic step that doesn't lead anywhere.   Under Article 155 of Spain's constitution, Madrid has the power to intervene in the running of Catalonia's regional government, forcing it to drop the vote. This could involve sending in the police or suspending the regional government's authority to rule. FILE PHOTO: People hold Catalan separatist flags, known as  Esteladas , during a gathering to protest against legal challenges made by Spain's government against pro-independence Catalan politicians, in Barcelona, Spain, November 13, 2016.Albert GeaBut this is widely seen as a last resort move and many analysts believe the clash will instead culminate in months of legal wrangling and possibly regional elections in Catalonia. The independence drive gathered strength during a recent recession, sparking mass demonstrations in favour of splitting from Spain. Some in the region say they now want to vote on their sovereignty come what may.   It doesn't matter if they block it, they're not going to be able to this time because we've had enough,  said Isabel Fernandez, a retired hairdresser sitting at a cafe in Barcelona. The 65-year-old came to live in Catalonia when she was 11 from central Spain and said she would be in favour of secession.      Pro-independence campaigners staged a symbolic ballot in 2014, months after Scots voted to stay in the United Kingdom, and which was organised by volunteers to get around court restrictions following a legal block by Madrid.  Some 2 million people voted in favour of secession in that non-binding ballot, though turnout was relatively low. A majority of people in Catalonia favour holding a referendum, according to opinion polls, although far fewer support splitting from Spain.  The last poll showed that 44.3 percent backed a split from Spain, while 48.5 percent want to continue with the status quo.  I believe in the right to vote - but with regards to independence, no one has ever really convinced me of the benefits,  said Antonio Piera as he waited for a bus in central Barcelona.

The increases in accidents and medical costs are partly the result of increased ridership overall, the researchers write in the journal Injury Prevention, but the higher cost per accident is mainly driven by larger numbers of riders over age 45 and more street and highway crashes that may involve cars.  “We advocate for cycling, as the proven health benefits certainly outweigh the potential health risks,” said senior author Dr. Benjamin Breyer of the University of California, San Francisco. “Our hope is that by quantifying these costs it will help to spur discussion and policy surrounding infrastructure for safe cycling,” Breyer told Reuters Health by email. Past research has shown that the number of bicycle-related accidents leading to hospital admission has risen dramatically, the researchers write.  To determine how medical and quality of life costs related to bike crashes are evolving, the study team used data collected between 1997 and 2013 on adult bicycle injuries.  The data on non-fatal crashes came from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System while the fatal crash data was from the National Vital Statistics System. The research team also used cost estimates from the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Injury Cost Model to determine costs of work missed and quality of life lost due to crashes. They found that 3.8 million non-fatal adult bicycle injuries and just under 10,000 deaths were reported between 1997 and 2013.  The total cost of bicycle injuries over the study period was $ 209 billion for nonfatal injuries and $28 billion for bike-related deaths.  The number of non-fatal biking injuries increased by about 6,500 each year and the total costs rose by an average of $789 million annually. But the injury costs per mile traveled by bike fell from $2.85 in 2001 to $2.35 in 2009. Overall, the costs of nonfatal biking injuries rose by nearly 140 percent, from $9.3 billion in 1997 to $22.4 billion in 2013.  Over the study period, the share of costs attributed to riders over age 45 rose steadily by about 1.6 percent each year. Bicycle-related deaths also increased for people over 45 and decreased for those under 45. In addition, crashes occurring on streets or highways played an increasing role, with their share of the total costs rising by 0.8 percent each year.  “Encouraging people to use bicycles must occur along with building safer cycling infrastructure such as cycle tracks and better street lighting,” said Morteza Asgarzadeh, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. “Bicyclists, especially the older sub-populations, should become well-informed about the risks they take by using bicycles,” Asgarzadeh told Reuters Health by email. Although building biking infrastructure is expensive, it could ultimately help bring down costs due to crashes, Breyer noted. “In fact, we could build cycling infrastructure in one-sixth of the entire U.S. for the same cost of all these injuries in 10 years,” Breyer said. Asgarzadeh advised cyclists to be vigilant and drivers to watch out for bikes and give them room on the road. “While bicycling has many health benefits, injuries can be costly and lengthy, especially for people over 40. Prevention is still the best and least expensive way to tackle the issue,” Asgarzadeh said. Breyer added that all cyclists should wear helmets. “The health benefits of cycling certainly outweigh the potential drawbacks. Many, many people cycle every day injury free,” he said.

Hundreds of people have been killed and more than a million displaced in Congo's Greater Kasai region since fighting broke out last August between a local militia and government forces. The violence has kept at least 150,000 children in the region out of the classroom, while more than 600 primary and secondary schools have been damaged by attacks, UNICEF said. Some schools have been occupied by fighters, leaving pupils and teachers unwilling or unable to return, and others are being used as emergency shelter for families uprooted by the violence.  Schools should be safe places where children can learn and begin to recover from the stress of the displacement or the memories of what they might have seen,  said Tajudeen Oyewale, UNICEF's acting representative in Congo.  Returning to the classroom can give children a small sense of normality in troubled times,  he said in a statement.  More than one in 10 children of primary school age in Greater Kasai have seen their education disrupted by violence, and many schools have been shut for several months, UNICEF said.  Ethnic violence in Congo, Africa's second-largest country, has spread and worsened since December when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate. The total number of displaced throughout Congo has more than doubled to 3.7 million since August 2016, with 1.3 million of them uprooted within the Kasai region, according to the U.N. Office for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The U.N.'s human rights chief called on Friday for an international investigation into massacres and other crimes committed in Kasai, where at least 42 mass graves were found. The government had said it would accept U.N. assistance but wanted to retain control of the inquiry in response to a Thursday deadline by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein for Congo to agree to a joint probe.  But in his statement on Friday, Zeid said the government  response to date falls short  and urged the U.N. Human Rights Council, which is holding a session until June 23, to act.

Nigeria has more than 60 million barrels of unsold crude, traders of its oil said, surpassing the level reached when global oversupply peaked two years ago. More export plans are a week away, likely bringing more than 50 million extra barrels.  Libya, meanwhile, is pouring nearly triple the amount of crude into global markets compared with last year. Few expected the two nations' output to rebound so quickly, and it could scupper OPEC's plans to lift oil prices out of a nearly three-year-long slump.  The 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries two weeks ago extended a deal struck in December with several non-member oil producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from levels seen late last year. But OPEC also renewed exemptions for Libya and Nigeria, which have struggled with output-sapping internal conflict. Those struggles, however, are abating.   They've added 600,000 barrels per day between the two of them  since the original deal was struck, said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects.  And that's half the OPEC cuts.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) this week lifted force majeure on Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months and cementing the addition of some 250,000 bpd to world markets.  Libyan oil production hit its highest since October 2014 at 835,000 bpd this month, despite the brief shutdown of Sharara, the country's largest oilfield, due to protests.  Despite this, OPEC sources said calls to bring Libya or Nigeria into the cuts never garnered enough support. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said this month it was too early for those countries to be considered for output curbs. But the excess is palpable – and it's pouring straight into the Atlantic Basin, home of the physical crude grades that underpin the global Brent benchmark.   In a physical sense, it's pretty dire,  one West African oil trader said.  Everything is on offer, and everything is pumping.  Traders said some Mediterranean refiners - typically reliable consumers - were reselling their oil.   A Mediterranean trader said that while Libya  is not a totally reliable source , its production was  running high on several fields . There are doubts over whether the two nations will maintain their run, particularly given Libya's political problems.  But Brent futures LCOc1 are trading nearly 20 percent below their 2017 high, and more than 10 percent below the level before the May OPEC meeting.   The biggest issue is light, sweet crude,  Sen said, adding the Atlantic Basin is  awash  with it.  This is where OPEC isn't light enough on its feet ... the benchmarks are all light sweet. And the cuts are medium and sour.  Even barrels from the United States are sailing east, looking for homes in Europe and Asia and further undermining the global benchmark. The dynamic, traders and analysts said, pointed to a need for more from OPEC.  This means the rest of the group will see the call on their crude falling - it's very simple,  FGE analyst James Davis said.  They need to cut deeper in order to maintain the status quo.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Nigerian oil production rebounds    reut.rs/2sKbLOv Libya oil tanker exports    reut.rs/2sciXCM Libya oil production (mln bpd)    reut.rs/2rHYoAc ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in Dubai; Editing by Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/opec-output-excess-idUSL8N1J62HY"},

Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who plays a key role in the Greek talks, expected a  deal on the full completion of the second review  at the Eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg next week, his spokesman told Reuters. A conclusion of the second review of the 86 billion euro ($96 billion) bailout would include the unblocking of new loans for Athens, which are needed to pay debts due in July. The chief of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, is set to attend the meeting of euro zone finance ministers next week, a further sign that differences between the IMF and Greece's EU creditors are narrowing on additional debt relief measures for Athens. Some euro zone lenders, led by Germany, have linked the disbursement of new financial aid to IMF participation in the bailout program, which is in turn linked to new debt relief for Greece to improve its financial stability. In spite of the growing optimism, a meeting of euro zone representatives on Thursday did not achieve much progress, leaving key issues in the hands of finance ministers next week, two EU officials told Reuters.  There were useful further clarifications on a technical level but the topic will have to be sorted out by the ministers on 15 June in Luxembourg,  an EU official who participated to the talks said. EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis reiterated on Thursday calls to unlock funds to avoid further negative effects on the Greek economy, already weakened by months of protracted talks on new loans.

British voters dealt a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May in a snap election, wiping out her parliamentary majority, just weeks before the beginning of Brexit negotiations. May said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish party to provide political certainty. European stocks were choppy on Friday following the election result. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15 percent, while UK's blue chip FTSE 100 index gained 0.74 percent. Analysts, however, said the impact from the election on the U.S. market would be limited.  The UK election is a UK event and there is no direct economic impact from that on the U.S. economy,  said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.  Investors are more concerned about Trump and the perception of what he can and can't get passed legislatively in regards to tax reform. The last thing the Republicans want to do is head to the mid-term election in 2018 without any major legislative accomplishments.  Wall Street ended mostly flat on Thursday after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony was seen by investors as having no smoking gun that could affect Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs.

Sibanye spokesman James Wellsted said about 3,900 workers were striking against the company's drive to root out illegal mining from its operations, which has included the arrest of employees accused of collusion with criminal elements and a policy of not allowing any food to be taken underground. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.  The Cooke mines have been at the center of illicit activities at Sibanye's operations and Wellsted said that before this week 101 illegal miners had been arrested there and 58 employees accused of collusion had also been arrested.   Since the strike began Tuesday, 71 illegal miners have come to the surface and been arrested because they were no longer being provided with food,  Wellsted said. Illegal miners can spend weeks underground, which requires large amounts of food and water - which is why Sibanye has banned its employees from taking any food underground. Sibanye said  the strike has been associated with a significant amount of threats and intimidation  and that dismissal procedures had been started against striking employees. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said in a statement the 16 assaulted miners were its members and that four of them were in a critical condition in hospital but Sibanye could not confirm that. NUM, which is the majority union at Cooke, blamed the assaults on its arch-rival the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). A spokesman for AMCU said he could not immediately comment.

Voters dealt May a devastating blow in the snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil.  Following are some scenarios for Brexit: Brexit Talks Formal Brexit talks were due to start on June 19, just under two years ahead of a British exit due in March 2019. But May has no majority and British politics is now deadlocked, meaning talks could be delayed. While May remains prime minister until a new government is formed, she does not have a clear mandate for her interpretation of Brexit that includes limits on immigration and leaving the single market.      Theresa May arrogantly gambled with our Brexit and blew it,  said a spokesman for the Leave.EU pro-Brexit campaign.  We demand fresh leadership immediately.    Germany said there was no time to lose on negotiating Brexit because time was ticking. France said the election result would not call into question Britain's decision to exit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Brexit talks should go ahead as planned.  Given that Britain has already triggered the formal divorce talks, it is unclear what mechanism could be used to delay the negotiations. Brexit Hard or Soft? If May forms a minority government with support from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), then she would enter Brexit talks heavily dependent on one side of the divide in Northern Ireland and on the eurosceptic wing of her own party. Her ability to drive Brexit reforms through parliament is sharply diminished. With less room for manoeuvre, she may be forced to reject compromises proposed by Brussels and drive a harder bargain.  The likely narrowness of the majority will give an ability for any small grouping of Conservative MPs to potentially block legislation,  JPMorgan said.  She warned EU ambassadors in January that attempts to punish Britain would be an  act of calamitous self-harm  for EU countries and repeatedly told voters during the campaign that she would be prepared to walk away from talks without a deal. A disorderly Brexit with no deal would spook financial markets, tarnish London's reputation as one of the world's top two financial centres and sow chaos through the economies of Britain and the EU by dislocating trading relationships.  The hung parliament makes both a 'soft' Brexit (staying in the Single Market) and a chaotic Brexit (no deal) more likely than before, potentially even a second referendum,  Citi said in a research note. Still,  'hard-but-smooth' Brexit would remain our base case,  Citi said.  Will Brexit Happen? May has insisted that Brexit means Brexit but it is unclear how long she will remain in power or whether another British election will be called.  If May resigns, the negotiations could be delayed by months due to the leadership contest, potentially new elections and even another process to design the UK’s negotiation strategy,  Citi said. If talks are delayed for long - and if British political turmoil continues - then the timetable for Brexit will slip while uncertainty could undermine economic confidence. Before her defeat, May said she wanted to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. Corbyn, who voted against EU membership in 1975 but said he voted for membership in 2016, told voters the issue of Brexit had been settled. He wants a trade deal and a guarantee that EU worker rights be preserved as part of any Brexit agreement.  Whatever happens Theresa May is toast – it is just a matter of time,  Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said.  Quite frankly I don’t know what’s going to happen.  But Farage said he feared Corbyn could somehow manage to form a minority government that would allow a second Brexit referendum. The Liberal Democrats, whose votes in parliament could help sustain a Labour government, campaigned on the position that Britons should be able to vote again on the terms of the final EU deal, and stay in the bloc if the deal was rejected. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has argued that Scotland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU last year, should have the right to hold an independence referendum at the end of the Brexit process.  As a Brexiteer who believes in it with all his heart and soul, my fear is that Corbyn forms a coalition with the SNP and a few Lib Dems and we look down the barrels of a second referendum in a few years time,  Farage said.

There was concern that a weak minority administration and a possible leadership challenge to May after her electoral gamble backfired might mean further delay to the start of talks scheduled for June 19. But the prime minister said her new government would now prepare for discussions in 10 days time. However, Guenther Oettinger, the German member of the EU executive, was among those warning that a weak British leader may be a problem once talks start.  We need a government that can act,  he told German radio.  With a weak negotiating partner, there's a danger the negotiations will turn out badly.  Oettinger's boss, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, said his Brexit negotiating team under Michel Barnier was ready:  The clock is ticking,  Juncker said. Barnier sounded conciliatory:  Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready,  he tweeted.  Timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal.  Donald Tusk, the former Polish premier who will oversee the process as chair of EU national leaders' summits, also stressed there was  no time to lose  and a need for London and Brussels to cooperate to minimize disruption for people, businesses and governments across Europe when Britain walks out in 22 months.  Our shared responsibility and urgent task now is to conduct the negotiations ... in the best possible spirit, securing the least disruptive outcome,  said Tusk, who warned last month that emotions stirred up on either side of the English Channel during the British election campaign were jeopardizing agreement. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was quick to scotch a suggestion Britain might do a U-turn and ask to stay in the bloc - something that would need EU agreement - and a Commission spokesman resisted a barrage of questions at a press briefing on whether the Union might agree to extend the two-year deadline. Related CoverageEU tells May 'no time to lose' on Brexit talksEU's Juncker urges London not to delay Brexit talksBrexit forever? How May's failed election gamble changes BrexitFew Europeans voiced much sympathy for May. Some compared her to her predecessor David Cameron, who sought to silence Eurosceptic fellow Conservatives by calling the referendum on EU membership which ended his career and shocked Europe.  Yet Another Own Goal   Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,  tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the liberal former Belgian premier who is the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit process. German conservative Markus Ferber, an EU lawmaker involved in discussions on access to EU markets for Britain's financial sector, was scathing:  At the most untimely point,  he said,  The British political system is in total disarray. Instead of strong and stable leadership we witness chaos and uncertainty.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the Conservative Party's Headquarters after Britain's election in London, June 9, 2017.Peter NichollsMay, who had campaigned against Brexit last year, delivered her terms for withdrawal on March 29 that included a clean break from the EU single market. She then called a snap election hoping for a big majority to strengthen her negotiating hand. That was also the broadly desired outcome in Brussels, where leaders believed that a stronger May would be better able to cut compromise deals with the EU and resist pressure from hardline pro-Brexit factions in her party to walk out without a deal. European leaders have largely given up considering the possibility that Britain might change its mind and ask to stay, something May made clear was not her intention. Most now appear to prefer that the bloc's second-biggest economy leave smoothly and quickly. Having recovered from last year's shock, Germany, France and other powers see Brexit as a chance to tighten EU integration without the awkward British.  As news of British mayhem broke, Juncker was launching a new push for an expanded EU defense project which Britain has long opposed, fearing a clash with the U.S.-led NATO alliance. Fear of Collapse A breakdown in negotiations could mean Britain ceasing to be an EU member without having in place the legal agreements that would avoid a chaotic limbo for people and businesses. That would also make it improbable that Britain could secure the rapid free trade agreement it wants with the EU after it leaves. In a note to clients, UBS wrote that a breakdown in talks was now more likely and would make it harder to reach a trade deal:  A tighter political balance could make it easier for Eurosceptics ... to prevent the government from offering the compromises needed to secure a trade deal.  Barnier aims to start with talks on residence rights for expatriates, on how much Britain will owe the Union on departure and on EU-UK border arrangements in Northern Ireland. He hopes outline agreements on those issues by the end of this year can open the way for discussion on a future trade deal. However, May and her allies have questioned the EU's negotiating proposals. May's reappointment and determination to soldier on without a clear majority has muted talk of a different ruling coalition taking power with a mission to seek a  softer  Brexit than May is pursuing, possibly seeking to remain in the single market. While the other 27 states would quite possibly be willing to extend to Britain the same kind of access to EU markets they offer to Norway or Switzerland, they have made clear that would mean Britain continuing to pay into the EU budget and obey EU rules, including on free migration across the bloc, while no longer having any say in how the Union's policies are set.  Maybe there won’t be a hard Brexit,  Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende said.  Maybe Britain will have to show greater flexibility in the negotiations.  But EU officials question how any British government could persuade voters to accept a Norway-style package and so would be wary of starting down the path of negotiating it for fear of ending up without a deal that both sides could ratify in 2019.

Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that protects a woman's right to abortion. Abortion rights advocates on Friday cheered the move by Governor John Carney Jr., who a day earlier approved the bill to codify at the state level provisions of the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision protecting a woman's right to abortion.  We applaud Governor Carney for sending a strong message that state policymakers will protect women's access to critical reproductive health services in the face of threats at the federal level,  said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion.  This new law is important because it says to women that you are important, that you have the ability to decide when to have a child and the state supports you in making the decision that is best for you and your family,  said Elizabeth Nash, an analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy. Abortion opponents had lobbied against the legislation.  You can codify abortion all you want but you are still codifying the murder of an unborn child,  Delaware Right to Life spokeswoman Moira Sheridan said before the bill was signed into law. Carney's signature of the law on Thursday came just days after the state House voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to pass the bill, which was passed by the state Senate 11-7 on May 9. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats and Carney is a Democrat. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it. In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate.

The combination of a lack of economic momentum and the heightened uncertainty about how Prime Minister Theresa May can advance her plans for Brexit might prompt her new government to relax its grip on spending, some analysts said. Industrial output rose 0.2 percent on the month in April after falling for three months. It was much weaker than a forecast 0.8 percent, and over a three-month period it contracted for the first time since November, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. Manufacturing, which is part of overall industrial output, also saw output rise 0.2 percent in April, compared with a forecast of 0.9 percent in the Reuters poll. The construction sector was much weaker than expected too. After last year's shock decision by voters to pull Britain out of the European Union, Britain is now facing more political upheaval after May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority.  There is clearly a risk that today's election result causes growth to weaken towards the end of the second quarter,  Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said.  That said, this is unlikely to spell disaster since the economy has proved pretty resilient to political uncertainty in the recent past.  Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2017, making it the worst performer among the Group of Seven nations after outpacing its peers in 2016, despite the shock of the Brexit vote. As well as rising inflation and slow wage growth weighing on consumers, the economy now has to contend with heightened political uncertainty about Britain's ability to proceed with its plan to leave the European Union. Britain's economy grew by a below-par 0.2 percent in the three months to May, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: A worker uses a soldering iron at the Mec Com Ltd factory near Stafford, central England December 15, 2016.Phil Noble/File Photo The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung parliament into sharp relief,  NIESR director Jagjit Chadha said.  People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages.  Boe Back in Action? Investors are watching closely to see if May responds to the increase in support for the opposition Labour Party by relaxing her grip on public spending, something which would boost the economy. Chris Iggo, fixed income chief investment officer at AXA Investment Managers, said that if the government failed to boost the economy, the Bank of England might resort to reviving its massive bond-buying program again. The BoE said before the election that it expected some of the impact of slower consumer spending would be eased by stronger exports driven by the pound's fall since the Brexit vote last year. ONS data showed on Friday that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed by more than expected to 10.4 billion pounds ($13.2 billion) in April.  But the smaller deficit was due to a sharp fall in goods imports with volumes in monthly terms down more than 5 percent in April, almost reversing a surge in March. Exports edged down. Over the three months to April, goods exports rose 2.1 percent while imports were flat. But the ONS said there was no sign yet that exporters were taking advantage of sterling's weakness to cut their foreign-currency prices and strengthen their competitive advantage.  Britain won't enjoy a trade boost until exporters reduce margins and seek greater market share instead,  Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. The ONS said construction output in April fell by 1.6 percent from March and was down 0.6 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent on the month but a fall of 0.4 percent compared with April last year.

With no clear winner emerging from Thursday's election, a wounded May signaled she would fight on. Her Labour rival Jeremy Corbyn, once written off by his opponents as a no-hoper, said she should quit. In the aftermath of one of the most sensational nights in British electoral history, politicians and commentators called her decision to hold the election a colossal mistake and derided her performance on the campaign trail. Below are reactions from British business leaders. Cbi:  This is a serious moment for the UK economy. The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy,  the business lobby group's Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said in a statement. Institute of Directors:  Both sides of the aisle must swallow their pride and work on a cross-party basis on the most important issues. The last thing business leaders need is a parliament in paralysis, and the consequences for British businesses and for the UK as an investment destination would be severe,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the business managers' organization. London First:  Business is coping with extraordinary levels of uncertainty, but this cannot continue. We need adults round the table quickly to chart the way forward,  CEO Jasmine Whitbread said in a statement.  National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers:  Business owners need to be reassured that the economy remains a key focus and is not forgotten amid the political infighting that's surely set to come,  it said. City of London Corporation:  In these negotiations with the EU we would hope any new Government recognizes the importance of two-way market access, a transitional agreement and the ability of talented people across Europe to get access to the best jobs,  Chairman Catherine McGuinness said in a statement.   We cannot risk harming London's position as the world’s leading financial center or damaging the financial services industry, which supports 2.2 million jobs in the UK and generates 72 billion pounds ($92 billion)in tax income.  Federation of Master Builders:  The construction sector is particularly vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence brought about by political uncertainty and therefore it's crucial that this uncertainty is minimized,  FMB Chief Executive Brian Berry said in a statement.   For the construction sector, our greatest concern is that the flow of migrant workers might be reduced too quickly and before we are able to put in place a framework for training sufficient UK workers to replace them.  SAVILLS (SVS.L):  The UK housing market has been shaped by political and economic uncertainty for some time.  This could be accentuated in the short term, though once the dust settles, it will be broader economic trends that will dictate housing market performance.   Our forecasts have already taken account of prevailing political and economic uncertainty and assume two years of extremely low house price growth during Brexit negotiations.   Renewable Energy Association:  The renewable and clean tech industry has been waiting for nearly a year for the release of the Clean Growth Plan and it's now critical for us that we have a clear commitment and direction, no matter what shade of government.  Tech Uk:  Decisions that will have to be taken over the next five years will shape the UK for generations to come,  CEO Julian David said in a statement.  It is vital that the UK remains an open and dynamic economy in which tech businesses of all sizes can be the engine of inclusive growth.  Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders:  It's important a government is established as quickly as possible to provide political and economic stability,  said Chief Executive Mike Hawes.   UK Automotive is vitally important to the UK economy and jobs across the country and now more than ever we need strong engagement by government with the industry, both on the domestic agenda and in European negotiations, to secure future growth and investment in our sector.   Aston Martin:  We cannot stress strongly enough the need for rapid and decisive policy direction to ensure that business can continue to invest for the long term growth and ensure the global competitiveness of the British economy,  the British luxury carmaker's Chief Executive Andy Palmer said in a statement. Jaguar Land Rover:  Jaguar Land Rover looks forward to working with the new government and will support all proposals aimed at free and fair trade and increased global competitiveness.  Rural Landowner Association Cla:  Immediate attention will inevitably be on the implications of this result for securing a Brexit deal that will work in the long-term interests of agriculture and the wider economy. We remain confident that the right deal can be done,  President Ross Murray said in a statement. London Central Portfolio:  It is anticipated that transactions will continue to fall in prime central London whilst investors assimilate the new situation, particularly at the luxury end and in the new build sector, already battered through the introduction of new residential taxes,  it said.   For the domestic housing market, outside prime central London, the recent evidence of a downturn by most data analysts, due to concerns over a weakening UK economic position and rising inflation, is unlikely to be reversed in light of the current events.  WILLIAM HILL (WMH.L):  We are monitoring developments following the election result. As and when the Department for Culture, Media & Sport team re-engage with the Triennial process, we will continue to work with both the department and ministers as appropriate.

The decision by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Baharain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties this week threatens to hurt Qatar's trade balance, suck deposits from its banks and push out foreign investment. Reflecting this threat, the riyal fell on Friday in the offshore forwards market QAR1Y=W to its lowest level against the dollar since December 2015, when low oil and gas prices raised concern about all the Gulf economies. But the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter is so rich that it could offset the threatened capital outflows by liquidating just a portion of its financial reserves. And as long as it can keep exporting gas, its current account balance is unlikely to go deep into the red. That means the riyal's spot market peg of 3.64 to the dollar QAR= is probably safe for the foreseeable future. Any decision to change the peg would essentially be political rather than economic. At their lowest on Friday, forwards prices implied riyal depreciation of under 2 percent over the next 12 months. Many economists at financial institutions in the Gulf decline to discuss Qatar publicly because of the political tensions, but privately they say they expect Qatar to defend its currency successfully.  We are not looking for the Qatari peg to break,  wrote Chris Turner, global head of strategy at Europe's ING, though he called the pressure on the riyal unprecedented and said other countries' experience in the past 25 years indicated that if the peg did break, the riyal could fall at least 20 percent. Assets Cutting Qatar's credit rating to AA- this week, Standard & Poor's put the government's liquid external assets at 170 percent of gross domestic product, or about $295 billion, based on the International Monetary Fund's estimate of Qatari GDP. Capital outflows could come in several forms. Foreign investors have already started to sell Qatari equities; a complete pull-out could mean an outflow of nearly 10 percent of the stock market, or about $15 billion. Qatari banks had 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) of foreign liabilities in March, most in the form of loans and deposits from foreign banks. Less than half that is from banks in other Gulf states.   Some Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already started to cut their exposure to Qatar, and they could cut aggressively if the diplomatic crisis continues and their governments order them to do so. Riyadh may also try to force foreign banks to choose between the Saudi and Qatari markets. If foreign banks cut two-thirds of their exposure to Qatar in coming months, that could mean an outflow of over $80 billion. Then there is the current account balance. Before the crisis, the IMF predicted firm oil and gas prices would help Qatar run a surplus of $1.2 billion this year, rising gradually to $4.7 billion in 2020, against a deficit of $3.5 billion last year. Ten percent of Qatar's exports, which the IMF has estimated at $70 billion this year, are to countries that have blocked trade, S&P; calculated; import costs are likely to rise because of the closure of the land border with Saudi Arabia.  Costs may also rise as Qatar's isolation forces it to pay higher wages to the foreign professionals and workers who make up the vast majority of the population of about 2.6 million. The result could be a current account deficit of several billion dollars annually while the crisis lasts - a drain on resources, but not a decisive one considering Doha's assets. Because of its small size and the fact that many major banks have links to the government, Qatar would probably find it easier than most countries to impose capital controls if that became necessary to prevent residents from sending large amounts of money abroad. Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said he did not expect the riyal's peg to break. Even Riyadh, which also fixes its currency to the dollar to maintain investor confidence and limit volatility in its oil revenues, might want to avoid driving Qatar to take that step.  After all, if Qatar is forced to devalue, fresh concerns may be raised about other dollar pegs in the region.

Now the tech entrepreneur is vying for his seat in a battle that embodies France's political upheaval. Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2r9l3qw It is a contest that pits a white, 65-year-old career politician against a 33-year-old son of Moroccan immigrants who has never held elected office - a test of the public desire for political renewal promised by centrist President Emmanuel Macron. Mahjoubi, a newly-appointed junior minister, is running on a ticket for Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party. Opinion polls show the party on course to win the biggest majority in parliament in decades, upending mainstream parties only a year after its creation.  On its candidate list are seasoned lawmakers and political novices who include a bullfighter and mathematician.   We're younger, we're campaigning differently, we are what France looks like,  Mahjoubi told Reuters as he canvassed support in his working class constituency in northern Paris.  Macron won the presidency a month ago. He needs a majority to push through his reforms, including overhauling labor laws to make hiring and firing easier, cutting corporate tax, and investing billions of euros in renewable energy and job training. In Mahjoubi's constituency, as across France, Macron's promise to clean up politics and be neither right nor left is striking a chord with voters fed up with high unemployment and a political elite perceived as out of touch.   We want to give the president a majority so he can work,  said voter Regina Biladi, a 46-year-old civil servant. The two-round legislative election takes place on June 11 and 18.

In another telling sign of the shifting political landscape, Mahjoubi's chief challenger may not be Cambadelis but a young teacher from Jean-Luc Melenchon's far-left France Unbowed party. Support for Melenchon surged during his presidential campaign as the Socialist Party of former president Francois Hollande fought for its survival.  Melenchon won 30 percent of votes in Mahjoubi's constituency in the first round of the presidential vote, just ahead of Macron. Macron went on to win some nine in ten votes there in the run-off against the far-right's Marine Le Pen. While opinion polls show conservative party The Republicans polling second nationally in the legislative vote, they are weak in northern Paris.  The emergence of Macron and his LREM has threatened the unity of the Socialist Party and The Republicans like in no other election cycle. His rivals have been left warning voters that a landslide majority for Macron would be a danger to democracy.  We shouldn't have a monopolistic party,  former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve said as he joined Cambadelis on the campaign trail.   The French people are hesitating, some want to give him (Macron) a chance, others want a balance of powers. Where will the balance lie, no one knows,  Cambadelis said. He pointed out to voters that Mahjoubi, an unknown until he led Macron's efforts to fend off cyber attacks during the presidential campaign, will not sit in parliament if he wins but stay in government and pass his legislative duties to a deputy.

An election that produced no clear winner has knocked sterling lower, nearly a year after it was pummelled by a UK vote to leave the European Union. A brutal EU exit and a second Scottish independence referendum may now be a little less likely. But that is not a good enough reason to stock up on pounds anytime soon. Sterling was the worst hit of all UK assets on Friday after Prime Minister Theresa May’s parliamentary majority was wiped out. It fell more than 2 percent to below $1.27 and lost nearly as much ground against the euro. The currency is more than 10 percent above the lows that it set against the dollar after the EU referendum in June 2016 but its near-term prospects are blighted by the political uncertainty that investors detest. In the currency options market, the preference to sell sterling for either dollars or euro in the future grew more marked. Granted, pain now may spare the pound greater grief later on. A weak Conservative government is less apt to take the hard-line in Brexit negotiations that May had promised to adopt if she won a big majority. That reduces the risk of an economically-damaging withdrawal from the bloc – the worst case scenario for the pound. Also, losses for the Scottish National Party make another vote on secession less likely, removing another potential risk to the pound. But the silver lining isn’t quite shiny enough to distract investors from the pound’s immediate problems. First, policy uncertainty could weigh on investment when growth is already slowing. Second, a renewed slide in sterling will make imported goods more expensive and bolster inflation, which is already outstripping wage growth to the detriment of consumers. Third, foreigners may become warier of buying gilts if a fragile government, hostage to vested interests, spends more to cling to power. Even if Brexit negotiations aren’t bumpy, sterling’s path will be.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Canada's job growth accelerated in May at its fastest pace in eight months, Statistics Canada said. Employers added 54,500 jobs, handily topping economists' forecast for a gain of 11,000.                   It is just another piece of information that suggests that the Bank of Canada could be tightening maybe a little bit earlier than markets are pricing,  said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.     Chances of an interest rate increase this year rose to nearly 30 percent from 22 percent before the jobs report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                On Thursday, Bank of Canada Governor Poloz said he is comforted by recent signs of economic strength even as the central bank warned that rising consumer debt levels and an unbalanced housing market have raised household vulnerabilities.                  At 9:20 a.m. ET (1320 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3461 to the greenback, or 74.29 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3454, while it touched its weakest since June 2 at C$1.3545.     In other domestic data, industrial capacity rose to its highest level since 2007 in the first quarter, lifted by the manufacturing and construction sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed.                           Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, steadied after steep falls earlier in the week under pressure from widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts led by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to tighten the market.           U.S. crude        prices were up 0.26 percent at $45.76 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        climbed against a basket of major currencies, helped by a bounce in bond yields as risk aversion ebbed following the testimony of former FBI director James Comey.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 6.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.75 percent and the benchmark 10-year             falling 33 Canadian cents to yield 1.454 percent.     The 10-year yield touched its highest since May 26 at 1.459 percent, while the gap between it and the U.S. 10-year yield narrowed 1.3 basis points to a spread of -76.4 basis points as Canadian bonds underperformed.

The Outlook is Negative. Its Viability Rating (VR) was affirmed at 'b'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The affirmation follows a periodic review of the bank. The European Commissions (EC) in May 2016 ordered the privatisation of the bank by February 2018 in an open, transparent, non-discriminatory tender process or, if the sale is unsuccessful and HSH's viability not confirmed, a wind-down of the bank. HSH initiated the sales process in January 2017 and received non-binding bids from a range of investors with the process ongoing. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING The bank's IDRs, senior debt rating and SR are driven by support from HSH's owners comprising the federal states of Schleswig-Holstein (AAA) and Hamburg (AAA), the regional savings banks and ultimately the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe (SFG, A+/Stable), including the Sparkassen (savings banks) and Landesbanken-shared institutional protection fund (Sicherungseinrichtung). HSH's Long-Term IDR is five notches below SFG's Long-Term IDR, which reflects Fitch's view that the bank is strategic to its owners, but also its weak company profile, which in Fitch's opinion makes support less likely given the private investor test under EU legislation. HSH is currently in the midst of a privatisation process and we expect a clearer picture to emerge on final bidders over the coming months. Fitch believes that the pool of potential buyers is limited given HSH's overall weak asset quality and profitability, but under the terms of the EU agreement HSH could also be sold in parts. The agreement requires a positive, state aid-free sale price and a sale will be subject to the EC's assessment of viability of the new entity and its final approval. If the privatisation is successful HSH's regional state owners will no longer be majority shareholders and would only be allowed to own a combined share of up to 25% for a period of up to four years, and following a privatisation Fitch would likely consider the public sector owners' stakes in HSH no longer a strategic investment. If a sale is unsuccessful, the bank will have to cease new business activities and manage the assets with a view of winding them down. In this scenario, we expect that the existing owners will have financial and reputational incentives to ensure that the wind-down is managed in a way that senior unsecured creditors do not incur losses. The Negative Outlook on HSH's reflects our expectation that a sale could result in a downgrade of the IDRs if the new owners have a lower ability or propensity to provide support than HSH's current federal state owners. VR HSH's VR reflects the bank's weak stand-alone credit profile, still burdened by legacy exposures, despite an overall risk reduction in recent years and particularly in 2016. HSH has re-allocated certain business segments to the non-core bank to strengthen the core bank's business and credit profile and profitability metrics. This included a partial carve-out of the shipping portfolio to the non-core bank, which in turn has to bear higher costs. We believe risk reduction efforts over the last two years and stronger impaired loan coverage had a positive impact on the risk profile of the overall bank, because of measures undertaken in preparation for the sales process, but the viability of its business model remains uncertain. Commitments to deleverage the bank's legacy portfolio have led to a moderate improvement in assets quality, and we foresee further declines in the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in 2017 due to committed asset sales. But HSH's NPL ratio at end-2016 was still the weakest among peers. A decline in risk-weighted assets resulted in an improved fully loaded CET 1 ratio of 13.4% at end-2016, in line with higher-rated peers and its leverage ratio is well above peers'. However, HSH's capitalisation remains burdened by high net impaired loans. The projected sale of a second tranche of assets in the amount of about EUR1.6 billion as part of the EU commitment in 2H17 will underpin an adequate capitalisation into 2018 and provide a sufficient buffer to its current SREP regulatory requirements. Nevertheless HSH's capitalisation will remain vulnerable to further asset quality deterioration in the shipping portfolio and potential negative rating migration even though charter rates improved in 1Q17. HSH's profitability is weak due to a decline in interest-earning assets and high restructuring costs. However, due to a guarantee mechanism EUR156 million of loan loss provisions were released at end-2016, which allowed HSH to report a net profit of EUR121 million. We believe that HSH's profitability is unlikely to materially improve until the bank's future business model has been decided in the event of a privatisation of the bank. HSH has reached its funding targets for 2016, driven by strong covered bond issuance and also unsecured and asset-based funding. Its liquidity metrics remained solid and we expect uninterrupted funding through 2017 in the absence of unexpected shocks to investor confidence during the privatisation process. DCR AND DEPOSIT RATINGS We view HSH as a notable derivative counterparty in light of the hedging activities inherent in its business model. We have aligned HSH's DCR and Deposit Ratings with the bank's respective Long- and Short-term IDRs. In Fitch's opinion, debt buffers do not afford any obvious incremental probability of default benefit over and above the support benefit already factored into their IDRs. STATE-GUARANTEED/GRANDFATHERED SECURITIES The 'AAA' rating of HSH's state-guaranteed/grandfathered senior debt, subordinated debt and market-linked securities reflect the credit strength of the guarantor - the federal state of Schleswig Holstein and the City of Hamburg - and our view that they will honour their guarantees. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING HSH's IDRs, senior debt rating and SR are primarily sensitive to the likelihood of a successful privatisation. HSH's IDRs and Support Rating would only be upgraded if a new owner with a high rating and strong ability and propensity to support HSH is found. We believe that this is not impossible but view it highly unlikely. Fitch would likely place HSH's IDRs, senior debt rating and SR on Rating Watch Negative or downgrade the ratings if Fitch concludes that support from a successful buyer is not sufficiently strong to warrant an IDR of at least 'BBB-'. If the privatisation is not successful, HSH's shareholder structure will be unchanged and the bank will be wound down. In this case HSH is likely to remain a member of the protection scheme of the Landesbanken (Sicherungseinrichtung), which means that it could continue to receive support from its owners in combination with SFG to protect senior unsecured bondholders. This could result in the affirmation of its IDR at 'BBB-' if we conclude that imposing losses on senior creditors during the run-down of assets is prevented by the Sicherungseinrichtung and HSH's owners. VR An upgrade of HSH's VR would be contingent on the confirmation of the long-term sustainability of the bank's business model that will allow the bank to generate adequate profitability. Fitch believes that this would ultimately rely on its successful privatisation. A disruption of the sales process or sudden unexpected stress that would significantly undermine investor confidence in the bank and reduce HSH's chances on a successful privatisation could trigger a downgrade of its VR. We believe that in such a scenario HSH is most vulnerable to a stress on liquidity and funding. If HSH is wound-down, we would likely withdraw its VR, in line with our approach for other wind-down institutions where we believe a stand-alone assessment of the bank is not meaningful. DCR AND DEPOSIT RATING DCR and Deposit Ratings are sensitive to changes in HSH's IDRs. STATE-GUARANTEED/GRANDFATHERED SECURITIES The ratings of HSH's state-guaranteed/grandfathered senior debt, subordinated debt and market-linked securities are sensitive to changes in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the guarantors. The rating actions are as follows: HSH Nordbank AG Bank Long-Term IDR: affirmed at 'BBB-', Outlook Negative Short-Term IDR: affirmed at 'F3' Support Rating: affirmed at '2' Derivative Counterparty Rating: affirmed at 'BBB-(dcr)' Viability Rating: affirmed at 'b' Long-term senior debt, including programme ratings: affirmed at 'BBB-' Short-term senior debt: affirmed at 'F3' Long-term deposits: affirmed at 'BBB-' Short-term deposits: 'F3' State-guaranteed/grandfathered senior and subordinated debt: affirmed at 'AAA' State-guaranteed/grandfathered market-linked securities: affirmed at 'AAAemr' Senior market-linked securities: affirmed at 'BBB-emr' Contact: Primary Analyst Roger Schneider Director +49 69 768 076 242 Fitch Deutschland GmbH Neue Mainzer Strasse 46-50 60311 Frankfurt am Main Secondary Analyst Ioana Sima Associate Director +44 20 3530 1736 Committee Chairperson Christian Scarafia Senior Director +44 20 3530 1012 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com. Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments: Fitch re-classifies the hedge effect of the second loss guarantee as an offset to loan impairment charges and removes the balance sheet impact of the compensation from impaired loans reserves to better reflect the economic effect of the second loss guarantee.

The OPEC member's recession was largely caused by low oil prices and militant attacks on Niger Delta energy facilities in 2016. Oil sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. The budget must be signed by the president to become law. President Muhammadu Buhari has been on medical leave in Britain since May 7 and handed over power to his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo, in his absence.  The 2017 Appropriations Bill ... will be signed into law early next week,  said Yakubu Dogara, speaker of the House of Representatives, at an event to mark two years since parliament was convened after elections in 2015. Two presidency sources, who did not want to be named, also said the budget would be signed next week. The record 7.44 trillion naira budget passed by parliament's upper chamber on May 11 was bigger than the 7.298 trillion naira draft spending plan submitted by Buhari in December. A government official last week said the presidency and lawmakers were still in talks over the spending plan. Last year's budget, passed in May 2016, was delayed for months due to disagreements between lawmakers and the presidency over spending plans that cut the supply of government money and deepened the economic crisis.

Poland, the Baltic states and others say Nord Stream 2 would increase EU dependence on Russia's Gazprom, which already supplies about a third of the bloc's gas. Backers such as Germany say it will offer the EU cheaper supplies. The bloc wants to diversify EU gas supplies and the Commission has said the pipeline could let  a single supplier  - Russia - strengthen its position in the EU market.  Nord Stream 2 does not contribute to the (EU) Energy Union's objectives,  Energy Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said.  If the pipeline is nevertheless built, the least we have to do is to make sure that it will be operated in a transparent manner and in line with the main EU energy market rules,  he said in a statement. EU states now need to examine the proposal from Brussels, which says it wants  a special legal framework  with Moscow to ensure the bloc's energy rules apply to offshore parts of the pipeline, which starts beyond the EU's jurisdiction in Russia and goes under the Baltic Sea. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he is against expanding Nord Stream and has told the Commission any mandate they seek must be very demanding on Russia. The new pipeline, which will have capacity to pump 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year to a terminal in Germany, is expected to start operating in 2019. Construction has begun. Berlin, which dismisses questions about the legality of the plan at the EU-level, says the project is purely commercial. The Nord Stream 2 company said the Commission's plan to negotiate an agreement was unnecessary.  The German regulator already confirmed that there is no legal void that needs to be addressed,  it said in a statement. Germany's Uniper, Austria's OMV and France's Engie are working with Gazprom on the plan.

However, a negative rating action is unlikely unless there is more indication that the court may rule against Sistema on the validity of such claims and their size. Sistema strongly believes that Rosneft's claims are without merit. The amount of claims is significant and equal to more than 4.5x of dividends received by Sistema in 2016 from its operating subsidiaries. If satisfied in full, the impact on the company's leverage and its ratings is likely to be negative. The total amount of claims consists of a number of individual claims of smaller size, and the court is likely to make a decision on the merits and the size of each of the sub-claims. Sistema made a number of public statements defending its position that none of the sub-claims is merited. We believe there is no indication at this stage which side is likely to prevail, and the situation is treated as negative event risk. Any rating action will likely depend on court decisions and will take into account the potential amount and timing of cash outflows, if any. Fitch will closely follow the litigation developments. Rosneft filed claims against Sistema seeking Rub 170.6bn of damages for alleged abuse of Sistema's shareholding rights in PJSOC Bashneft (Bashneft) (BBB-/Stable), a medium-sized Russian oil company with legal registration in Russian republic of Bashkortostan (BBB-/Stable)  and currently a majority-controlled subsidiary of Rosneft, during the period when Sistema was the majority owner of Bashneft. The preliminary hearings took place at an arbitration court in Bashkortostan on 6 June whereby the amount of claims was increased from an earlier filed RUB 106.6 billion, and the government of Bashkortstan, a shareholder in Bashneft, was accepted as the co-plaintiff. The court is scheduled to proceed to hearings on the substance of this case on 27 June 2017.

Governments across Asia - most notably Hong Kong and Singapore - have launched a raft of initiatives to grab a slice of the $100 billion invested in financial technology globally but the regulatory hotchpotch is making it tough for firms to scale up, the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) said in a report on Friday.  The regulatory landscape is very fragmented and a lot of the initiatives, though well-intentioned, are not necessarily well thought through,  said Mark Austen, CEO of ASIFMA. The lobby group, which represents global banks and asset managers such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, has called on Asian regulators to coordinate better and to adopt a consistent set of best practices for fostering fintech in the region.  By not cooperating on fintech, Asian financial centers are putting themselves at a real disadvantage relative to the rest of the world: that traditional competitive dynamic and rivalry between the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore may actually in this case be a disadvantage,  said Hannah Cassidy, partner at Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong, which contributed to the report.  Investors poured $19 billion worldwide into fintech - including P2P lenders, distributed ledger technology and crowdfunding platforms - in 2016 alone and thousands of fintech start-ups continue to proliferate, according to a February report by global regulatory body the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia have launched a range of special programs to attract and foster fintech ventures, from incubators and grants, to temporary license waiver schemes, with competition fiercest between Hong Kong and Singapore.  While all these markets operate well-defined licensing and supervisory regimes for traditional financial firms including banks, brokers, insurance companies and funds, regulators are still struggling to establish clear and consistent regimes for fintech firms because they often operate innovative business models.  Cryptocurrency exchanges, for example, are licensed as money changers and regulated by the customs authority in Hong Kong but they are licensed as online shopping malls, akin to clothes retailers, in South Korea. In Singapore, the central bank has proposed regulating bitcoin exchanges as payment firms.  This makes it very expensive for fintech firms based in places with small domestic markets like Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia to expand into the broader region because they are more or less starting from scratch each time they enter a new country, said Aurelien Menant, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.com.  This is a very important issue for fintech firms in Asia,  he said, adding he would welcome tougher standardized rules for alternative currency exchanges across the region. The lack of regulatory clarity has meant some aspiring fintech firms have struggled to gain licenses in markets like Hong Kong, Reuters reported last year. (here)  We are open to cooperation with regional and global regulators on fintech,  the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement, adding it would be entering into new regulatory cooperations shortly. The SFC added it has taken a leading role in discussions around fintech within IOSCO and conducts dialogue with other watchdogs through a dedicated fintech liaison officer.  A spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the regulator has signed fintech cooperation agreements with 10 counterparties, including in Australia, India, Japan and South Korea.  “These agreements create frameworks for information sharing on fintech trends and regulatory issues, and potential joint innovation projects. They also help to create greater understanding between fintech players in different markets, with the ultimate goal of benefiting consumers and businesses,” the spokeswoman said in an email.

The 25-year-old, who arrived as world number four but can top the WTA rankings if she beats unseeded Jelena Ostapenko in Saturday's showpiece, was the pick of seven-time champion Evert before the tournament and nothing has altered her view.  I don't think Halep is going to let go of the title now,  Evert, adding her vast Roland Garros knowledge to broadcaster Eurosport's coverage, told Reuters.  She has come through adversity. She nearly didn't play because of injury, she was a set and two breaks down in the quarter-finals. She's not going to let this go,  said Evert.  She is not playing against a Serena, or a player she has lost to. She is not going to lose this title. This is her best chance ever to win a grand slam and she'll find a way.  Halep, who could become only the second Romanian woman to win a grand slam after Virginia Ruzici, now her manager, ruled on the Parisian clay in 1978, has indeed done things the hard way after a straightforward first week. She was as good as out when she trailed by a set and 5-1 against fifth seed Elina Svitolina, before grinding her way back from the brink, then soaked up some searing power in a three-set defeat of second seed Karolina Pliskova in the semis. Halep admits that might not have been possible until a change of mindset after a brief split with coach Darren Cahill, who questioned her desire after a defeat in Miami. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 8, 2017   Romania's Simona Halep celebrates winning her semi final match against Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova   Reuters / Benoit Tessier He told me many words, but it's tough to explain,  said Halep, who was beaten by Maria Sharapova in the 2014 final.  He told me that I have to play every point because every point it's important at this level. Until he told me, I thought I did not give up in matches. But I did a few times and in the most important moments,  she said.  If you give up, you don't have that chance anymore.  The break (with Cahill) was definitely very good. It woke me up a little bit and made me realize that I have to change something to be in this position. After that I've won so many matches on the clay.  Halep reached the semi-finals in Stuttgart, won the title in Madrid and reached the Rome final where she injured her ankle in a three-set defeat by Svitolina. Should she win on Saturday, she will be the first player since Justine Henin in 2005 to take a singles' title at Roland Garros after saving a match point. The unseeded Ostapenko will doubtless try and blast Halep off balance with her relentless attacking game, but the Romanian is ready for whatever the Latvian throws her way.  She's hitting very strong balls. But I will focus more on myself. I'm not focusing on her too much. It's going to be a big match, tough match. I know that. She can play her best tennis. She has nothing to lose but I'm ready.  Reporting by Martyn Herman; editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-frenchopen-women-halep-idUSKBN1901WY"},

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), social conservatives who favor Northern Ireland's continued inclusion in the United Kingdom, have enough seats to keep May in power after her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority -- just 10 days before the formal divorce talks start. But a deal between the DUP and Conservative Party would  risk destabilizing the political balance in Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. The Conservative Party's 318 lawmakers and the 10 Westminster seats of the DUP would allow May's minority government to pass legislation more easily.  We will continue to work with our friends and allies in the Democratic Unionist Party in particular,  May said on Friday outside her official Downing Street residence in London.  Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.  Jeffrey Donaldson, a DUP member of parliament, said the election outcome created the  perfect territory  to secure concessions from the Conservatives. These would be likely to include increases in funding for Northern Ireland. The party said it would be willing to negotiate with May but declined to comment on reports a deal had already been reached. While the DUP are deeply euroskeptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-call hard Brexit -- a clean break from the EU's single market -- and talks will inevitably touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland, an important plank of its election manifesto.   We want to make sure that Brexit is properly introduced and we will be the effective and possibly sole voice in parliament from Northern Ireland on Brexit,  Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP member of parliament, told BBC television.   We'll be making sure we get the best deal for all of Northern Ireland.  Irish Border? The British province's largest party was among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for Brexit and wants Britain to leave the EU's customs union, but its manifesto focused heavily on maintaining the benefits of membership. It called for a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland,  ease of trade  with the rest of the EU and a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement with the bloc once Britain leaves in 2019.  Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster addresses journalists in Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 9, 2017.Liam McBurneyThe DUP also called for a safeguarding of the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom.  It's wrong to say we're not in favor of a soft Brexit,  DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC, saying he was against a deal that would restore a  hard border  that would cause significant barriers to movement between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We want a situation where the best deal is arranged for Northern Ireland.  But Dodds said the DUP would block any attempt to give Northern Ireland a  special status  within the EU to avoid a hard border, something Irish nationalist rivals Sinn Fein is seeking.   The DUP does support proponents of hard Brexit on the scrapping of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is seen among some unionists as being more favorable to Irish nationalists than British courts. Slideshow (5 Images)United Kingdom? A deal with the Conservatives would put one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe in government. The DUP has fought to maintain tight restrictions on abortion and opposes gay marriage.  The DUP also sees Thursday's election result as a victory for pro-British unionists in the struggle with Irish nationalists. Party leader Arlene Foster described the election as  a good night for the union.  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams described his nationalist party's rise from four to seven of Northern Ireland's seats as a  historic result for the party , but it has said it will maintain its policy of not taking seats in Britain's parliament. Unionists appeared to have been sidelined when Sinn Fein pulled out of Northern Ireland's devolved assembly in January and surged at resulting regional elections, depriving Foster of her position as First Minister in the power-sharing government created by a 1998 peace deal.  This is a dramatic and significant event for Ireland,  political commentator Noel Whelan said of the election result.  Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster are now the most significant figures in Brexit talks on the island of Ireland.   The shift also threatens to deepen a crisis in regional politics in the province of 1.8 million people.  The DUP and Sinn Fein were due to restart talks on Monday on the formation of a new assembly, but a DUP deal could raise questions about the British Conservative Northern Ireland Minister James Brokenshire as an honest broker.  A deal between May and the DUP could involve her accepting demands which make a deal on the formation of a new assembly impossible. The DUP has called for former Irish nationalist militants to be denied the status of victims and for increased status for former members of the British armed services.

Growing doubts about the U.S. administration's ability to pass tax and healthcare reforms through Congress, along with weak U.S. economic data, have pushed Treasury yields to the lowest since after Donald Trump's shock election victory in November. Still, the latest poll of 100 economists conducted this week showed the Fed was certain to push interest rates up by 25 basis points to 1.00-1.25 percent at the June 13-14 meeting. The consensus view from the poll is for the central bank to follow that up with another 25 basis point increase in the third quarter to take the fed funds rate to 1.25-1.50 percent. A significant minority of economists, 22 of 49, who answered an extra question said their conviction for the Fed to raise rates again after this month had stayed the same over the past month, with only seven saying the probability had increased. The remaining 20 said chances had decreased. (For a graphic on the Fed: reut.rs/2sawFta) Traders' bets reflect a 98 percent chance of a Fed rate hike next week, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool on Friday, but their expectations have diminished for a September hike too. The Fed's own view is for two more rate hikes this year, after the central bank teed the markets up for a hike in March and delivered.  Recent U.S. data has been mixed, while inflation in particular has surprised to the downside. If this continues, the Fed's dot plot may move toward the market, rather than the other way,  noted Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The inflation outlook has been sharply downgraded compared with a poll taken just one month ago, even as the jobless rate fell further below 5 percent to a 16-year low in May. Predictions for core PCE inflation in 2017, the measure the Fed closely watches, have been cut to their lowest since polling began for this period more than two years ago. Core PCE inflation is expected to rise between 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent each quarter this year. It is unlikely to hit the Fed's 2 percent goal until at least the end of next year, the poll found. While the economy is expected to rebound in the second quarter after a dismal 1.2 percent annualized growth rate in the first, growth is expected to be well short of the more than 3 percent mooted as a target by the Trump U.S. administration. cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=best-polls The economy is forecast to expand at an annualized rate of 2.0-2.5 percent each quarter from July until the end of next year, according to the median view in the latest poll. The lowest forecast was 0.4 percent and the highest was 4.1 percent. Jim O'Sullivan, U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics and the most accurate forecaster in Reuters polls on the U.S. economy last year, took a more positive tone, arguing that the Fed is likely to look through the weaker payrolls growth in recent months.   We don't think the trend in employment growth has slowed significantly,  he said.  We continue to expect another 25 basis point hike on June 14. We expect another rate hike in September and then a pause from conventional tightening for the start of balance sheet normalization in December.

The final guidance was broadly in line with the draft published last November but was tweaked after market feedback, bringing it more into line with US leveraged lending guidelines, although the ECB guidance is viewed as tighter due to the introduction of a new definition for failed deals.  The guidance in the US and Europe is similar . . . but the ECB guidance is tighter in some respects,  said Martin Forbes, a banking partner at White & Case. The guidelines made some concessions, including allowing adjusted Ebitda and borrowers to show an ability to repay senior secured debt to a sustainable level in five to seven years rather than repaying 50% of total debt from cash flow. Certain types of deals were also excluded. Several key questions are outstanding, including the definition of total debt and the impact of the regulation on acquisition finance and banks' internal systems due to the introduction of a tough 90-day limit for syndicating deals, according to a report by White & Case. Under the final guidance, the definition of total debt now includes additional debt that loan agreements normally allow. It is not clear if this includes incremental, accordion or side-by-side loans and baskets and ratios for permitted debt, which are normally allowed in loan covenants even if they are never actually drawn. Only committed undrawn liquidity facilities, such as commercial paper programmes, have been excluded, and the ECB has warned that care needs to be exercised when applying this exemption. 90-DAY RULE In a more radical departure, banks are now expected to treat deals that have not been syndicated within 90 days of signing as failed syndications for internal monitoring, booking, accounting, regulatory classification and capital requirements, which could change European banks' behaviour. Many of Europe's commercial banks have a  buy and hold  mentality and hold stakes in their own deals until maturity, especially those loans made to domestic companies. The new rules could push them to align with US investment banks, which seek to sell down to zero to release and reuse their capital and reduce funding costs.  We don't know exactly how the 90-day requirement for completion of syndication, after which syndicated deals should be treated as having failed, will be applied. The more tightly it's applied, the more the market will tighten,  Forbes said. The 90-day rule could have a big impact on merger and acquisition financing, which is usually agreed before deals are announced to provide certainty of funding. M&A; deals can take months to close if they are referred to regulators and are often not fully syndicated until the M&A; trade closes.  In transactions where you have long competition clearance, divestments or other complications, this will unfairly penalise banks underwriting those deals,  Forbes said. It also remains to be seen how  failed  deals that have not been syndicated after 90 days will be allocated to lenders' hold books. Further guidance is required on how do this for acquisition financing and bids with interim loan agreements. Investors are sometimes offered ticking fees to compensate them for their commitments until M&A; loans are drawn. If lenders have to charge higher fees for tying up their balance sheets, acquisition loans could become more expensive for borrowers.  In a situation where you have to set aside capital for a longer time, you normally have to compensate with a ticking fee. If banks are told to only lend to deals like this in exceptional circumstances, there will be fewer of those deals underwritten by European banks,  Forbes said. Shareholder loans and PIK loans will be included in total debt calculations, but it is not clear if this also includes subordinated shareholder debt, which is used to upstream cash in European leveraged finance. Banks will also be required to verify leveraged loan pricing by a unit independent of the syndication team, and deals with credit, underwriting or settlement risk in syndication also need to be reviewed and approved by an independent risk function. UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD As in the US, banks are concerned that the guidance will create an uneven playing field that will favour institutions not regulated by the ECB, such as US, Japanese and (post-Brexit) UK banks.  The US and ECB versions of the guidelines are at least similar, and some market participants are already subject to US rules. It is certainly significant and people will have to think about how they do things,  said Andreas Wieland, a partner who heads White & Case's regulatory practice in Frankfurt. Many institutions, particularly those with global operations, have been lending around the US guidelines, and national regulators are expected to take a similar approach to the ECB guidance.  National supervisors will likely base their assessment of leveraged lending procedures on criteria similar to the ECB,  said White & Case partner Stuart Willey. Non-regulated lenders thrived in the US after its version of leverage lending rules was introduced and it is not clear how the ECB will react if an uneven playing field is indeed created. Although the guidance is not binding, the regulator expects institutions under its supervision to integrate the rules into internal credit processes and will intervene if this does not happen.

In excerpts of an interview aired on ABC's  Good Morning America  on Friday, Manning said she had not spoken to Obama since he commuted her sentence five months ago, but that if she could, she would tell him how grateful she was.  I was given a chance, that's all I wanted,  Manning told ABC's  Nightline  co-anchor Juju Chang, her voice choked with emotion.  That's all I asked for was a chance, that's it.  Manning, 29, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had been serving time for passing secrets to the WikiLeaks website in the biggest breach of classified data in the history of the United States. She had been working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. She was convicted by court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offenses for furnishing more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, an international organization that publishes information from anonymous sources. Manning came out as transgendered shortly after her sentencing, but the military denied her request for hormone therapy treatment while behind bars. She was placed in solitary confinement after attempting suicide twice. Manning continued to fight for the treatment, and the authorities ultimately relented. In her ABC interview, she said the hormone therapy was essential.  It's literally what keeps me alive. It keeps me from feeling like I'm in the wrong body,  Manning said.  I used to get these horrible feelings like I just wanted to rip my body apart.

As Britain slipped closer to political deadlock after Prime Minister Theresa May's disastrous gamble on a snap election, the losses by the Scottish National Party (SNP) undermined Nicola Sturgeon's bid for a second independence vote. Sturgeon's party, which nearly swept the board in Scotland two years ago, lost heavyweights to a Conservative Party reinvigorated by Scottish leader Ruth Davidson. Those losses included former leader Alex Salmond, who led Scotland in the unsuccessful bid for independence in 2014, and the SNP's top lawmaker in the British Parliament, Angus Robertson.  The union is safer than it was,  political commentator David Torrance said. While the loss of seats pushes the issue of a second referendum onto a back burner for now, opinion polls show about 45 percent of Scottish voters support independence. Sturgeon said it was  a disappointing result  for her party, two years after it won a landslide in Scotland, and admitted that the focus on independence was undoubtedly a factor in the poor result.  She has argued that last year's Brexit ballot called the future of the United Kingdom into question because England and Wales voted to leave the European Union but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. Sturgeon said she would now seek an alliance with like-minded parties to try to keep the Conservatives out of government and to keep both Scotland and the UK within the single European market as part of the Brexit talks. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, waves after voting in Glasgow, Britain June 8, 2017.Russell Cheyne Last night it was shown that the reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit must be abandoned,  she said  I'm appealing to (lawmakers) from all parties to join together to try to keep Scotland and the UK in the single market .. and bring some order to the negotiations.   The SNP still took 35 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's 650-seat national parliament, while the Conservatives won 13 Scottish seats, achieving the second largest share of the vote. Labour won seven and the Liberal Democrats four.  All three nationwide British parties won just one seat each in 2015. In the election campaign, the SNP sought to focus on Conservative austerity measures and Brexit, but the other parties hammered home the theme of stopping a second referendum. Sturgeon appears to have erred badly on timing, after winning a mandate from the Scottish parliament for a second independence ballot by arguing that the Brexit result changed the rules of the game.  Rivals accused the SNP of setting aside day-to-day devolved government, including in health and education, to focus on splitting Scotland from England despite the rejection of independence by a 10-point margin almost three years ago. Scottish Labour appears to have piggy-backed on the surge in support for UK-wide leader Jeremy Corbyn, who won over many voters with an unexpectedly strong campaign. Scotland was the only good news for a Conservative Party that lost its overall majority in the British parliament.  We had a very clear message in this campaign and there wouldn't have been so many SNP losses tonight if Nicola Sturgeon hadn't tried to force through an unwanted second independence referendum in March,  Ruth Davidson said.

The main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) made significant gains on Sunday in local elections against the ruling party of authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen, winning about 46 percent of the vote compared with 51 percent for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP). The opposition hopes the elections will be a springboard for more gains in a general election next year, when Hun Sen aims to extend his more than three decades in power. Since the vote results were announced, pro-government groups have stepped up attacks on many of the newly elected officials, especially in social-media posts, in what the opposition sees as a deliberate smear campaign. CNRP candidate Srun Chanty, 42, who won in Poipet town near the border with Thailand, said a picture of her was posted on Facebook accusing her of being Vietnamese. Anti-Vietnamese sentiment is pervasive in Cambodia, even among progressive political groups, and political parties of all stripes often play the anti-Vietnam card against opponents to undermine their legitimacy.  It won’t be easy working with this government, under this ruling party,  Srun Chanty, adding that she worried about her security. Other opposition members have been accused of being members of the Khmer Rouge, under whose 1975-1979 rule about two million Cambodians were killed or died of starvation. Another newly elected opposition official was accused of being a  sword-wielding gangster  while the pro-government  Fresh News  web site accused others of running an illegal lottery racket. Government spokesman and CPP member Phay Siphan denied that there was any government or ruling party backing for such intimidation.

This is not the policy of the CPP or the government,  he told Reuters. Monovithya Kem, the CNRP's deputy public affairs director, denounced what she called  misinformation and discriminatory information  against the opposition, which she said she feared would only get worse.  Obviously, it shows a grudge against our newly elected officials,  she told Reuters.  This smear campaign will only backfire, as all their smear campaigns have in the past. People chose to replace CPP with CNRP officials for many reasons.  Human rights groups fear a surge of political violence and other abuses in the run-up to the general election. Scores of opposition politicians and rights activists have been jailed in recent months. The government denies accusations of rights abuses and Hun Sen has warned of chaos and even a revival of civil war if he were to lose the general election.

The Kurds have played a major role in the eight-month-old U.S.-backed campaign to defeat the hardline Sunni insurgents in the Nineveh province around their de-facto capital Mosul.  Baghdad's Shi'ite-led government has rejected any move by the mostly Sunni Muslim Kurds to press unilaterally for independence, insisting that any decision about the future of the country should involve all its other parts. But Hoshiyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign and finance minister and now a senior adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Massoud Barzani, said the decision to hold the vote on Sept. 25 was irreversible.   We crossed the Rubicon with that decision, there is no going back,  he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Related CoverageVote for Kurdish secession would not mean automatic break with Baghdad -senior officialHowever, the expected  yes  vote would simply strengthen the Kurds' hand in talks with Baghdad rather than leading automatically to a break from Iraq, nor would an independent Kurdistan annex the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and three other disputed regions in Kurdish-controlled territory, he said.  You will hear people saying we are for Iraq’s unity, territorial integrity, we want dialogue between Baghdad and Erbil, we understand all this,  he said.  A referendum is a democratic process, no democratic country can oppose having a referendum; we are not talking about independence, we are talking about the referendum.      The KRG's announcement on Wednesday sparked concern in the United States and Germany, two of the region's most important partners in the fight against Islamic State, which still controls a small part of Iraq's northern city of Mosul as well as swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. Neighboring Iran, Turkey and Syria all oppose secession, fearing separatism will spread to their own Kurdish populations. Turkey's foreign ministry called the plan a  terrible mistake  on Friday and said that Iraq's territorial integrity and political unity was a fundamental principle for Ankara. Iraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. The country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The center around Baghdad is mixed. The Kurds have their own armed force, the Peshmerga, which in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin. The Sinjar region is populated by Yazidis, the followers of an ancient religion who speak a Kurdish language and the group most persecuted by Islamic State. Makhmour is south of the Kurdish capital Erbil and Khanaqin is near the border with Iran. Zebari said the vote will only be held in these disputed territories if local elected councils want to join the process.

Along with our American colleagues but above all our colleagues in the region, we must try to find solutions, especially lifting the sea and air blockades,  Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters in Wolfenbuettel, Germany.  We're talking about food and many other things,  he said. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar this week over its alleged support for terrorism and the agenda of regional arch-rival Iran, charges Qatar dismissed as baseless. Visiting Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, speaking after talks with Gabriel, said the blockade of Qatar broke international law and described the severing of links to his country as  collective punishment.   These procedures that were taken (are) clear violations of international law and international humanitarian law. They will not have a positive impact on the region but a negative one,  he said.  Earlier, the four Arab nations stepped up pressure on Qatar, issuing a list of dozens of people designated as terrorists with alleged links to Qatar. Sheikh Mohammed said it included journalists and other individuals with no relationship to Qatar. Some had never even visited the country. Gabriel's spokesman Martin Schaefer later urged Iran, a Shi'ite state that Sunni Saudi Arabia accuses of supporting militant groups across the Middle East, to refrain from any move that could exacerbate the crisis.  It is important that nothing is done on the other side of the Gulf ... to pour oil on the fire,  he told a regular news conference in Berlin. Germany would try to promote dialogue but did not intend to become a key mediator in the crisis, he said. Gabriel was optimistic diplomatic efforts could resolve the crisis and said  it must not end in further escalations that include violence.  Many countries in the region, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, had previously supported organisations viewed by Germany as dangerous, Gabriel said. Germany would pursue its concerns about indirect support for militant groups by individuals living in Qatar via its intelligence services, said Gabriel, adding that he believed Doha would respect its agreements with Berlin.

Eight navy ships and sonar systems have joined the search for victims of Wednesday's incident, along with 20 civilian boats, despite persistent stormy weather, the military said.      More than 100 stunned relatives and friends gathered at a cemetery in the southern coastal town of Dawei, some weeping quietly and others offering prayers, to commemorate ten identified victims who were cremated on a rainy afternoon.   What we found now is my granddaughter. Her father and mother's bodies are not found yet,  said one of the mourners, Ma Myat Thaw May, his voice trembling as he spoke of the 7-month-old girl.  Scores of soldiers waited on standby to help if more bodies need to be carried ashore in the fishing village of Sanlan, about 600 km (372 miles) from Myanmar's largest city, Yangon.  Twenty-three adults and eight children made up the tally of bodies searchers have pulled from the Andaman Sea since Wednesday, the military said on its official page on social media site Facebook.

The Kurds have played a major role in the eight-month-old U.S.-backed campaign to defeat the hardline Sunni insurgents in the Nineveh province around their de-facto capital Mosul.  Baghdad's Shi'ite-led government has rejected any move by the mostly Sunni Muslim Kurds to press unilaterally for independence, insisting that any decision about the future of the country should involve all its other parts. But Hoshiyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign and finance minister and now a senior adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Massoud Barzani, said the decision to hold the vote on Sept. 25 was irreversible.   We crossed the Rubicon with that decision, there is no going back,  he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Related CoverageVote for Kurdish secession would not mean automatic break with Baghdad -senior officialHowever, the expected  yes  vote would simply strengthen the Kurds' hand in talks with Baghdad rather than leading automatically to a break from Iraq, nor would an independent Kurdistan annex the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and three other disputed regions in Kurdish-controlled territory, he said.  You will hear people saying we are for Iraq’s unity, territorial integrity, we want dialogue between Baghdad and Erbil, we understand all this,  he said.  A referendum is a democratic process, no democratic country can oppose having a referendum; we are not talking about independence, we are talking about the referendum.      The KRG's announcement on Wednesday sparked concern in the United States and Germany, two of the region's most important partners in the fight against Islamic State, which still controls a small part of Iraq's northern city of Mosul as well as swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. Neighboring Iran, Turkey and Syria all oppose secession, fearing separatism will spread to their own Kurdish populations. Turkey's foreign ministry called the plan a  terrible mistake  on Friday and said that Iraq's territorial integrity and political unity was a fundamental principle for Ankara. Iraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. The country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The center around Baghdad is mixed. The Kurds have their own armed force, the Peshmerga, which in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin. The Sinjar region is populated by Yazidis, the followers of an ancient religion who speak a Kurdish language and the group most persecuted by Islamic State. Makhmour is south of the Kurdish capital Erbil and Khanaqin is near the border with Iran. Zebari said the vote will only be held in these disputed territories if local elected councils want to join the process.

Consumer prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index rose 3.60 percent in the 12 months through May, down from an increase of 4.08 percent in the previous month and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll, statistics agency IBGE said.     This is the lowest inflation rate for Brazil since May 2007, in stark contrast with the double-digit rates seen before a deep, two-year-long recession weighed on prices.     On a monthly basis, inflation rose to 0.31 percent in May from April, up from an increase of 0.14 percent in the previous month, according to IBGE. It was the lowest monthly rate for May since 2007.     The official inflation target is 4.5 percent. Most economists expect the government to reduce that goal later this month for the first time in more than a decade to bring it closer to the target of other emerging economies.     Falling inflation is also expected to leave the central bank comfortable to cut rates from the current 10.25 percent to around 8.5 percent by December, according to a weekly survey of economists. Yields on rate futures were mostly down on Friday.      The central bank has already lowered the benchmark Selic rate by 400 basis points since October, but signaled it could slow down the pace of easing as a political crisis threatened to derail President Michel Temer's agenda to cut public spending.

Eight navy ships and sonar systems have joined the search for victims of Wednesday's incident, along with 20 civilian boats, despite persistent stormy weather, the military said.      More than 100 stunned relatives and friends gathered at a cemetery in the southern coastal town of Dawei, some weeping quietly and others offering prayers, to commemorate ten identified victims who were cremated on a rainy afternoon.   What we found now is my granddaughter. Her father and mother's bodies are not found yet,  said one of the mourners, Ma Myat Thaw May, his voice trembling as he spoke of the 7-month-old girl.  Scores of soldiers waited on standby to help if more bodies need to be carried ashore in the fishing village of Sanlan, about 600 km (372 miles) from Myanmar's largest city, Yangon.  Twenty-three adults and eight children made up the tally of bodies searchers have pulled from the Andaman Sea since Wednesday, the military said on its official page on social media site Facebook.   We have not received any information about survivors,  said Phyu Phyu Win, a regional social welfare and relief official.  Hopefully someone would survive.

An aircraft wheel, two life jackets and some bags with clothes - believed to be from the missing plane - were found on Thursday. Some oil patches were also spotted, the military said.

State-owned China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation, maker of the plane, said it would assist Myanmar authorities in investigating the crash.     Survivors are unlikely more than 24 hours after the plane lost contact, despite warm sea temperatures, experts have said.  Many bodies fragmented into several pieces and no victim wearing a life jacket has yet been recovered, a member of the emergency team said.  Aircraft accidents, involving both civilian and military planes, are not uncommon in Myanmar. A military helicopter crashed last June, killing three military personnel. Five were killed in February last year when an air force aircraft crashed in the capital, Naypyitaw, media said.

President Donald Trump's ordinarily red-hot Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, was dormant during the three-hour hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, although another Trump helped carry the mantle. Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, live tweeted throughout Comey's testimony, taking the ex-FBI director to task for his version of what the president told him. Twitter had a field day with other moments of Comey's testimony, including his revelation that he broke a date with his wife in order to have dinner with Trump and his use of the exclamation  Lordy.  Comey's disclosure that the person who leaked his memos of meeting with Trump was a Columbia Law School professor led to a stampede on the school's website, causing it to crash. Here are some highlights of what excited Twitter during the testimony. Son Stands in for Trump Trump Jr. took issue with Comey's comments about whether the president was ordering him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  Knowing my father for 39 years when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,  he tweeted.  (here)  Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that,  he concluded, adding the hashtag  #givemeabreak . (here) With his father's Twitter handle silent, @DonaldJTrumpJr became the 10th most mentioned Twitter handle in the Comey conversation, according to social media analysis firm Brandwatch. 'Lordy' One remark in particular from Comey got the Twittersphere buzzing. U.S. President Donald Trump gestures at the Infrastructure Summit with Governors and Mayors at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 8, 2017.Yuri Gripas Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  he told the committee regarding whether Trump had recorded their conversation.  Lordy  quickly became the focus of numerous memes, animated graphics and calls for T-shirts. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary got into the act, tweeting out the definition of  Lordy  as a word used to  express surprise or strength of feeling.   (here) Twitter said Comey's  Lordy  remark was among the top three most tweeted moments during the testimony. Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinStood Up Social media also poked fun when Comey revealed a presidential intrusion into his domestic life.  I had to call my wife and break a date with her,  Comey said.  I was supposed to take her out to dinner that night.    Moral of the #Comey testimony: Don't cancel a date with your wife,  said CBS-Chicago reporter Jeremy Ross on Twitter. (here) Columbia Crash Columbia Law School's website became overburdened after Comey said he had asked a good friend who is a professor there to leak memos from his meeting with Trump to the media. Daniel Richman later confirmed to Reuters he was the one to whom Comey referred in his testimony. Shortly after the mention by Comey, the school tweeted:  Columbia Law's site is down at the moment. We are working on a solution. Stay tuned.  (here) Reporting by Angela Moon and Jonathan Oatis; Editing by Bill Trott","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-socialmedia-idUSKBN18Z2Y8"},

British voters dealt a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May in a snap election, wiping out her parliamentary majority, just weeks before Brexit negotiations are due to begin. May said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish unionists to provide political certainty. European stocks were choppy on Friday, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.3 percent, while UK's blue chip FTSE 100 index gaining 0.5 percent. Analysts said the impact from the election on the U.S. market would be limited.  The UK election is a UK event and there is no direct economic impact from that on the U.S. economy,  said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.  Investors are more concerned about Trump and the perception of what he can and can't get passed legislatively in regards to tax reform. The last thing the Republicans want to do is head to the mid-term election in 2018 without any major legislative accomplishments.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.25 points, or 0.06 percent, on volume of 24,847 contracts. Wall Street ended mostly flat on Thursday after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony was seen by investors as having no smoking gun that could affect Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs.

Liberbank has lost close to half of its stock market value this week and its shares have fallen for 10 straight days. They are now trading at 0.582 euro each, down 29 percent on Friday and close to their all-time low of 0.526 euro in July last year. Meanwhile, the initial public offering of Unicaja, a regional lender in Andalusia, flagged for before the summer, is seen suffering from both the Popular fallout and the competition of the 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) cash call Santander will soon carry out. Liberbank, which was formed in 2011 from the merger of three regional savings banks and controls around two percent of all Spanish deposits, has been seen as one of the weakest links of Spain's banking sector for several years despite efforts to sell bad real estate assets and improve its liquidity position. The bank has a bad loan ratio of 13 percent, well above most of its peers, and two thirds of its 2.1 billion euros debt matures by the end of the year with several repayments due in the next two months. Smaller banks in Spain, including Liberbank, saw their subordinated debt sell off on Thursday in the aftermath of the Banco Popular resolution, with cash prices dropping by multiple points. In a bid to draw a line under the current selloff, Liberbank Chief Executive Officer Manuel Menendez and Member of the Board Victor Roza bought more than 100,000 euros worth of shares in the lender yesterday, according to official registries seen by Reuters on Friday. A spokesman for Liberbank said the lender was strong both in terms of liquidity and solvency and the recent selloff was only the result of short-selling from opportunist investors. Unicaja, which also manages around 2 percent of Spanish deposits, enjoys a slightly more relaxed situation. Its bad debt ratio is just below 10 percent and a deadline to repay 600 million euros of subordinated debt and meet legal requirements to list is still months away but banking insiders say pressure is mounting.  It has always been a complex IPO because the banks lack an equity story,  said a senior Spanish banker.  Most of its business is formed by residential mortgages, which turn very low margins. Either it lists at a very low price or they will suffer to get it done,  the banker also said, adding that he would expect the listing to be postponed. Unicaja declined to comment.

Yet her gamble had started quite differently. With results showing May's Conservatives have lost their majority in parliament, party members blamed what one called a  just awful  campaign, training their ire on an election team that highlighted the 60-year-old's flaws by sticking doggedly to an agreed script instead of masking her weaknesses. Without the desired larger majority, May will now be in the thrall of two wings of her party that oppose her plans to leave the European Union:  purists  who want a clean break with the bloc and  remainers  who are pressing for closer ties, two Conservative sources said. That throws into doubt the complex talks on Britain's departure from the EU that are due to begin in just 10 days.  We overestimated our match-fit status. We overestimated the campaign team at the top. We believed the polls and we were cocky,  said one senior Conservative source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Instead of betting on the size of the majority, party insiders were now putting money on when the prime minister would quit, less than a year after she was propelled into Downing Street following Britain's shock decision to exit the EU. Standing outside her Downing Street official residence, May said she would form a government by relying on support from  friends  in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and lead Britain in talks with the EU to secure a successful deal.   She's staying, for now,  the source told Reuters. Sure-Fire Bet   In April, the political landscape was very different. After a holiday in Wales, May said she had reluctantly decided to bring forward the election by three years to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU, talks which will reshape Britain's role in the world and that of a bloc praised by many for ensuring peace after World War Two. Her decision, reluctant or not, seemed at the time to promise a sure-fire win for a leader who had never led her party into an election.  Opinion polls gave her sky-high personal ratings and her party a runaway lead over the opposition Labour Party. They seemed to offer her a cushion to do something she rarely does: change her mind after weeks of vowing no early poll. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party's headquarters in London, June 9, 2017.Peter NichollsSurprised by the U-turn, one former co-worker, Tony Smith, said last month that May must have  taken her time out and gone away to think about it  before making the decision.  Once she has, you won't find any prevarication there. I don't think you'll see in her memoirs 'Oh I'm not sure whether I should've called that election back then',  said Smith, the former head of Britain's Border Force who worked closely with May in organizing security checks for the London 2012 Olympics. After winning her parliamentary seat, May said on Friday her Conservative Party would take responsibility for delivering stability if it won the most seats in the election.  If, as the indications have shown, and if this is correct that the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do,  May said, without explicitly mentioning her own role. But the outcome will have put paid to the image her aides sought to portray. The  bloody difficult woman  who promised to be  strong and stable  looks anything but.  Maybot  The senior Conservative source blamed the party's over-dependency on the tight messaging demanded by election guru Lynton Crosby for failing to endear May to voters weary of  elections and rattled by two militant attacks in as many weeks. More geared to messaging than policy, Crosby, alongside business partner and pollster Mark Textor, wanted to bring strict discipline to the campaign, sticking to party slogans and attacking Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, sources said. They wanted the campaign to focus on May and a clear message that only she could be trusted. At first it seemed to work, but May's decision to introduce a new policy which would see people pay more towards their elderly care was a turning point. The policy went down badly with voters and was attacked by the opposition as an unfair  dementia tax . A local campaign manager in northern England complained that May's closest aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill  had never met a real person in their life  and had badly misread the electorate with the plan. With the Labour Party campaigning on policies such as ending university fees and boosting the police, the slide in the opinion polls for the Conservatives had begun. By the end of the seven week run-up, May had earned the moniker  Maybot  for her robotic performances, was openly mocked by audience members at a question-and-answer session and jeered during a tour of a London meat market. She ended her election campaign with a rally in a half-empty conference hall on the outskirts of Britain's second city, Birmingham. Her advisers said there were 800 activists cheering her on. A Reuters witness put the number closer to 250.  Corbyn ran a way better campaign, he got to more places and got more people to come out to his rallies,  said Labour supporter Alisa Hall outside the London building where Corbyn's votes were counted.  It showed. People weren't excited to go and see Theresa May at a rally.

The U.S. Pacific Command said on its website that two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers flew a 10-hour training mission from Guam over the South China Sea on Thursday, in conjunction with the Navy's USS Sterett guided-missile destroyer. The exercise comes after a U.S. warship in late May carried out a  maneuvering drill  within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea. The U.S. military conducts such  freedom of navigation  patrols to show China it is not entitled to territorial waters there, U.S. officials said at the time. The latest exercise was part of Pacific Command's  continuous bomber presence  program, but it did not give details on where it was conducted, and did not refer to it as a freedom-of-navigation operation.   China always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country's military activities in the South China Sea,  the ministry said in a statement, referring to the United States.  China's military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability,  it said. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, a stance contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Now it takes just hours. Better yet, the land is producing a crop even as southern Africa’s droughts grow stronger and more frequent, a problem linked to climate change. That’s because Chiweshe is no longer plowing a portion of his farm, but instead planting his seeds directly into the intact soil, a water-conserving technique called “no-till” farming. “Come next year you will find even bigger cobs in my field,” promised the 67-year-old retired bus driver, who this year expects to harvest 2 tonnes of maize from a half-hectare “no-till” trial plot. No-till farming is hardly new. Three decades ago, Zimbabwe’s commercial farms adopted the technique and it has been promoted by Zimbabwe research and development organizations since 2004. But it is seeing new popularity among small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe as many, shaken by a recent long drought that killed crops, look for ways to avoid a repeat of those losses the next time drought returns. About 300,000 small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe, most of whom depend on rainfall to water their crops, are now using the no-till farming system, according to Christian Thierfelder, an agronomist with the southern Africa regional office of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).  Besides planting seeds directly into the soil, no-till farming involves allowing the stalks and leaves left from earlier harvests to remain on the ground, to help hold moisture and eventually add nutrients to the soil, building soil fertility over time.  Often weeds are sprayed with herbicides rather than removed by digging them from the soil. The technique has had problems of its own over the last growing season, marked by flooding and heavy rains. In some areas where soils are sandy, farmers practicing no-till farming saw yields no higher than those of farmers who plowed their land.  More Maize, Fewer Hassles? But for some farmers, like Chiweshe, the new style of farming is providing more reliable than the old way of doing things, which “was stressing” in the face of worsening drought, he admits. Before taking up no-till farming, he said he harvested just one ton of maize from his 3-hectare plot last year, during the drought. This year he expects twice that from just one-sixth of his land. Eliminating plowing and other labor also is saving money, he said, and giving him more time to concentrate on other money-makers on his farm, such as bananas and livestock. Thierfelder said conventional farming equipment – such as plows – can be converted into specialized no-till equipment for a small investment of about $25. In Malawi, no-till farmers find they need to spend fewer days each year planting and weeding their fields – though they may need to buy and use herbicides to get rid of weeds without tilling the land, Thierfelder said. Some farmers say eliminating tilling also has allowed them to plant more crops side-by-side in the same field. Efforts to spread the use of no-till farming in Zimbabwe, in the face of worsening climate change impacts, have been hampered by a lack of sufficient trainers to help farmers make the adjustment, he said. Under a 2011 government plan to promote the practice, each of the country’s 4,300 farm extension officers was expected to train at least 75 farmers a year, said Phillimon Ngirazi, an extension officer from Chavakadzi in Shamva District, 120 km northwest of Harare.  But not all extension officers have reached that goal, he said. “Changing minds that crop production is possible without plowing has been difficult. But once farmers have experience with conservation agriculture practices for some time they influence other farmers to adopt,” Ngirazi said.

Safe-haven gold and U.S. Treasuries drifted lower and futures markets pointed to Wall Street opening modestly higher.  The uncertainty is bad news for sterling,  said Bank of America, Merrill Lynch European equity & cross-asset strategist James Barty.  I think for the global market it doesn't matter. Unlike Brexit, which at the time had a spillover into other markets, this is a very UK-specific thing.  Bets that another drop in sterling would flatter international firms' profits pushed London's FTSE as much as 1 percent higher but it was up a more limited 0.4 percent by mid-session. Bourses in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan had also slipped back to leave MSCI's closely-followed 46-country 'All World' index down 0.1 percent and set for its first weekly fall since mid-April. May's Conservatives failed to win an outright majority in parliament. It meant she turned to Northern Ireland's small Democratic Unionist Party to retain power, amid serious questions about her own future. That raised fears the political turmoil could delay and confound talks on leaving the European Union, which are due to start in less than two weeks. The pound shed more than 2 percent against the dollar, dropping as low as $1.2636 and 88.6 pence per euro -- two- and six-month troughs -- before recovering all the way to $1.2741 and 87.70. Yields on 10-year gilts also ticked higher after falling to 1 percent. John Wraith, a strategist at UBS, said there was a high likelihood of a potentially prolonged period of uncertainty over whether May would be replaced. But he cautioned bears against chasing the pound much lower.  Today's result will in part be seen as a vote against a definitive break from the EU, and the market may soon begin to reassess the probability of a so-called 'hard Brexit'.  No Smoking Gun There was much less drama elsewhere. E-mini futures for the S&P; 500 edged up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei added 0.5 percent and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended the day all but flat. The Japanese yen eased to 110.40 per dollar, while the euro was down 0.35 percent against the U.S. currency at $1.1173. The single currency had slipped overnight when the European Central Bank cut forecasts for inflation and said it had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying campaign, sending bond yields to multi-month lows. Italian bond yields fell again on Friday as the head of the country's ruling Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, said he was pessimistic over the chances of reaching a new cross-party pact on a reform of the electoral law. Political analysts see that as reducing the chances of a snap election in the coming months.  The dollar is right at a key point,  said Saxo Bank head of FX strategy John Hardy.  There is the FOMC (Federal Reserve) meeting next week and we had a maximum-dove ECB meeting.  Overnight, Wall Street had also seemingly judged that the testimony of former FBI director James Comey was not life-threatening for the administration of President Donald Trump. Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 election.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here,  said Jefferies & Co money market economist Thomas Simons.  So it's not particularly impactful for thinking about ... Trump's economic agenda to go through.  The Dow rose 0.04 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.03 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.39 percent. The S&P; and Dow are both marginally lower for the week. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.3 percent lower at $1,274.45 an ounce. Oil prices remained subdued, with Brent having settled at its lowest since Nov. 29, the eve of an OPEC production cut deal. U.S. crude futures was flat at $45.63 a barrel, with Brent crude at $47.84. Both benchmarks are down roughly 4 percent in what will be a third consecutive weekly fall.

The conditional approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), announced by the NSE on Friday, comes four months after the country's largest bourse nominated Limaye for the post, an unusually long time. Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters SEBI had been concerned the executive's time would be split if he were to remain a member of a Supreme Court appointed committee to supervise the country's cricket body after a 2013 fixing scandal.  SEBI has approved the appointment of Mr. Vikram Limaye as the MD and CEO of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd, subject interalia to his being relieved from his BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) assignment,  NSE said in a statement. No specific date was provided for when Limaye would take over as CEO. The appointment of Limaye removes one of the key hurdles as NSE pursues a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) that bankers say could raise as much as $1 billion. NSE applied for the IPO in December, but SEBI has delayed that approval as well, as it probes the NSE's disclosure that some brokers may have been given unfair access to its servers. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the exchange is pursuing a settlement of the probe, in hopes for winning SEBI's approval of the IPO. NSE has been operating under an acting CEO after former head Chitra Ramkrishna unexpectedly resigned in December, citing personal reasons. Ramkrishna's exit has been followed by a spate of resignations from board members and other senior executives, including former CEO Ravi Narain. NSE Chairman Ashok Chawla said this week he expected the exchange to go public before the end of 2017. Limaye, a 50-year-old finance industry veteran, will be the first head of NSE to come from outside the ranks of the founding team of the exchange, which was set up in 1992. A chartered accountant with an MBA in finance from the Wharton School, Limaye has worked in a variety of roles in investment banking, capital markets and structured finance and has been part of various government committees and industry associations.

Yet her gamble had started quite differently. With results showing May's Conservatives have lost their majority in parliament, party members blamed what one called a  just awful  campaign, training their ire on an election team that highlighted the 60-year-old's flaws by sticking doggedly to an agreed script instead of masking her weaknesses. Without the desired larger majority, May will now be in the thrall of two wings of her party that oppose her plans to leave the European Union:  purists  who want a clean break with the bloc and  remainers  who are pressing for closer ties, two Conservative sources said. That throws into doubt the complex talks on Britain's departure from the EU that are due to begin in just 10 days.  We overestimated our match-fit status. We overestimated the campaign team at the top. We believed the polls and we were cocky,  said one senior Conservative source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Instead of betting on the size of the majority, party insiders were now putting money on when the prime minister would quit, less than a year after she was propelled into Downing Street following Britain's shock decision to exit the EU. Standing outside her Downing Street official residence, May said she would form a government by relying on support from  friends  in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and lead Britain in talks with the EU to secure a successful deal.   She's staying, for now,  the source told Reuters. Sure-Fire Bet   In April, the political landscape was very different. After a holiday in Wales, May said she had reluctantly decided to bring forward the election by three years to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU, talks which will reshape Britain's role in the world and that of a bloc praised by many for ensuring peace after World War Two. Her decision, reluctant or not, seemed at the time to promise a sure-fire win for a leader who had never led her party into an election.  Opinion polls gave her sky-high personal ratings and her party a runaway lead over the opposition Labour Party. They seemed to offer her a cushion to do something she rarely does: change her mind after weeks of vowing no early poll. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party's headquarters in London, June 9, 2017.Peter NichollsSurprised by the U-turn, one former co-worker, Tony Smith, said last month that May must have  taken her time out and gone away to think about it  before making the decision.  Once she has, you won't find any prevarication there. I don't think you'll see in her memoirs 'Oh I'm not sure whether I should've called that election back then',  said Smith, the former head of Britain's Border Force who worked closely with May in organizing security checks for the London 2012 Olympics. After winning her parliamentary seat, May said on Friday her Conservative Party would take responsibility for delivering stability if it won the most seats in the election.  If, as the indications have shown, and if this is correct that the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do,  May said, without explicitly mentioning her own role. But the outcome will have put paid to the image her aides sought to portray. The  bloody difficult woman  who promised to be  strong and stable  looks anything but.  Maybot  The senior Conservative source blamed the party's over-dependency on the tight messaging demanded by election guru Lynton Crosby for failing to endear May to voters weary of  elections and rattled by two militant attacks in as many weeks. More geared to messaging than policy, Crosby, alongside business partner and pollster Mark Textor, wanted to bring strict discipline to the campaign, sticking to party slogans and attacking Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, sources said. They wanted the campaign to focus on May and a clear message that only she could be trusted. At first it seemed to work, but May's decision to introduce a new policy which would see people pay more towards their elderly care was a turning point. The policy went down badly with voters and was attacked by the opposition as an unfair  dementia tax . A local campaign manager in northern England complained that May's closest aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill  had never met a real person in their life  and had badly misread the electorate with the plan. With the Labour Party campaigning on policies such as ending university fees and boosting the police, the slide in the opinion polls for the Conservatives had begun. By the end of the seven week run-up, May had earned the moniker  Maybot  for her robotic performances, was openly mocked by audience members at a question-and-answer session and jeered during a tour of a London meat market. She ended her election campaign with a rally in a half-empty conference hall on the outskirts of Britain's second city, Birmingham. Her advisers said there were 800 activists cheering her on. A Reuters witness put the number closer to 250.  Corbyn ran a way better campaign, he got to more places and got more people to come out to his rallies,  said Labour supporter Alisa Hall outside the London building where Corbyn's votes were counted.  It showed. People weren't excited to go and see Theresa May at a rally.

Nigeria has more than 60 million barrels of unsold crude, traders of its oil said, surpassing the level reached when global oversupply peaked two years ago. More export plans are a week away, likely bringing more than 50 million extra barrels.  Libya, meanwhile, is pouring nearly triple the amount of crude into global markets compared with last year. Few expected the two nations' output to rebound so quickly, and it could scupper OPEC's plans to lift oil prices out of a nearly three-year-long slump.  The 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries two weeks ago extended a deal struck in December with several non-member oil producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from levels seen late last year. But OPEC also renewed exemptions for Libya and Nigeria, which have struggled with output-sapping internal conflict. Those struggles, however, are abating.   They've added 600,000 barrels per day between the two of them  since the original deal was struck, said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects.  And that's half the OPEC cuts.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) this week lifted force majeure on Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months and cementing the addition of some 250,000 bpd to world markets.  Libyan oil production hit its highest since October 2014 at 835,000 bpd this month, despite the brief shutdown of Sharara, the country's largest oilfield, due to protests.  Despite this, OPEC sources said calls to bring Libya or Nigeria into the cuts never garnered enough support. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said this month it was too early for those countries to be considered for output curbs. But the excess is palpable – and it's pouring straight into the Atlantic Basin, home of the physical crude grades that underpin the global Brent benchmark.   In a physical sense, it's pretty dire,  one West African oil trader said.  Everything is on offer, and everything is pumping.  Traders said some Mediterranean refiners - typically reliable consumers - were reselling their oil.   A Mediterranean trader said that while Libya  is not a totally reliable source , its production was  running high on several fields . There are doubts over whether the two nations will maintain their run, particularly given Libya's political problems.  But Brent futures LCOc1 are trading nearly 20 percent below their 2017 high, and more than 10 percent below the level before the May OPEC meeting.   The biggest issue is light, sweet crude,  Sen said, adding the Atlantic Basin is  awash  with it.  This is where OPEC isn't light enough on its feet ... the benchmarks are all light sweet. And the cuts are medium and sour.  Even barrels from the United States are sailing east, looking for homes in Europe and Asia and further undermining the global benchmark. The dynamic, traders and analysts said, pointed to a need for more from OPEC.  This means the rest of the group will see the call on their crude falling - it's very simple,  FGE analyst James Davis said.  They need to cut deeper in order to maintain the status quo.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Nigerian oil production rebounds    reut.rs/2sKbLOv Libya oil tanker exports    reut.rs/2sciXCM Libya oil production (mln bpd)    reut.rs/2rHYoAc ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in Dubai; Editing by Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-output-excess-idUSKBN1901RM"},

The appearance of a comet called “lovebug” sets into motion a series of events which brings them together again after a thousand years. The film is a rehash of the many reincarnation stories that have populated the Bollywood romance genre over the years and has nothing new to say. The protagonists are Saira (Kriti Sanon) and Shiv (Sushant Singh Rajput), two twenty-somethings who live in a Budapest that happens to be crawling with Indians. He is a cocky banker and spends all his spare time trying to woo every woman in the city. She is a baker and spends all her time trying to be over-familiar and chatty with people she barely knows. The first time Saira meets Shiv she lets him follow her home. The second time they meet, she sleeps with Shiv, but then refuses to see him after that because she has a boyfriend who “watches sunsets with me and takes me on long drives.” Slideshow (2 Images)If you don’t have the time to dwell on her flightiness, it is probably because you are distracted by the sheer verbosity of Shiv. He probably thinks a minute of silence is a minute he is wasting, and spends all his waking hours trying to impress Saira and throwing smarmy one-liners at her. Even when Saira tells him about her constant nightmares and the fact that she is unable to sleep at night, he has a patronising line about how her life is interesting and that she has the tragedy of her parents’ death while he leads a stodgy, boring life as a banker! Thankfully, the entry of Zak (Jim Sarbh), a billionaire tycoon with a permanent scowl on his face takes some of the attention off Shiv’s smugness. Zak has 10 times the attitude of Shiv and he too has the hots for Saira. When Shiv is away at a conference, Zak whisks Saira away to his mansion in the middle of an island, ostensibly kidnapping her. At his point, “Raabta” goes from a regular romance to a story that seems to take place on the leftover sets of “Game of Thrones.” We are transported back in time a thousand years where tribes are fighting to control a kingdom, and Zak and Shiv are warring princes. It is difficult to understand what the point of this story is other than to add depth to the current love story and to make Shiv and Saira sound like lovers who were destined to meet, instead of the self-centred, shallow people they seem to be. But Vijan doesn’t seem to have the directing chops to make this kind of film, and at 154-minutes, “Raabta” is much too long and overwrought. Sanon and Rajput drum up chemistry in the beginning and try to make their parts work, but Jim Sarbh is out of his depth. He is uncomfortable as the villain and unintentionally funny when he tries to portray the charming psychopath.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-raabta-sushant-singh-kriti-idUSKBN1901MZ"},

Now it takes just hours. Better yet, the land is producing a crop even as southern Africa’s droughts grow stronger and more frequent, a problem linked to climate change. That’s because Chiweshe is no longer plowing a portion of his farm, but instead planting his seeds directly into the intact soil, a water-conserving technique called “no-till” farming. “Come next year you will find even bigger cobs in my field,” promised the 67-year-old retired bus driver, who this year expects to harvest 2 tonnes of maize from a half-hectare “no-till” trial plot. No-till farming is hardly new. Three decades ago, Zimbabwe’s commercial farms adopted the technique and it has been promoted by Zimbabwe research and development organizations since 2004. But it is seeing new popularity among small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe as many, shaken by a recent long drought that killed crops, look for ways to avoid a repeat of those losses the next time drought returns. About 300,000 small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe, most of whom depend on rainfall to water their crops, are now using the no-till farming system, according to Christian Thierfelder, an agronomist with the southern Africa regional office of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).  Besides planting seeds directly into the soil, no-till farming involves allowing the stalks and leaves left from earlier harvests to remain on the ground, to help hold moisture and eventually add nutrients to the soil, building soil fertility over time.  Often weeds are sprayed with herbicides rather than removed by digging them from the soil. The technique has had problems of its own over the last growing season, marked by flooding and heavy rains. In some areas where soils are sandy, farmers practicing no-till farming saw yields no higher than those of farmers who plowed their land.  More Maize, Fewer Hassles? But for some farmers, like Chiweshe, the new style of farming is providing more reliable than the old way of doing things, which “was stressing” in the face of worsening drought, he admits. Before taking up no-till farming, he said he harvested just one ton of maize from his 3-hectare plot last year, during the drought. This year he expects twice that from just one-sixth of his land. Eliminating plowing and other labor also is saving money, he said, and giving him more time to concentrate on other money-makers on his farm, such as bananas and livestock. Thierfelder said conventional farming equipment – such as plows – can be converted into specialized no-till equipment for a small investment of about $25. In Malawi, no-till farmers find they need to spend fewer days each year planting and weeding their fields – though they may need to buy and use herbicides to get rid of weeds without tilling the land, Thierfelder said. Some farmers say eliminating tilling also has allowed them to plant more crops side-by-side in the same field. Efforts to spread the use of no-till farming in Zimbabwe, in the face of worsening climate change impacts, have been hampered by a lack of sufficient trainers to help farmers make the adjustment, he said. Under a 2011 government plan to promote the practice, each of the country’s 4,300 farm extension officers was expected to train at least 75 farmers a year, said Phillimon Ngirazi, an extension officer from Chavakadzi in Shamva District, 120 km northwest of Harare.  But not all extension officers have reached that goal, he said. “Changing minds that crop production is possible without plowing has been difficult. But once farmers have experience with conservation agriculture practices for some time they influence other farmers to adopt,” Ngirazi said.

Kennedy International Airport, air traffic controllers can track planes traveling hundreds of miles away.  But when it's time for a controller to hand off responsibility for watching a flight, the technology becomes decidedly last century: details are printed on a slip of paper and passed to a co-worker. President Donald Trump promised on Monday to sweep away such outmoded systems and replace them with  the best, newest and safest technology available.  Trump's solution is to split air traffic control away from the Federal Aviation Administration and privatize it under a not-for-profit, independent corporation. Billions of dollars in government and private contracts ride on the conversion of the nation's air traffic control system to satellite-based GPS. A federal modernization program known as NextGen has already targeted traditional ground-based radar and other aging technologies for replacement. Still, the United States lags well behind other countries including Canada, Ireland and Denmark, whose satellite-based GPS systems are slated to go live next year.  Private-sector companies angling for a piece of this business see wide commercial potential for products unleashed by the U.S. modernization effort, including digital cockpit messaging, live monitoring of aircraft engines and systems, advanced weather maps and faster internet service for passengers.  It's a big deal for us,  said David Nieuwsma, a senior vice president in charge of such systems at Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N).  We know it's the future.  Delay and Expense Congress gave the FAA $7.4 billion between 2004 and 2016 to develop and install NextGen systems. The aim was to boost the capacity of the U.S. aviation system to handle more planes, cut flight delays and improve safety, according to a Government Accountability Office report published in November.  Airlines support NextGen and are expected to spend $15 billion upgrading their fleets to prepare for the new systems. But industry players have grown frustrated as the FAA missed implementation deadlines. The agency now estimates NextGen will cost another $14.8 billion to complete, with many major upgrades not due to be functional until 2025, the GAO said. Proponents say privatization will speed NextGen by freeing it from FAA bureaucracy. Modeled after Canada's widely praised 1996 privatization, which created an entity known as Nav Canada, the U.S. plan has the backing of most U.S. airlines as well as qualified support from the air traffic controllers union. Critics, including Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), the National Business Aviation Association and an organization of FAA safety inspectors and technicians, say Congress should instead enact a law to stabilize FAA's NextGen funding, which is controlled by Congress.   Privatizing the largest and most complex aviation system in the world is a risky and unnecessary step at this pivotal point in its modernization,  said Mike Perrone, head of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a union of 11,000 FAA safety employees, after Trump's announcement.  This would slow down enhancements and possibly compromise safety to fix a system that’s not broken.   Bouncing Off the Satellites Central to the modernization effort are global positioning satellites that can track planes more accurately than radar, enabling controllers to reduce the distance between aircraft during flight. That allows more takeoffs and landings, which is essential to meet rising global demand for air travel. That's creating opportunities for a host of U.S. firms. FILE PHOTO - Travelers are seen at John F. Kennedy International airport in the Queens borough of New York, U.S. on February 14, 2014.Eric Thayer/File PhotoMcLean, Virginia-based Iridium Communications (IRDM.O) owns a network of satellites for voice and data transmission. Through a joint venture known as Aireon, it has partnered with Nav Canada and several other air traffic control organizations to roll out a global satellite air navigation system planned to go into operation next year.  Aireon recently began tests with the FAA on eight satellites Iridium launched in January. The consortium is among the top contenders for a multibillion-dollar contract that the agency is expected to award next year. Aireon already has contracts with 30 air navigation service  providers. But FAA approval is  the gold standard  that likely would prompt more countries to sign up, Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch said in an interview. Meanwhile, the increasing sophistication of commercial and private jets means more opportunities for aerospace manufacturers such as Honeywell International (HON.N). Headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey, Honeywell recently introduced a weather application that uses  crowdsourced  data from other planes in flight to give pilots a real-time map of turbulence and storms.  Those things didn't exist before. We're inventing them,  said Carl Esposito, president of the Honeywell business that provides cockpit, navigation, space and safety systems. Slideshow (2 Images)Systems by Honeywell and others, such as Chicago-based Gogo Inc (GOGO.O), are using satellites to give planes internet service fast enough for passengers to stream Netflix and similar services. Pilots can use the same pipeline to share data with each other and ground control. Rockwell Collins (COL.N), based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is working with Hawaiian Airlines and the FAA to certify the safety of a satellite system for aircraft status messages. The messages, known as ACARS, have been in use for decades. The satellite system would extend that reach. Controller Jobs Declining But pressure to modernize has not resolved the debate about the FAA's structure. Trump’s spin-off plan mirrors one advocated by U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who chairs the House Transportation Committee.  Critics say shifting some 14,000 controllers and other FAA employees to a new corporation could potentially compromise safety, hand airlines too much power and put technology upgrades even further behind schedule.  Proponents say a private entity could tap capital markets and sign contracts quickly by avoiding the FAA's slow  procurement process. It also gets workers off the federal payroll. Modernization could reduce the number of unionized controllers, who earn $130,000 to $180,000 a year according to online listings.  The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which represents the workers, says it supports a non-profit corporation as long as it preserves safety, provides stable funding and protects its workforce while ensuring airport access for all types of planes, including personal and business aircraft. Job loss appear inevitable as digital and satellite technology allow controllers to do more with less effort.  Technology company Harris Corp (HRS.N) has set up a system in more than 50 U.S. airports that lets pilots load aircraft route changes directly into their onboard computers. That saves time, especially in bad weather when routes change frequently.  All of this is going to make the controller job more efficient and effective,  Harris chief executive Bill Brown said in an interview. As for the paper strips, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) won the $344 million contract last year to do away with them at 89 U.S. airports.  The FAA says implementation will start in 2020.

May asked Britain's Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a new government on Friday after an election debacle that saw her Conservative Party lose its parliamentary majority days before talks on Britain's EU departure are due to begin. On the doorstep of her official Downing Street residence, May said she could rely in parliament on the support of her  friends  in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party after her governing Conservatives failed to win a majority.  We will continue to work with our friends and allies in the Democratic Unionist Party in particular,  she said.  Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.  The DUP - which staunchly defends Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, and takes a conservative approach to social issues - increased its number of seats to 10 in Thursday's election.  We will fulfil the promise of Brexit together and over the next five years build a country in which no one, and no community, is left behind,  May said.  This will allow us to come together as a country and channel our energies towards a successful Brexit deal that works for everyone in this country, securing a new partnership with the EU which guarantees our long term prosperity.  The DUP said earlier on Friday it would not comment on reports that it had agreed to back May's ruling Conservatives/ Some political analysts doubt a Conservative minority government with support from the DUP would last over the long term, and think a second election is likely.

By Busani Bafana MUREHWA, Zimbabwe, June 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Preparing his three-hectare plot of land for planting each year used to take Musafare Chiweshe – or the labourers he hired – two weeks. Now it takes just hours. Better yet, the land is producing a crop even as southern Africa’s droughts grow stronger and more frequent, a problem linked to climate change. That’s because Chiweshe is no longer ploughing a portion of his farm, but instead planting his seeds directly into the intact soil, a water-conserving technique called “no-till” farming. “Come next year you will find even bigger cobs in my field,” promised the 67-year-old retired bus driver, who this year expects to harvest 2 tonnes of maize from a half-hectare “no-till” trial plot. No-till farming is hardly new. Three decades ago, Zimbabwe’s commercial farms adopted the technique and it has been promoted by Zimbabwe research and development organisations since 2004. But it is seeing new popularity among small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe as many, shaken by a recent long drought that killed crops, look for ways to avoid a repeat of those losses the next time drought returns. About 300,000 small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe, most of whom depend on rainfall to water their crops, are now using the no-till farming system, according to Christian Thierfelder, an agronomist with the southern Africa regional office of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Besides planting seeds directly into the soil, no-till farming involves allowing the stalks and leaves left from earlier harvests to remain on the ground, to help hold moisture and eventually add nutrients to the soil, building soil fertility over time. Often weeds are sprayed with herbicides rather than removed by digging them from the soil. The technique has had problems of its own over the last growing season, marked by flooding and heavy rains. In some areas where soils are sandy, farmers practicing no-till farming saw yields no higher than those of farmers who ploughed their land. More Maize, Fewer Hassles? But for some farmers, like Chiweshe, the new style of farming is providing more reliable than the old way of doing things, which “was stressing” in the face of worsening drought, he admits. Before taking up no-till farming, he said he harvested just one tonne of maize from his 3-hectare plot last year, during the drought. This year he expects twice that from just one-sixth of his land. Eliminating ploughing and other labour also is saving money, he said, and giving him more time to concentrate on other money-makers on his farm, such as bananas and livestock. Thierfelder said conventional farming equipment – such as ploughs – can be converted into specialised no-till equipment for a small investment of about $25. In Malawi, no-till farmers find they need to spend fewer days each year planting and weeding their fields – though they may need to buy and use herbicides to get rid of weeds without tilling the land, Thierfelder said. Efforts to spread the use of no-till farming in Zimbabwe, in the face of worsening climate change impacts, have been hampered by a lack of sufficient trainers to help farmers make the adjustment, he said. Under a 2011 government plan to promote the practice, each of the country’s 4,300 farm extension officers was expected to train at least 75 farmers a year, said Phillimon Ngirazi, an extension officer from Chavakadzi in Shamva District, 120 km northwest of Harare. But not all extension officers have reached that goal, he said. “Changing minds that crop production is possible without ploughing has been difficult. But once farmers have experience with conservation agriculture practices for some time they influence other farmers to adopt,” Ngirazi said.

In many cases, workers are stepping up, attracted in part by guarantees that their principal is safe. It's far from clear how these guarantees would work, with employees in some cases being asked to buy shares and hold them for at least 12 months. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange - where all but one of the companies are listed - has taken notice, and has issued guidelines requiring companies to provide details on their guarantee plans, the Securities Times reported. Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance, says that however well intentioned these efforts are, usually by the companies' founders or big shareholders, there is a question mark over their financial ability to make such guarantees.  It could be driven by the genuine belief that the stocks are worth investing in. But it could be a desperate move to prop up share prices to avoid margin calls,  he said.  The promise to take any losses isn't legally binding and largely depends on big shareholders' virtue. And you can't rule out insider trading during the process, which is why regulators are demanding better disclosure,' he added. There were similar efforts during the 2015 China stock market crash, but then it was the government appealing to major shareholders' patriotism to buy and hold shares in what Beijing framed as a battle against speculators, both domestic and foreign. The scramble to raise share prices highlights the risks in using securities as loan collateral, a practice that by some estimates has quadrupled in China over the past two years. For the most part, the companies involved are private, small, and have seen their founders or major shareholders post large batches of stock as loan collateral in recent months. But falling share prices have eroded the value of that collateral, raising the specter of forced liquidation - where lenders, often Chinese brokerages, make borrowers sell the pledged shares. Selling the stock can further dent share prices, triggering a downward spiral. Share Bounce Shenzhen Fenda Technology Co (002681.SZ), which makes speakers and electronic accessories, was among the first to issue a statement, a week ago, encouraging staff to buy shares. At the end of March, Xiao Fen, the company's chairman and top shareholder with a 44.5 percent stake, or 416.4 million shares, had put up 84 percent of his holding as collateral for a loan, the company said. It did not say what the loan was for. Trading in the company's shares was suspended in late December pending a reorganization, but resumed in mid-April, when the stock price slumped to near their 2015 market crash low. Last Friday, Xiao promised any employee who bought shares in the company by June 6 and held them for at least a year would be shielded from losses.  A lot of colleagues I know have bought shares. I have too,  said one worker, who gave only his family name, Li.  The company is quite good and the chairman has guaranteed principal, so, of course, we're interested. I know some colleagues even bought shares with borrowed money.  Shenzhen Fenda Technology shares jumped by a tenth after the announcement, but have since edged back down. The price of Guangdong Biolight Meditech Co Ltd (300246.SZ) stock fell by a quarter this year, undercutting the value of the 14.6 million shares that its chairman Yan Jinyuan posted as collateral as of the end of the first quarter. On Monday, Yan made a promise like Fenda's Xiao, and the share price also rose. Sun Xishan, a sales worker at Biolight, said he missed the chance to buy stock on the day of the announcement, but would try to get in on the shares later.  I know the company well, it's in pretty good shape and its performance is growing. The chairman promised to cover losses if any, so it's hard not to be interested if one has money,  Sun said.

The government had said it would accept U.N. technical assistance but wanted to retain control of the inquiry in response to a Thursday deadline by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein for Congo to agree to a joint probe.  But in his statement on Friday, Zeid said the government  response to date falls short  and urged the U.N. Human Rights Council, which is holding a session until June 23, to act.

The U.S. private equity firm would replace rival KKR & Co LP as the main partner of the state-backed fund and would be a minority investor in the consortium under the plan being discussed, one of the sources said. Bain submitted a bid in the second-round of the auction with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. The current consortium led by the Japan Innovation Network Corp fund is one of two frontrunners in the race for the world's second biggest producer of NAND flash memory chips. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. A representative for SK Hynix declined to comment. A representative for KKR was not immediately available for comment. Western Digital, which jointly operates a key flash memory chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, has been planning to work with the Japanese state-backed fund and KKR in its proposal. It recently presented an outline of its proposed bid to Toshiba, separate sources said. The Japan-backed consortium is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Some sources say Broadcom may have the upper hand as it has submitted a higher bid that is also likely to invite less anti-trust scrutiny. The Japan-backed consortium was also seen on the backfoot as Western Digital and Toshiba are at loggerheads over the sale of the chip unit, with the California-based firm claiming breach of contract. In its bid, Western Digital initially hoped to gain a majority holding, but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease the government, the sources said. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the business, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp.

Just 10 days before the start of negotiations on Britain's divorce from the European Union, no single party won a clear claim to power in Thursday's snap vote. The result - flagged by some analysts as the worst possible election outcome due to uncertainty - saw the pound fall as much as 2.5 percent to $1.2636 in early European trade. That was its lowest level since May called the election on April 18. . It had recovered a notch by midday in London to trade 1.6 percent lower at $1.2745. Despite facing calls to quit after her election gamble to win a stronger mandate backfired, May will proceed on Friday to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government. For a graphic on the poll, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48  We still think that sterling will find support despite the near-term weakness,  said Martin Arnold, FX strategist at ETF Securities in London.  Although (the election result) raises...the potential for policy paralysis like we're seeing in the States, it's probably not at this stage too damaging to Brexit negotiations - those will likely continue along the same lines as expected.  Reactions in other major currencies such as the dollar, euro and yen were limited. They had already largely shrugged off Thursday's testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which had been seen as the week's other big event.  (The election result) is more of a UK-specific negative development than a broader, global, macro one,  said MUFG currency strategist Lee Hardman in London.  The harder Brexit scenario could have some negative implications for Europe as well as some impact globally but at the end of the day it's still more of a regional story.  The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 110.385 yen and against a basket of major currencies was up half a percent at 97.392. The dollar index had fallen to a seven-month low of 96.511 midweek when caution ahead of Comey's testimony and the British election drove U.S. yields to their lowest levels since November. But yields have since bounced from the lows as risk aversion ebbed. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates after it ends a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and investors' focus is on whether it would leave the door open for further monetary tightening in the months to come. The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.3 percent lower at $1.1179, off a seven-month high of $1.1285 touched a week ago on improved growth prospects in Europe and a broadly weaker dollar. But the common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme.

Prices are down around five crowns to 65-66 crowns per kilo, and some are talking about even lower prices,  said an exporter who declined to be named.  There is more fish coming into the market and buyers are more hesitant after the recent rise to unsustainable levels,  he explained. In the coming weeks he expected prices to decrease gradually, before an uptick in July, and then to fall further to around 50 crowns later in the year when volumes will likely increase. A salmon producer predicted a somewhat smaller decline of 3-4 crowns per kilo to  just below 70 crowns . Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since rallied. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints are expected to support prices in the first half of 2017 before an expected increase in volumes later in the year. Leading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.

Davidson, whose colorful humor and approachability has won her many fans, notched up the Conservatives' best result since 1983 north of the border. She may yet prove key to choosing a new leader to replace the party's nationwide leader, Prime Minister Theresa May, whose future is now in question.  With an easy, raucous laugh, she is a self-described  shovel-faced lesbian , a literature graduate and a former journalist who says the army taught her the art of leadership when she was a reservist.  Davidson, 38, has unapologetically stood up for the United Kingdom.  I've never been afraid of debate and clash and think that's part of it. It's important that the Conservative voice isn't delegitimized,  she told Reuters prior to the election. In Britain's constantly shifting political landscape, she has reached Scottish voters by sticking to a message they not only understand but care about, as well as being more ordinary than the elite associated with her party 400 miles (644 km) down south in London.  I'm proud to be Scottish and British and female and gay and Christian and Conservative and a Fifer and fond of chips, a fan of  Hamilton  the musical and to prefer dogs to cats,  she told an audience at the Orwell Foundation last month. Scottish politics is quite distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom. Voters and parties are split between those who support the continued three-century economic and political union of England and Scotland, and those who want to break away.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats adopted the same message as the Conservatives by concentrating on opposing secession, and all did well on Thursday night. Davidson's forthright sense of humor also makes her different. Asked by Reuters if she objected to talking about personal issues, she laughed:  Just don't rummage in my knicker drawer.  She has gained traction by offsetting the dry image of May, whose Scottish approval ratings plummeted 15 points in three weeks according to pollster YouGov. In a campaign in which she rarely strayed off script, May earned the nickname  Maybot .  Also on the back foot is Scottish National Party leader and leader of the devolved Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon, who just a year ago seemed unassailable.  FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party leader Ruth Davidson speak during a general election campaign visit to a removals depot in Edinburgh, Scotland, June 5, 2017.Ben Stansall/Pool/File PhotoSturgeon's SNP won the election in Scotland, but its vote share fell after 10 years in power in Scotland's devolved parliament. Sturgeon has argued the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union is a seismic change which makes another vote on secession necessary because Scotland voted to keep its EU membership. But Scots do not want another vote so soon, if at all, after rejecting independence from the United Kingdom in 2014, although support for it is little changed at around 45 percent. Also helping Davidson has been the Labour Party's continued flip-flops on the union question.      Tank-Riding   Slideshow (10 Images)Scotland, more sparsely populated than the rest of the United Kingdom and with an 8 percent share of its economy, has not voted overwhelmingly for the Conservatives since the 1950s. On Thursday they won 13 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's 650 seat parliament, up from one. Davidson credits her  outsider's eye  for being able to overhaul the Scottish party after winning the leadership in 2011, and an ability to call a spade a spade. Critics say, however, that her high media profile, attractive in Westminster where politicians tend to show a more humdrum side, risks her not being taken seriously. She has been photographed on a tank with a British flag, or even atop a bull in the past, once describing herself as  a bit of a photo tart .  She's done very well to get where she has, but I think there is a danger that we've gone beyond the strong image with the marshalling of the troops, to her becoming almost a parody of herself with the tank-riding and bull-riding and flag-waving,  a senior SNP lawmaker said.

Akihito, 83, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare public remarks last year he feared age might make it hard for him to continue to fulfill his duties.  The soft-spoken Akihito, the first Japanese emperor who was never considered divine, has worked for decades at home and abroad to soothe the wounds of World War Two, fought in his father Hirohito's name. He will be succeeded by Naruhito, 57. In a vote televised live on NHK public television, the upper house of parliament passed the bill with a handful of lawmakers sitting out the vote. It cleared the more powerful lower house last week.  Abdication will take place for the first time in 200 years, reminding me once again of how important an issue this is for the foundation of our nation, its long history, and its future,  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters after the vote. Now the government has to hammer out the details of the abdication, including the timing, but media reports have said it is likely to take place at the end of 2018, which would mark three decades on the Chrysanthemum throne for Akihito. The abdication, the first since 1817, appears to have support among the general population, who view it as a sign of changing times. FILE PHOTO: Japan's Emperor Akihito smiles at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo February 23, 2011.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo In essence, the emperor is resigning, which I feel was an issue of personal thought,  said Masayoshi Matsumoto, a 47-year-old animator.  People live much longer these days. I think while on the one hand it pains him not to be able to carry out his duties properly, he may also wonder why he should have to do the job this long.  The government also has to ensure the continuity of a monarchy beset by a shortage of male heirs and shrinking pool of imperial family members. Women are not allowed to inherit the throne and leave the family upon marriage, an issue highlighted last month with the announcement that the Emperor's oldest granddaughter will marry a commoner. The law, which applies only to Akihito and not to future emperors, included a resolution to debate letting female royals stay in the imperial family after marriage but did not touch on the controversial topic of allowing women to inherit.  I believe we will look into all these issues rather broadly,  said Koichi Hagiuda, deputy chief cabinet secretary, at a news conference. Many conservatives oppose the idea of an empress, but some Japanese think the monarchy should also move with the times on this.  I have no problem with an empress, there are plenty of women royals ruling overseas,  said Yukinori Kumakiri, 61-year-old man working for an electrical company.  After all, the emperor is a symbol, it's not as if they really have power. They're a representative of the Japanese people and man or woman shouldn't matter.

Results show May's Conservatives have lost their majority in parliament. But May, facing scorn for running a lackluster campaign, is determined to hang on. A spokesman for her office said she would go to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government - a formality under the British system. Without the desired larger majority, May will now be in the thrall of two wings of her party that oppose her plans to leave the European Union:  purists  who want a clean break with the bloc and  remainers  who are pressing for closer ties, two Conservative sources said. That throws into doubt the complex talks on Britain's departure from the EU that are due to begin in just 10 days.  Brexit forever? How May's failed election gamble changes Brexit Latest updates and analysis following the UK election Dollar cleans up as UK election shock stuns sterling Washington      Former FBI Director James Comey prepares to testify before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on  Russian Federation Efforts to Interfere in the 2016 U.S. Elections  on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Bourg   During former FBI director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, he vividly recounted conversations with President Donald Trump that he viewed as an effort to undermine an investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Comey said that after his firing, he shared a memo describing his conversations with the president to a  close friend  and told him to share its contents with a reporter, a revelation that drew sharp criticism from Trump’s lawyer.   In his first tweet about the hearing, Trump wrote: “Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!”  But the investigation has contributed to a steady erosion of Trump's political capital. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken from June 1 to 5, even before the Comey testimony - 38 percent of Americans said they approved of Trump, versus 58 percent who disapproved.  Factbox: Did Comey's testimony support an obstruction of justice charge? World Europe's chief executive appealed to EU governments to forge a military alliance to defend the bloc and enhance its power abroad, warning that the United States was no longer prepared to do it for them.  China said it was monitoring U.S. military activities in the South China Sea, after two U.S. bombers conducted training flights over the disputed waters.  South Korea has found what appears to be a North Korean drone equipped with a camera on a mountain near its border with the isolated nation, the South's military said, suggesting the device was on a spying mission.  A woman detonated her explosive belt in a market east of the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala, killing at least 30 and wounding 35, Iraqi security sources said. Islamic State claimed the attack in the town of Musayab, south of Baghdad, in a statement on its Amaq news agency. It didn't identify the bomber.  Qatar vowed to ride out the isolation imposed on it by fellow Arab states over its alleged support for militant groups and said it would not compromise its sovereignty over foreign policy to resolve the region's biggest diplomatic crisis in years.   Russia may seize U.S. diplomatic property in Moscow and complicate life for an Anglo-American school unless Washington hands back two diplomatic compounds in the United States before July, the daily Kommersant newspaper reported. In December, then U.S. president Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russians over what he said was their involvement in hacking last year's U.S. presidential election, allegations Moscow flatly denies. The U.S. authorities seized two Russian diplomatic compounds, one in Maryland and another on Long Island, at the same time. Moscow did not retaliate, saying it would wait to see if relations improved under Trump.  Business SoftBank said it would buy two firms that build walking robots from Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc, adding to the Japanese company's growing artificial intelligence portfolio.  Governments across Asia - most notably Hong Kong and Singapore - have launched a raft of initiatives to grab a slice of the $100 billion invested in fintech globally.

Investors shovelled $16 billion into bonds in the week to Wednesday, with investment grade bond funds attracting $9.6 billion and high yield bond funds $1.4 billion, according to BAML data. Together, the $11 billion  monster  inflows are corporate bonds' highest since February 2015, BAML said. Year to date, inflows to corporate bonds are at $119 billion.  BAML also noted that precious metals enjoyed their largest inflows in 11 weeks at $800 million, and said the shift into safe-haven bonds and gold reflected rising event risk.  The bank's analysts pointed to the diplomatic crisis in the Middle East, where Qatar has been isolated by its neighbors, and the June 8 British election, which has resulted in a hung parliament. BAML also highlighted nervousness ahead of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, which also took place this week.  Comey was fired by President Donald Trump over his handling of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia.  The inflows even extended to low-yielding government bonds and Treasuries, which attracted $600 million, the largest inflows in 19 weeks. Emerging debt funds pulled in $2.3 billion, their 19th straight week of inflows.  Conversely, equities suffered $1.3 billion of outflows, with $5.4 billion of outflows from mutual funds outweighing $4.1 billion of inflows into equity exchange traded funds. Once again, it was U.S. equity funds that saw the biggest outflows, with $5.1 billion of redemptions. U.S. stocks have now suffered outflows in six out of the past eight weeks. European equities, however, attracted $900 million and emerging market equity funds received $1.2 billion.  The latter continues to top BAML's league table of cross-asset winners, returning 18.6 percent in dollar terms in the year to date. European equities are second, returning 17.2 percent, and gold third with 12.2 percent.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has upgraded Banco Popular Espanol, S.A.'s (Popular) Long-Term IDR to 'A-' from 'B' with a Stable Outlook. We have also downgraded Popular's VR to 'f' from 'b' following the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to put Popular into resolution and subsequently withdrawn the VR as the bank can no longer be assessed on a standalone basis. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions follow the 7 June 2017 announcement that Santander has acquired 100% of the shares of Popular at the price consideration of EUR1 as part of a resolution organised by the Single Resolution Board (SRB). Prior to the sale, the preferred stock and perpetual Tier 1 convertible notes issued by Popular were fully written down and subordinated debt (lower tier 2) was converted into equity. Santander will raise EUR7 billion of capital to fund the acquisition. KEY RATING DRIVERS SANTANDER IDRS, VR, DCR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Santander's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the impact of this transaction on the group's financial profile is broadly neutral. This is because the write-off of Popular's share capital and the bail-in of tier 1 instruments and subordinated instruments prior to the acquisition have been used to increase the reserve coverage of its problem assets substantially. Additionally the impact from integrating Popular's assets and liabilities on Santander's fully loaded CET1 will be offset by the planned EUR7 billion capital increase for which the group already has underwriting commitments. As a result of the capital increase, Santander expects no material impact on its fully loaded CET1 ratio, which stood at 10.7% at end-March 2017. In our view, execution risks are manageable given Popular's relative size to Santander (around 11% of total assets at end-2016) and the track record of the latter's management team in acquiring and integrating banks. We believe the group's plan to turn around Popular's business is credible, especially taking into account the positive trajectory in Spain's economy. Asset quality at the combined bank will initially deteriorate somewhat due to Popular's large stock of problem assets. However, we believe that the increased reserve coverage on Popular's legacy real estate-related assets (65% for foreclosed real estate and 75% non-performing loans (NPLs) to real estate developers) will facilitate divestments. Santander targets to halve the acquired stock of problem assets within 18 months and divest the bulk of it by 2020. Popular's acquisition strengthens Santander's competitive position in Portugal and provides it with the largest banking franchise in Spain, with a leading market share in SME banking. We expect the initial impact of the transaction on Santander's domestic profitability to be mildly negative owing to the integration and restructuring costs entailed. However, profitability should be restored gradually due to the potential for cost synergies, which Santander quantifies at around EUR500 million savings annually from 2020. Also the substantial additional provisions made as part of the resolution to write-down problem assets should alleviate loan impairment charges going forward. We believe that the acquisition will not have a material impact on Santander's funding and liquidity profile despite Popular experiencing liquidity pressures from customer deposit outflows in the weeks before its resolution. The group expects that the additional cost of larger TLAC-eligible debt issuance needs will be offset by Popular's cost of funding converging with Santander's. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Santander's Support Ratings (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floors (SRF) of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's belief that senior creditors of the bank can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that the bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for eurozone banks provide a framework for resolving banks that is likely to require senior creditors participating in losses, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Santander are notched down from its VR, in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. Subordinated (lower Tier 2) debt is rated one notch below the bank's VR to reflect above- average loss severity of this type of debt (one notch). Upper Tier 2 debt is rated three notches below the bank's VR to reflect above-average loss severity of this type of debt (one notch) and high risk of non-performance (two notches) given the option to defer coupons if the issuer reports losses in the last audited accounts. Preferred shares are rated five notches below the bank's VR to reflect higher loss severity risk of these securities compared with average recoveries (two notches from the VR), as well as high risk of non-performance (an additional three notches) due to profit test for legacy issues and fully discretionary coupon payments for recent issues. POPULAR IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING Popular's IDRs, senior debt ratings and SR have been upgraded following Santander's acquisition. This reflects our view of an extremely high probability of support for Popular by Santander, if needed given the plan to fully integrate Popular with the parent bank. Popular is 100%-owned by Santander and an integral part of the group as it strengthens Santander's SME franchise in Spain and overall competitive position. In our assessment of support, we judge that management and corporate culture at Popular will be highly integrated with those of its parent in a short period of time following the appointment of Santander's CFO as the new Chairman of Popular. In addition, within regulatory restrictions, Santander's capital and liquidity are highly fungible within the group, at least in the eurozone. Popular's SRF has been affirmed and withdrawn because the primary source of support for the bank is now Santander, rather than Spain. VR The downgrade of Popular's VR to 'f' reflects the bank's failure in the form of resolution action taken by the SRB. Loss of confidence from investors and customers had triggered a liquidity shortfall that urged European authorities to resolve the institution. According to the ECB, Popular's supervisor, it was failing or likely to fail in accordance with Article 18 (1) of the SRM regulation. The ECB determined that the significant deterioration of Popular's liquidity position in the past few days would make the bank unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due in the near future. As a result, the SRB decided that the sale of business tool for transferring shares to a purchaser met the resolution objectives and ensured financial stability was maintained in Spain and Portugal. Fitch has also withdrawn Popular's VR because the bank can no longer be assessed as a standalone institution given the intention to fully integrate Popular with the parent bank in a short period of time. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The downgrade and withdrawal of Popular's subordinated debt (lower Tier 2) and preferred stock and perpetual Tier 1 convertible notes ratings reflects the effective write-down to zero of these debt instruments as part of the resolution. The SRB exercised its power of write-down and conversion of these capital instruments prior to the transfer, to address the shortfall in the value of the bank. RATING SENSITIVITIES SANTANDER IDRS, VR, DCR AND SENIOR DEBT The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the group's overall credit profile will remain stable in the foreseeable future despite the execution risks of integrating Popular and the immediate deterioration of asset quality caused by the acquisition. Santander's VR (and hence the bank's IDRs) are unlikely to be higher than their current one notch above Spain's sovereign rating. An upgrade of the VR would be contingent on an upgrade of Spain's sovereign rating. This would have to be accompanied by further improved capital metrics while the positive asset quality trend prior to the acquisition is maintained and potentially accelerated given the acquisition of a weaker bank. This implies a speedy reduction of the large stock of problem assets at Popular. Equally important will be the preservation of the group's earnings resilience by delivering the planned cost synergies from the integration of Popular and maintaining sound earnings performance at major international subsidiaries. A downgrade of Spain's sovereign rating would trigger a downgrade of the bank's VR and hence Long-Term IDR. Downward rating pressure could also arise from a slower improvement in asset quality than currently anticipated in the rating, a substantial weakening of earnings, which we view as unlikely, or unexpected execution and integration risks emerging from Popular's acquisition that could compromise the accomplishment of the group's financial targets for 2018. The rating of second-ranking senior notes is primarily sensitive to a change in the Long-Term IDR of Santander. For the preferred senior notes and the DCR to achieve a one-notch uplift, the buffer of qualifying junior debt and non-preferred senior debt would need to exceed our estimate of a 'recapitalisation amount'. This amount is likely to be around or above the bank's minimum pillar 1 total capital requirement. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Any upgrade of the SRs and upward revision of the SRFs would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Santander are primarily sensitive to a change in its VRs. Upper Tier 2 notes and preferred shares are also sensitive to Fitch changing its assessment of the probability of their non-performance relative to the risk captured in the bank's VR. POPULAR IDRs, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT Popular's IDRs and debt ratings are sensitive to the same factors that might drive a change in Santander's IDRs. While it is not our base case, Popular's ratings would also be sensitive to a reduction in Santander's stake in Popular or if Popular does not become significantly integrated into the group in the short term, leading Fitch to conclude its strategic importance has reduced.

The feud complicates efforts to stabilize countries reeling from years of turmoil and undermines the notion of a Sunni Muslim Arab world united against terrorism and Iran, proclaimed by U.S. President Donald Trump in his visit last month. The quarrel is the latest chapter in the battle of wills between political Islamists and traditional Arab autocrats which has buffeted Muslim societies for decades. Since the 2011  Arab Spring  protests, which aspired to democratic reform but in several countries collapsed into warfare, Egypt and especially the United Arab Emirates emerged as main foes of an ascendant Muslim Brotherhood backed by Qatar. After Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE cut ties to Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting militants and Iran, regional allies followed suit and denounced domestic foes as Qatari stooges, undermining reconciliation efforts by foreign powers.  The whole situation has become very awkward. Qatar and its big rivals are fighting each other, but indirectly and on other people's territory,  said Yemeni analyst Farea al-Muslimi.  Having internal Arab messes like this escalate and get more complicated makes it pretty clear that the Arab world is far away from solving other issues like Palestine or Iraq or even the relationship with Iran.  In Libya, the UAE and Qatar, which both played key roles in backing rebels in the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, have emerged as rivals on the battlefield with conflicting interests and visions. The UAE, along with Egypt, has backed anti-Islamist former army commander Khalifa Haftar, appointed by a government and parliament based in the east. Qatar and Turkey have supported rival Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.  In Yemen -- mired in conflict since Saudi Arabia launched an air war in 2015 against the Houthi movement that controls the capital -- a southern Yemeni secessionist council armed by the UAE opposes the internationally recognized government because it includes the Qatar-backed Muslim Brotherhood. The council and Yemen's Saudi-backed government, despite years of Qatar ties, cut diplomatic relations with Doha.  The eastern-based Libyan government and parliament aligned with anti-Islamist Haftar did the same.  We are certain that the concerned states in the Gulf and Egypt will put pressure so as to drastically shift Qatar's outrageous policies,  Mohamed Dayri, the foreign minister of the eastern government, told Reuters. On Friday Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain designated as terrorists five Libyans including Tripoli Grand Mufti Sadiq al-Ghariani, an influential figure for anti-Haftar militias in western Libya. They also listed the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), a group that has tried to revive armed opposition to Haftar since last year.     FILE PHOTO: A traditional wooden fishing Dhow is seen in port near modern glass and steel buildings on the Doha skyline, Qatar February 9, 2010.Jacky Naegelen/File PhotoTime to Withdraw? Qatar has for years punched well above its weight in world affairs by parleying its vast gas wealth into influence across the region, irking the UAE and dominant Gulf Arab power Saudi Arabia with its maverick stances and support for Islamists. Now, Qatar's powerful neighbors appear to be demanding a retreat from those conflicts.  The message now is that it's time for Qatar to withdraw from the region and essentially not have an independent foreign policy,  said Peter Salisbury, an analyst at Chatham House.  It looks like Saudi Arabia and the UAE won't be satisfied until Qatar is pushed to stop funding the groups they don't like, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.  FILE PHOTO: General Khalifa Haftar, commander in the Libyan National Army (LNA), leaves after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Russia, November 29, 2016.Maxim Shemetov/File PhotoBut these demands come while Qatar's allies have for the most part been forced onto the back foot. Blessed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, former Egyptian army chief and now president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted the Qatar-aligned elected Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in a 2013 military takeover. Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, some of its leaders based in Doha, is no closer to leading the Palestinian people then when it fell out with secular rivals in the Fatah party in 2007. The Gulf spat is likely to further fuel inter-rebel conflicts in Syria, where rivalries between Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been showcased since the earliest days of the crisis.    Extremist Dividends  Qatar's friends who retain a plausible chance at national leadership, in Libya and Yemen, may have the most to lose from the row. Haftar styles himself as a bane of extremism, and has become the dominant figure in eastern Libya since launching a campaign against Islamist groups and former rebels in Benghazi three years ago. Many suspect he seeks national rule.   His supporters believe the Qatar spat vindicates their anti-Islamist stance, as Haftar has gained ground and the U.N.-backed Tripoli government that he has rejected has been floundering.   Any hardening of the Haftar camp's stance could complicate mediation efforts by Libya's neighbors to the west, Algeria and Tunisia, which have been pushing for an inclusive, negotiated solution.  Qatar being made an example out of ... means that Haftar, Egypt and the UAE will experience much less diplomatic pushback as they ramp up their military campaign inside Libya itself,  said Jalel Harchaoui, a researcher at Paris 8 University.

In many cases, workers are stepping up, attracted in part by guarantees that their principal is safe. It's far from clear how these guarantees would work, with employees in some cases being asked to buy shares and hold them for at least 12 months. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange - where all but one of the companies are listed - has taken notice, and has issued guidelines requiring companies to provide details on their guarantee plans, the Securities Times reported. Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance, says that however well intentioned these efforts are, usually by the companies' founders or big shareholders, there is a question mark over their financial ability to make such guarantees.  It could be driven by the genuine belief that the stocks are worth investing in. But it could be a desperate move to prop up share prices to avoid margin calls,  he said.  The promise to take any losses isn't legally binding and largely depends on big shareholders' virtue. And you can't rule out insider trading during the process, which is why regulators are demanding better disclosure,' he added. There were similar efforts during the 2015 China stock market crash, but then it was the government appealing to major shareholders' patriotism to buy and hold shares in what Beijing framed as a battle against speculators, both domestic and foreign. The scramble to raise share prices highlights the risks in using securities as loan collateral, a practice that by some estimates has quadrupled in China over the past two years. For the most part, the companies involved are private, small, and have seen their founders or major shareholders post large batches of stock as loan collateral in recent months. But falling share prices have eroded the value of that collateral, raising the specter of forced liquidation - where lenders, often Chinese brokerages, make borrowers sell the pledged shares. Selling the stock can further dent share prices, triggering a downward spiral. Share Bounce Shenzhen Fenda Technology Co (002681.SZ), which makes speakers and electronic accessories, was among the first to issue a statement, a week ago, encouraging staff to buy shares. At the end of March, Xiao Fen, the company's chairman and top shareholder with a 44.5 percent stake, or 416.4 million shares, had put up 84 percent of his holding as collateral for a loan, the company said. It did not say what the loan was for. Trading in the company's shares was suspended in late December pending a reorganization, but resumed in mid-April, when the stock price slumped to near their 2015 market crash low. Last Friday, Xiao promised any employee who bought shares in the company by June 6 and held them for at least a year would be shielded from losses.  A lot of colleagues I know have bought shares. I have too,  said one worker, who gave only his family name, Li.  The company is quite good and the chairman has guaranteed principal, so, of course, we're interested. I know some colleagues even bought shares with borrowed money.  Shenzhen Fenda Technology shares jumped by a tenth after the announcement, but have since edged back down. The price of Guangdong Biolight Meditech Co Ltd (300246.SZ) stock fell by a quarter this year, undercutting the value of the 14.6 million shares that its chairman Yan Jinyuan posted as collateral as of the end of the first quarter. On Monday, Yan made a promise like Fenda's Xiao, and the share price also rose. Sun Xishan, a sales worker at Biolight, said he missed the chance to buy stock on the day of the announcement, but would try to get in on the shares later.  I know the company well, it's in pretty good shape and its performance is growing. The chairman promised to cover losses if any, so it's hard not to be interested if one has money,  Sun said.

Investors shovelled $16 billion into bonds in the week to Wednesday, with investment grade bond funds attracting $9.6 billion and high yield bond funds $1.4 billion, according to BAML data. Together, the $11 billion  monster  inflows are corporate bonds' highest since February 2015, BAML said. Year to date, inflows to corporate bonds are at $119 billion.  BAML also noted that precious metals enjoyed their largest inflows in 11 weeks at $800 million, and said the shift into safe-haven bonds and gold reflected rising event risk.  The bank's analysts pointed to the diplomatic crisis in the Middle East, where Qatar has been isolated by its neighbors, and the June 8 British election, which has resulted in a hung parliament. BAML also highlighted nervousness ahead of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, which also took place this week.  Comey was fired by President Donald Trump over his handling of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia.  The inflows even extended to low-yielding government bonds and Treasuries, which attracted $600 million, the largest inflows in 19 weeks. Emerging debt funds pulled in $2.3 billion, their 19th straight week of inflows.  Conversely, equities suffered $1.3 billion of outflows, with $5.4 billion of outflows from mutual funds outweighing $4.1 billion of inflows into equity exchange traded funds. Once again, it was U.S. equity funds that saw the biggest outflows, with $5.1 billion of redemptions. U.S. stocks have now suffered outflows in six out of the past eight weeks. European equities, however, attracted $900 million and emerging market equity funds received $1.2 billion.  The latter continues to top BAML's league table of cross-asset winners, returning 18.6 percent in dollar terms in the year to date. European equities are second, returning 17.2 percent, and gold third with 12.2 percent.

Confident of securing a sweeping victory, May had called the snap election to strengthen her hand in the European Union divorce talks. But in one of the most sensational nights in British electoral history, a resurgent Labour Party denied her an outright win, throwing the country into political turmoil as no clear winner emerged. European Union leaders expressed fears that May's shock loss of her majority would delay the Brexit talks, due to begin on June 19, and so raise the risk of negotiations failing. May's Labour rival Jeremy Corbyn, once written off by his opponents as a no-hoper, said May should step down and he wanted to form a minority government. But May, facing scorn for running a lacklustre campaign, was determined to hang on. A spokesman for her office said she would go to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government - a formality under the British system. Sky News reported that Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) would back her, allowing the Conservatives to reach the 326 seats needed for a parliamentary majority. The DUP declined to comment. With 649 of 650 seats declared, the Conservatives had won 318 seats and Labour 261. The DUP, which took 10 seats, was considering an arrangement which would involve it supporting a Conservative minority government on key votes in parliament but not forming a formal coalition, Sky said.  If ... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do,  a grim-faced May said after winning her own parliamentary seat of Maidenhead, near London. But with complex talks on Britain's divorce from the EU due to start in 10 days, it was unclear what their direction would now be and if the so-called  Hard Brexit  taking Britain out of a single market could still be pursued. After winning his own seat in north London, Corbyn said May's attempt to win a bigger mandate had backfired.  The mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence,  he said.  I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  Chief among Labour's potential allies would be the Scottish National Party (SNP), which suffered major setbacks but still won a majority of Scottish seats. Brexit Risks  We need a government that can act,  EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.  With a weak negotiating partner, there's a danger that the (Brexit) negotiations will turn out badly for both sides.  The EU's chief negotiator said the bloc's stance on Brexit and the timetable for the talks were clear, but the divorce negotiations should only start when Britain is ready.  Let's put our minds together on striking a deal,  Michel Barnier said. But there was little sympathy from some other Europeans.  Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,  tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian premier who is the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit process. May's predecessor David Cameron sought to silence Eurosceptic fellow Conservatives by calling the referendum on EU membership. The result ended his career and shocked Europe. German conservative Markus Ferber, an EU lawmaker involved in discussions on access to EU markets for Britain's financial sector, was scathing.  The British political system is in total disarray. Instead of strong and stable leadership we witness chaos and uncertainty,  he said, mocking May's campaign slogan. Sterling tumbled as much as 2.5 percent on the result while the FTSE share index opened higher. The pound hit an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro.  A working government is needed as soon as possible to avoid a further drop in the pound,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in London. Craig Erlam, an analyst with brokerage Oanda in London, said a hung parliament was the worst outcome from a markets perspective.  It creates another layer of uncertainty ahead of the Brexit negotiations and chips away at what is already a short timeline to secure a deal for Britain,  he said.  Dreadful Campaign  Conservative member of parliament Anna Soubry was the first in the party to disavow May in public, calling on the prime minister to  consider her position .  I'm afraid we ran a pretty dreadful campaign,  Soubry said. May had unexpectedly called the snap election seven weeks ago, even though no vote was due until 2020. At that point, polls predicted she would massively increase the slim majority she had inherited from Cameron. May had spent the campaign denouncing Corbyn as the weak leader of a spendthrift party that would crash Britain's economy and flounder in Brexit talks, while she would provide  strong and stable leadership  to clinch a good deal for Britain. But her campaign unravelled after a policy u-turn on care for the elderly, while Corbyn's old-school socialist platform and more impassioned campaigning style won wider support than anyone had foreseen. In the late stages of the campaign, Britain was hit by two Islamist militant attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London, temporarily shifting the focus onto security issues. That did not help May, who in her previous role as interior minister for six years had overseen cuts in the number of police officers. She sought to deflect pressure onto Corbyn, arguing he had a weak record on security matters.  What tonight is about is the rejection of Theresa May's version of extreme Brexit,  said Keir Starmer, Labour's policy chief on Brexit, saying his party wanted to retain the benefits of the European single market and customs union. Analysis suggested Labour had benefited from a strong turnout among young voters. The campaign had played out differently in Scotland, the main faultline being the SNP's drive for a second referendum on independence from Britain, having lost a plebiscite in 2014. SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been a disappointing night for her party, which lost seats to the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Sturgeon should take the prospect of a new independence referendum off the table.

Overall emerging markets were kept in check by a firmer dollar and weaker Chinese factory gate prices that again cast doubts on economic growth, but MSCI's emerging equity index rose 0.2 percent for a 0.6 percent increase this week. Qatari stocks stabilised on Thursday after sharp falls, but pressure on its currency and bonds showed little sign of abating, with one-year dollar/riyal forwards hitting the lowest since December 2015 in offshore trade. The riyal has traded as low as 3.7 per dollar in onshore forwards markets, Thomson Reuters data shows, a record low, and some 1.6 percent below its spot pegged rate.  There is a bit of a spike but Qatar has plenty of reserves to fight the attack on the currency, so we don't think a de-peg is on the cards,  Societe Generale strategist Regis Chatellier said. He ruled out defaults despite pressure on Qatari bonds. Sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) also rose to a new seven-month high of 101 basis points (bps), almost double week-ago levels, according to IHS Markit. Saudi CDS touched their highest since February, indicating some spill over to the rest of the Gulf but this also is not expected to be serious.  Obviously this is not a positive story for ... any of the other countries ... it has a negative impact on the image of GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) as one unit and it makes it potentially more difficult to implement reforms overall,  MUFG strategist Trieu Pham said. He noted the GCC plan to implement a value-added tax from next year. But a positive global backdrop would limit the fall out, he said.  We see that even Qatar (assets) has not gone through the roof. At this point everything looks controllable so I don't see it spilling out (of the Middle East).  Broader emerging markets, however, are in good shape and inflows to emerging debt funds topped $2.3 billion in the past week - the 19th straight week of inflows. Emerging equity funds took in $1.2 billion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data showed. Elsewhere, the Czech crown jumped 0.4 percent to a new three-year high versus the euro, with higher-than-expected May inflation data pointing to possible monetary tightening later this year, and contrasting with the European Central Bank's (ECB's) dovish stance . Czech bond yields rose across the curve, with five-year yields hitting 10-day highs. There was little impact on emerging markets from the British election but Rabobank advised positioning for central European currencies to firm against the weaker pound.  The Czech crown has the biggest potential amongst its peers to appreciate against sterling. Even if the political situation stabilises ... downside pressure on sterling/crown is likely to prevail over the mid-term horizon given that the outlook for the Czech economy is relatively positive,  Rabobank told clients. Elsewhere, investors are carefully watching developments in Venezuela, which missed a $30 million interest payment to the CAF development bank, the development bank of Latin America, days after missing a $1 billion repayment to Russia. The Ivory Coast, meanwhile, issued the first euro-denominated bond sold by any sub-Saharan African country besides South Africa.

The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world's middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalization and a surge in private consumption.  It's the tyranny of large numbers,  Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world's second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world's fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. Related CoverageAirbus ready to boycott suppliers who perform badlyThe 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive.  Low-cost long-haul will work,  he told a media briefing at the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters. Twin-Aisle Demand Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing's proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes.  Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company's finance chief was also achievable.

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards ending at 152.85/90 per dollar, unchanged from Wednesday's close of 152.85/95. The markets were closed on Thursday for a Buddhist religious holiday.  The demand was there in the morning session. But the rupee ended steady as there were some inward remittances,  a currency dealer said, requesting anonymity. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Friday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trading was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. Hospitality and manufacturing are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said.

Opposition groups outnumber Rajoy's center-right People's Party (PP) in the Spanish parliament, but divisions among the two main left-leaning blocs have hindered their attempts to forge a front against him since a 2016 general election.     Pablo Iglesias, who led anti-austerity Podemos ( We Can ) into third place last year with about a fifth of the vote, said in an interview that his party did not see itself ceding the lead role in a Portuguese-style alliance to the center-left Socialists, which came second with only a slightly higher score.  We're almost on a par with the Socialist party, we even scored more than them in some areas, so I don't think it would  be sensible for anyone to offer a relationship as a junior partner to someone who is an equal,  Iglesias said.     In neighboring Portugal, the center-left Socialists have been at helm of a minority government since 2015 with the backing of two smaller far-left parties, in an alliance which has proved more stable that analysts and rivals had projected.  Podemos (We Can) leader Pablo Iglesias poses next to his parliamentary seat in congress following an interview with Reuters, in Madrid, Spain, June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Paul HannaPedro Sanchez, the newly re-elected head of the Spanish Socialists, has often praised the Portuguese formula, a rare success story for the European center-left which is increasingly struggling. [nL8N1HA06L] Slideshow (2 Images)Sanchez's comeback after he was ousted as the Socialist leader last year has raised expectations that Rajoy would face a rougher ride in parliament than he has since being re-instated for a second term last October with a minority mandate. But the Socialists and far-left Podemos, a young party which was born out of street protests during a recent recession, are  vying to occupy the same space in Spanish politics and have rarely been on the same page in terms of opposing Rajoy. Next week, for instance, the Socialists are set to abstain in a motion of no confidence against Rajoy filed by Podemos, criticizing the motion for being too hastily put together without a prior consensus. Iglesias did not rule out voting in favor of a motion of no confidence that would be put forward by the Socialists instead but such a move remains highly hypothetical given both leaders have repeatedly failed to agree on forming a government in the wake of Spain's elections in 2015 and 2016.

But Renzi said those hopes were slim and he appeared in no hurry for early elections, saying he wanted to focus on the country's main problems in the  coming days, weeks and months . Italian bonds and stocks have strengthened over the past 24 hours, with investors, fearful of political instability in the euro zone's third largest economy, betting that the breakdown of the accord would reduce the risk of snap elections this year. Renzi blamed the anti-system 5-Star Movement for the collapse of the pact and suggested that Italy could go to the polls using the existing voting system, with a few adjustments. But he gave no timeframe for such a move and left the door open for further talks with the main opposition parties, including Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia.  If there are the conditions so that we can draw up a nice law all together, with Forza Italia, with 5-Star; if unexpectedly people return to good sense and reason, then we will see,  he said in a webcast on his Facebook page.  Forgive me if I am not particularly optimistic on this point,  he added. The legislature is due to run until May 2018, but Renzi, who resigned as prime minister in December after losing a referendum on constitutional reform, has pushed behind the scenes for a snap election in an effort to regain power. However, President Sergio Mattarella has said parliament must first draw up new voting rules because at present there is too much divergence between the systems for electing members in the upper and lower chambers. Renzi's PD, 5-Star, Forza Italia and the Northern League agreed last week to back a proportional representation system. The deal imploded on Thursday after the PD lost a parliamentary vote on a minor, proposed amendment.  At this point we say, we did what was right to do for the country. 5-Star betrayed the pact,  said Renzi. 5-Star, which leads in most opinion polls, has acknowledged backing the amendment in the secret, parliamentary vote. The row has come ahead of municipal elections in many Italian towns and cities on Sunday. Parties will look to the results to see how their support is holding up before deciding on the fate of the electoral law.

Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region said this week it would hold a referendum on independence, a move that is also unlikely to be welcomed by the central government in Baghdad. Kurdish separatism is a sensitive issue for Turkey, which has been battling a militant insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast for three decades.  Ankara is also worried about the advances by a Syrian Kurdish militia in northern Syria, fearing that could embolden the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey.  We think this will represent a terrible mistake,  the foreign ministry said in a statement.  The maintenance of Iraq's territorial integrity and political unit is one of the fundamental principles of Turkey's Iraq policy.  The idea of Iraqi Kurdish independence has been historically opposed by Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria, as they all fear separatism spreading to their own Kurdish populations. Iraq's majority Shi'ite Arab community mainly live in the south while the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs inhabit different areas of the north. The center around Baghdad is mixed.

The sale is likely to be suspended indefinitely amid uncertainties at the parent firm, IFR added, citing bankers. FGV was not immediately available for a comment. The world's No.3 palm plantation group has begun an internal probe into some transactions at a subsidiary, while FGV's board suspended its Chief Executive Officer Zakaria Arshad and three others earlier this week. The CEO has denied wrongdoing and called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to conduct its own investigation. Officials from MACC spent nearly eight hours at FGV's headquarters on Thursday, seizing documents and interviewing company officials.  MACC is currently in the process of reviewing the documents that were seized to collect evidence relating to the investigation before further action is taken,  MACC Deputy Chief Commissioner Azam Baki said in a statement.  MACC will begin to call witnesses and individuals involved to help with the investigation shortly,  he added. The investigation focuses on six issues involving FGV, he said, without providing any details. Turmoil at FGV - whose biggest shareholder is state-owned Federal Land Development Authority - could hurt Prime Minister Najib Razak, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year.

The 36-year-old fisherman was among hundreds banned from fishing a stretch of water near the entry point for a pipeline that pumps oil 770 km (480 miles) across Myanmar to southwest China and forms a crucial part of Beijing's  Belt and Road  project to deepen its economic links with Asia and beyond.  How can we make a living if we're not allowed to catch fish?  said Nyein Aye, who bought a bigger boat just four months ago but now says his income has dropped by two-thirds due to a decreased catch resulting from restrictions on when and where he can fish. Last month he joined more than 100 people in a protest demanding compensation from pipeline operator Petrochina. The pipeline is part of the nearly $10 billion Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, a scheme at the heart of fast-warming Myanmar-China relations and whose success is crucial for the Southeast Asian nation's leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Embattled Suu Kyi needs a big economic win to stem criticism that her first year in office has seen little progress on reform. China's support is also key to stabilizing their shared border, where a spike in fighting with ethnic armed groups threatens the peace process Suu Kyi says is her top priority. China's state-run CITIC Group [CITIC.UL], the main developer of the Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, says it will create 100,000 jobs in the northwestern state of Rakhine, one of Myanmar's poorest regions. But many local people say the project is being rushed through without consultation or regard for their way of life. Suspicion of China runs deep in Myanmar, and public hostility due to environmental and other concerns has delayed or derailed Chinese mega-projects in the country in the past. China says the Kyauk Pyu development is based on  win-win  co-operation between the two countries.  Avoiding Panic  Since Beijing signaled it may abandon the huge Myitsone Dam hydroelectric project in Myanmar earlier this year, it has pushed for concessions on other strategic undertakings - including the Bay of Bengal port at Kyauk Pyu, which gives it an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East. Internal planning documents reviewed by Reuters and more than two dozen interviews with officials show work on contracts and land acquisition has already begun before the completion of studies on the impact on local people and the environment, which legal experts said could breach development laws. The Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone will cover more than 4,200 acres (17 sq km). It includes the $7.3 billion deep sea port and a $2.3 billion industrial park, with plans to attract industries such as textiles and oil refining. A Reuters' tally based on internal planning documents and census data suggests 20,000 villagers, most of whom now depend on agriculture and fishing, are at risk of being relocated to make way for the project.  There will be a huge project in the zone and many buildings will be built, so people who live in the area will be relocated,  said Than Htut Oo, administrator of Kyauk Pyu, who also sits on the management committee of the economic zone. He said the government has not publicly announced the plan, because it didn't want to  create panic  while it was still negotiating with the Chinese developer. Ambitious Deadline In April, Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw signed two agreements on the pipeline and the Kyauk Pyu port with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as Beijing pushed to revive a project that had stalled since its inception in 2009. Chinese port terminal seen in Made island outside Kyaukphyu, Myanmar  May 18, 2017. Picture taken on May 18, 2017.Soe Zeya TunThe agreements call for environmental and social assessments to be carried out as soon as possible. While the studies are expected to take up to 15 months and have not yet started, CITIC has asked Myanmar to finalize contract terms by the end of this year so that the construction can start in 2018, said Soe Win, who leads the Myanmar management committee of the zone.  Such a schedule has alarmed experts who fear the project is being rushed.  The environmental and social preparations for a project of these dimensions take years to complete and not months,  said Vicky Bowman, head of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business and a former British ambassador to the country. CITIC said in an email to Reuters it would engage  a world-renowned consulting firm  to carry out assessments. Although large-scale land demarcation for the project has not yet started, 26 families have been displaced from farmland due to acquisitions that took place in 2014 for the construction of two dams, according to land documents and the land owners.       Slideshow (12 Images)Experts say this violates Myanmar's environmental laws.   Carrying out land acquisition before completing environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans is incompatible with national law,  said Sean Bain, Myanmar-based legal consultant for human rights watchdog International Commission of Jurists.             Job Opportunities? CITIC says it will build a vocational school to provide training for skills needed by companies in the economic zone. It has given $1.5 million to local villages to develop businesses. Reuters spoke to several villagers who had borrowed small sums from the village funds set up with this money.  The CITIC money was very useful for us because most people in the village need money,  said fisherman Thar Sai Aung, who borrowed $66 to buy new nets.    Chinese investors say they also plan to spend $1 million during the first five years of the development, and $500,000 per year thereafter to improve local living standards.  But villagers in Kyauk Pyu say they fear the project would not contribute to the development of the area because the operating companies employ mostly Chinese workers.  From more than 3,000 people living on the Maday island, the entry point for the oil pipeline, only 47 have landed a job with the Petrochina, while the number of Chinese workers stood at more than double that number, data from labor authorities showed. Petrochina did not respond to requests for comment. In a recent report it said Myanmar citizens made up 72 percent of its workforce in the country overall and it would continue to hire locally.  I don't think there's hope for me to get a job at the zone,  said fisherman Nyein Aye. He had been turned down 12 times for job applications with the pipeline operator.

Thursday's election result wipes out May's parliamentary majority and throws Britain into political turmoil as it prepares to start talks to exit the European Union this month. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had  noted  the outcome of the election, but she would not comment directly, saying it was an internal affair.  But what I want to stress is that China will, as before, pay attention to the development of Sino-British ties,  she told a daily news briefing.  We are willing to work with Britain to promote even greater developments in relations.  As for the Brexit issue, we hope that Britain can appropriately resolve the relevant issue via negotiations with the EU side,  Hua added, without elaborating. China is high on Britain's list of countries with which to sign a free trade deal once it leaves the EU. Prior to Britain's vote to exit the EU last year, China had not directly stated an opinion, viewing the subject as an internal matter and saying only that it wanted to see a strong and stable Europe. Diplomatic sources, however, said that was coded support for the defeated  remain  camp, as the bloc, China's largest trading partner, will lose around a sixth of its economic output. While China and Britain have a history of disputes over human rights and the future of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the export-reliant Asian giant values Britain as a strong advocate for free trade within the EU. Ties have warmed in the past few years and economic links have multiplied in what both countries call a  golden age , though Britain upset China last year by putting on hold a nuclear project that it later approved.

Such  tumor-agnostic  drugs from companies including Merck & Co and Loxo Oncology may help overcome misgivings by health insurers, who have balked at covering large-scale tests looking for genetic mutations in tumors, and quell concerns of some top cancer doctors who question whether enough patients benefit from such tests.      Last month, Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda became the first cancer treatment ever to win U.S. approval based on whether the tumor carried a specific genetic glitch, irrespective of the tumor's location.  More recently, Loxo showed that its drug larotrectinib helped shrink tumors in 76 percent of patients with a wide variety of advanced cancers who carried a specific genetic defect.      The surprising results suggested a benefit of testing many patients for the same defects.          Insurance companies had an easy out  before the Merck approval and Loxo data, said Dr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Hyman presented the Loxo results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting last weekend.       They have asked, 'Show me the evidence this helps patients.' It didn't exist,  he said.  Now we have these data.      A second company, Ignyta Inc, has developed a drug that targets the same genetic glitch as Loxo’s larotrectinib, and both treatments are under expedited review by U.S. regulators.     At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, cancer chief Dr. Richard Pazdur said he is  very supportive  of the tumor-agnostic approach and believes more such approvals are likely.  What we're seeing is the result of a lot of work that has been done to determine how these drugs work,  Pazdur told Reuters. Such evidence may begin to sway insurers, but it's not clear how quickly. Aetna Inc said it is studying the Keytruda approval and will base its decision about testing based on the medical evidence and whether the treatments improve quality, reduce waste and provide members with access to affordable care. Dr. Jeffrey Hankoff of Cigna Inc said the company  generally does not cover multi-gene panels  unless they are recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit group that sets cancer treatment guidelines.  Ultimately, it's a matter of having actionable information from genetic testing that is based on evidence, not on conjecture,  Hankoff said.     Enthusiasm Waning     In 2001, Novartis drug Gleevec transformed the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) from a fatal blood cancer to a treatable condition for most patients. The drug takes aim at a single genetic defect, raising hopes for a new age of targeted drugs that work better and more safely than traditional chemotherapy.    Since then, gene sequencing has become exponentially faster and cheaper. Five years ago, companies such as Foundation Medicine introduced genetic profiling tests that look for a range of cancer-causing genes to match patients to a handful of targeted drugs for lung, skin and breast cancer or to clinical trials testing new agents. Many doctors have embraced the practice, hoping to find a treatment for patients with advanced cancers who were out of options. But insurers have been slow to pay for the tests, which cost $1,000 to $5,000 and can result in the off-label use of targeted drugs with no evidence that they work.      In late 2015, a randomized trial showed such testing yielded no survival advantage compared with conventional therapy. The finding triggered a fierce debate in medical journals, with some experts questioning whether hype has gotten ahead of the science.      There are patients that benefit, but it's very much a minority of the patients,  said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.         Hyman argues that the Keytruda approval based on a single genetic defect  changed the field overnight  and will gain momentum with the likely approval of larotrectinib, which targets a defect called TRK fusions. Experts estimate up to 1 percent of all cancer patients have TRK fusions.     Dr. John Heymach, an oncologist from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas who was not involved in the Loxo study, said it underlines  the importance of expanding what we're looking for.

The Cavaliers will try to begin a historic comeback from a 3-0 deficit and avoid starting the summer early when they host the Golden State Warriors in Game 4 on Friday.  I said it after we won the Eastern Conference finals that we're getting ready for a juggernaut,  Cleveland star LeBron James told reporters of the Warriors.  It's probably the most, most firepower I've played in my career. I played against some great teams, but I don't think no team has had this type of firepower.  That firepower allowed Golden State to overcome a six-point deficit in the final minutes of Wednesday's 118-113 triumph, capped by Kevin Durant's deep 3-pointer over James with 45 seconds to play. The Warriors improved to 15-0 in the postseason with the win and can become the first team in NBA history to sweep the postseason with a win on Friday.  I don't want to relax,  Durant told reporters.  It's not over. This is a crazy game, anything can happen. I'm just trying to enjoy this moment, try not to look in the future or the past.  TV: 9 p.m. ET, ABC ABOUT THE WARRIORS: Durant scored 14 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter on Wednesday and is averaging 34 points on 56.1 percent shooting - 52.4 percent from beyond the arc - in the series.  He took over,  Golden State coach Steve Kerr told reporters of Durant's Game 3 performance.  You can tell he knows this is his moment. He's been an amazing player in this league for a long time. He senses this is his time, his moment, his team.  Durant isn't the only Warriors player enjoying a strong series as Stephen Curry continues to put the pain of last year's Finals loss in the rearview mirror by averaging 28.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and nine assists in the series. ABOUT THE CAVALIERS: Cleveland overcame a 3-1 deficit to defeat the Warriors in the Finals last spring but is aware that a tougher challenge exists this time around.  From a mental standpoint, there is no other option, other than to prepare for Game 4 as best you can. That's it,  point guard Kyrie Irving told reporters.  This is as do or die as possible as I've ever faced in my career. So we understand what's at stake, our whole entire season. There's really no other decision, other than to leave it all out there.  James is averaging 32 points on 55.4 percent shooting, 12.3 rebounds and 10.3 assists in the series and Irving adds an average of 27 points, but the rest of the team is struggling to find a scoring rhythm. Buzzer Beaters 1. Golden State SG Klay Thompson is 10-of-18 from 3-point range in the last two games after managing six points while going 0-of-5 from beyond the arc in Game 1. 2. Cleveland PF Kevin Love went 1-of-9 from the field in Game 3, including 1-of-7 from 3-point range. 3.

The 24-year-old Arizona native struck out six in that contest, matching the sum total of his three previous outings. Davies recorded a quality start against the Diamondbacks on May 25, but he permitted two homers and three runs total in six innings and received zilch in terms of run support in a 4-0 setback. Delgado sustained a hard-luck loss in his last outing on Saturday, as he allowed just one run on six hits in 5 1/3 innings in a 3-0 setback at Miami.

The Rockies look to extend their winning streak to six games and continue their strong performance against the Chicago Cubs when the teams continue a four-game series Friday at Wrigley Field. The Rockies beat the Cubs 4-1 in Thursday’s opener, giving Colorado three wins in four meetings this season and seven of 10 against the Cubs since the beginning of the 2016 campaign. While the Rockies have won five straight and lead the NL West by two games, the Cubs are just one game over .500, though they’re only a game behind Milwaukee for the NL Central lead. The biggest difference for Chicago has been its starting pitchers, who had posted a 2.34 ERA through 59 games last season compared with a 4.65 mark this year, and the rotation took another hit with right-hander Kyle Hendricks (finger) landing on the disabled list Wednesday. Left-hander Mike Montgomery is set to make his first start of the season for the Cubs – he is 5-7 with a 4.23 ERA in 23 career starts.

Marquez did strike out a career-high nine Padres, but he also surrendered two home runs for the second straight start.

British voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in a snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil.  In our view, the lack of a majority for any party is likely to delay Brexit negotiations, scheduled to start very soon,  S&P; Global said in a statement.

Low prices for produce such as lentils and cereals amid a glut in supply have triggered protests by farmers in central Madhya Pradesh state and neighboring Maharashtra, where officials have said they will waive loans of some defaulting farmers. But the waivers will only benefit farmers who own land and do not address the main reasons for farmers' distress including landlessness and the small size of holdings, said Kishor Tiwari, head of a committee set up by the Maharashtra government to address farmers' issues.  Lease holders who cultivate others' land cannot avail of debt waivers, and they will continue to suffer until the government tackles reform of the farm economy,  he said.  The state must find a way to determine who the real cultivator is, and see that they get relief.  The five farmers shot dead in Madhya Pradesh when police opened fire to disperse a protest did not own the land they cultivated, the Indian Express daily reported on Friday.  About two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people depend directly or indirectly on farming for their livelihoods.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years with a slew of policies. Over the past decade, tens of thousands of farmers have killed themselves across the country, with  bankruptcy or indebtedness  cited as the main reason in official data. Most of these farmers were tenants who did not own the farmland, and therefore did not qualify for benefits such as subsidized loans or crop insurance, said Raghu Pillai, head of the land and livelihood hub at advocacy group ActionAid India.  Tenant farmers are not even recognized as farmers, and because they don't have the title to the land, they cannot get anything - not even compensation when they are dead,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We need changes in the tenant law to give them recognition and benefits.  Several Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, are adopting a model land leasing law aimed at giving tenant farmers greater access to benefits such as credit, but the move is opposed by landowners who say it jeopardizes their rights.

The competitors of Ohio-based Spangler Candy Co have, over the years, moved their plants south to Mexico and beyond to gain unfettered access to the cheaper sugar supplies there. That was part of a shift in manufacturing out of the United States that President Donald Trump has vowed to reverse. Spangler's Chief Executive Officer Kirk Vashaw has kept the candy cane industry alive in the United States at his plant in Ohio, where his firm churns out 200 million candy canes a year. But the new sugar supply deal will make things tougher still for Spangler, as an agreed rise in the minimum price for Mexican sugar will drive up Spangler's raw material cost.  To be honest, I'm just very disappointed that the Trump administration didn't do more to level the playing field, which is something they promised over and over again to do for the American worker,  Vashaw said in a phone interview with Reuters.  This was an opportunity to do that, and they didn't.  The firm is one of a wide range of food producers, drinks makers and cereal manufacturers across the country that will see sugar input costs higher by about $1 billion above government support prices, according to the Sweetener Users Association. Many of those companies, who oppose the government's support for the sugar industry, will have to consider whether to pass that rise in costs on to consumers. The additional cost is a fraction of the value of the packaged food industry, estimated at around $373 billion in 2016, according to data provider Euromonitor International. Food and beverage firms such as Hershey Co, General Mills Inc, J.M. Smucker Co, Mondelez International Inc will be impacted because they are all companies for which sugar is a key raw material. Hershey said in a statement that it was aware the agreement had the potential to increase sugar prices in the long term. Both Hershey and Mondelez referred Reuters to the Sweeteners Users Association, which in a statement described the pact as a  stealth price increase.  General Mills and Coca-Cola Co declined to comment. PepsiCo Inc, Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc and Mars Inc did not respond to request for comment.  This is putting America second,  said Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, where Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Sprüngli has its U.S. headquarters.  It's a bad deal for American families and businesses that will raise costs for consumers and threaten jobs in sugar-using industries.  Shaheen is a long-time critic of the sugar program and has pushed for changes. U.S. sugar companies - which process beet and cane before selling it to food and beverage industries - got better terms out of the deal and yet will not be impacted by the price rise. Refiners were insulated from the impact of the higher raw sugar price by a greater increase in the minimum prices for refined sugar in this week's agreement, so will simply charge the companies and consumers that buy their sugar more. The U.S. sugar industry had asked for better terms after complaining the previous deal with Mexico squeezed refinery margins and starved them of supplies. Cozy Deal The new deal revised the previous 2014 pact and aimed to end years of dispute between the two countries. Larger sugar refiners will benefit the most, as the new terms make it harder for smaller competitors to import sugar from Mexico, which is the top foreign sugar supplier to the United States. That means the smaller sugar buyers will have to pay more for their supplies. Access to the 11 million-tonne annual U.S. sugar market is coveted by sugar exporters as price of the sweetener in the world's largest economy is higher than elsewhere. The market is protected by the government, prices are guaranteed and imports are rationed. The combined impact of those measures means that U.S. sugar buyers will pay about 60 percent more than global benchmark prices. For Spangler, which makes Dum Dum lollipops as well, the rise in prices for Mexican sugar will translate to an around 8 percent rise in what it pays, estimates Vashaw. Spangler opened a plant in Juarez, Mexico, in the early 2000s and now produces a little over half its candy canes there.  If it was all about money, we'd do it all in Mexico,  said Vashaw.  When your main cost driver just went up 8 percent and in Mexico it didn’t go up at all, it just makes any foreign confectionary supplier more cost competitive. That's why a lot of companies moved out of the United States.

While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P; 600 index .SPSMCBKS of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P; 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks .SPXBK is unchanged. The full S&P; 500 .SPX, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals.  I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through,  said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks.  Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. Waiting for Clarity   Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts.         Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well,  said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P; Bank Exchange Traded Fund (KBE.P) and SPDR S&P; Regional Banking ETF (KRE.P) increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector.  Short interest in the S&P; bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble  winning congressional support for legislative changes to  regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report.         If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals,  said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

Alabama put Robert Melson to death by lethal injection at 10:27 p.m. local time at its death chamber in Atmore. It was the second execution in Alabama in 2017.  Melson made no last statement and there were no complications with the execution, prison spokesman Bob Horton said.  Melson was convicted of murdering James Nathaniel Baker, 17, Darryl Collier, 23 and Tamika Collins, 18, during a robbery at a fried chicken fast food restaurant in Gadsden, about 115 miles northwest of Montgomery.  It is my prayer that, with tonight’s events, the victims’ families can finally have closure,  Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said in a statement.  As the restaurant was closing at about midnight, Melson and another robber forced four employees to remove cash from the restaurant safe and then ordered them into a freezer, court documents said. Melson fatally shot three of the workers while the fourth, Bryant Archer, was shot multiple times but survived, the documents said. Archer identified one of the robbers as Cuhuatemoc Peraita, a former employee at the restaurant, but did not know the shooter, they said. Police later linked Melson to Peraita, who was 17 at the time of the killings and too young to be executed under U.S. law. Peraita was sentenced to life without parole. While in prison, he killed another inmate and currently is on death row, according to court records. Lawyers for Melson tried to halt his execution, arguing a drug in the state's lethal injection has been linked to troubled executions in Alabama, Arizona and Oklahoma, where inmates could be seen twisting on death chamber gurneys. They said its use violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The lawyers contend the drug, the sedative midazolam, does not render a person sufficiently unconscious for surgery and should not be used in executions where it is typically followed by a drug that halts breathing and another that induces cardiac arrest. Last week, a federal appeals court in Atlanta issued a stay of execution for Melson because of the drug issue. Alabama appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted Melson's stay, allowing the execution to proceed on Thursday.

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, closed at 2.9136 percent on Friday, more than eight basis points lower than the previous week's closing average rate at 2.9981 percent.      Traders said there were few signs of liquidity stress this week after central bank injections, though market expectations for tightening cash conditions towards the end of June have driven interest rates for longer-term loans higher.     The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for one-month tenor stood at 4.5854 percent on Friday, its highest level since April 2015. The three-month rate  also rose to a more than two-year high.     The one-year SHIBOR rate, which was lower than China's benchmark one-year lending rate until late May, has continued to rise and climbed to 4.4116 percent on Friday, its highest since May 2015. The one-year benchmark was 4.35 percent.     A Shanghai-based trader at a Chinese bank said monthly payments of a regulatory tax will begin next week, while the central bank's quarterly Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) will tighten liquidity further.     June traditionally has tight liquidity. In 2013, a China cash crunch that spooked global markets occurred in late June.     The People's Bank of China injected 498 billion yuan ($73.27 billion) into the financial system through its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Tuesday, more than offsetting the amount of maturing loans this month.     Three batches of earlier MLF loans totaling 431.3 billion yuan are due to mature in June, according to Reuters calculations based on official data from the central bank.     Market players did not expect the central bank to renew a batch of maturing six-month MLF loans with a value of 207 billion yuan next Friday, but anticipated the PBOC would raise its interest rates soon, with expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike next week.     In March, after the U.S. Fed raised interest rates, the PBOC lifted short-term interest rates in what economists said was a bid to stave off capital outflows and keep the yuan stable.     The central bank has injected 974.2 billion yuan on a net basis through the MLF loans so far this year, compared with a net drain of 775 billion yuan via open market operations during the same period, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data from the PBOC.     Nearly 200 billion yuan of accumulated net cash injection with longer maturity into the country's financial system this year clearly showed that the authorities have been walking a tightrope between maintaining overall liquidity in the market, while deleveraging and reducing risks without hurting the real economy.     In the open market operations, the PBOC drained a net 10 billion yuan from the money market this week, compared with a net injection of 30 billion yuan a week earlier.

The U.S. authorities seized two Russian diplomatic compounds, one in Maryland and another on Long Island, at the same time. Moscow did not retaliate, saying it would wait to see if relations improved under the incoming U.S. president, Donald Trump.  Kommersant, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, said on Friday that Moscow wanted the compounds back before a possible meeting at the G20 in Germany in July between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.  If that did not happen, the newspaper cited the sources as saying Russia could retaliate by seizing a U.S. diplomatic dacha, or country house, in Serebryany Bor in north-west Moscow and a U.S. diplomatic warehouse in Moscow. It said that Russian authorities could also complicate life for Moscow's Anglo-American school by altering its legal status. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that Moscow was still waiting for the return of its U.S. compounds and could retaliate in kind if that did not happen.

Autoliv argues it is on the cusp of accelerating growth just as the extra spending it needed to deliver on new orders tapers off, expecting to exceed a $12 billion sales target for 2019. But many investors remain skeptical. They have been more focused on muted sales growth and a squeeze on margins after the company took on more staff to meet demand. The Swedish company had $10.1 billion in sales last year and analysts have forecast $10.4 billion for 2017. Chief Executive Jan Carlson sees more rapid progress by 2019.  When we look at these more than $12 billion, that is absolutely mostly based on the order book we have,  Carlson told Reuters in an interview, adding the precise final outcome would depend on car production and product mix. Analysts are forecasting $11.8 billion in 2019 sales according to Thomson Reuters' SmartEstimate. Part of the issue for Autoliv is down to timing. Lead times between orders and revenue are about two years in passive safety and three years in active safety, Carlson said. The company sells radar products, vision systems and advanced driver assistance software in its active safety business. Airbags and seatbelts, standard issue for a number of years, are the top products in what is known as passive safety and which remains by far the largest contributor to sales. Takata last month reported its third consecutive annual loss following a scandal over the recall of its potentially deadly airbag inflators. Seeking to fulfill additional orders, Autoliv recruited an extra 1,000 engineers in the nine months to the end of March.  The market has been big as well, with record order intake during two years. So that is of course a big reason for us investing this money,  Carlson said. Investors are also fretting over the global car production outlook, while a phase-out of older braking systems and GPS modules is also weighing on Autoliv's growth this year.               FUTURE CHALLENGES    Autoliv's U.S.-listed shares rose in May, but are still down 10 percent over the past year, underperforming a 13 percent rise for the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles & Parts Index .DJUSAP. Underscoring market divisions over Autoliv's prospects, Morgan Stanley upgraded its shares to  Overweight  in late May,  calling the company  an overlooked safe haven .     Autoliv has taken half of the available passive safety orders since early 2015, compared with a market share of 39 percent on actual deliveries last year.  Both 2018 and also 2019 will be big launch years for us,  Carlson said, adding Autoliv could keep a market share on new orders above historic levels of just under 40 percent. Autoliv grew active safety like-for-like sales by 3 percent in the first quarter, and targets $1 billion in sales by 2020. Carlson said Autoliv was confident its close links and long history with carmakers would help it to remain a top player in the rapidly expanding active safety business, even as new competition enters in the race toward self-driving cars. It sees a new autonomous driving software joint venture with Volvo Cars, Zenuity, as a crucial part of that.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - With growth slowing and the formal start of Brexit negotiations only days away, the political uncertainty blown open by Britain's inconclusive election could not have come at a worse time for sterling. The greater chance a hung parliament will ultimately lead to a softer Brexit could bolster the British economy and currency in the long run, but in the near term investors should expect a higher degree of volatility in the pound. First, however, a bit of context. The second biggest British political miscalculation in living memory will have much less of a market impact than the first. Last year's Brexit referendum triggered the pound's biggest fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced over 40 years ago. Sterling plunged 10 percent plunge against the dollar. Implied volatility hit record levels, even higher than in the 2008 global financial crisis, forcing Bank of England governor Mark Carney to come out and calm markets. A few weeks later, the BoE responded to growing fears over the economy by resuming quantitative easing and slashing interest rates to a new low of 0.25 percent. Currency market moves on Friday so far pale against that. The pound has lost around 2 percent of its value, and one-month sterling/dollar volatility has risen to its highest only since January. Carney isn't expected to address the nation. But investors are building a higher risk premium into sterling. The difference between one-month implied sterling/dollar and euro/dollar volatility rose to 3.75 vol, its highest since October. Historically, implied sterling volatility has been lower than euro volatility. Barring a few brief spikes, sterling/dollar vol has consistently been lower than euro/dollar vol since the single currency's launch in 1999. The exceptions were 2008-10 and much of the time since last year's Brexit referendum. Even still, as recently as April, sterling/dollar vol relative to euro/dollar vol was the lowest since 2015 before snapping back as soon as Prime Minister Theresa May called the election. It's likely to remain elevated as economic and political uncertainty rise. This trend has been even more stark regarding euro/sterling and euro/dollar. Since 1999 euro/sterling vol has almost always been below euro/dollar vol. Again, the exception was June last year, and in recent weeks the gap has notably widened out again.  Sterling volatility is the winner,  said Jordan Rochester at Nomura. $1.20 Back on the Cards? There's little to suggest those volatility premia will come down. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's global outlook this week, British economic growth will slow to 1 percent next year. That will be the lowest of all 32 countries in the report bar one, sclerotic Italy. What's more, Britain will be the only one of those 32 countries to post slowing growth four years in a row from 2014 to 2018. Many economists say the election chaos could jeopardize business investment and consumer spending, putting risks to the economic outlook firmly to the downside. The political backdrop could, on the margins, make it even harder to convince overseas investors that they should keep on plugging the yawning UK current account deficit. Having one of the developed world's biggest current account deficits means Britain relies on  the kindness of strangers , in the words of BoE governor Mark Carney, to balance its books. Last year the deficit was 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, meaning Britain needed about $100 billion from abroad. There are signs that inflows from abroad may be slowing. The gloomy economic forecasts were already moulded on the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. From a political perspective, that uncertainty is now morphing into chaos. May's plea for a  strong and stable  government to guide the country through Brexit was rejected by the electorate. She has said she will not resign but the disastrous result has gravely wounded her, and it must be only a matter of time before she is replaced. But by who? A hard or soft Brexiteer? And will it make any difference anyway? Because her ruling Conservatives have no overall majority, there's a good chance another general election later this year will have to be held, potentially solidifying the growing political risk premium into the currency. This is the backdrop to the Brexit negotiations with the European Union that formally begin on June 19. Whichever way sterling goes - analysts say a fall towards $1.20 looks increasingly likely, while hopes of a softer Brexit would push it back above $1.30 - it's going to be a rocky ride.

Its appearance a day after Pyongyang tested a new type of anti-ship missile on Thursday, could spark questions about the state of South Korea's air defenses at a time when Seoul is trying to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programs.  In size and shape, the device looked like a North Korean drone found in 2014 on an island near the border, South Korea's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, adding that authorities plan to conduct a close analysis.  The drone found this time looks sloppy but slightly more slender than previous ones,  a South Korean military official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The device would be the latest of several North Korean drones to have flown into the South, with which Pyongyang is technically at war after the Korean war ended in a truce, rather than a peace treaty, in 1953.  In 2014, South Korea said three unmanned drones from North Korea were found in border towns.  A joint investigation by South Korean and U.S. militaries has concluded the craft were on reconnaissance missions for the North, which has denied sending spy drones, however, dismissing the findings as a fabrication. Last year, South Korea fired warning shots at a suspected North Korean drone, forcing it to turn back. North Korea owns around 300 unmanned aerial vehicles of different types including reconnaissance, target and combat drones, the United Nations said in a report last year. The North Korean drones recovered in South Korea were probably procured through front companies in China, with parts manufactured in China, the Czech Republic, Japan and the United States, it added.

Autoliv argues it is on the cusp of accelerating growth just as the extra spending it needed to deliver on new orders tapers off, expecting to exceed a $12 billion sales target for 2019. But many investors remain skeptical. They have been more focused on muted sales growth and a squeeze on margins after the company took on more staff to meet demand. The Swedish company had $10.1 billion in sales last year and analysts have forecast $10.4 billion for 2017. Chief Executive Jan Carlson sees more rapid progress by 2019.  When we look at these more than $12 billion, that is absolutely mostly based on the order book we have,  Carlson told Reuters in an interview, adding the precise final outcome would depend on car production and product mix. Analysts are forecasting $11.8 billion in 2019 sales according to Thomson Reuters' SmartEstimate. Part of the issue for Autoliv is down to timing. Lead times between orders and revenue are about two years in passive safety and three years in active safety, Carlson said. The company sells radar products, vision systems and advanced driver assistance software in its active safety business. Airbags and seatbelts, standard issue for a number of years, are the top products in what is known as passive safety and which remains by far the largest contributor to sales. Takata last month reported its third consecutive annual loss following a scandal over the recall of its potentially deadly airbag inflators. Seeking to fulfill additional orders, Autoliv recruited an extra 1,000 engineers in the nine months to the end of March.  The market has been big as well, with record order intake during two years. So that is of course a big reason for us investing this money,  Carlson said. Investors are also fretting over the global car production outlook, while a phase-out of older braking systems and GPS modules is also weighing on Autoliv's growth this year.               FUTURE CHALLENGES    Autoliv's U.S.-listed shares rose in May, but are still down 10 percent over the past year, underperforming a 13 percent rise for the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles & Parts Index .DJUSAP. Underscoring market divisions over Autoliv's prospects, Morgan Stanley upgraded its shares to  Overweight  in late May,  calling the company  an overlooked safe haven .     Autoliv has taken half of the available passive safety orders since early 2015, compared with a market share of 39 percent on actual deliveries last year.  Both 2018 and also 2019 will be big launch years for us,  Carlson said, adding Autoliv could keep a market share on new orders above historic levels of just under 40 percent. Autoliv grew active safety like-for-like sales by 3 percent in the first quarter, and targets $1 billion in sales by 2020. Carlson said Autoliv was confident its close links and long history with carmakers would help it to remain a top player in the rapidly expanding active safety business, even as new competition enters in the race toward self-driving cars. It sees a new autonomous driving software joint venture with Volvo Cars, Zenuity, as a crucial part of that. Zenuity expects its first revenue in 2019, and plans to offer fully autonomous driving software by 2021.       Carlson said he expects costs for research, development and engineering to reach their peak relative to sales during the second half of 2017, and then begin falling.      Chip giant Intel's (INTC.O) $15 billion deal this year to buy Israel's Mobileye (MBLY.N), market leader in camera-based monovision algorithms, highlighted the growth potential and heady valuations in the sector. A move in 2014 to develop a stereo-vision camera saw Autoliv part company with Mobileye as a supplier. That left a gap in its product portfolio filled only in early 2016 when the latest Mercedes E-Class was launched with Autoliv's new gear. Since then Autoliv has won 25 percent of available active safety orders and these will start going into production in 2019 and 2020, Carlson said.

Two days after unveiling a multi-billion euro plan to help fund European defense research, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was time to integrate militaries and defense industries, seizing on the strong backing from France's new president and Britain's decision to leave the bloc.  I see the tide turning,  Juncker told a conference in Prague, citing growing support in EU capitals for military cooperation, notably from French President Emmanuel Macron.   The call I make today is not only in favor of a Europe of defense — it is a call in defense of Europe,  he said. Although the European Union has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Britain had long blocked EU defense integration, fearing a European army that would challenge national sovereignty. NATO broadly supports EU defense integration, as 22 EU states are members of the U.S.-led alliance. Chiding the bloc for decades of failed attempts to work together on defense since the 1950s, Juncker said that even before the election of President Donald Trump, the United States considered it was paying too much for wealthy Europe's security. With Trump, who has sharply criticized European states for not spending enough on defense and has refused to explicitly support NATO, the reality was more stark, he said.  NATO can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts,  Juncker said. He said the United States is  no longer interested in guaranteeing Europe's security in our place.   The economically powerful EU has long been able to boast of a  soft power  with recent diplomatic successes including its role in brokering the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. But the EU's inability to help bring peace to Syria or significantly influence events abroad, from Turkey to the Middle East, meant that soft power was not enough, Juncker said.  We have no other choice than to defend our own interests in the Middle East, in climate change, in our trade agreements.  EU leaders will discuss broad European defense plans, first put forward by France and Germany following Britain's EU referendum a year ago, at a summit on June 22-23 in Brussels. France, Germany and Italy want ways to pay for common military missions abroad, to be able to use EU battlegroups for the first time and for industries to collaborate and develop weapons and helicopters that can be used by all EU armies. EU states jealously protect their defense contractors, meaning the bloc has developed 178 different weapons systems, compared to 30 in the United States.  Absurdly, there are more helicopter types then there are governments to buy them,  Juncker said.

Low prices for produce such as lentils and cereals amid a glut in supply have triggered protests by farmers in central Madhya Pradesh state and neighboring Maharashtra, where officials have said they will waive loans of some defaulting farmers. But the waivers will only benefit farmers who own land and do not address the main reasons for farmers' distress including landlessness and the small size of holdings, said Kishor Tiwari, head of a committee set up by the Maharashtra government to address farmers' issues.  Lease holders who cultivate others' land cannot avail of debt waivers, and they will continue to suffer until the government tackles reform of the farm economy,  he said.  The state must find a way to determine who the real cultivator is, and see that they get relief.  The five farmers shot dead in Madhya Pradesh when police opened fire to disperse a protest did not own the land they cultivated, the Indian Express daily reported on Friday.  About two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people depend directly or indirectly on farming for their livelihoods.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years with a slew of policies. Over the past decade, tens of thousands of farmers have killed themselves across the country, with  bankruptcy or indebtedness  cited as the main reason in official data. Most of these farmers were tenants who did not own the farmland, and therefore did not qualify for benefits such as subsidized loans or crop insurance, said Raghu Pillai, head of the land and livelihood hub at advocacy group ActionAid India.  Tenant farmers are not even recognized as farmers, and because they don't have the title to the land, they cannot get anything - not even compensation when they are dead,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We need changes in the tenant law to give them recognition and benefits.  Several Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, are adopting a model land leasing law aimed at giving tenant farmers greater access to benefits such as credit, but the move is opposed by landowners who say it jeopardizes their rights.

It is now tasked with minimizing fallout as it restructures its money-losing India operations, which will continue making cars for export. At the same time, the firm has had to fend off an attack from a hedge fund demanding change at the top after a 16 percent stock price fall during the current CEO's tenure.

GM India is working directly with our dealers to transition to authorized service outlets and to recognize some of the investments made in dealerships.

The three DAB members plus three more dealers told Reuters the offer was too low. One of the DAB members said compensation amounted to about 10 to 12 percent of their original investment, and that it should be  higher by a few multiples .

Overall emerging markets were kept in check by a firmer dollar and weaker Chinese factory gate prices that again cast doubts on economic growth, but MSCI's emerging equity index hovered near flat for a half-percent rise this week. Qatari stocks had stabilised on Thursday after sharp falls but pressure on its currency and bonds showed little sign of abating, with one-year dollar/riyal forwards hitting the lowest since December 2015 in offshore trade. The riyal has traded as low as 3.7 per dollar in onshore forward markets, Thomson Reuters data shows, a record low, and some 1.6 percent below its spot pegged rate.  There is a bit of a spike but Qatar has plenty of reserves to fight the attack on the currency, so we don't think a de-peg is on the cards,  Societe Generale strategist Regis Chatellier said. He ruled out defaults despite pressure on Qatari bonds. Sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) also rose to a new seven-month high of 101 basis points (bps), almost double week-ago levels, according to IHS Markit. Saudi CDS touched their highest since February, indicating some spill over to the rest of the Gulf but this also is not expected to be serious.  Obviously this is not a positive story for ... any of the other countries ... it has a negative impact on the image of GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) as one unit and it makes it potentially more difficult to implement reforms overall,  MUFG strategist Trieu Pham said. He noted the GCC plan to implement a value-added tax from next year. But a positive global backdrop would limit the fallout, he said.  We see that even Qatar (assets) has not gone through the roof. At this point everything looks controllable so I don't see it spilling out (of the Middle East).  Elsewhere, the Czech crown jumped 0.4 percent to a new three-year high versus the euro, with higher-than-expected May inflation data pointing to possible monetary tightening later this year, and contrasting with the European Central Bank's (ECB's) dovish stance . Czech bond yields rose across the curve, with five-year yields hitting 10-day highs.

Plassat, credited with saving Carrefour from a possible break-up, leaves a group which has progressed in most of Europe and in Brazil, its second-largest market. But a more sluggish performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has hampered the stock's performance.

The step comes as Japan looks to boost the use of generics to 80 percent by September 2020 from about 56 percent now, thus saving the government hundreds of billions of yen every year. To ease the burden on the national health insurance system, the government last month said it would consider having patients who prefer expensive advance prescription drugs pay the difference in cost over generic drugs. In an annual draft of policy guidelines that incorporated the change, the government also floated the idea of lowering the prices of these prescription drugs to the levels of generic drugs. But the proposals were missing from the final version of the annual policy guidelines approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet on Friday.  These proposals serve as materials for consideration but should not be taken as a certain course of direction,  a Cabinet Office official told reporters on condition of anonymity. A decision made by the end of year would weigh up various factors, he added, without elaborating. The change followed deliberations on the draft by ruling party officials, including those voicing the interests of drugmakers worried about hits to revenues. In December, the government said it would review official pricing every year, instead of every two years, and would widen the review to cover all prescription drugs, following drastic price cuts for two blockbuster drugs. Previously the government only reviewed cases of a large discrepancy between the official price, which determines how much the National Health Insurance system reimburses medical providers, and the actual price charged to wholesalers. On the fiscal front, the government's policy guidelines set a new fiscal goal, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, along with its primary budget surplus target, in what investors view as a shift toward diluting fiscal reform. The government's guidelines made no mention of a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent now, a measure now planned for October 2019, fuelling speculation that it is preparing to further put it off. Separately, Abe's cabinet also approved the government's economic growth plans, which target package delivery by drone sometime in the 2020s.

Any disruption in any mature region or market that is relevant for us is a reason for concern,  Chief Executive Tom Enders told reporters. Referring to the aviation blockade against Qatar imposed by Saudi Arabia and others this week, Enders said:  That's a development that is troubling for our industry, for many industries. We sincerely hope that these disruptions are not developing to a long-term conflict.  The bust-up between Arab powers has dealt a blow to Gulf carriers already hurt by low oil prices and laptop bans and exposed the sensitivity of Gulf hubs to regional uncertainty,  delegates at an airlines meeting said this week.. Analysts say any prolonged disruption could prompt Qatar to delay taking aircraft deliveries from Airbus and Boeing. Speaking at a media briefing ahead of the June 19-25 Paris Airshow, Enders played down suggestions that Airbus, the world's second-largest planemaker behind Boeing (BA.N), was too reliant on the Middle East.   We are far from being over exposed… to this region,  he said, noting it made up 13 percent of unfilled orders. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders speaks during a news conference on the aerospace group's annual results, in London, Britain February 24, 2016.Hannah McKay I think this region will remain important and relevant even allowing for some recouping, some consolidation; nobody can exclude that for the long term.  With talks looming on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Enders said Airbus's UK plants were among its most competitive and warned against crimping this advantage through restrictions on people or goods.  We are a company that is obviously very interested in the free flow of people. The mobility between our sites in Europe is crucially important,  he said. FILE PHOTO: The cockpit of an Airbus A350-900 of Ethiopian Airlines is photographed during a site-inspection at Fraport airport in Frankfurt, Germany, May 22, 2017.Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo Any tariff barriers could also potentially impact the competitiveness of our activities in Britain.  Enders was speaking shortly before a shock exit poll suggested that UK Prime Minister Theresa May had failed to maintain an overall majority after calling an election to strengthen her Conservative government's position ahead of EU negotiations. Several companies have expressed concerns over a so-called 'hard Brexit' under which trade tariffs could apply. Enders said  any British government paying attention to the importance of the aerospace industry is well aware of what is at stake .

The step comes as Japan looks to boost the use of generics to 80 percent by September 2020 from about 56 percent now, thus saving the government hundreds of billions of yen every year. To ease the burden on the national health insurance system, the government last month said it would consider having patients who prefer expensive advance prescription drugs pay the difference in cost over generic drugs. In an annual draft of policy guidelines that incorporated the change, the government also floated the idea of lowering the prices of these prescription drugs to the levels of generic drugs. But the proposals were missing from the final version of the annual policy guidelines approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet on Friday.  These proposals serve as materials for consideration but should not be taken as a certain course of direction,  a Cabinet Office official told reporters on condition of anonymity. A decision made by the end of year would weigh up various factors, he added, without elaborating. The change followed deliberations on the draft by ruling party officials, including those voicing the interests of drugmakers worried about hits to revenues. In December, the government said it would review official pricing every year, instead of every two years, and would widen the review to cover all prescription drugs, following drastic price cuts for two blockbuster drugs. Previously the government only reviewed cases of a large discrepancy between the official price, which determines how much the National Health Insurance system reimburses medical providers, and the actual price charged to wholesalers. On the fiscal front, the government's policy guidelines set a new fiscal goal, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, along with its primary budget surplus target, in what investors view as a shift toward diluting fiscal reform. The government's guidelines made no mention of a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent now, a measure now planned for October 2019, fuelling speculation that it is preparing to further put it off. Separately, Abe's cabinet also approved the government's economic growth plans, which target package delivery by drone sometime in the 2020s.

(Reuters) - Kaliesha Andino has spent the last year running from gunshots. At night, she flashes back to her hiding spot behind a bar in a Florida nightclub, where a bullet ripped through her arm during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The date her life shattered, June 12, 2016, is tattooed in Roman numerals on her other arm, along with images of clouds and an eye to memorialize a friend who was among the 49 people killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Like others who got out alive, Andino, 20, has spent the year since the attack navigating the line between victim and survivor. Her physical wounds have healed. But she searches for exits in crowded rooms and has not been working.   I will never have closure,  she said, adding:  I've got to live right now. I have to cope with the situation.  The death toll in the attack marked the worst in a spate of U.S. shooting rampages in recent years - from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut to an office party in San Bernardino, California - that stoked debate about gun control and left communities grappling with deep emotional and physical wounds. Counseling and medical needs have consumed many survivors working to establish a new normal after gunman Omar Mateen opened fire at Pulse during Latin music night. Some saw their trauma magnified when the tragedy at the gay club outed them as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). One survivor recently had a lodged bullet removed. Others have struggled at times to leave home after the rampage, which also left more than 50 people injured. Mateen held hostages inside for three hours before he died in an exchange of gunfire with police.   They are still so raw,  said attorney Antonio Romanucci, who is suing Mateen's ex-employer and widow on behalf of dozens of victims, including Andino and relatives of some of the deceased.  They are still living it.   Approximately 300 people who were at the club or directly tied to the victims still receive support services from the Orlando United Assistance Center. That is down from the more than 800 helped in the immediate aftermath, said Michael Aponte, director for the resource hub, which involves government and community groups.

People from around the world have left mementos and scrawled notes, now fading in the sun.  Never stop dancing,  reads an inscription on a parking lot barrier. To honor the one-year mark on Monday, June 12, Pulse owner Barbara Poma plans to open the club gate so survivors and victims' relatives can gather inside at 2:02 a.m., when the first shots were fired.   Everybody is still in very different places,  Poma said.  I would not say there is anybody that is ready to move on.

He hears bullets pounding the floor and people screaming, he said in Spanish through a translator. He smells blood. The first shot to hit him struck his right arm. Two more tore into his legs. Falling to his knees, Cufiño waited for a fatal blow. A fourth shot pierced his back. When police arrived waving flashlights, the former physical education teacher mustered all his strength to signal that he was alive. He remembers an officer dragging him out by an arm. Three months later, Cufiño awoke from a medically induced coma and learned he would never walk again.  After a year of surgeries and rehabilitation, Cufiño still needs help dressing. But he can lift himself out of his wheelchair and hopes one day to prove medical experts wrong.  In this moment, I don't know what it is to be a survivor,  he said in Spanish.

Voters dealt May a devastating blow in the snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil.  Following are some scenarios for Brexit: Brexit Talks Formal Brexit talks were due to start on June 19, just under two years ahead of a British exit due in March 2019. But May has no majority and British politics is now deadlocked, meaning talks could be delayed. While May remains prime minister until a new government is formed, she does not have a clear mandate for her interpretation of Brexit that includes limits on immigration and leaving the single market.      Theresa May arrogantly gambled with our Brexit and blew it,  said a spokesman for the Leave.EU pro-Brexit campaign.  We demand fresh leadership immediately.    Germany said there was no time to lose on negotiating Brexit because time was ticking. France said the election result would not call into question Britain's decision to exit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Brexit talks should go ahead as planned.  Given that Britain has already triggered the formal divorce talks, it is unclear what mechanism could be used to delay the negotiations. Brexit Hard or Soft? If May forms a minority government with support from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), then she would enter Brexit talks heavily dependent on one side of the divide in Northern Ireland and on the eurosceptic wing of her own party. Her ability to drive Brexit reforms through parliament is sharply diminished. With less room for manoeuvre, she may be forced to reject compromises proposed by Brussels and drive a harder bargain.  The likely narrowness of the majority will give an ability for any small grouping of Conservative MPs to potentially block legislation,  JPMorgan said.  She warned EU ambassadors in January that attempts to punish Britain would be an  act of calamitous self-harm  for EU countries and repeatedly told voters during the campaign that she would be prepared to walk away from talks without a deal. A disorderly Brexit with no deal would spook financial markets, tarnish London's reputation as one of the world's top two financial centres and sow chaos through the economies of Britain and the EU by dislocating trading relationships.  The hung parliament makes both a 'soft' Brexit (staying in the Single Market) and a chaotic Brexit (no deal) more likely than before, potentially even a second referendum,  Citi said in a research note. Still,  'hard-but-smooth' Brexit would remain our base case,  Citi said.  Will Brexit Happen? May has insisted that Brexit means Brexit but it is unclear how long she will remain in power or whether another British election will be called.  If May resigns, the negotiations could be delayed by months due to the leadership contest, potentially new elections and even another process to design the UK’s negotiation strategy,  Citi said. If talks are delayed for long - and if British political turmoil continues - then the timetable for Brexit will slip while uncertainty could undermine economic confidence. Before her defeat, May said she wanted to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. Corbyn, who voted against EU membership in 1975 but said he voted for membership in 2016, told voters the issue of Brexit had been settled. He wants a trade deal and a guarantee that EU worker rights be preserved as part of any Brexit agreement.  Whatever happens Theresa May is toast – it is just a matter of time,  Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said.  Quite frankly I don’t know what’s going to happen.  But Farage said he feared Corbyn could somehow manage to form a minority government that would allow a second Brexit referendum. The Liberal Democrats, whose votes in parliament could help sustain a Labour government, campaigned on the position that Britons should be able to vote again on the terms of the final EU deal, and stay in the bloc if the deal was rejected. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has argued that Scotland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU last year, should have the right to hold an independence referendum at the end of the Brexit process.  As a Brexiteer who believes in it with all his heart and soul, my fear is that Corbyn forms a coalition with the SNP and a few Lib Dems and we look down the barrels of a second referendum in a few years time,  Farage said.

China is trying to verify this information and is also ascertaining details about the victims, she added.  China resolutely opposes and strongly condemns all forms of terrorism, and supports Pakistan's efforts to fight terrorism and maintain domestic security and stability,  Hua said. Pakistan had gone all out in its rescue efforts and had promised to continue to do its utmost to protect Chinese citizens, she added. The kidnapping was a rare security incident involving Chinese nationals in Pakistan, where Beijing has pledged $57 billion under its massive  Belt and Road  initiative to build rail, road and power infrastructure. China says Pakistan, a long-time political and military ally, is a major part of its plans to build a modern day  Silk Road  network of land and maritime routes to connect Asia with Africa and Europe. Key parts of the infrastructure will be in Baluchistan, including the new port of Gwadar, which will be linked to western China under current plans. The killing of the teachers was claimed by Islamic State's Amaq news agency on Thursday.  Islamic State fighters killed two Chinese people they had been holding in Baluchistan province, southwest Pakistan,  Amaq said. A Baluchistan government spokesman said officials were in the process of confirming whether the report was correct. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan's interior ministry or its foreign office. Greater Caution Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, said in an editorial on Friday China would never bow in the face of terror, but also said Chinese people should exercise greater caution abroad, especially in more remote areas.  They also need to raise their ability to protect themselves, and as much as possible put distance between themselves and real danger,  it said. The claim of the killings sparked anger on Chinese social media, with some strongly anti-Muslim comments. Islamic State, which controls some territory in neighboring Afghanistan, has struggled to establish a presence in Pakistan. However, it has claimed several major attacks, including one on the deputy chairman of the Senate last month in Baluchistan, in which 25 people were killed. On Thursday, Pakistan's military published details of a three-day raid on a militant hideout in a cave not far from Quetta, saying it had killed 12  hardcore terrorists  from a banned local Islamist group and prevented Islamic State from gaining a  foothold  in Baluchistan. China's ambassador to Pakistan and other officials have often urged Islamabad to improve security, especially in Baluchistan. The numbers of Pakistanis studying Mandarin has skyrocketed since 2014, when President Xi Jinping signed off on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Consequently, any attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan would come as an embarrassment to Islamabad, which greatly prizes its relationship with Beijing. The two refer to each other as  all weather friends . Security in Baluchistan has improved in recent years, but separatists, who view infrastructure projects as a ruse to steal natural resources, killed 10 Pakistani workers building a road near Gwadar this month. China has also expressed concern about militants in Pakistan linking up with what China views as separatists in the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have been killed in violence in recent years.

The South Asian nation is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week. Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modi's promise to double farmers' incomes over the next five years.  The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realization,  said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai. Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers. Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices. Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of India's 1.3 billion people. Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding  production has jumped but local demand hasn't risen in the same proportion . Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.  There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive,  said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body. FILE PHOTO: Farmers from the southern state of Tamil Nadu pose half shaved during a protest demanding a drought-relief package from the federal government, in New Delhi, India April 3, 2017.Cathal McNaughton/File photoIndian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn < NMZc1>, wheat NWTc1, soybean NSBc1 and turmeric NTMc1. Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output. Rural Distress A rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit India's vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago. FILE PHOTO: Farmers sprinkle fertilizers on a paddy field on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India, February 1, 2017.Amit Dave/File photoNearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives. To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chili, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers. Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtra's Nashik district are unhappy.  If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers' debts, then why not Maharashtra?  he asked. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances.  It is a path that we need to tread very carefully,  he said this week. Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.  There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. That's how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains,  says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.  Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers' protests.

Islamic State has claimed that its fighters killed the two teachers, who were kidnapped on May 24 in Pakistan's Baluchistan province, where China is investing billions of dollars in infrastructure projects.

The outcome of the snap poll, called by Prime Minister Theresa May to try to bolster her parliamentary majority, was a blow to investors who had already weathered major risk events in the United States and Europe the previous day. But the wider reaction suggested a more limited impact than after last year's Brexit vote, which triggered a prolonged decline in the pound and unsettled other assets.  The uncertainty is bad news for sterling,  said Bank of America, Merrill Lynch European equity & cross-asset strategist James Barty.  I think for the global market it doesn't matter. Unlike Brexit, which at the time had a spillover into other markets, this is a very UK-specific thing.  Bets that another drop in sterling would flatter international firms' profits pushed London's FTSE up around 0.6 percent, while the Frankfurt, Paris and Milan bourses made almost as much. With the majority of seats counted, May's Conservatives had no way to win an outright majority in parliament. That raised fears the political turmoil could delay and confound talks on leaving the European Union, which are due to start in less than two weeks, and the pound shed over 2 percent against the dollar. It dropped as low as $1.2636 and 88.6 pence per euro -- two- and six-month troughs -- in early London trading, before clawing back some ground. Yields on 10-year gilts fell 3 basis points to 1.00 percent. The damage was limited elsewhere, with E-mini futures for the S&P; 500 edging up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei added 0.5 percent and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was closing all but flat. The rot for sterling had started when an exit poll showed the ruling Conservatives could fail to win a clear majority when markets had expected a handy victory. Ahead of the final results, forecasts showed the party would hold a reduced 319 seats in the 650-member parliament, following a big swing to the left-leaning opposition Labour Party. For the latest updates, click Betting agencies were already taking wagers on whether May would still have her job by the end of the day.  At this stage, there is no obvious way a formal, stable coalition government can be constructed, and therefore there is a high likelihood of a potentially prolonged period of uncertainty over who will be prime minister,  said John Wraith, a strategist at UBS. But he cautioned bears against chasing the pound much lower.  Today's result will in part be seen as a vote against a definitive break from the EU, and the market may soon begin to reassess the probability of a so-called 'hard Brexit'.  No Smoking Gun There was much less drama elsewhere, as the Japanese yen gave up early gains and eased to 110.38 per dollar. The euro was also down 0.35 percent against the U.S. dollar at $1.1173. The single currency had slipped overnight when the European Central Bank cut forecasts for inflation and said it had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying campaign, sending bond yields to multi-month lows. Italian bond yields fell again on Friday as the head of the country's ruling Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, said he was pessimistic over the chances of reaching a new cross-party pact on a reform of the electoral law. Political analysts see that as reducing the chances of a snap election in the coming months. Overnight, Wall Street had also seemingly judged that the testimony of former FBI director James Comey was not life-threatening for the administration of President Donald Trump. Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 election.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here,  said Jefferies & Co money market economist Thomas Simons.  So it's not particularly impactful for thinking about ... Trump's economic agenda to go through.  The Dow rose 0.04 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.03 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.39 percent. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.3 percent lower at $1,274.45 an ounce. Oil prices remained subdued, with Brent having settled at its lowest since Nov. 29, the eve of an OPEC production cut deal. U.S. crude futures edged up 10 cents to $45.76 a barrel, with Brent crude at $47.95. Both benchmarks are down roughly 4 percent in what will be a third consecutive weekly fall.

The Saudi Arabia Football Federation earlier  unreservedly  apologized for the incident, which a former Australian government minister said showed  a disgraceful lack of respect  for the victims of the London attack.  After reviewing the match report and images of the said match, we can confirm that there are no grounds to take disciplinary action in relation to the matter you mention,  FIFA said in a statement. Eight people were killed and 50 injured after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge last Saturday, then attacked revelers nearby with knives. Two of the dead were Australian. Football Federation Australia (FFA) said it had  sought agreement  from the Saudis and the Asian Football Confederation to hold the minute's silence to honor the victims ahead of the match at Adelaide Oval late on Thursday. The Australia team duly lined up in the center circle and linked arms but all bar one of the Saudi players dispersed around the pitch and continued to jog and stretch.  Both the AFC and the Saudi team agreed that the minute of silence could be held,  an FFA spokesman said.   The FFA was further advised by Saudi team officials that this tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture and they would move to their side of the field and respect our custom whilst taking their own positions on the field.  The incident prompted a social media storm, coming as it did at a time when Australians were still mourning victims of recent attacks. In addition to the Australians who died in London, a deadly siege in Melbourne on Tuesday that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called  an act of terrorism  claimed one victim, while an Australian schoolgirl was one of more than a dozen killed in a Baghdad car bomb blast last week. Soccer Football - Australia v Saudi Arabia - World Cup 2018 Qualifiers - Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, Australia - 08/06/2017 The Australian team stand together as they observe a minute's silence for victims of the London attacks, in which two Australians died.David GrayAnthony Albanese, a front bench spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said the incident was  bloody disgraceful .  There is no excuse here. This isn't about culture, this is about a lack of respect,  he told Channel 9.  I'm so angry about this.  The governing body of Saudi soccer later issued a statement saying it  deeply  regretted the incident.  The players did not intend any disrespect to the memories of the victims or to cause upset to their families, friends or any individual affected by the atrocity,  it added.  The Saudi Arabian Football Federation condemns all acts of terrorism and extremism and extends its sincerest condolences to the families of all the victims and to the government and people of the United Kingdom.  Prime Minister Turnbull said on Friday that he had not seen video of the incident but thought everybody should condemn  terrorism .  The whole world, the whole free world, is united in condemnation of that terrorist attack and terrorism generally,  he told reporters in Tasmania. Australia won the match 3-2 to move level on 16 points in Group B with the second-placed Saudis and leaders Japan, who have a game in hand, with two rounds to play. The top two teams win a place at the World Cup finals in Russia next year.

How can we make a living if we're not allowed to catch fish?  said Nyein Aye, who bought a bigger boat just four months ago but now says his income has dropped by two-thirds due to a decreased catch resulting from restrictions on when and where he can fish. Last month he joined more than 100 people in a protest demanding compensation from pipeline operator Petrochina. The pipeline is part of the nearly $10 billion Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, a scheme at the heart of fast-warming Myanmar-China relations and whose success is crucial for the Southeast Asian nation's leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Embattled Suu Kyi needs a big economic win to stem criticism that her first year in office has seen little progress on reform. China's support is also key to stabilizing their shared border, where a spike in fighting with ethnic armed groups threatens the peace process Suu Kyi says is her top priority. China's state-run CITIC Group [CITIC.UL], the main developer of the Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, says it will create 100,000 jobs in the northwestern state of Rakhine, one of Myanmar's poorest regions. But many local people say the project is being rushed through without consultation or regard for their way of life. Suspicion of China runs deep in Myanmar, and public hostility due to environmental and other concerns has delayed or derailed Chinese mega-projects in the country in the past. China says the Kyauk Pyu development is based on  win-win  co-operation between the two countries.  Avoiding Panic  Since Beijing signaled it may abandon the huge Myitsone Dam hydroelectric project in Myanmar earlier this year, it has pushed for concessions on other strategic undertakings - including the Bay of Bengal port at Kyauk Pyu, which gives it an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East. Internal planning documents reviewed by Reuters and more than two dozen interviews with officials show work on contracts and land acquisition has already begun before the completion of studies on the impact on local people and the environment, which legal experts said could breach development laws. The Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone will cover more than 4,200 acres (17 sq km). It includes the $7.3 billion deep sea port and a $2.3 billion industrial park, with plans to attract industries such as textiles and oil refining. A Reuters' tally based on internal planning documents and census data suggests 20,000 villagers, most of whom now depend on agriculture and fishing, are at risk of being relocated to make way for the project.  There will be a huge project in the zone and many buildings will be built, so people who live in the area will be relocated,  said Than Htut Oo, administrator of Kyauk Pyu, who also sits on the management committee of the economic zone. He said the government has not publicly announced the plan, because it didn't want to  create panic  while it was still negotiating with the Chinese developer. Ambitious Deadline In April, Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw signed two agreements on the pipeline and the Kyauk Pyu port with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as Beijing pushed to revive a project that had stalled since its inception in 2009. Chinese port terminal seen in Made island outside Kyaukphyu, Myanmar  May 18, 2017. Picture taken on May 18, 2017.Soe Zeya TunThe agreements call for environmental and social assessments to be carried out as soon as possible. While the studies are expected to take up to 15 months and have not yet started, CITIC has asked Myanmar to finalize contract terms by the end of this year so that the construction can start in 2018, said Soe Win, who leads the Myanmar management committee of the zone.  Such a schedule has alarmed experts who fear the project is being rushed.  The environmental and social preparations for a project of these dimensions take years to complete and not months,  said Vicky Bowman, head of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business and a former British ambassador to the country. CITIC said in an email to Reuters it would engage  a world-renowned consulting firm  to carry out assessments. Although large-scale land demarcation for the project has not yet started, 26 families have been displaced from farmland due to acquisitions that took place in 2014 for the construction of two dams, according to land documents and the land owners.       Slideshow (12 Images)Experts say this violates Myanmar's environmental laws.   Carrying out land acquisition before completing environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans is incompatible with national law,  said Sean Bain, Myanmar-based legal consultant for human rights watchdog International Commission of Jurists.             Job Opportunities? CITIC says it will build a vocational school to provide training for skills needed by companies in the economic zone. It has given $1.5 million to local villages to develop businesses. Reuters spoke to several villagers who had borrowed small sums from the village funds set up with this money.  The CITIC money was very useful for us because most people in the village need money,  said fisherman Thar Sai Aung, who borrowed $66 to buy new nets.    Chinese investors say they also plan to spend $1 million during the first five years of the development, and $500,000 per year thereafter to improve local living standards.  But villagers in Kyauk Pyu say they fear the project would not contribute to the development of the area because the operating companies employ mostly Chinese workers.  From more than 3,000 people living on the Maday island, the entry point for the oil pipeline, only 47 have landed a job with the Petrochina, while the number of Chinese workers stood at more than double that number, data from labor authorities showed. Petrochina did not respond to requests for comment. In a recent report it said Myanmar citizens made up 72 percent of its workforce in the country overall and it would continue to hire locally.  I don't think there's hope for me to get a job at the zone,  said fisherman Nyein Aye. He had been turned down 12 times for job applications with the pipeline operator.   Chinese companies said they would develop our village and improve our livelihoods, but it turned out we are suffering every day.

The South Asian nation is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week. Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modi's promise to double farmers' incomes over the next five years.  The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realization,  said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai. Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers. Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices. Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of India's 1.3 billion people. Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding  production has jumped but local demand hasn't risen in the same proportion . Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.  There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive,  said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body. FILE PHOTO: Farmers from the southern state of Tamil Nadu pose half shaved during a protest demanding a drought-relief package from the federal government, in New Delhi, India April 3, 2017.Cathal McNaughton/File photoIndian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn < NMZc1>, wheat NWTc1, soybean NSBc1 and turmeric NTMc1. Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output. Rural Distress A rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit India's vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago. FILE PHOTO: Farmers sprinkle fertilizers on a paddy field on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India, February 1, 2017.Amit Dave/File photoNearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives. To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chili, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers. Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtra's Nashik district are unhappy.  If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers' debts, then why not Maharashtra?  he asked. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances.  It is a path that we need to tread very carefully,  he said this week. Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.  There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. That's how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains,  says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.  Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers' protests.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat by 0919 GMT, having moved in and out positive territory throughout the day, while the UK's internationally facing blue chip FTSE 100 index outperformed with a gain of 0.8 percent.  Whilst a hung parliament was not the specific outcome that many expected, asset prices in the UK and to a certain extent globally, already discounted a period of extended political uncertainty given the complexity of delivering on the outcome of last year's EU referendum,  said Paras Anand, CIO European Equities at Fidelity International.  Simply put, that we are facing a period of political uncertainty is nothing new,  he added. After hitting their highest level in nearly two years in May on the back on a surprisingly strong earnings seasons and record inflows, European equities have been moving sideways with investors seeking fresh catalysts to extend the rally. British voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a devastating blow in a snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, wiping out her parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. That prompted sterling to fall as much as 2.5 percent, which in turn gave a strong boost to British companies which sell outside their country. Among them were oil major BP, bank HSBC and beverages group Diageo, all up between 1.1 and 1.6 percent. In turn, companies that make most of their revenues in the UK were hit with Lloyds Bank down 3.4 percent and supermarket Marks and Spencer down 2.4 percent. Some investors said May's failure to get a strong hand in parliament lowered the chances of a so called  hard Brexit , a development which could ultimately boost the pound.  The outcome is a clear near-term market negative, but in the medium-term the probability of shifting the UK towards a 'softer' Brexit position and less fiscal tightening have increased,” Deutsche Bank FX strategist George Saravelos said in a note to clients. On the broader European market, Italian bank UBI Banca rose 5.9 percent, leading gainers on the STOXX, as investors were upbeat about a possible rescue of two troubled regional lenders. Traders also cited an upbeat note from local broker Equita which upgraded the stock to buy saying the market had underestimated the benefits of an acquisition. Basic resources stocks provided the biggest lift to the STOXX as copper prices rose, helped by supply concerns in Chile and recent data pointing to robust import demand from China. Heavyweight miners BHP, Rio Tinto and Glencore all rose more than 1 percent. Elsewhere price action was driven by broker moves. Analyst at Citi and Denmark's Jyske Bank both cut their rating on Philips Lighting to sell, sending shares in the world's largest light maker down 1.6 percent. French electrical parts distributor Rexel fell 3.1 percent after a two-notch downgrade to sell at Kepler, while shares Dutch builder Heijmans rose 4.7 percent after an upgrade to buy from the same broker. Back in the UK, utilities including Centrica, National Grid and SSE all rose as prospects of a hung parliament diluted risks of harsher regulation - the Conservatives and Labour party have both proposed tariff caps. Stocks linked to the British housebuilding industry were the biggest STOXX fallers. Builders merchant Travis Perkins fell 4.1 , Howden Joinery dropped 4 percent and commercial REIT Great Portland Estates fell 2.2 percent. UK travel stocks and pub companies also fell, while the domestically exposed FTSE 250 index fell 0.5 percent.  So lots of uncertainties and the domestic political and economic path forward is murky. However for UK equities the outlook is more measured and we will be looking for selective buying opportunities,  said Richard Colwell, Head of UK Equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

The U.S. Pacific Command said on its website that two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers flew a 10-hour training mission from Guam over the South China Sea on Thursday, in conjunction with the Navy's USS Sterett guided-missile destroyer. The exercise comes after a U.S. warship in late May carried out a  maneuvering drill  within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea. The U.S. military conducts such  freedom of navigation  patrols to show China it is not entitled to territorial waters there, U.S. officials said at the time. The latest exercise was part of Pacific Command's  continuous bomber presence  program, but it did not give details on where it was conducted, and did not refer to it as a freedom-of-navigation operation.   China always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country's military activities in the South China Sea,  the ministry said in a statement, referring to the United States.  China's military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability,  it said. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, a stance contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The United States has criticized China's construction of islands and build-up of military facilities there, concerned they could be used to restrict free movement and extend China's strategic reach. U.S. allies and partners in the region had grown anxious as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had held off on carrying out South China Sea operations during its first few months in office.

The (Asian) credits market was immune to British election news so far, despite volatility in pound and gilt yields because Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party lost its majority in the election,  said a Hong Kong-based trader.  The market is very quiet, partly due to weekend.

Its appearance a day after Pyongyang tested a new type of anti-ship missile on Thursday, could spark questions about the state of South Korea's air defenses at a time when Seoul is trying to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programs.  In size and shape, the device looked like a North Korean drone found in 2014 on an island near the border, South Korea's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, adding that authorities plan to conduct a close analysis.  The drone found this time looks sloppy but slightly more slender than previous ones,  a South Korean military official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The device would be the latest of several North Korean drones to have flown into the South, with which Pyongyang is technically at war after the Korean war ended in a truce, rather than a peace treaty, in 1953.  In 2014, South Korea said three unmanned drones from North Korea were found in border towns.  A joint investigation by South Korean and U.S. militaries has concluded the craft were on reconnaissance missions for the North, which has denied sending spy drones, however, dismissing the findings as a fabrication. Last year, South Korea fired warning shots at a suspected North Korean drone, forcing it to turn back. North Korea owns around 300 unmanned aerial vehicles of different types including reconnaissance, target and combat drones, the United Nations said in a report last year. The North Korean drones recovered in South Korea were probably procured through front companies in China, with parts manufactured in China, the Czech Republic, Japan and the United States, it added.

Being developed by an international consortium led by BP, the field in the Caspian Sea has been estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters of gas, which European customers hope can supply them for decades, cutting their dependence on Russia. The Shah Deniz I development of the field has been in production since 2006 and has an annual production capacity of about 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas.  We have received a notification from Azerbaijan that gas deliveries from Shah Deniz will be suspended in August due to planned repair works on the pipeline,  Mariam Valishvili told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. She said that similar work was undertaken almost every year, although this year's would last for a full month,  the longest ever conducted.  Valishvili said suspension would not create problems for  Georgia as gas consumption declines in the summer and it would be compensated by supplies from other gas fields in Azerbaijan. Annual gas consumption in Georgia is 2.5 bcm and the country gets 800 million cubic meters every year from Azerbaijan at a reduced rate as a transit country.  This volume will rise to 1.6 bcm per year from 2020, when the second stage of Shah Deniz is expected to be launched,  Valishvili said. Shah Deniz II is expected to produce 16 bcm of gas a year beginning in 2020, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey and Georgia.

She's only been the leader for under a year, she got it without any opposition, an uncontested election with support up and down the country. I don't think the Conservative Party is so fickle, or such a fair-weather friend as it would not continue to back the prime minister.  Anna Soubry, Pro-European Lawmaker  She's in a very difficult place, she's a remarkable and a very talented woman and she doesn't shy from difficult decisions, but she now has to obviously consider her position.   Theresa did put her mark on this campaign, she takes responsibility as she always does, and I know she will, for the running of the campaign. It was tightly knit group, and it was her group that ran this campaign.   I'm afraid we ran a pretty dreadful campaign, that's probably me being generous.   The change of heart on social care ... it did not make her look the strong and stable prime minister and leader that she had said that she was. That was a very difficult and very serious blow in terms of her own credibility.   Iain Duncan Smith, Former Conservative Party Leader  I just want some stability. She is prime minister, she remains prime minister and the country has to come first.  Ed Vaizey, Former Culture Minister  I think she can hold on ... going into a hung parliament, to lose our prime minister would be disastrous.   If she wants to stay on as leader I would support her.  John Redwood, Eurosceptic Lawmaker  A very very strong mandate for our prime minister, and of course it should be the leader with the most seats in the House of Commons who can win the necessary votes, and Theresa May is in that position today.  Nicky Morgan, Former Education Minister  Theresa May is obviously a competent, more than capable prime minister... but clearly there has been a misjudgment.   There are two things: having a government prepared to negotiate Brexit, which I think is what most people in this country now agree needs to happen, and what's going to happen to the Conservative party, which is for us to deal with.

Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region said this week it would hold a referendum on independence, a move that is also unlikely to be welcomed by the central government in Baghdad. Kurdish separatism is a sensitive issue for Turkey, which has been battling a militant insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast for three decades.  Ankara is also worried about the advances by a Syrian Kurdish militia in northern Syria, fearing that could embolden the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey.  We think this will represent a terrible mistake,  the foreign ministry said in a statement.  The maintenance of Iraq's territorial integrity and political unit is one of the fundamental principles of Turkey's Iraq policy.  The idea of Iraqi Kurdish independence has been historically opposed by Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria, as they all fear separatism spreading to their own Kurdish populations. Iraq's majority Shi'ite Arab community mainly live in the south while the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs inhabit different areas of the north. The center around Baghdad is mixed.

Shares of Alibaba rocketed up 13 percent on Thursday - the group's biggest daily rise since going public - after the company revealed startlingly optimistic revenue growth forecasts during its annual investor conference. It's a powerful vindication of Ma's forays into AI and cloud technology.  Gasps and cheers were heard from the audience in Hangzhou when Alibaba Chief Finance Officer Maggie Wu said she expects revenue growth of up to 49 percent for the next fiscal year, trouncing the average 38 percent rise analysts on Eikon predicted. The bigger reaction came hours later, when investors added a jaw-dropping $41 billion in market value to the New York-listed behemoth. By the end of the day, Alibaba had taken the title of China's most valuable publicly-listed company back from rival Tencent. Graphic: Alibaba is China’s most valuable public company: reut.rs/2s9XttO The signal from Alibaba is the strongest sign yet that the expensive bets the company placed outside of its core e-commerce business are starting to pay off. Ma has made wild and often unpredictable investments in areas like cloud computing, online video, supermarket chains, and mobile mapping to transform the company into a giant data and content platform. This vision is starting to come together: the other big reveal from Wu on Thursday was that users are spending much more time on Alibaba's shopping and entertainment sites and apps than before, and as a result, spending more too. Advertisers are paying attention. The big question is when Ma's data and content bets will translate into profit. Alibaba disclosed last month that its cloud, media and other businesses made an operating loss of over 18 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the fiscal year on 24 billion yuan of revenue. Wu has already assured investors that Alibaba's core e-commerce margins will not be impacted too much. Given the high expectations, that may not be enough for long.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

In an official notice published in the Friday edition of the Politika newspaper, Belgrade said the deadline had been extended to June 21. The initial deadline was for March 10, but this was then extended to May 30.  The public body (government and airport management) decided to extend the deadline to allow qualified participants ... to provide proof of fulfilment of all requirements,  it said. In March, the then-Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said that 27 companies had expressed an interest in bidding.

The Serbian government has an 83.1 percent stake in the airport whose net profit increased by 21 percent in the first four months of 2017 to 831.7 million dinars ($7.6 million).

The world's second largest healthcare group by market capitalization has ample cash to fund deals in the country and beyond, helping it tap  enormous  fast-growing Chinese healthcare demand, CEO Tan See Leng told reporters in Shanghai.  Greater China is our key growth market and we are committed to significantly expanding our presence here,  he said at an event after the firm broke ground on a 1.36 billion yuan ($200 million) 450-bed private hospital in Shanghai.  We are actually sitting on quite a lot of cash and our gearing is actually very low, so we have the ability to do fairly sizable M&As;,  he added when asked about looking for deals in China.   We would be on the look out for M&A; opportunities.  China's healthcare market is a magnet for firms from medical devices to private hospital operators, especially as Beijing looks for help from the private sector to rein in a healthcare bill estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2020. The firm's Greater China CEO Paul Gregersen said an aging population and rising incomes were driving demand for healthcare services, creating the need for more private care.  This is going to put a huge pressure on the public healthcare system,  he said.  Our private hospitals will help alleviate the strain from this pent-up demand.  IHH has 50 hospitals in 10 countries, with a focus on Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey and India. It plans to open a new hospital in China each year from 2018-2020 and has a China pipeline of hospitals worth around 8 billion yuan. China has been touting greater access to private healthcare operators over the last few years, though there have been hurdles including a lack of commercial health insurance coverage and a shortage of doctors willing to move to the private sector. IHH said it was working closely with local insurer Taikang Insurance Group and that rising incomes would mean more people bought commercial health cover - important because of obstacles linking private hospitals with China's public insurance schemes.  With rising affluence we expect commercial health insurance to cover more people across Greater China, which will divert patience toward the private sector,  said Gregersen.

It has also affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of Beazley Re and ultimate parent and holding company of the group, Beazley plc, (collectively Beazley) at 'A'.  All ratings carry a Stable Outlook. The subordinated debt has also been affirmed at 'BBB+' KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of Beazley are underpinned by its historically strong and stable underwriting performance, strong capitalisation, prudent reserving practices and its established position in the London insurance market. However, the ratings are constrained by the group's business profile, which while Fitch views as strong, is limited by the group's medium size in terms of business volume. In 2016, Beazley's gross written premium was USD2.2 billion compared with the Fitch median of between EUR1 billion and EUR3 billion for non-life insurers with a 'strong' business profile. Its significant presence in the Lloyd's market is viewed positively by Fitch. Beazley's Lloyd's syndicates benefit from a strong track record and good reputation among brokers. As a result, Beazley is the lead on a large amount of business that it underwrites through the platform. Beazley has reported strong underwriting profitability in recent years as reflected in a Fitch-calculated five-year average combined ratio of 87%. Beazley's net income remained flat at USD251 million in 2016 (2015: USD249m), reflecting a slightly weaker underwriting result. This was due to increasingly challenging underwriting conditions, evidenced by an average 2% rate decline across the portfolio in 2016, which was offset by an improved investment result at Beazley. Fitch views Beazley's capitalisation as strong. Beazley's score in Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Model was 'Extremely Strong' at end-2016. Fitch expects capitalisation to remain supportive of Beazley's ratings, reflecting the group's strong underwriting performance and limited asset risk, and assuming an 'average' level of catastrophe activity during the remainder of 2017. In 2016, Beazley Group Limited repaid GBP76.5 million of existing tier 2 subordinated debt and Beazley Re issued USD250 million of new tier 2 subordinated debt with a maturity date of 2026. As a result, financial leverage increased to 20% in 2016 (2015: 15%). Fitch views such debt as moderate compared with London market peers and being supportive of the ratings. Beazley's debt-servicing ability is strong, as reflected in an 18x fixed-charge coverage in 2016 (2015: 20x). The agency's view of Beazley's good financial flexibility is driven by the number of internal and external funding options available to the insurer. Fitch believes that Beazley's reserve adequacy is strong, which will continue to contribute to technical profitability. The company targets a margin on net held reserves of between 5% and 10% above the actuarial estimate and has been able to report continuous strong prior year reserve releases. The margin in net held reserves above the actuarial estimate was 6.6% in 2016 (2015: 8.2%). Beazley's conservative investment strategy is positive for the ratings. Eighty-eight per cent of Beazley's investments are part of the group's core portfolio (CP). The CP, which consists of cash investments, sovereigns and highly rated bonds, is held to serve insurance claims, and durations are managed with reference to insurance liabilities. The remaining 12% of investments belong to a capital growth portfolio, which includes equity and hedge fund exposures. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of Beazley's ratings is unlikely given the group's business profile, which we do not expect to improve materially in the medium term. Deterioration in profitability, reflected in a combined ratio consistently above 97%, or net return on equity consistently below 10% could lead to a downgrade. A prolonged decline in capitalisation to a level below 'Very Strong' could also lead to a downgrade.

Vichai Thepwong, 34, a former insurance salesman, was initially sentenced to 70 years, but the jail term was halved after he pled guilty to 10 separate violations of Thailand's strict lese majeste law. Since seizing power in a coup three years ago, the military government has brought cases against 73 people under the royal defamation law, according to iLaw, a Thai legal monitoring group. The latest conviction carried the heaviest sentence yet, beating a 30-year sentence handed down in 2015.  This is the longest sentence for Article 112 verdicts ever recorded,  iLaw said, referring to the section of the criminal code dealing with insults to the monarchy. In a move criticized by rights groups, the junta has also moved to tighten both cyber security and online censorship, to guard against threats to national security and insults to the country's royals. Vichai was arrested in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai in 2015 for allegedly posting ten messages and images on Facebook deemed insulting to the monarchy. His lawyer said Vichai, who has been in a Bangkok prison since his arrest, will not appeal against the court's verdict.  He wants the case to end, and wants to petition for a royal pardon,  said Khumklao Songsonboon, who works for Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. On Friday, another Thai man was sentenced to five years in jail for uploading an audio-file regarded as insulting to the monarchy. His sentence was also halved after he pled guilty. The number of royal defamation cases increased following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej last October after seven decades on the throne. The revered monarch was succeeded by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

India's biggest lender is also due to gain additional funds this financial year from a planned share sale in its life insurance arm and also from possible stake divestments it considers non-core, the head of the bank, Arundhati Bhattacharya, told a briefing. As such, there is no need for SBI to seek funds from the government for now, she added. The successful sale, India's biggest ever qualified institutional placement, will take some of the pressure off the government which owns majority stakes in more than 20 lenders. Many of them, analysts say, do not have the ability to raise external capital, making them heavily dependent on the government. Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday that the 11 Indian state-run banks it rates, including SBI, could need up to 950 billion rupees ($14.8 billion) in capital by March 2019, far more than the 200 billion rupees India plans to inject into state banks by then. Bhattacharya said SBI's key capital ratios would rise by 79 basis points after the share sale, with its capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio likely to rise to 13.64 percent and common equity Tier 1 climbing to 10.2 percent.  As per the plan we have put in place we are quite comfortable till next year,  she said. The lender, which accounts for more than a fifth of Indian banking assets, expects loans to rise 10-12 percent in the current year to March 2018, and 14 percent in the year after. After the share sale, the Indian government will see its ownership of SBI fall to 57.07 percent. State-run Life Insurance Corp of India, a traditional big investor in government-related share sales, bought 38 percent of the share issue, which priced at the top of its indicated range. Domestic investors bought 25 percent, while foreign institutional investors subscribed to 26 percent and foreign hedge funds accounted for 11 percent.

With the majority of seats counted, incumbent Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party had no way to win an outright majority in parliament. She had called the election to gain a stronger mandate before launching into arduous divorce talks with the European Union.                                           The poll verdict could create mild risk aversion which should be mildly supportive for gold; but depends on what sort of negotiations take place between the EU and UK (over Brexit),  NAB analyst John Sharma said.       For now, looks like the market has taken this in its stride.       Spot gold        was down 0.4 percent at $1,273.81 per ounce, as of 0816 GMT. The yellow metal has fallen 0.4 percent for the week, and is poised for its first weekly drop in five.      U.S. gold futures         for August delivery were 0.2 percent lower at $1,276.40.     Dollar-denominated gold typically falls in value when the greenback gains.      Earlier in the day, gold was pressured by events in the United States, including former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey's Congressional testimony and improving economic data.     Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBI's investigation of possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.                   However, his statement was seen containing no major surprises.             Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, unwinding half of the prior period's jump and suggesting the labor market was tightening despite a recent slowdown in job growth.                   Looking at the developments in the UK and in the U.S. as well as at the recent ECB meeting, we think of these as business as usual,  said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner, J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.      The road is bumpy and the price follows, but assuming no major armed conflict in sight, or any other developments that may result in an impeachment process of President Trump, we believe prices will bounce back and forth in response to performances of other assets classes.          The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 97.427.            Among other precious metals, palladium        climbed as much as $864.50 an ounce, its highest since September 2014.     Silver        slipped 0.5 percent to $17.29 per ounce, while platinum        edged 0.3 percent higher to $934.74.

Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented the BOJ with a communication challenge, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might dial back its stimulus without scaring investors that such a move is imminent.  The BOJ shouldn't be afraid of revising (its exit strategy) in the future and openly debate the subject now, paying heed to market voices,  Akio Negishi, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, told a news conference on Friday. BOJ officials say they hope to convince markets they have a credible exit strategy in mind, without giving out details on concern doing so too soon could confuse markets. They also remain reluctant of presenting numerical forecasts on how an exit could affect the BOJ's balance sheet, saying an actual exit path could be quite different from what the central bank predicts now. But Negishi said that through good dialogue, the BOJ can avoid causing market confusion.  We hope the BOJ releases (details of an exit strategy) with clear, meticulous explanation  that could avoid causing market confusion, he said. Many analysts expect the BOJ to lag well behind its U.S. and European counterparts in withdrawing its huge stimulus as inflation stagnates around zero percent, well below its target.

The shutdown would affect fields operated by Statoil, Shell and Eni and would cut output by 443,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (NOG) said in a statement. The deadline for the talks is at midnight Friday (2200 GMT), but shutdowns would only start on Sunday, the lobby group said. Voluntary negotiations broke down last month and the two sides now face a mandatory process under a state-appointed mediator before any strike is allowed by Norwegian law.  The industry still faces significant challenges with the oil price and cost levels,  NOG said.  We hope the mediation will lead to agreement with Lederne.  Of the five fields, Goliat, Draugen and Oseberg East are oil producing fields, while Gudrun and Kvitebjoern are gas and condensate fields. Norway produces about two million barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) per day, while its output of natural gas currently stands at around 300 million cubic meters per day. Lederne represents 983 workers on Norwegian oil and gas platforms, or 13 percent of the total, and only 106 of these would initially go on strike. The union mostly represents senior staff considered crucial to operations, however. Wage negotiations for the remaining 87 percent of Norwegian oil workers were settled in May. Norway's last strike by oil workers took place in 2012 and lasted for 16 days before the government intervened to force an end to the conflict, citing vital national interests.

Two days after unveiling a multi-billion euro plan to help fund European defense research, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was time to integrate militaries and defense industries, seizing on the strong backing from France's new president and Britain's decision to leave the bloc.  I see the tide turning,  Juncker told a conference in Prague, citing growing support in EU capitals for military cooperation, notably from French President Emmanuel Macron.   The call I make today is not only in favor of a Europe of defense — it is a call in defense of Europe,  he said. Although the European Union has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Britain had long blocked EU defense integration, fearing a European army that would challenge national sovereignty. NATO broadly supports EU defense integration, as 22 EU states are members of the U.S.-led alliance. Chiding the bloc for decades of failed attempts to work together on defense since the 1950s, Juncker said that even before the election of President Donald Trump, the United States considered it was paying too much for wealthy Europe's security. With Trump, who has sharply criticized European states for not spending enough on defense and has refused to explicitly support NATO, the reality was more stark, he said.  NATO can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts,  Juncker said. He said the United States is  no longer interested in guaranteeing Europe's security in our place.   The economically powerful EU has long been able to boast of a  soft power  with recent diplomatic successes including its role in brokering the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. But the EU's inability to help bring peace to Syria or significantly influence events abroad, from Turkey to the Middle East, meant that soft power was not enough, Juncker said.  We have no other choice than to defend our own interests in the Middle East, in climate change, in our trade agreements.  EU leaders will discuss broad European defense plans, first put forward by France and Germany following Britain's EU referendum a year ago, at a summit on June 22-23 in Brussels. France, Germany and Italy want ways to pay for common military missions abroad, to be able to use EU battlegroups for the first time and for industries to collaborate and develop weapons and helicopters that can be used by all EU armies. EU states jealously protect their defense contractors, meaning the bloc has developed 178 different weapons systems, compared to 30 in the United States.  Absurdly, there are more helicopter types then there are governments to buy them,  Juncker said.

Among other currencies the forint and the Romanian leu were up 0.1 percent and the zloty flat, with Central European markets showing no significant reaction to the unexpected outcome of Britain's elections.     The crown led gains on Thursday, hitting its highest level since 2013, after Czech central bankers repeated that they could start raising interest rates this year, in contrast with dovish policies elsewhere in the region.      On Friday the crown gained 0.4 percent versus the euro after breaking a resistance level of 26.30 to trade at 26.20.     Czech year-on-year inflation came in above market forecasts at 2.4 percent in May, although this was below the central bank's own prediction of 2.6 percent. The bank targets inflation at 2 percent.      The CNB has to some degree a free hand. Its own outlook argues for growth in rates in the second half of the year,  Radomir Jac, chief economist for Generali Investments CEE, said, adding that the central bank did not need to hurry to hike.      Raising rates by the end of this year cannot be ruled out. But I see a number of arguments for stable rates this year and the first rise in the spring of 2018,  Jac said.     The CNB has also said that the more the crown firms from its former cap at 27 against the euro, the less the need for tightening monetary policy.     An increase in Czech rates -- which stand at a technical zero -- would be the first in about a decade.       Shares in Kofola jumped 8 percent after its founders and majority owners said they would raise their stake in the Czech soft drinks maker to 68 percent in a series of transactions that will see a big private equity investor exit.

They are looking to produce a testing kit that would cost clinics and hospitals around $30 and take about 15 minutes to analyze blood samples for a key dengue protein, said Cleverton Luiz Pirich, a researcher at the Federal University of Paraná. A biosensor is an analytical device that converts a biological response into an electrical signal.  “You can do a diagnosis very fast, at a very low cost, and you don’t need to have a lot of knowledge of this equipment,” Pirich said by telephone from Curitiba in southern Brazil. “The innovation of our work is not specific to dengue - you can use it for other diseases,” he added. The scientists coated the biosensor with a thin film of bacterial cellulose nanocrystals, which effectively detected a protein known as NS1 from blood samples, according to results published in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics. They now want to explore ways to create cost-effective biosensor components that could be used to analyze multiple blood samples, said Pirich. The technology could potentially be adapted to detect proteins from viruses such as Zika, which is also transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, he added. Endemic in Latin America and Asia, dengue infects hundreds of millions of people each year, and is becoming more prevalent. It is often hard to diagnose as the symptoms, which include fever and severe joint pain, are similar to a number of other diseases.  Simple tools such as testing blood from a finger prick, used to detect malaria, are not available for dengue, and there is no dedicated treatment for the virus which is usually found in urban and semi-urban areas. Dengue has spread to more than 100 countries from nine in 1960, according to the World Health Organization, with cases rising to 390 million a year from 15,000 in 1960. Experts say the increased movement of people and goods due to globalization, as well as worsening floods linked to climate change, are likely to speed up the spread of dengue. The economic impact is potentially huge, with the disease estimated to cost the Americas $2.1 billion annually, while Southeast Asian economies could lose almost $2.4 billion.

Beijing has pledged to cut company costs by more than 1 trillion yuan ($147.12 billion) a year in an effort to lower the burden on firms struggling with higher costs and tepid demand as the economy shifts to a slower growth trajectory. China's State Council announced new measures on Wednesday to further cut cost burdens on companies, including temporary exemption from supervision fees in the banking and insurance sectors, and lowering some fees in the power and construction sectors. China said that a switch to a value added tax system last year saved companies 574 billion yuan in taxes, though the cost-cutting campaign comes as the Ministry of Finance says the imbalance between revenue and expenditure  remains serious .   Cuts in taxes and fees will definitely have an impact on fiscal revenues,  vice finance minister Shi Yaobin said at a news conference Friday.  Shi said that the government's forecast for the fiscal budget deficit to expand by 200 billion yuan this year is due in large part to less revenue expected from taxes and fees, though the fiscal deficit ratio is expected to remain unchanged at 3 percent. Shi said China's system of government transfer payments ensures against any shortfall in local government revenues.   For the small number of local governments that face fiscal difficulties, we will use transfer payments to make sure these governments are able to match revenues and expenditures and safeguard public services and social development,  said Shi.   I don't think (local government finances) are a problem...but we do need to keep an eye on it.

What started as a childhood dream of winning the America's Cup has become an obsession to become the first British challenger to lift the  Auld Mug  and bring it  home . Ainslie's first shot at achieving that ended on Thursday, when a team from New Zealand, one of only four countries to have won the cup, beat his Land Rover BAR crew in the semi-final of the 35th America's Cup challenger series in Bermuda.  We knew it was going to be incredibly tough at the first attempt,  Ainslie told a news briefing after the race.  Ultimately we weren't able to catch up with the existing teams in time,  sailing's most successful Olympian, who is not used to losing, added. He has won the cup before, as tactician with Oracle Team USA in their 2013 comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. But Ainslie wants to win it for  Queen and country  and under the banner  Bring The Cup Home  set about mounting his own challenge, launching BAR with the aim of doing something British teams have tried and failed to do on some 20 occasions. From Table to Bermuda Getting an America's Cup boat on the water, let alone competing with Oracle Team USA and Artemis Racing, which are both backed by billionaires, costs tens of millions of dollars.  I couldn't be prouder of the team today ... Three and a half years ago a few of us were sitting around a table in London ... what we have we have achieved today is incredible,  Ainslie said in the televised briefing. Ainslie managed to raise 90 million pounds ($116 million) to fund his campaign, building a massive team headquarters in Portsmouth on the south coast of England. This base looks south across the Solent to where he now lives with his wife the sports presenter Georgie Thompson and daughter Bellatrix in the aptly named village of Seaview. His  commute  to work is either on a high speed ferry or in his own RIB speedboat across the channel where he hopes one day to defend the cup for Britain. To do so he will need to keep bringing the money in. Land Rover BAR has been part funded by wealthy private investors with a passion for sailing, including entrepreneur Keith Mills and Dixons Carphone Chairman Charles Dunstone. Ainslie paid tribute to both men's involvement on Thursday and said that Land Rover was renewing its partnership with BAR to compete for the next America's Cup. Corporate Sponsors In order to succeed, Ainslie has attracted corporate sponsors such as Land Rover, BT, BAE Systems and Siemens who have provided financial backing and technical know-how. One supporter who has set Land Rover BAR apart is Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, who has sailed with Ainslie and is patron of the 1851 Trust, the charity he has set up to get young people to discover science and technology through sailing. As well as being team principal, skipper, part-time fund-raiser and ambassador, Ainslie has managed to attract an impressive team to the BAR stable, including chief executive Martin Whitmarsh who was previously at McLaren Formula One. On the water he signed up Jono Macbeth, a 44-year-old New Zealander who has three America's Cup wins, as sailing team manager and enlisted Giles Scott as tactician on his catamaran  Rita , the name Ainslie gives to all his racing boats. As ever with Ainslie, no sooner was he back on dry land on Thursday than he was looking to his next challenge.  Already the work is starting on the next campaign ... and we will be that much stronger next time,  he vowed.

SoftBank said it would buy Boston Dynamics and Tokyo-based Schaft, which design and manufacture robots that simulate human movement, but did not disclose the terms of the transactions. Shares of the company rose as much as 7.9 percent after the deal was announced, hitting a 17-year high.  Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution, and Marc (Raibert) and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots,  SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son said in a statement on Friday.  Raibert is CEO and founder of Boston Dynamics. SoftBank has embarked on an aggressive acquisition campaign to boost its research and development capabilities. The group is backing the $93 billion Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund that seeks to invest in technologies expected to grow significantly in the near future, such as robotics and artificial intelligence. Son, Japan's richest man, describes the fund as essential for setting up SoftBank for a data  gold rush  which he expects to happen as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized. Boston Dynamics and Schaft could eventually be vested with the Vision Fund, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters  Schaft, a University of Tokyo spinoff, develops bipedal robots designed to negotiate uneven terrain.  Robotics as a field has great potential, and we're happy to see Boston Dynamics and Schaft join the SoftBank team to continue contributing to the next generation of robotics,  an Alphabet spokesperson said. Boston Dynamics has produced a number of robots that mimic human and animal movement, including Atlas, a humanoid model that co-ordinates motion and balance using its arms and legs and can pick itself up off the ground when knocked over. It is best known for building robots that look as if they belong in science-fiction movies and are often co-developed or funded by the U.S. military. Its military projects would mean the acquisition is likely to be subject to regulatory approval from Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company was acquired by Google in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, but the team struggled to find its place within the tech giant after Rubin's departure, former Boston Dynamics employees said.  They're advancing the state of the art in independent robotics. They are probably the leader in the U.S.,  said Arnis Mangolds, a robotics expert who has worked with Boston Dynamics.  But the problem is it's not ready for prime time, and very few people have a tolerance for that.

The world's second largest healthcare group by market capitalization has ample cash to fund deals in the country and beyond, helping it tap  enormous  fast-growing Chinese healthcare demand, CEO Tan See Leng told reporters in Shanghai.  Greater China is our key growth market and we are committed to significantly expanding our presence here,  he said at an event after the firm broke ground on a 1.36 billion yuan ($200 million) 450-bed private hospital in Shanghai.  We are actually sitting on quite a lot of cash and our gearing is actually very low, so we have the ability to do fairly sizable M&As;,  he added when asked about looking for deals in China.   We would be on the look out for M&A; opportunities.  China's healthcare market is a magnet for firms from medical devices to private hospital operators, especially as Beijing looks for help from the private sector to rein in a healthcare bill estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2020. The firm's Greater China CEO Paul Gregersen said an aging population and rising incomes were driving demand for healthcare services, creating the need for more private care.  This is going to put a huge pressure on the public healthcare system,  he said.  Our private hospitals will help alleviate the strain from this pent-up demand.  IHH has 50 hospitals in 10 countries, with a focus on Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey and India. It plans to open a new hospital in China each year from 2018-2020 and has a China pipeline of hospitals worth around 8 billion yuan. China has been touting greater access to private healthcare operators over the last few years, though there have been hurdles including a lack of commercial health insurance coverage and a shortage of doctors willing to move to the private sector. IHH said it was working closely with local insurer Taikang Insurance Group and that rising incomes would mean more people bought commercial health cover - important because of obstacles linking private hospitals with China's public insurance schemes.  With rising affluence we expect commercial health insurance to cover more people across Greater China, which will divert patience toward the private sector,  said Gregersen.

When we don't know what's happening, markets get defensive and so gilts should do OK.  British voters dealt Prime Minister Theresa May a blow in a snap election she had called to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks, leaving her Conservative Party without a parliamentary majority and throwing the country into political turmoil. Political uncertainty, which can weigh on economic growth, typically benefits government bonds. The yield on Britain's long-dated gilt was steady in early Friday trade at around 1.03 percent. Zahn said that while sterling  was undervalued, the currency was likely to continue to be driven by politics, and could remain weak.  Political events over the coming months will be what drives the currency so we do not have a position in the currency at the moment,  he said. The surprise result sent the pound to eight-week lows against the dollar and its lowest in seven months versus the euro.

The Office for National Statistics also said Britain's trade deficit widened by more than expected, a further setback for hopes that the fall in the value of the pound since the European Union membership referendum would help rebalance the economy. Industrial output fell by a monthly 0.5 percent - a sharper decline than expected by economists taking part in a Reuters poll - and output in February was revised lower. The manufacturing sector, which is part of overall industrial output, saw output fall by 0.6 percent, compared with economists' expectations of no change. For the first quarter as a whole, industrial output only inched up by 0.1 percent and manufacturing growth slowed to 0.3 percent. Britain's economy has slowed this year after it initially withstood the shock of the decision by voters to leave the European Union in a referendum in June. The slowdown and uncertainty about Britain's future relationship with the EU have added to expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their record low possibly for another two years. The BoE is due to announce its latest thinking on Britain's economy at 1100 GMT on Thursday. Consumers, who are the main drivers of growth, have reined in their spending as inflation rises quickly, pushed up by the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound. Some surveys have suggested that manufacturers started the year well, potentially offsetting some of the slowdown in consumer spending. But that optimism has not yet been reflected in official data. The ONS said Thursday's figures implied no change to its preliminary estimate that Britain's economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, less than half the pace of growth at the end of 2016. Despite the weaker start to the year for the economy, British Prime Minister Theresa May is widely expected to win comfortably a national election she has called for June 8. Separate data from the ONS showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 13.441 billion pounds, bigger than the median forecast of 11.8 billion pounds in the Reuters poll of economists. That took the total trade deficit - including Britain's surplus in services - for the first quarter to 10.540 billion pounds, more than double the shortfall in the fourth quarter. Growth in exports of goods, measured in volume terms, slowed to 0.2 percent in the first quarter while import volumes jumped by 3.3 percent.  An ONS official said the widening deficit was fueled by imports of machinery and cars and by rising oil imports. The ONS also released figures for construction output in March, which fell 0.7 percent on the month and rose 2.4 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.

They are looking to produce a testing kit that would cost clinics and hospitals around $30 and take about 15 minutes to analyze blood samples for a key dengue protein, said Cleverton Luiz Pirich, a researcher at the Federal University of Paraná. A biosensor is an analytical device that converts a biological response into an electrical signal.  “You can do a diagnosis very fast, at a very low cost, and you don’t need to have a lot of knowledge of this equipment,” Pirich said by telephone from Curitiba in southern Brazil. “The innovation of our work is not specific to dengue - you can use it for other diseases,” he added. The scientists coated the biosensor with a thin film of bacterial cellulose nanocrystals, which effectively detected a protein known as NS1 from blood samples, according to results published in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics. They now want to explore ways to create cost-effective biosensor components that could be used to analyze multiple blood samples, said Pirich. The technology could potentially be adapted to detect proteins from viruses such as Zika, which is also transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, he added. Endemic in Latin America and Asia, dengue infects hundreds of millions of people each year, and is becoming more prevalent. It is often hard to diagnose as the symptoms, which include fever and severe joint pain, are similar to a number of other diseases.  Simple tools such as testing blood from a finger prick, used to detect malaria, are not available for dengue, and there is no dedicated treatment for the virus which is usually found in urban and semi-urban areas. Dengue has spread to more than 100 countries from nine in 1960, according to the World Health Organization, with cases rising to 390 million a year from 15,000 in 1960. Experts say the increased movement of people and goods due to globalization, as well as worsening floods linked to climate change, are likely to speed up the spread of dengue. The economic impact is potentially huge, with the disease estimated to cost the Americas $2.1 billion annually, while Southeast Asian economies could lose almost $2.4 billion.

The BOJ shouldn't be afraid of revising (its exit strategy) in the future and openly debate the subject now, paying heed to market voices,  Akio Negishi, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, told a news conference on Friday. BOJ officials say they hope to convince markets they have a credible exit strategy in mind, without giving out details on concern doing so too soon could confuse markets. They also remain reluctant of presenting numerical forecasts on how an exit could affect the BOJ's balance sheet, saying an actual exit path could be quite different from what the central bank predicts now. But Negishi said that through good dialogue, the BOJ can avoid causing market confusion.  We hope the BOJ releases (details of an exit strategy) with clear, meticulous explanation  that could avoid causing market confusion, he said. Many analysts expect the BOJ to lag well behind its U.S. and European counterparts in withdrawing its huge stimulus as inflation stagnates around zero percent, well below its target.

The Arizona-based company resumed copper concentrate exports from Grasberg, the world's second-biggest copper mine, in April after a 15-week outage related to a government dispute over mining rights. Freeport had planned to ramp up production, which was cut by around two-thirds during the outage. Freeport shares gained 2.9 percent to $12.06 on Thursday.  Jakarta halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports in January, under new rules that require miners to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in their operations and relinquish arbitration rights.  Freeport, whose current contract runs until 2021 with two 10-year extensions, will only agree to a license accompanied by an investment stability agreement that replicates current legal and fiscal certainty, Quirk said.  We think we're on a path to be able to get that resolved during this year and that's our top priority,  Quirk said via webcast from a Deutsche Bank conference. Without the agreement, Freeport is unlikely to continue investing in the country, she said, noting the company has already spent $3 billion on a project to transitions Grasberg to underground from open pit mining.  Production from the project, about half complete, is targeted for 2018 or 2019, she said. The government will meet Freeport next Wednesday for further talks and negotiations could be concluded by October 2017,  Teguh Pamuji, secretary general at Indonesia's energy and mining ministry told reporters on Friday.  The important thing is the substance, which will cover regulations and documents that will make them comfortable and give security for them to operate in Indonesia,  he said. Meantime, Freeport is grappling with labor problems. Its contractor-dominated workforce in Indonesia has been reduced to approximately 26,000 workers currently from about 33,000 at the start of 2017. Following the export restrictions, Freeport furloughed some 3,000 workers in the first quarter, Quirk said, sparking a strike and high levels of absenteeism. Freeport later deemed that approximately 3,000 full-time employees and 1,000 contractors had resigned, Quirk said. Quirk said Freeport is training additional workers and  offering opportunities for those workers that are deemed to have resigned to be able to apply for open positions through contractor companies.  While the union said its strike would extend into June,  Freeport has not seen additional absenteeism that would cause it to assume the workers had resigned, she added. The union, which began a 30-day strike on May 1, said on May 20 that it would extend the strike for a second month.

It is a centerpiece of Germany's biggest contemporary art exhibit, documenta 14. The exhibit, created by Argentine artist Marta Minujin, is also a poignant visual bridge to Athens, where a sister  documenta 14 show is being held for the first time since the prestigious exhibit began in 1955.   This year's dual exhibits include work by 160 artists from more than 50 countries, including, in Athens some rare Communist Albanian paintings. Both the Athens and Kassel shows will continue for 100 days. Organizers expect close to a million visitors in Kassel, where the exhibit will continue until Sept. 17.  It's an exhibition including many artists who went through rather concrete experiences of displacement,  Polish curator Adam Szymczyk told Reuters TV.  These artists and their bodies, their histories, kind of testify in many ways to this permanent state of displacement that is affecting many people around the globe.  In Kassel, Kurdish-Iraqi artist Hiwa K. has created an exhibit with a series of ceramic pipes entitled  when we were exhaling  that centers on his experience after fleeing northern Iraq on foot in the 1990s, too poor to afford a hotel room, Szymczyk said.

Refugee Crisis Slideshow (6 Images)Hiwa K. sees the exhibit as a broader reflection on poverty, capitalism and what happens when a person no longer has room for their belongings.  The refugee crisis is ... the outcome of what late capitalism is producing and what it is bringing to us,  Hiwa K. told Reuters TV.  It is interesting to show it in Kassel because you have a big industry for weapons here which are producing weapons for other countries.  He had hoped to turn the exhibit into an Airbnb space for documenta 14 visitors, but the city refused, citing health and safety reasons. Instead only the 13 students who helped decorate the cylinders will spend a night there during the art fair. Across town, an installation by Mexican artist Antonio Vega Macotela, looks at the global economy and humanity, allowing visitors to push a wheel on the  Mill of Blood  that produces a both a metallic coin and a digital  bitcoin.  Macotela says the mill is reminiscent of mills used in Mexico and Bolivia to mint coins, using the labor of animals and slaves.  This machine is different of course because the energy is not going to be given by animals or by slaves. It is going to be given by the people coming to the documenta,  Macotela said.

Freeport, whose current contract runs until 2021 with two 10-year extensions, will only agree to a license accompanied by an investment stability agreement that replicates current legal and fiscal certainty, Quirk said.  We think we're on a path to be able to get that resolved during this year and that's our top priority,  Quirk said via webcast from a Deutsche Bank conference. Without the agreement, Freeport is unlikely to continue investing in the country, she said, noting the company has already spent $3 billion on a project to transitions Grasberg to underground from open pit mining.  Production from the project, about half complete, is targeted for 2018 or 2019, she said. The government will meet Freeport next Wednesday for further talks and negotiations could be concluded by October 2017,  Teguh Pamuji, secretary general at Indonesia's energy and mining ministry told reporters on Friday.  The important thing is the substance, which will cover regulations and documents that will make them comfortable and give security for them to operate in Indonesia,  he said. Meantime, Freeport is grappling with labor problems. Its contractor-dominated workforce in Indonesia has been reduced to approximately 26,000 workers currently from about 33,000 at the start of 2017. Following the export restrictions, Freeport furloughed some 3,000 workers in the first quarter, Quirk said, sparking a strike and high levels of absenteeism. Freeport later deemed that approximately 3,000 full-time employees and 1,000 contractors had resigned, Quirk said. Quirk said Freeport is training additional workers and  offering opportunities for those workers that are deemed to have resigned to be able to apply for open positions through contractor companies.  While the union said its strike would extend into June,  Freeport has not seen additional absenteeism that would cause it to assume the workers had resigned, she added. The union, which began a 30-day strike on May 1, said on May 20 that it would extend the strike for a second month.

Davidson, whose colorful humor and approachability has won her many fans, notched up the Conservatives' best result since 1983 north of the border. She may yet prove key to choosing a new leader to replace the party's nationwide leader, Prime Minister Theresa May, whose future is now in question.  With an easy, raucous laugh, she is a self-described  shovel-faced lesbian , a literature graduate and a former journalist who says the army taught her the art of leadership when she was a reservist.  Davidson, 38, has unapologetically stood up for the United Kingdom.  I've never been afraid of debate and clash and think that's part of it. It's important that the Conservative voice isn't delegitimized,  she told Reuters prior to the election. In Britain's constantly shifting political landscape, she has reached Scottish voters by sticking to a message they not only understand but care about, as well as being more ordinary than the elite associated with her party 400 miles (644 km) down south in London.  I'm proud to be Scottish and British and female and gay and Christian and Conservative and a Fifer and fond of chips, a fan of  Hamilton  the musical and to prefer dogs to cats,  she told an audience at the Orwell Foundation last month. Scottish politics is quite distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom. Voters and parties are split between those who support the continued three-century economic and political union of England and Scotland, and those who want to break away.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats adopted the same message as the Conservatives by concentrating on opposing secession, and all did well on Thursday night. Davidson's forthright sense of humor also makes her different. Asked by Reuters if she objected to talking about personal issues, she laughed:  Just don't rummage in my knicker drawer.  She has gained traction by offsetting the dry image of May, whose Scottish approval ratings plummeted 15 points in three weeks according to pollster YouGov. In a campaign in which she rarely strayed off script, May earned the nickname  Maybot .  Also on the back foot is Scottish National Party leader and leader of the devolved Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon, who just a year ago seemed unassailable.  FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party leader Ruth Davidson speak during a general election campaign visit to a removals depot in Edinburgh, Scotland, June 5, 2017.Ben Stansall/Pool/File PhotoSturgeon's SNP won the election in Scotland, but its vote share fell after 10 years in power in Scotland's devolved parliament. Sturgeon has argued the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union is a seismic change which makes another vote on secession necessary because Scotland voted to keep its EU membership. But Scots do not want another vote so soon, if at all, after rejecting independence from the United Kingdom in 2014, although support for it is little changed at around 45 percent. Also helping Davidson has been the Labour Party's continued flip-flops on the union question.      Tank-Riding   Slideshow (10 Images)Scotland, more sparsely populated than the rest of the United Kingdom and with an 8 percent share of its economy, has not voted overwhelmingly for the Conservatives since the 1950s. On Thursday they won 13 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's 650 seat parliament, up from one. Davidson credits her  outsider's eye  for being able to overhaul the Scottish party after winning the leadership in 2011, and an ability to call a spade a spade. Critics say, however, that her high media profile, attractive in Westminster where politicians tend to show a more humdrum side, risks her not being taken seriously. She has been photographed on a tank with a British flag, or even atop a bull in the past, once describing herself as  a bit of a photo tart .  She's done very well to get where she has, but I think there is a danger that we've gone beyond the strong image with the marshalling of the troops, to her becoming almost a parody of herself with the tank-riding and bull-riding and flag-waving,  a senior SNP lawmaker said. Collaborators hint at a ruthless streak.  If Ruth disagrees with something, she says so,  said a former Conservative party adviser.  In private she might chuck a can of diet coke across a room. But she's not afraid of taking on an upopular idea if she sees the value in it.       Davidson wants to return the party to a broad base, and her colleagues clearly relish having a fresh voice onside.  The full-bodied character that people see on the screen is the character that people interact with in the party, and on the street when she comes to their doorstep,  says Jackson Carlaw, a Conservative lawmaker in the Scottish parliament  I think people in the party see she reaches people that the Conservatives haven’t got to in a long time.

Recommendations in the highly-anticipated review, aimed at ending a decade of political warfare over climate policy, mean that coal-fired power generation using carbon-capture technology could potentially be used alongside gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar. The blueprint for energy security, presented to federal and state leaders, is expected to drive a compromise on carbon and energy policy, urgently needed to curb power price volatility and end outages that have hurt manufacturers. It was commissioned last October after tornadoes triggered a state-wide blackout in South Australia that came as a wake-up call to politicians as it left homes in the dark for up to eight hours and crippled industry for nearly two weeks.  The lack of a transparent, credible and enduring emissions reduction mechanism for the electricity sector is now the key threat to system reliability,  the review said. The energy crisis has crept up on Australia, despite its rich endowment of coal and gas, as states have promoted rooftop solar and wind power in the absence of stable carbon policy at a federal level, and coal- and gas-fired plants have shut.  More of the same is not an option, we need to aim higher,  Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, the head of the review panel, said in a statement. Finkel called for the government to set a clean energy target to encourage investment in  reliable generation , including coal with carbon capture and storage or gas. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said such a target would work, adding that the recommendation had the virtue of being technology-agnostic.  We are looking at it, giving it very favorable consideration,  he told reporters. Finkel said the recommendation would help cut power prices by 10 percent for households and 20 percent for industry by 2050 compared to if policy was left unchanged. The review advised making new generators have  fast response  capabilities to deal with peak demand, meaning that variable sources like wind farms would need to be teamed with sources such as gas-fired power. It also suggested large generators should give three years' notice before closing to avoid shocking the market. Defying state bans on gas drilling and green group calls for no new gas-fired power, Finkel said gas would be essential for providing reliable electricity. Based on the current energy mix and expected growth, Australia's emissions in 2030 are projected to be about 57 percent higher than its target of 290 million tonnes under the Paris climate accord, the nation's top research body has said. Gas retailers, generators, and industry groups said they hoped the blueprint would provide the certainty needed to drive billions of dollars of investment into new generation.  This blueprint is the last, best hope that Australian energy customers have for a secure, reliable and affordable energy transition,  said Energy Networks Australia head John Bradley.

Sterling fell 2 percent to $1.2698 after sliding as much as 2.5 percent to $1.2636 in early European trade, its weakest level since April 18. May faced calls to quit after her election gamble to win a stronger mandate backfired, leaving no single party with a clear claim to power just 10 days before the start of negotiations on Britain's divorce from the European Union. She is due to make a speech at 0900 GMT. For a graphic on the poll, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48  The market wants more clarity now in terms of who is going to be Prime Minister, what form the government is going to take and ultimately how all that feeds through into upcoming Brexit negotiations,  said MUFG currency strategist Lee Hardman in London.  In the near term the increased political uncertainty and the risk of more disorderly Brexit negotiations should enforce pound weakness.  Reactions in other major currencies such as the dollar, euro and yen were limited. They had already largely shrugged off Thursday's testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which had been seen as the week's other big event.  Other currencies, like dollar/yen, are not reacting much as it is a more domestic affair this time, unlike last year's Brexit vote,  said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.  The focus for the broader currency market will now shift towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.  The Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates after it ends a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the focus is on whether it would leave the door open for further monetary tightening in the months to come. The U.S. currency was up 0.3 percent at 110.365 yen. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up half a percent at 97.392. It had retreated to a seven-month low of 96.511 midweek when caution ahead of Comey's testimony and the British election drove U.S. yields to lowest levels since November. But yields have since bounced from the lows as risk aversion ebbed. The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1193, off a seven-month high of $1.1285 touched a week ago on improved growth prospects in Europe and a broadly weaker dollar. But the common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme.

The game was preceded by a war of words in which Bayern midfielder Stefan Effenberg said that Cork's balding center-forward Dave Barry  looks like my grandfather  and Barry retorted that the outspoken German  plays like my grandfather.          The fireworks continued on the pitch: Barry himself fired Cork ahead in the first leg before Effenburg rescued a 1-1 draw for the embarrassed Bundesliga side, who won the return 2-0.  Those are the memories you can't take away from supporters,  said Niamh O'Mahony, a Cork supporter who is acting CEO of Supporters Direct Europe group.  But under the current European setup, the paths of the two sides would not have crossed. Bayern had finished second in the Bundesliga the previous season which nowadays would take them straight into the Champions League group stage. Cork's second place in the League of Ireland, meanwhile, would today send them into the depths of the Europa League qualifiers.  European soccer will become even more exclusive from 2018/19 when Spain, England, Germany and Italy will be guaranteed four places each in the 32-team Champions League group stage.  Eight more places will be shared between the next six biggest leagues, while a mere four slots will be contested by the remaining 44 domestic champions. The changes reflect the way in which a handful of big clubs, benefited by the huge television revenues in their own countries, have come to dominate the competition.  In the past, teams such as Dundee United, Widzew Lodz, Austria Vienna, IFK Gothenberg, CSKA Sofia and Anderlecht all reached the semi-finals of the old European Cup.  Malmo and Panathinaikos each got to the final and Red Star Belgrade and Steaua Bucharest won it. None of those teams could even dream of such progress today. Only nine different clubs, from five countries - Spain, England, France, Italy and Germany -- have reached the Champions League semi-finals in the last five seasons.  Even former European champions such as Ajax Amsterdam, Benfica and Porto have effectively become feeder clubs for the bigger leagues. Ajax appear to have the makings of a great team after last month reaching the Europa League final with a side whose average age was 22. Yet, it has already begun to break up with coach Peter Bosz joining Borussia Dortmund.

Ajax's Frenkie De Jong and Matthijs de Ligt look dejected after the match.  Reuters / Andrew Couldridge / File Photo / Livepic The recent changes to the European competitions do benefit clubs from the bigger leagues when European competitions were always about all clubs having the opportunity to play at that level,  said O'Mahony.  It's a badge of honor when you see your league and club doing well in Europe and the way the competition is going, it is losing that sort of magic.  Balancing Act UEFA has acknowledged that competitive balance is a big issue and one it is concerned about. But its president Aleksander Ceferin, elected after the changes to the Champions League had been approved, admitted that it was a balancing act.  We have to develop soccer all around Europe, but from the other side, we have five European countries who generate 76 percent of all the revenues of European soccer,  he told the BBC.  My program before the elections was creating the perfect balance and now I see that it’s not easy to create a perfect balance.  Cross-border leagues have been suggested to increase the television markets outside the main countries although these have been given a lukewarm response by both league and club representatives themselves. Others point out that dominance by a handful of clubs is not necessarily new and the market is far from closed.  You can argue that the dominance has increased over the last 30 years but it's marginal,  said Stefan Szymanski, professor of Sport Management at the University of Michigan.  What has changed is the way that dominance works, particularly in the case of clubs based in a large television market.   In many ways, there is a danger of reading too much into recent trends and assuming things will always be the same; it's not impossible we could see the renaissance or emergence of new rivals to the established clubs.  He said it was not inconceivable that a Gulf or Chinese investor could turn Ajax into a global club.  The same goes for Benfica or Porto.  Clubs in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, have suffered for the political and economic instability in their region.  One of the problems is that the rise of broadcast revenues coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and disintegration of Yugoslavia,  said Szymanski. Greater economic stability could lead to  large scale investment , he said.   The amount of money going into the game in Russia has been quite substantial,  he added.  We are not far off a Russian club being able to compete at the top level with the big (western) European clubs.

Recommendations in the highly-anticipated review, aimed at ending a decade of political warfare over climate policy, mean that coal-fired power generation using carbon-capture technology could potentially be used alongside gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar. The blueprint for energy security, presented to federal and state leaders, is expected to drive a compromise on carbon and energy policy, urgently needed to curb power price volatility and end outages that have hurt manufacturers. It was commissioned last October after tornadoes triggered a state-wide blackout in South Australia that came as a wake-up call to politicians as it left homes in the dark for up to eight hours and crippled industry for nearly two weeks.  The lack of a transparent, credible and enduring emissions reduction mechanism for the electricity sector is now the key threat to system reliability,  the review said. The energy crisis has crept up on Australia, despite its rich endowment of coal and gas, as states have promoted rooftop solar and wind power in the absence of stable carbon policy at a federal level, and coal- and gas-fired plants have shut.  More of the same is not an option, we need to aim higher,  Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, the head of the review panel, said in a statement. Finkel called for the government to set a clean energy target to encourage investment in  reliable generation , including coal with carbon capture and storage or gas. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said such a target would work, adding that the recommendation had the virtue of being technology-agnostic.  We are looking at it, giving it very favorable consideration,  he told reporters. Finkel said the recommendation would help cut power prices by 10 percent for households and 20 percent for industry by 2050 compared to if policy was left unchanged. The review advised making new generators have  fast response  capabilities to deal with peak demand, meaning that variable sources like wind farms would need to be teamed with sources such as gas-fired power. It also suggested large generators should give three years' notice before closing to avoid shocking the market. Defying state bans on gas drilling and green group calls for no new gas-fired power, Finkel said gas would be essential for providing reliable electricity. Based on the current energy mix and expected growth, Australia's emissions in 2030 are projected to be about 57 percent higher than its target of 290 million tonnes under the Paris climate accord, the nation's top research body has said. Gas retailers, generators, and industry groups said they hoped the blueprint would provide the certainty needed to drive billions of dollars of investment into new generation.  This blueprint is the last, best hope that Australian energy customers have for a secure, reliable and affordable energy transition,  said Energy Networks Australia head John Bradley.

The value of shares that shareholders have pledged as collateral to borrow money, mainly from brokerages, has quadrupled over two years to more than 6 trillion yuan ($898 billion), or a tenth of the total value of China's stock market, according to estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BOCOM International. For small-caps and start-ups, the proportion of pledged shares is higher, making up almost a fifth of companies' combined market value - or nearly $400 billion as of end-2016. Across the rest of China's stock markets, stock-collateralized loans account for 7.3 percent of total share value. These loans were taken out when share prices were strong, with shareholders borrowing against their shares and using the proceeds for everything from buying shares to repaying loans and investing in other companies, and sometimes luxury properties, analysts say. But investor interest in small-caps has waned this year, with the ChiNext start-up market down more than 8 percent and Shenzhen's predominantly small-cap SME board down more than 5 percent. In contrast, the blue-chip CSI300 index is up nearly 8 percent. That has left a growing number of borrowers scrambling to avoid forced liquidation, where brokers make them sell the shares they have used as collateral. Dongguan Kingsun Optoelectronic, which makes LED lighting products, and textile producer Dohia Group, for example, were among more than 100 companies flagging problems with stock-collateralised loans. They suspended trading in their shares in April and June, respectively, citing margin calls being triggered after their share prices slumped. If markets continue to slide, there could be a surge in margin calls on these loans, potentially triggering a vicious cycle of share selling, increasing the risk of broader financial instability, analysts warn.  If stock prices fall, but shareholders don't have enough capital to replenish their collateral, the pledged shares would face forced selling,  said Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.   That would develop into a negative spiral; as the more you sell, the lower the stock price, which would then trigger more forced selling.  China has a broader issue with collateral that could endanger the health of its financial system – fraudulent or  ghost  collateral, where pledged products either don't exist or are already sold or pledged to multiple lenders. BofA Merrill Lynch strategist David Cui warned that a potential  vicious selling circle  could lead to a replay of China's mid-2015 market crash.  As the 2015 experience shows, with high leverage, a vicious selling circle can quickly develop,  he said, noting a  moderate  risk of broad-based financial instability. The stock market crash nearly two years ago, when the Shanghai stock index lost 40 percent of its value in three months, was fueled largely by an unwinding of margin financing for stock purchases. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which oversees the country's stock markets, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, did not respond to emailed questions about the share collateral issue. Margin Calls Last month, as the ChiNext fell to near 2-1/2-year lows, more than 140 mostly smaller listed companies announced their shareholders had pledged additional shares to shore up the value of their loan collateral. That compares with 60 such cases in April, and fewer than 40 in January-March. Dongguan Kingsun Optoelectronic said its shares were suspended after controlling shareholders Li Xuliang and his sister Li Shuxian faced margin calls. They had already resolved the issue - raising fresh money from investors to deposit with lenders - so didn't need to sell the stock. Still, share trading remains suspended as the company plans to divest some assets, the official said. Stock filings show that Shenzhen-listed Dohia's founders Chen Jun and Huang Yani have pledged a total of 50 million shares, or 43 percent of the company's total shareholding. Dohia's stock price has more than halved over the past month. An investor relations officer for the company said measures had been taken to reduce collateral risks, including  pledging deposits or more collateral . He did not elaborate. The major shareholders at both Dohia and Dongguan Kingsun could not be reached for a comment. Business for Brokers Xia Zhengzhou, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities, said the ballooning in stock-collateralised loans had been driven by high share valuations and by brokerages looking to expand their revenue streams. Brokerages ranking high in this area include Haitong Securities, which has said it had stock-collateralised loans of 140.6 billion yuan at the end of last year, and is looking to do more. Third-ranked Guotai Junan, with outstanding stock-collateralised loans of 69.3 billion yuan at end-2016, said in its annual report that it remains  cautious and active , while maintaining rapid growth. The fastest growing include Founder Securities and Sealand Securities. Both say they take measures to control credit risks - from screening and educating investors to monitoring markets in real-time and forced liquidation where necessary.  This year, we have strengthened risk management and compliance (in the collateral credit business),  an investor relations official at Sealand Securities said.   Falling stock prices don’t necessarily lead to defaults.

The Prime Minister’s Conservative government has lost its majority in Britain’s general election. Even if it clings to power, the gamble on seeking a bigger mandate has spectacularly failed. May was the clear loser from results published in the early hours of June 9. She had called an election three years earlier than scheduled in an attempt to take advantage of the apparent unpopularity of her opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. At the time, some opinion polls suggested the Conservatives had a 21 percentage point lead.  That advantage evaporated during May’s hapless campaign. She insisted the election was about Brexit, but failed to offer any details about Britain’s departure from the European Union. She shunned debates with rivals in favour of staged events where she repeated empty mantras about being a “strong and stable” government. She claimed to offer firm leadership, but watered down a key policy on elderly care a few days after publishing the party’s manifesto. Even if her party returns to government, May’s authority has been severely – perhaps fatally – damaged. Obvious winners are harder to identify. Corbyn’s Labour Party has outperformed low expectations, helped by a strong turnout among younger voters. Yet it also fell far short of the 326 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons. It’s also hard to see how Labour could form a coalition with smaller groups like the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National Party without ditching large chunks of its hard-left manifesto, which envisages the nationalisation of utilities and railways as well as higher corporate taxes. The political calculus therefore points to an unstable government of an uncertain complexion. That could complicate negotiations with the EU, which are due to begin in earnest in a few days and must be completed by the end of March 2019. The pound dropped 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar as the results came in. The results defy firm policy conclusions. Poor results for the Conservatives suggest voters were lukewarm about May’s vision of a hard Brexit and tough restrictions on immigration. Labour attracted voters from both sides of last year’s referendum campaign, even though Corbyn insists the decision cannot be reversed. Yet these divisions will persist, especially if Britain’s recent poor economic performance continues. May’s rejection of free-market values in favour of a more interventionist government now looks like a mistake. But perhaps voters just decided – as they have in so many other countries of late – to reject the incumbent administration. That is a warning for the next British government, whoever gets to form it.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The resulting hung parliament threatens to derail talks over Britain's exit from the European Union and dampen consumer confidence, which could puncture a banking sector that many analysts believe is already overextended. Britain's financial sector had pinned its hopes on a strengthened majority for May's Conservative government, expecting it to deliver a more certain economic outlook. But her failure to win outright control of parliament could delay and complicate talks over Britain's exit from the European Union, increasing the likelihood of slowing economic growth.  This is the worst outcome apart from (Labour leader) Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister,  a government relations official at one of Britain's biggest banks said. The more internationally-focused banks fared better in the election aftermath. HSBC and Standard Chartered both rose by 2 percent by 0730 GMT thanks to their lower exposure to the British economy and higher proportion of dollar earnings which rose in value against the pound. Conservative-Led Coalition Analysts said the most favourable outcome now for banks is a Conservative-led coalition, likely with Northern Ireland's pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  The best case for the markets, as it stands now, is a continuity of the current government with outside support from some of the parties,  Chirantan Barua of Bernstein wrote in a research note. The DUP's manifesto makes little mention of banks and the financial sector, but lenders may be heartened by its emphasis on trade and customs relationships in the Brexit negotiations. Banks could still suffer under this scenario with a weakened government unlikely to push too hard for big business. May had said she would tighten laws on company takeovers and would ensure any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services if she won the election, in a potential blow to dealmaking. Labour-Led Coalition The worst outcome for banks, especially Royal Bank of Scotland, would be if Corbyn is able to form a coalition government with another party, or win a follow-up election. Labour in its manifesto said it would launch a consultation to break the state-owned lender into smaller regional banks. Other lenders would suffer under a Labour government too, with the party set to hike corporate taxes from 19 percent to 26 percent by 2020 and to restore a separate bank levy. In further measures hostile to banks, Labour could pass laws preventing banks from closing unprofitable branches in places where they are the last branch in town, and intervene to curb profits banks make on variable rate mortgages.

That may be just what the economy needs. The hung parliament that emerged from June 8’s election leaves room for a middle-ground approach to tax and spending, while some of the worst manifesto ideas on migration, Brexit and nationalising industries are likely to be consigned to the policy dustbin. After Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative party lost its majority, horse-trading will follow. That might result in a government with a wafer-thin hold on power, or another election within months. While memories of the 1974 hung parliament will resurface, this time is different. The incumbent party has the largest number of seats and the British economy is not in recession. Look past the uncertainty, and stalemate has its economic charms. Both major parties were planning to interfere with the ability of companies and investors to create jobs and grow the economy. The Conservatives had proposed levies on foreign workers and a brutal cap on migration that would have left employers starved of talent. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wanted to crank up corporation taxes and nationalize rail, mail and energy companies. Then there’s Brexit. Theresa May had asked for a strong hand; whoever follows her will have a weak one. That might make European trading partners more willing to push out key deadlines or offer transitional arrangements that keep financial and trade flows going. It will certainly mean that ideology takes a back seat to pragmatism, and that a majority is unable to railroad through irreversible decisions. The financial industry in particular can consider this a lucky escape. May had virtually pretended the sector didn’t exist, even though finance generates twice as much economic value per employee than the economy overall. Corbyn wanted to instate a punitive financial transaction tax. The surplus generated by the City of London urgently needs to be spread around the country more fairly, but not stamped out of existence. There will be anxiety ahead, for sure. But Britain is not Italy, a country that has had more than 60 governments since 1945, in need of major reforms but with no political party strong enough to push them through. If anything, the UK needs a state with better things to do than meddle too much with the economy. That’s what it is now likely to get.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

But he’s too shy - first to confess to her, and later to tell their families. A series of misunderstandings coupled with Gattu’s reluctance to own up to their relationship leads to many a funny situation. Slideshow (4 Images)Thanks to those misunderstandings, rumours swirl about Binny’s alleged dalliances, and her brother wants to see her married off as soon as possible. Their failure to see Gattu as anything but the neighbour’s son means our hero finds himself entrusted with guarding the woman he wants to marry while her family searches for a groom. Even though there is enough slapstick comedy in the film, the real humour comes from writer Vinit Vyas’ gentle observations of the motley group of characters that make up this film. From Gattu’s earnest father (Darshan Jariwala) to his loyal friend Bhura (played wonderfully by Herry Tangiri), Vyas and Pannalal manage to infuse smart lines and lots of wry wit into their story. Jariwala, Rao and Tangri have some of the best lines in the film, and they deliver them with deadpan precision. The scene where a drunken Rao berates Bollywood heroes and blames them for his messy love life is wonderfully done, as are scenes between him and Tangri. Soon enough though, the jokes run dry and the story, which is flimsy anyway, feels over-stretched. In the midst of what is a very good ensemble cast, Haasan stands out like a sore thumb. She is horribly miscast and unable to pull off neither the humour nor any chemistry with Rao.  The romance in this romantic comedy is non-existent, but thankfully the wit and sparkle in the humour make it a fun watch.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-behen-hogi-teri-idUSKBN1900PQ"},

Damien Canizares, who runs a butcher's shop with his son in the Mediterranean coastal city of Nice, holds neither of those views. Matching what a third of voters did in the May 7 presidential election, he will put the name of the candidate representing the National Front (FN) and its leader Marine Le Pen in his parliamentary voting envelope on Sunday. Le Pen rejects the closer European ties, the embrace of globalization, and the liberalized rules for businesses that centrist President Emmanuel Macron says can bring prosperity. She does advocate tax cuts for companies, but she would also tax imports, restrict trade, protect workers rights, and close borders to migrants to keep jobs in France and combat Islamist militant attacks. For voters like Canizares, she is a conduit for anger, and will be again on Sunday.  (Macron's) a young president, and there's plenty of hope, but sadly nothing will change. Nothing. Because if you don't change the mentality of people, you change nothing. It's the people who need to change, not the president, sadly,  he told Reuters.  I'll vote Marine, because, sadly I am angry, and if she doesn't make it, I don't care, because I'm angry.  The 58 year-old -- who says he left school at 13 to start a life of hard work -- believes no government can fix his main concerns. These are the high tax and social charges he says prevent people from enjoying the fruits of their labor, and the fear of more attacks like the truck rampage that killed 86 people on the promenade 100 meters (yards) from his shop last summer. Le Pen may well get elected as a lawmaker in the northern constituency she is fighting - but Canizares is right to doubt her chances of having a significant force in parliament. Opinion polls show her first round vote nationally will be below a fifth, while electoral pacts among the other parties aimed at keeping FN candidates out could keep a party that won only two seats in 2012 but hoped for many more this time in single figures. Giving Hope a Chance     Jerome Busson Girie, stay-at-home father of three and former financial controller, poses in his house in Genas, near Lyon, France, June 2, 2017. Picture taken June 2, 2017.Emmanuel FoudrotDespite anger from voters like Canizares, poll surveys show Macron's new centrist party and its allies will wind up with a thumping majority in the 577 seat National Assembly. Some predict the biggest since Charles De Gaulle's conservatives won over 80 percent of seats in 1968. Stay-at-home father of three Jerome Busson Girie is among those who want that outcome for Macron's Republic on the March (LREM) party. At 39, he is the new president's age, and is on the hunt for a job in a country where unemployment sits around 10 percent. Macron says he can get that rate down to seven with measures including a corporation tax cut, limits on layoff costs, and more flexible working hours. Patrick Macquerel, newspaper seller, poses inside his newsstand in Marseille, France, May 31, 2017. Picture taken May 31, 2017.Jean-Paul Pelissier If all goes according to plan he can quickly give businesses back their confidence,  Busson Girie told Reuters at his home in Genas, near France's third largest city, Lyon.  The big ones yes, but also the small ones, which all too often hesitate to hire people.  The former financial controller also favours Macron's plans for special educational investments in depressed areas and investment in training aimed at sectors that face a skills shortages. The hope is tinged with caution, however. Florence Lapica, 42, a general practice doctor in Soucieu-en-Jarrest, another Lyon satellite town, is concerned about France's creaking public healthcare system, and says it is  too early to tell  whether Macron's plan to invest 5 billion euros there will go to the right places. For some, though, it is just a question of giving Macron a shot. Back on the south coast, Patrick Macquerel is willing to give the new president the benefit of the doubt.  It all offers hope,  he said from his newspaper kiosk in Marseille.  You have to go with the flow of the presidential election and give this new government a chance to apply its reforms.

The trade figures, released by the Federal Statistics Office on Friday, were another sign that Germany's robust economic upswing is likely to continue following Thursday's news that industrial production rose by more than expected in April. The shrinking trade surplus is also welcome news for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in September national elections amid criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called Germany's trade and spending policies  very bad  for America. Seasonally adjusted exports were up 0.9 percent on the month while imports jumped 1.2 percent, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had pointed to exports rising 0.3 percent and imports falling 1.0 percent. Domestic demand has replaced exports as the main growth driver in Germany as consumers and the state are benefiting from falling unemployment, rising tax revenues and record-low borrowing costs enabled by the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus edged down to 19.8 billion euros from a revised 19.9 billion euros in March. The April reading was below the Reuters consensus forecast of 20.3 billion euros. Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, plunged to 15.1 billion euros after a revised 31.1 billion euros in March, the data showed. Protectionist Debate BayernLB economist Johannes Mayr said the international debate about trade policies and protectionism so far had not put the brakes on German export growth.  We continue to expect net trade to contribute to overall growth,  Mayr added. The German economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2016, the strongest rate in half a decade, helped by soaring private consumption, higher state spending and increased construction. In the first quarter of 2017, the economy picked up further speed as exports also helped to drive growth, pushing up Germany's quarterly growth rate to 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. In another positive sign, the German central bank on Friday increased its growth forecasts for the German economy. The Bundesbank now expects adjusted GDP growth of 1.9 percent in 2017, 1.7 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019. All three figures were 0.1 percentage points higher compared with the previous forecasts from December. Despite the better growth prospects, the Bundesbank expects German inflation to remain well below the ECB's target of just under 2 percent for another year. It cut its inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent respectively, while nudging up its projection for this year to 1.5 percent. Its previous estimates put price growth at 1.4 percent this year, 1.7 percent the next and 1.9 percent in 2019. Coming a day after the ECB trimmed its inflation estimates for the euro zone as a whole, the downgraded Bundesbank projections may weaken its hand in calling for an imminent scaling down of the ECB's monetary stimulus.

Below is a list of the 100 most marginal seats from 2015, ranked from smallest vote margin to largest and showing the swing that had been needed for seats to change hands. Labour hung on to many of its smallest margin seats, and made gains from the Conservatives.  Below are some key developments so far: Key Labour Gains Vale of Clwyd Labour Gain The first Labour gain of the night. Some polls had showed the Conservatives doing well in Wales, where most people voted to leave the European Union. But Labour overturned a thin 237 vote margin, increasing its vote by around 12 percentage points Sheffield Hallam Labour Gain Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg was deputy Prime Minister little over 2 years ago, but he lost out to Labour after Conservatives, who had backed him tactically in 2015 following the two party's time in coalition government, returned to voting for the Conservatives. The Conservative share of the vote rose 10 percentage points, while Labour increased their share by just 2 points. Thar was enough to produce a near 6 point fall for the Lib Dems, and hand Labour the seat. Brighton Kemptown This marginal seat had been held by the Conservative minister responsible for financial services, Simon Kirby, with a majority of just 690. It voted strongly in favor of remaining in the EU and Labour surged to take the seat. It has been a bellwether at national elections since 1979 and the Green Party, who won more than 3,000 votes here in 2015, did not stand. Middle England Bellwethers Nuneaton Conservative Hold Considered a national bellwether seat, holding Nuneaton gave May's Conservatives a early boost, which proved to be illusory. They increased their majority here in 2015, despite it being a Labour target, and it provided one of the first indications the Conservatives were on course for victory. However, Labour also increased their share of the vote in the seat, as support for the anti-European Union party UKIP collapsed. Darlington Labour Hold This was a key Conservative target seat, which voted in favor of leaving the EU. But Labour held the seat, with both parties increasing their share of the vote by about 8 percentage points. Bury North Labour Gain This had been a Conservative-held marginal seat, with a majority of just 378 voters. It has been a bellwether seat so the fact the Conservatives lost it, despite facing no UKIP candidate, supports the view that they could lose their majority.     Canterbury Labour Gain Canterbury, which had been Conservative since 1918, saw the Labour party's vote share rise by over 20 percentage points, in a stunning victory. Labour won the seat by fewer than 200 votes London Goes Red London, which voted heavily to remain in the European Union last year, saw big swings to Labour in many places. Battersea Labour Gain British junior finance minister Jane Ellison was defending a 15 percentage point lead in Battersea in London, but the strongly pro-Remain seat voted Labour. The opposition party increased its share of the vote by 9.1 percentage points, while Conservative share of the vote dropped by nearly 11 points.     Ealing Central & Acton Labour Hold Labour's Rupa Huq had just a 274 seat majority in 2015, but gained a massive 16.5 percentage point increase to record nearly 60 percent of the vote it the strongly pro-remain seat. Croydon Central Labour Gain Conservative MP Gavin Barwell had one of the slimmest majorities in the country, and lost his seat as Labour benefited from support in remain-voting patches of London Twickenham Lib Dem Gain Labour weren't the only party to do well in London. the Lib Dems retook Twickenham, a seat they had lost in 2015. Vince Cable, who served in cabinet in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015, regained his seat. Snp Losses The Scottish National Party, which dominated in Scotland in 2015, suffered some notable losses Gordon, Angus, Moray Conservative Gain The Conservatives won several key seats in Scotland from Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, delivering a blow to the party that had a near clean sweep in Scotland two years ago. SNP veteran and former leader Alex Salmond lost his Gordon seat as the Conservative Party surged in Scotland. Colin Clark defeated Salmond, who was also Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, by 2,607 votes. Salmond said people had not seen the last of him. The Conservatives also took Moray from the SNP, unseating the party's leader in Westminster Angus Robertson. While Moray voted to remain in the European Union, it did so by the tightest margin in Scotland, and was strongly against independence in 2014's Scottish referendum. In Angus, the Conservatives overturned an 11,230 SNP majority to win by 2,644 votes,  Midlothian, East Lothian, Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour Gains Labour used to be dominant in Scotland, and showed a few signs of a comeback, picking up several seats that had rejected independence in 2014.

The Portland smelter has been running at a third of its 300,000-tonnes-per-year capacity since a freak storm prompted the power outage in December, causing molten aluminum to solidify in the facility's potlines and freezing production.  Getting to the half way point in our bid to restore the business has been a big task, but what I have seen up to now gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver the plan,  Plant Manager Peter Chellis said in a statement.    The plant's resumption has come in part due to a A$240 million ($182 million) government-sponsored rescue package that has secured its future for at least four years in a state that has suffered from a spate of job losses including the shutdown of three major car makers and a power station. With local power costs soaring, a cheap source of energy was also needed. The Portland smelter lined up a four-year power supply deal with AGL Energy for 510 megawatts, or about 10 percent of the state's electricity load, earlier this year.   We are expecting to have production restored to pre-outage levels by early to mid-August,  Alcoa spokeswoman Jodie Read told Reuters.  The government's financial aid is dependent on the smelter staying open at least until 2021 and output remaining at least 90 percent of pre-blackout levels.

The company, which is preparing to buy John Menzies' distribution arm, said its board had received the details of the allegation on June 7 and was co-operating fully with the City of London Police Economic Crime Directorate.  The investigation is at a very early stage,  DX said in a brief statement, without giving any details of what the allegation against it was. A spokeswoman for DX declined to comment further. DX traces its origins to the legal sector and even today its DX Exchange members' network supplies the majority of the top legal firms within the UK.  The service, which can be used to correspond with 25,000 members across the UK and Republic of Ireland, also caters to central and local government, banks and building societies, estate agents and accountants, among others. The news comes as DX is set to put to vote its planned reverse takeover of Menzies distribution arm, after securing the backing of its largest investor Gatemore Capital Management earlier this month with revised deal terms. The deal is aimed at bolstering DX, which issued a warning in February and is one of several big operators in the crowded parcels market, where DHL-owner Deutsche Post has bulked up by buying UK Mail and Amazon has started its own deliveries. Under the deal, Menzies investors will get 60 percent of the issued shares in the enlarged firm. DX shareholders will receive 35 percent, and the rest will go to the John Menzies pension fund. If the deal closes, Menzies' distribution managing director Greg Michael will become DX chief executive and distribution finance director Paul McCourt will become DX chief financial officer. Menzies said on Friday that its board was considering its position after noting DX's announcement. Its stock was down 2.7 percent at 705.5 pence at 0711 GMT.

In its monthly crop report, the agriculture ministry said it expects 2017/18 corn output of 211.65 million tonnes, down 0.7 percent from last month's forecast and 3.6 percent lower than last year. The figure in June's Chinese Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (CASDE) would make it the smallest crop since 2013, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Center think tank.     Farmers in parts of China's northeast corn belt regions switched to soybeans and substitute grains after drought made it hard to plant corn, leading to a drop in corn acreage, the CASDE report said. Corn output was also hit by hail in the country's northern Hebei and central Henan provinces, where heavy rains and wind damaged young crops, the report said.  The most-active Chinese corn futures rose 2.1 percent to 1,672 yuan per tonne, their highest in nearly two months, as some speculators bet on higher prices due to extreme weather. Concerns about U.S. crops may also have been a factor behind the fresh buying, which broke the usually volatile market out of a prolonged period of rangebound trade, said Meng Jinhui, analyst at Shengda futures. Prices were on track for their best daily performance in three months. Weather has also affected crops in the United States, where spot corn futures hit a near one-year high last week on forecasts for potentially stressful crop weather in the Midwest. China also reduced its 2017/18 sugar import forecast to 3.2 million tonnes from 3.5 million tonnes previously, according to the CASDE report.  China's commerce ministry imposed hefty tariffs on sugar imports in a ruling last month, closing the gap between Chinese and global prices.

German Bund yields were pinned near six-week lows, having already tumbled in recent weeks on the possibility of an election upset as polls suggested a tightening race between Britain's leading parties. No clear winner emerged from Thursday's British election. With talks of unprecedented complexity on Britain's departure from the EU to start in just 10 days' time, sterling was hit by uncertainty over who would form the next government and over the fundamental direction Brexit would take. Across the euro area, government bond yields opened slightly lower, with French 10-year bonds yields touching a fresh five-month low at around 0.63 percent. Italian yields extended the previous day's sharp falls to hit a 1-1/2 week low at 2.14 percent. Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield edged lower to 0.25 percent and was within sight of six-week lows hit the previous session after the European Central Bank cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme.  A flight-to-safety was already visible running into the election and other key risk events this week,  said Martin van Vliet, a senior rates strategist at ING. Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly called the snap election seven weeks ago, even though no vote was due until 2020. At that point, polls predicted she would massively increase the slim majority she had inherited from predecessor David Cameron. Instead, she risks an ignominious exit after just 11 months at Number 10 Downing Street, which would be the shortest tenure of any prime minister for almost a century. Political turmoil in Britain is the worst-case scenario for EU leaders who want to press ahead quickly with Brexit talks. These are due to start on June 19 but now could be delayed - narrowing the window of time available to clinch a deal before a March 2019 deadline. Any expectations that a softer Brexit stance and fiscal expansion could arise from the election could renew global reflation trades and push bond yields up, analysts said.  If forecasts solidify into reality then, on realisation of a softer Brexit stance and more fiscally easy outlook, the market should be factoring in greater growth and inflation and gilt supply, generating a steeper gilt curve and stronger GBP,  said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho.

Below are some of the candidates who could run if May stepped down:  David Davis, 68 Davis, plucked from political wilderness by May to lead Britain's Brexit policy, has run in two previous leadership contests. A long-time eurosceptic, he is seen as an experienced political operator who used his time out of government to campaign against the erosion of civil liberties.   Philip Hammond, 61 A long-serving cabinet minister, Hammond was appointed finance minister by May in 2016. If May had won a large majority, local media suggested he could have been sacked after clashing with May's advisers over policy, and other senior cabinet ministers after pushing for a softer approach to Brexit talks to protect the financial industry.   Amber Rudd, 53 Rudd was promoted to lead the interior ministry after May became prime minister last year, moving from the Department for Energy and Climate Change. She is seen as a close ally of May's and was used during the election as a spokeswoman, including during a televised debate which May refused to participate in. She has led Britain's response to three major militant attacks this year.  Boris Johnson, 52 Johnson is one of the most recognizable figures in British politics thanks to his shock of platinum blonde hair and colorful turn of phrase - attributes that made him a key asset for the Brexit campaign during last year's EU referendum. A two-term Mayor of London, former journalist and currently foreign secretary, Johnson was favorite to replace David Cameron after the Brexit vote before ally Michael Gove decided to run instead, scuppering his leadership bid. Liam Fox, 55 Fox stood for the leadership of the Conservatives in 2005 and 2016. He was appointed defense secretary in 2010 but was forced to resign a year later after letting an unauthorized aide access ministerial meetings. A prominent eurosceptic, he was rehabilitated by May, who appointed him to lead Britain's push for new trading relationships after Brexit. Nicky Morgan, 44 Morgan was one of a handful of Conservatives to rebel against May's vision of Brexit, arguing in favor of remaining in the EU's single market. She has held different ministerial roles including as education minister. She was mooted as a possible successor to David Cameron in 2016, but ended up backing Michael Gove. Michael Gove, 49 A prominent Brexiteer during the EU referendum, Gove failed in a 2016 bid to lead the party when his decision to abandon Boris Johnson and run himself was viewed as treacherous by some fellow lawmakers.  He led sweeping reforms of Britain's education and justice departments under Cameron, but was overlooked for a senior role when May took over. A former journalist, he interviewed Donald Trump days before he was sworn in as U.S. president. Priti Patel, 45 Patel was part of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, and has served in ministerial roles since being elected to parliament in 2010. She has worked in the finance ministry and most recently as a member of the cabinet, heading up the international development department.

Xi also congratulated India on becoming an official member state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) security bloc, jointly led by Russia and China. The two leaders meet in Astana, Kazakhstan on the sidelines of a summit for the eight country bloc, which also includes nearly a dozen other states as partners or observer states. Modi thanked Xi for supporting India to join the SCO and said that the two countries should respect each others core interests and appropriately manage differences, according to the Chinese foreign ministry post. No comment was immediately available from the Indian delegation. Xi also said that China and India should increase trade and investment cooperation to ensure that the two countries were able to enjoy more  early stage profits  from large scale projects in infrastructure and industry.  Substantive progress  on the China-India-Bangladesh-Myanmar project should also be promoted, Xi said, referring to a project to increase connectivity and trade between the four countries. India has expressed unease over China's  Silk Road  initiative to expand trade links between China and Eurasia, and did not send government officials from Delhi to attend a summit of leaders and ministers in Beijing in May. [nL4N1ID390} A visit in April by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who Beijing brands a separatist, to a region controlled by India but claimed by China stoked tensions between the two countries. The Indian government has since taken steps to cool tensions, rejecting an Australian request to take part in joint naval exercises with the United States and Japan last month to avoid agonizing China. The SCO was formed by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2001 to fight threats posed by radical Islam and drug trafficking from neighboring Afghanistan. China has said that it supports Iran's membership of the security bloc, as requested by Russia, and that the subject is under discussion at the summit, despite having been refused last year.

The value of shares that shareholders have pledged as collateral to borrow money, mainly from brokerages, has quadrupled over two years to more than 6 trillion yuan ($898 billion), or a tenth of the total value of China's stock market, according to estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BOCOM International. For small-caps and start-ups, the proportion of pledged shares is higher, making up almost a fifth of companies' combined market value - or nearly $400 billion as of end-2016. Across the rest of China's stock markets, stock-collateralized loans account for 7.3 percent of total share value. These loans were taken out when share prices were strong, with shareholders borrowing against their shares and using the proceeds for everything from buying shares to repaying loans and investing in other companies, and sometimes luxury properties, analysts say. But investor interest in small-caps has waned this year, with the ChiNext start-up market down more than 8 percent and Shenzhen's predominantly small-cap SME board down more than 5 percent. In contrast, the blue-chip CSI300 index is up nearly 8 percent. That has left a growing number of borrowers scrambling to avoid forced liquidation, where brokers make them sell the shares they have used as collateral. Dongguan Kingsun Optoelectronic, which makes LED lighting products, and textile producer Dohia Group, for example, were among more than 100 companies flagging problems with stock-collateralised loans. They suspended trading in their shares in April and June, respectively, citing margin calls being triggered after their share prices slumped. If markets continue to slide, there could be a surge in margin calls on these loans, potentially triggering a vicious cycle of share selling, increasing the risk of broader financial instability, analysts warn.  If stock prices fall, but shareholders don't have enough capital to replenish their collateral, the pledged shares would face forced selling,  said Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.   That would develop into a negative spiral; as the more you sell, the lower the stock price, which would then trigger more forced selling.  China has a broader issue with collateral that could endanger the health of its financial system – fraudulent or  ghost  collateral, where pledged products either don't exist or are already sold or pledged to multiple lenders. BofA Merrill Lynch strategist David Cui warned that a potential  vicious selling circle  could lead to a replay of China's mid-2015 market crash.  As the 2015 experience shows, with high leverage, a vicious selling circle can quickly develop,  he said, noting a  moderate  risk of broad-based financial instability. The stock market crash nearly two years ago, when the Shanghai stock index lost 40 percent of its value in three months, was fueled largely by an unwinding of margin financing for stock purchases. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which oversees the country's stock markets, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, did not respond to emailed questions about the share collateral issue. Margin Calls Last month, as the ChiNext fell to near 2-1/2-year lows, more than 140 mostly smaller listed companies announced their shareholders had pledged additional shares to shore up the value of their loan collateral. That compares with 60 such cases in April, and fewer than 40 in January-March. Dongguan Kingsun Optoelectronic said its shares were suspended after controlling shareholders Li Xuliang and his sister Li Shuxian faced margin calls. They had already resolved the issue - raising fresh money from investors to deposit with lenders - so didn't need to sell the stock. Still, share trading remains suspended as the company plans to divest some assets, the official said. Stock filings show that Shenzhen-listed Dohia's founders Chen Jun and Huang Yani have pledged a total of 50 million shares, or 43 percent of the company's total shareholding. Dohia's stock price has more than halved over the past month. An investor relations officer for the company said measures had been taken to reduce collateral risks, including  pledging deposits or more collateral . He did not elaborate. The major shareholders at both Dohia and Dongguan Kingsun could not be reached for a comment. Business for Brokers Xia Zhengzhou, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities, said the ballooning in stock-collateralised loans had been driven by high share valuations and by brokerages looking to expand their revenue streams. Brokerages ranking high in this area include Haitong Securities, which has said it had stock-collateralised loans of 140.6 billion yuan at the end of last year, and is looking to do more. Third-ranked Guotai Junan, with outstanding stock-collateralised loans of 69.3 billion yuan at end-2016, said in its annual report that it remains  cautious and active , while maintaining rapid growth. The fastest growing include Founder Securities and Sealand Securities. Both say they take measures to control credit risks - from screening and educating investors to monitoring markets in real-time and forced liquidation where necessary.  This year, we have strengthened risk management and compliance (in the collateral credit business),  an investor relations official at Sealand Securities said.   Falling stock prices don’t necessarily lead to defaults.

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.8251 percent on Friday, more than 17 basis points lower than the previous week's closing average rate at 2.9981 percent.      Traders said there were few signs of liquidity stress  this week after fresh fund injections led by the central bank.      A Shanghai-based trader at a Chinese bank said monthly payments of a regulatory tax will begin next week, while the central bank's quarterly Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) will tighten liquidity further.     The People's Bank of China injected 498 billion yuan ($73.27 billion) into the financial system through its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Tuesday, more than offsetting tha amount of maturing loans this month.     Three batches of earlier MLF loans totaling 431.3 billion yuan are due to mature in June, according to Reuters calculations based on official data from the central bank.     Market players did not expect the central bank to renew a batch of maturing six-month MLF loans with a value of 207 billion yuan next Friday, but anticipated the PBOC would raise its interest rates soon, with expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike next week.     In March, after the U.S. Fed raised interest rates, the PBOC lifted short-term interest rates in what economists said was a bid to stave off capital outflows and keep the yuan stable.     The central bank has injected 974.2 billion yuan on a net basis through the MLF loans so far this year, compared with a net drain of 775 billion yuan via open market operations during the same period, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data from the PBOC.     Nearly 200 billion yuan of accumulated net cash injection with longer maturity into the country's financial system so far this year clearly showed that the authorities have been walking a tight rope between maintaining overall liquidity in the market, while deleveraging and reducing risks without hurting the real economy.     In the open market operations, the PBOC drained a net 10 billion yuan from the money market this week, compared with a net injection of 30 billion yuan a week earlier.

In its monthly crop report, the agriculture ministry said it expects 2017/18 corn output of 211.65 million tonnes, down 0.7 percent from last month's forecast and 3.6 percent lower than last year. The figure in June's Chinese Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (CASDE) would make it the smallest crop since 2013, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Center think tank.     Farmers in parts of China's northeast corn belt regions switched to soybeans and substitute grains after drought made it hard to plant corn, leading to a drop in corn acreage, the CASDE report said. Corn output was also hit by hail in the country's northern Hebei and central Henan provinces, where heavy rains and wind damaged young crops, the report said.  The most-active Chinese corn futures rose 2.1 percent to 1,672 yuan per tonne, their highest in nearly two months, as some speculators bet on higher prices due to extreme weather. Concerns about U.S. crops may also have been a factor behind the fresh buying, which broke the usually volatile market out of a prolonged period of rangebound trade, said Meng Jinhui, analyst at Shengda futures. Prices were on track for their best daily performance in three months. Weather has also affected crops in the United States, where spot corn futures hit a near one-year high last week on forecasts for potentially stressful crop weather in the Midwest. China also reduced its 2017/18 sugar import forecast to 3.2 million tonnes from 3.5 million tonnes previously, according to the CASDE report.  China's commerce ministry imposed hefty tariffs on sugar imports in a ruling last month, closing the gap between Chinese and global prices.

Elliott's move follows a decision last week by U.S. firm PPG Industries to drop its attempts to buy Akzo for at least six months. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment. Under Dutch market rules, investors must report their holdings when they pass certain thresholds. Elliott could in theory own anywhere between 5 percent and 10 percent of Akzo's outstanding share capital. Elliott led a group of shareholders dissatisfied with Akzo's reluctance to enter talks with PPG over a 26.3 billion euro ($29.44 billion) buyout proposal, which represented a 50 percent premium to Akzo's share price in March before the approach. With support from other institutional investors representing 18 percent of Akzo's shareholder base, Elliott launched a court case in Amsterdam seeking an investigation into alleged mismanagement at Akzo and an extraordinary shareholder meeting to discuss the dismissal of the company's chairman, Antony Burgmans. Judges declined Elliott's request for such immediate remedies on May 29, but ordered the company to make attempts to repair its relationship with shareholders. It is not clear whether Elliott intends to pursue the case further. The hedge fund has previously said it began building a stake in Akzo in late 2016, seeing the owner of brands including Dulux paint as undervalued and underperforming.

The company, which is preparing to buy John Menzies' distribution arm, said its board had received the details of the allegation on June 7 and was co-operating fully with the City of London Police Economic Crime Directorate.  The investigation is at a very early stage,  DX said in a brief statement, without giving any details of what the allegation against it was. A spokeswoman for DX declined to comment further. DX traces its origins to the legal sector and even today its DX Exchange members' network supplies the majority of the top legal firms within the UK.  The service, which can be used to correspond with 25,000 members across the UK and Republic of Ireland, also caters to central and local government, banks and building societies, estate agents and accountants, among others. The news comes as DX is set to put to vote its planned reverse takeover of Menzies distribution arm, after securing the backing of its largest investor Gatemore Capital Management earlier this month with revised deal terms. The deal is aimed at bolstering DX, which issued a warning in February and is one of several big operators in the crowded parcels market, where DHL-owner Deutsche Post has bulked up by buying UK Mail and Amazon has started its own deliveries. Under the deal, Menzies investors will get 60 percent of the issued shares in the enlarged firm. DX shareholders will receive 35 percent, and the rest will go to the John Menzies pension fund. If the deal closes, Menzies' distribution managing director Greg Michael will become DX chief executive and distribution finance director Paul McCourt will become DX chief financial officer. Menzies said on Friday that its board was considering its position after noting DX's announcement. Its stock was down 2.7 percent at 705.5 pence at 0711 GMT.

The Portland smelter has been running at a third of its 300,000-tonnes-per-year capacity since a freak storm prompted the power outage in December, causing molten aluminum to solidify in the facility's potlines and freezing production.  Getting to the half way point in our bid to restore the business has been a big task, but what I have seen up to now gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver the plan,  Plant Manager Peter Chellis said in a statement.    The plant's resumption has come in part due to a A$240 million ($182 million) government-sponsored rescue package that has secured its future for at least four years in a state that has suffered from a spate of job losses including the shutdown of three major car makers and a power station. With local power costs soaring, a cheap source of energy was also needed. The Portland smelter lined up a four-year power supply deal with AGL Energy for 510 megawatts, or about 10 percent of the state's electricity load, earlier this year.   We are expecting to have production restored to pre-outage levels by early to mid-August,  Alcoa spokeswoman Jodie Read told Reuters.  The government's financial aid is dependent on the smelter staying open at least until 2021 and output remaining at least 90 percent of pre-blackout levels. The plant is co-owned by Alcoa, Australian firm Alumina Ltd, China's CITIC Resources and an arm of Japan's Marubeni Corp.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with the small Gulf Arab state on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran - charges Qatar calls baseless.  Several other countries later followed suit. Would-be mediators including U.S. President Donald Trump and Kuwait's ruling emir have struggled to ease a crisis that Qataris say has led to a blockade of their nation. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar had not yet been presented with a list of demands by countries that cut off diplomatic and transport ties, but insisted the matter be solved peacefully.   We have been isolated because we are successful and progressive. We are a platform for peace,  he told reporters in Doha in a defiant tone.  We are not ready to surrender, and will never be ready to surrender, the independence of our foreign policy,  he said, warning that the dispute threatened the stability of the region. Saudi Arabia's closure of Qatar's only land border sparked fears of major price hikes and food shortages for its population of 2.7 million people, with long queues forming as some supermarkets began running out of stock. With supply chains disrupted and anxiety mounting about deepening economic turbulence, banks and firms in Gulf Arab states were trying to keep business links to Qatar open and avoid a costly firesale of assets.  We're not worried about a food shortage, we're fine. We can live forever like this, we are well prepared,  Sheikh Mohammed said. He said Iran was ready to help with securing food supplies in the emirate, an investment powerhouse and supplier of natural gas to world markets but tiny and reliant on imports. Turkey has meanwhile brought forward a planned troop deployment to Qatar and pledged to provide food and water supplies to its Arab ally, which hosts a Turkish military base. Related CoverageQatar state TV shuts down website after hacking attemptsEgypt calls for U.N. inquiry into accusation of Qatar ransom paymentA senior UAE official accused Qatar of escalating the row by seeking help from Turkey and Iran.  The request for political protection from two non-Arab countries and military protection from one of them could be a new tragic and comic chapter,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, wrote on Twitter. Mediation Efforts Falter Trump initially took sides with the Saudi-led group before apparently being nudged into a more even-handed approach when U.S. defense officials renewed praise of Doha, mindful of the major U.S. military base hosted by Qatar that serves, in part, as a launchpad for strikes on Islamic State insurgents. In his second intervention in as many days, Trump urged action against terrorism in a call with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Wednesday and offered help in resolving the crisis, including through a meeting at the White House. But a Qatari official said on Thursday the emir would not be accepting the invitation.  The emir has no plans to leave Qatar while the country is under a blockade,  the official told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: A traditional wooden fishing Dhow is seen in port near modern glass and steel buildings on the Doha skyline, Qatar February 9, 2010.Jacky Naegelen/File PhotoThe White House said Trump was continuing to talk with all partners. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was also ready to support diplomatic efforts  if desired by all parties,  his spokesman said. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, who has said Gulf states could resolve the dispute among themselves without outside help, traveled to Muscat on Thursday to meet his Omani counterpart. But there have been few signs of progress as officials from Qatar and its Arab neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) pursue shuttle diplomacy.  The feeling here is that it is going to take a while to fix. It is more about preventing things from getting worse,  said one diplomat in Kuwait, whose leader was in both the UAE and Qatar on Wednesday for consultations.  It Is a Blockade!  The UAE's national postal group suspended services to Qatar and the UAE aviation authority said it had closed air space for traffic to and from Doha.  Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017.StringerThe Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Authority also reimposed a ban on oil tankers linked to Qatar calling at ports in the UAE, reversing a decision to ease restrictions and potentially creating a logjam of crude cargoes.  It is a blockade! Like that of Berlin. A declaration of war. A political, economic and social aggression,  a Qatari diplomat said.  We need the world to condemn the aggressors.  Authorities tried to calm nerves on Wednesday, releasing a video showing a shop with shelves brimming with food and reassuring Qataris - the wealthiest people in the world per capita - that their quality of life would not be hit. The International Monetary Fund said it was too early to assess the economic impact. But in a sign of the damage, Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday as its riyal currency fell to an 11-year low. Al Jazeera Caught in Row Qatar has backed Islamist movements but strongly denies supporting terrorism. It provides a haven to anti-Western groups like the Afghan Taliban, Palestinian Hamas and Algeria’s Islamic Salvation Front but says it does not accept its neighbors' view that any group with an Islamist background is terrorist.  Egypt on Thursday called for the United Nations Security Council to launch an investigation into accusations, denied by Qatar, that it paid a ransom of up to $1 billion to  a terrorist group active in Iraq  to release kidnapped members of its royal family.  In an interview with BBC radio, UAE Ambassador to Russia Omar Saif Ghobash said Qatar had to choose between supporting extremism or supporting its neighbors.  Qatar needs to decide: Do you want to be in the pocket of Turkey, Iran and Islamic extremists? They need to make a decision; they can't have it both ways,  he said.  The Saudi newspaper al Watan published what it called a list of eight  extremist organizations  seen as working to destabilize the region from Qatar, including Qatar's Al Jazeera news channel, that were targeted by Gulf Arab states. State-funded Al Jazeera's acting director general, Mostefa Souag, dismissed accusations that its reportage is pro-Islamist and amounts to meddling in the affairs of other Arab states.  We don't interfere in anybody’s business, we just report,  he told Reuters at Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters. A company source later said the network was combating a large-scale cyber attack but remained operational, and Qatar's official state TV said it had shut down its website temporarily after facing hacking attempts. Qatar said last month its state news agency had been hacked and false statements attributed to its ruler posted, helping ignite this week's rift with other Arab states.

Caught off-guard last month by a ratings downgrade by Moody's Investors Service that gave fresh momentum to bearish yuan bets, traders said Beijing has reverted to its old play book - intervening in markets to bend them to its will. (For a graphic on Yuan's trading range click tmsnrt.rs/2rcyMrv)  The key priority for authorities was maintaining market confidence ahead of a leadership transition later this year, policy insiders said, as growing debt risks, higher U.S. interest rates, capital outflows and possible trade tensions with the United States threatened to knock the economy.  The policy insiders say last month's introduction of a  mysterious 'counter-cyclical factor' that increases the central bank's influence over the yuan's reference rate showed how serious authorities are about flushing out bearish bets and heading off any slide towards 7 yuan to the dollar. The move highlighted the challenge China faces between safeguarding economic and currency stability and speeding up capital market reforms - important steps in its quest to internationalise the yuan.   They (authorities) are clearly tightening their grip (on the yuan), which is related to politics and diplomacy,  said a policy adviser.   From monetary authorities' perspective, they definitely do not want to see the yuan falling past 7 - a landmark move that could affect market expectations,  the adviser said. The People's Bank of China (PBOC), responding to Reuters' request for comment, denied suggestions that it's tightening control on the yuan via the counter-cyclical factor.  Such a statement is not true,  the PBOC said in a rare email response, and reiterated the official explanation that changes to the way the mid-point is calculated were geared to better reflect macroeconomic fundamentals and temper  irrational  market expectations.Beijing is especially sensitive to any renewed criticism of its currency policy by the United States, and a weaker yuan could play into President Donald Trump's protectionist proclivities as Washington engages in 100 days of trade talks with China.  A second adviser said that with the Federal Reserve set to raise rates further at next week's policy review, authorities are worried that capital outflows could drive persistent weakness in the yuan -  the last thing Chinese leaders want before the closely-watched leadership transition in the autumn. In 2015, a botched stock market rescue attempt tarnished Beijing's reform and broad policy-making credentials. The yuan CNY=CFXS has gained 2.2 percent versus the dollar this year, including 1.3 percent since May 24 - when Moody's downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years, citing its mounting debt risks. A Reuters poll predicted the yuan to slip toward 7.05 per dollar in 12 months. Countering Bears Policy insiders believe authorities had been experimenting with the new mid-point regime and may have been forced to introduce it early after the Moody's downgrade. The central bank meanwhile has also aggressively strengthened the mid-point since the start of the month.  Authorities are also concerned that rapid falls in the yuan, which is allowed to trade two percent above or below the mid-point rate, could undermine Beijing's bid to boost the Chinese currency's global clout.  The central bank will use various means to intervene if the yuan falls to 7 - this is a so-called red line,  another policy adviser said, underscoring unease that a destabilising fall in the yuan could sap confidence and hurt the economy.  China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves lastyear but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. Latest data showed foreign exchange reserves rose to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion in May, as stringent capital control measures helped staunch outflows.. Controversial  Policy insiders say the central bank will combine the 'counter-cyclical factor', with its regular currency interventions and existing curbs on capital outflows to support the yuan. The change will make it harder to speculate on the yuan, but critics say the move  undermines transparency of China's currency regime - a goal of recent market-based reforms.  The central bank's mid-point move is a step closer to the previous fixed exchange rate,  said one of the advisers.     The move is controversial as it's a retreat in reform.

Infosys was trading 1.62 percent lower, after falling as much as 3.5 percent, despite the company denying a Times of India report that said the company's promoters were looking to sell their entire stake.

It could be any school field in America, but on a warm spring night in Beijing the star of the game is nine-year-old Lisa Li, one of the best players in China’s first American football youth league.      I was so excited. Before I ran for the winning touchdown I thought to myself I just had to score,  Li said as her Eagles celebrated a come-from-behind 24-20 victory over the Sharklets.     Li plays running back and linebacker in the 16-team Future League run by GSG Sport, a Beijing company promoting America’s most popular game to parents seeking a new sport for children.      American football lags far behind soccer and basketball in China, but the huge potential market of 1.4 billion people has caught the attention of the National Football League.     This year's Super Bowl championship was streamed live for the first time in China, where 1.5 million mostly young fans watch weekly NFL games on digital platforms.      NFL stars are pitching in to help build the fan base. Tom Brady, a five-time Super Bowl winning quarterback, will visit Beijing and the commercial hub of Shanghai later in June.             Essence of America      GSG initially wanted to set up an adult league, but spotted the youth niche five years ago, said co-founder Michael Jin. Today it has 5,000 players whose parents spend between $1,700 and $3,000 annually for training, uniforms and equipment.    Parents like football because it stresses discipline, team skills and exposes their pre-teen children to a new culture.  A lot of parents think football is actually the essence of American culture,  Jin said.     At a recent Friday night game, a father cheering for his son said he appreciated the toughness of the sport.  It's very manly and the kids like it a lot,  he said. Parents at the game said they were not overly concerned about the risk of injury, which has fueled a safety debate in the United States.  They’re not running that fast or hitting that hard,  said one parent, who sought anonymity.  It's not a big risk.   The Sharklets (blue shirts) play the Eagles in a Future League American football youth league match in Beijing, China, May 26, 2017.Thomas PeterFriday Night Lights To tap a sports industry fueled by rising consumer spending and favorable policies, two Beijing-based funds, Kaixing Capital and Unity Ventures, said they had invested  millions of dollars  in GSG, but gave no specific figures.  Beijing wants to triple the value of China’s sports sector to 5 trillion yuan ($735 billion) by 2025.      Unity investment manager Xu Miaocheng said it was drawn to GSG’s training business model. Slideshow (6 Images) Most sports companies are not very good at generating cash,  he said.  The training sector generates cash.      GSG has expanded to Shanghai and the eastern city of Hangzhou and will soon open a franchise in eastern Qingdao. It aims to reach 10,000 players in two years.       GSG is not profitable but the funds say they are patient.       If you get in a hurry and compromise your service, it hurts your reputation,  said Pan Shijian, a partner at Kaixing, which set up a 10-billion-yuan sports fund last year with property developer Kaisa Group.  The one-year old Future League is a key part of GSG’s effort to build its brand.     Taking a page from American high school football, Future League games are held on Friday nights, complete with uniformed referees, cheering fans and a camera crew for post-game interviews.  This year GSG began livestreaming games in partnership with sports media company LeSports, drawing about 200,000 to watch the winning score by the Eagles' Li against the Sharklets.      Lisa is much more confident and much more brave after playing football,  said her father, Li Ning.

May has signalled she will use her right as incumbent to make the first attempt to form a government, but it is unclear whether she will have the necessary support to do so.  We'll put ourselves forward to serve the country and form a minority government and the reason for that is I don't think the Conservative Party is stable, I don't think the prime minister is stable.

Caught off-guard last month by a ratings downgrade by Moody's Investors Service that gave fresh momentum to bearish yuan bets, traders said Beijing has reverted to its old play book - intervening in markets to bend them to its will. (For a graphic on Yuan's trading range click tmsnrt.rs/2rcyMrv)  The key priority for authorities was maintaining market confidence ahead of a leadership transition later this year, policy insiders said, as growing debt risks, higher U.S. interest rates, capital outflows and possible trade tensions with the United States threatened to knock the economy.  The policy insiders say last month's introduction of a  mysterious 'counter-cyclical factor' that increases the central bank's influence over the yuan's reference rate showed how serious authorities are about flushing out bearish bets and heading off any slide towards 7 yuan to the dollar. The move highlighted the challenge China faces between safeguarding economic and currency stability and speeding up capital market reforms - important steps in its quest to internationalise the yuan.   They (authorities) are clearly tightening their grip (on the yuan), which is related to politics and diplomacy,  said a policy adviser.   From monetary authorities' perspective, they definitely do not want to see the yuan falling past 7 - a landmark move that could affect market expectations,  the adviser said. The People's Bank of China (PBOC), responding to Reuters' request for comment, denied suggestions that it's tightening control on the yuan via the counter-cyclical factor.  Such a statement is not true,  the PBOC said in a rare email response, and reiterated the official explanation that changes to the way the mid-point is calculated were geared to better reflect macroeconomic fundamentals and temper  irrational  market expectations.Beijing is especially sensitive to any renewed criticism of its currency policy by the United States, and a weaker yuan could play into President Donald Trump's protectionist proclivities as Washington engages in 100 days of trade talks with China.  A second adviser said that with the Federal Reserve set to raise rates further at next week's policy review, authorities are worried that capital outflows could drive persistent weakness in the yuan -  the last thing Chinese leaders want before the closely-watched leadership transition in the autumn. In 2015, a botched stock market rescue attempt tarnished Beijing's reform and broad policy-making credentials. The yuan CNY=CFXS has gained 2.2 percent versus the dollar this year, including 1.3 percent since May 24 - when Moody's downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years, citing its mounting debt risks. A Reuters poll predicted the yuan to slip toward 7.05 per dollar in 12 months. Countering Bears Policy insiders believe authorities had been experimenting with the new mid-point regime and may have been forced to introduce it early after the Moody's downgrade. The central bank meanwhile has also aggressively strengthened the mid-point since the start of the month.  Authorities are also concerned that rapid falls in the yuan, which is allowed to trade two percent above or below the mid-point rate, could undermine Beijing's bid to boost the Chinese currency's global clout.  The central bank will use various means to intervene if the yuan falls to 7 - this is a so-called red line,  another policy adviser said, underscoring unease that a destabilising fall in the yuan could sap confidence and hurt the economy.  China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves lastyear but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. Latest data showed foreign exchange reserves rose to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion in May, as stringent capital control measures helped staunch outflows.. Controversial  Policy insiders say the central bank will combine the 'counter-cyclical factor', with its regular currency interventions and existing curbs on capital outflows to support the yuan. The change will make it harder to speculate on the yuan, but critics say the move  undermines transparency of China's currency regime - a goal of recent market-based reforms.  The central bank's mid-point move is a step closer to the previous fixed exchange rate,  said one of the advisers.     The move is controversial as it's a retreat in reform.

The Portland smelter has been running at a third of its 300,000-tonnes-per-year capacity since a freak storm prompted the power outage in December, causing molten aluminium to solidify in the facility's potlines and freezing production.  Getting to the half way point in our bid to restore the business has been a big task, but what I have seen up to now gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver the plan,  Plant Manager Peter Chellis said in a statement. The plant's resumption has come in part due to a A$240 million ($182 million) government-sponsored rescue package that has secured its future for at least four years in a state that has suffered from a spate of job losses including the shutdown of three major carmakers and a power station. With local power costs soaring, a cheap source of energy was also needed. The Portland smelter lined up a four-year power supply deal with AGL Energy for 510 megawatts, or about 10 percent of the state's electricity load, earlier this year. The government's financial aid is dependent on the smelter staying open at least until 2021 and output remaining at least 90 percent of pre-blackout levels. The plant is co-owned by Alcoa, Australian firm Alumina Ltd , China's CITIC Resources and an arm of Japan's Marubeni Corp.

After watching the bank wobble on the edge of insolvency for months, regulators eased market jitters with a relatively swift winding up of the Spanish lender. The Single Resolution Board bailed in the sub debt, wrote down the shares and Additional Tier 1 instruments, converted the Tier 2 debt to new equity - and won wide praise for doing so.  This was the first major test of the BRRD and it shows that the decision system works,  said Gerald Podobnik, global head of capital solutions at Deutsche Bank. Before the regulators took action, Popular's two outstanding AT1 notes were quoted at a cash price in the 40/50s, while its Tier 2 was quoted in the high 70s. Those levels showed investors had not been expecting a complete wipeout of the debt.  The market seems to have been assuming that authorities would prefer a compromise ... [rather than] resolution tools being applied,  said Podobnik.  So it's good to see this happening and shows that the law will be applied.  The Italian Job The move in Spain comes in contrast to the situation in Italy, where regulators are still grappling with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. The market had had doubts about Popular since at least January, when the bank was forced to dip into reserves to ensure it could pay coupons on its AT1 bonds. Yet Popular never did miss a payment, and the decision to wipe out its sub debt and impose steep losses on bondholders jumped the sequence of events that some were expecting.  We'd have expected to have had a missed coupon before we'd have seen a write-down of an AT1,  wrote Eoin Walsh, partner and portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.  Popular never missed a coupon on its AT1s, and in that regard we are surprised.  And given its relatively healthy capital levels, regulators could find themselves at pains to explain the rationale for taking action just now. Popular's AT1 had been meant to trigger and convert into equity should the bank's capital ratio fall below 7% in the case of the 8.25% AT1 or 5.125% in the case of the 11.5% issue. But Popular's total capital ratio was well in the safety zone, standing at 11.91% at the end of the first quarter.  What happened at Popular has a negative read across for institutions like Vicenza the German Landesbanken as well,  said Filippo Alloatti, a credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management.  Some of Italy's banks are under pressure while a bank like Co-op is at risk of deteriorating asset-quality.  Calm Waters Still, many will see the situation as final proof that Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments can effectively be used as capital - a key confirmation in the wake of the last crisis. By using the BRRD's asset sale tool, the SRB and Spain were able to resolve the matter of Popular without having to inject any state money. It also means that the state will not have to wind the bank down, as the healthy part of the business has now been absorbed by Santander, which bought Popular's new shares for a token €1. And unlike in 2016 - when the threat of Deutsche Bank missing a coupon payment sent the market in a tailspin - the resolution of Popular has hardly caused a blip. Subordinated European bank bonds dipped initially Wednesday but rebounded quickly, while the region's bank stocks are up on the day.  Instead of having a situation that drags on, they've cleaned up a problematic bank in one shot,  said Marc Stacey, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management.  The market is reacting as it should,  he said.  This shows you it's working very well.

Governor Ryuichi Yoneyama told Reuters in an interview that he plans to create an advisory committee to review the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and examine evacuation drills in Niigata and the health impacts of the radiation release during the world's worst atomic crisis since Chernobyl. The review will start by August at the latest, he said.  The review would derail Kashiwazaki-Kariwa owner Tokyo Electric Power Co's (Tepco) recovery plans in the wake of the Fukushima meltdowns. The committee may take three years to present its findings, said Yoneyama, which contradicts Tepco's possible plan, presented in a business reorganization last month, to restart two of the seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa before March 2020. (For a graphic on Japan's nuclear reactor restarts click tmsnrt.rs/2s2C3hd)   It is necessary to look at the overall picture of the risks so we are going to conduct a review,  Yoneyama said at the prefecture's office in Tokyo.  I have no intention of launching the (local) consent process while the review is under way.  Yoneyama was elected last October on a platform requiring Tepco to give a fuller account of the Fukushima disaster. Prefectural governors do not have the legal authority to prevent restarts but Tepco has said it would not turn on the Niigata reactors without local approval, including the governor and the mayors where plants are located. Tepco's restructuring plan is designed to cut costs and boost earnings to repay the bulk of the estimated 21.5 trillion yen ($195 billion) bill from the Fukushima disaster. The plan last month was the third proposed in the last six years and depends on generating revenue by resuming output from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.  The plant can generate 8,212 megawatts of electricity which is 19.8 percent of Japan's nuclear capacity. In response to Yoneyama's comments, a Tepco spokesman stressed that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart is hypothetical and that the company has not given a restart target for the plant. A nearby earthquake in 2007 caused fires and radiation leaks at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in a disaster that prefigured the Fukushima calamity. Niigata voters opposed restarting the plant by 73 percent to 27 percent, according to an NHK exit poll in the October election. National polls have shown a consistent opposition to nuclear power since Fukushima. Yoneyama was non-committal on under what conditions he would approve a restart but indicated that some risks would remain in using nuclear power.   No matter how much we review, it will never be absolutely safe,  he said.  After weighing up the positives and negatives (of nuclear power), then we should decide based on a democratic process.  On Friday, Japan's government denied a report in the Nikkei newspaper that it was considering building new plants as part of a new review of its energy policy.

The divergence in flows via the  Connect  schemes between the two markets became prominent in recent months with the Hong Kong leg seeing much greater usage compared with China-bound traffic.  (Mainland) investors have been worried about economic growth, which possibly peaked in the first quarter, and also tighter financial regulations as the government stepped up deleveraging efforts,  said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities. Lopsided equity flows put the spotlight on Beijing's efforts to attract investments and the progress it is making in reforms that have promised to open up its capital markets. They also come at a time when China has imposed tighter restrictions on taking funds out of the country to staunch outflows. From January to May, a total of 168 billion yuan ($24.7 billion) flowed into Hong Kong via the pipelines, while northbound usage in the same period was 86 billion yuan. The southbound leg of the Shanghai-Hong Kong connect dominated, recording a net flow of 133 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) in the first five months of the year, up nearly 80 percent from the same period in 2016. The benchmark Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, has jumped about 18 percent since the start of the year, in stark contrast to a gain of about 1.8 percent in the Shanghai Composite Index . China kicked off the landmark scheme connecting Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets in November 2014 and the long-awaited link between Shenzhen and Hong Kong went live in December. Analysts say demand for Hong Kong shares will likely continue as mainland markets come under greater regulatory scrutiny from a crackdown on risky lending practices and as the authorities tighten credit to ward off debt bubbles. Chinese investors are also increasingly seeking companies with better valuations and the opportunity to diversify into non-yuan assets.  Hong Kong stocks are favoured for their lower valuations and higher dividend payments compared with mainland peers, as institutional investors who emphasize fundamentals and valuations participate more in the southbound legs,  said Linus Yip, Hong Kong-based chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities. The Shanghai stock market trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 16 times and the Shenzhen market at 34 times. In contrast, the Hang Seng index trades at 14 times earnings. Hong Kong exchange data shows investors prefer large-cap dual-listed financial firms and industry leaders, including Bank of China, New China Life Insurance, Tencent Holdings and China Evergrande. The index measuring price differences between dual-listed companies in Shanghai and Hong Kong stood at 122.23, 2.7 percent lower than the peak of 125.58 early this year. Yip said investors should be wary of sharp gains in Hong Kong.  If Hong Kong stocks go higher too rapidly, there could be a chance of a short-term correction and the (southbound) Connect flows could scale back.  $1 = 6.7985 Chinese yuan Editing by Jacqueline Wong","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-stocks-connect-idUSL3N1J32IG"},

The Bundesbank cut its inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, while nudging up its projection for this year to 1.5 percent. Its previous estimates put price growth at 1.4 percent this year, 1.7 percent the next and 1.9 percent in 2019. Coming a day after the ECB trimmed its inflation estimates for the euro zone as a whole, the downgraded Bundesbank projections may weaken its hand in calling for an imminent scaling down of the ECB's monetary stimulus. Unveiling the figures, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann emphasized underlying inflation, which strips out the more volatile food and energy components, was on a steadily rising path that should take it from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2019. The ECB targets headline inflation in the euro zone. (Reporting by Francesco Canepa; Editing by Michael Nienaber)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-bundesbank-idUSF9N1G902E"},

In his words, he considered it a chance to  hit the reset button.  Gibson (3-4) has won all three of his decisions since his May 22 recall, and he pitched a season-high six-plus innings Thursday night to lead the Minnesota Twins to a 2-1 victory against the streaking Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field.  You never want to get sent down, but it's tough to be able to work on things up here,  Gibson said.  I've just been able to execute a little better and keep my mind in a better spot.  Said Twins manager Paul Molitor:  Kyle in having to go down had a chance to work on some things. I don't think he needed a wake-up call. He just needed a chance to get his career back heading in a positive direction. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at MarinersMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch He's given us some good starts since his return.  Gibson allowed five hits and one run with three walks and four strikeouts. He was lifted after allowing a leadoff single to Taylor Motter in the seventh inning. Matt Belisle closed out the seventh. Taylor Rogers got out of jam in the eighth to tie for the major league lead with his 15th hold of the season, and Brandon Kintzler retired the side in order in the ninth for his 16th save. Kintzler allowed a walk-off homer to Seattle's Mike Zunino the previous night as the Mariners extended their season-high winning streak to five games.  To get in the next night is huge,  Kintzler said.  In this game and in that (closer's) role, you can't dwell on it.  The Mariners got two runners on with one out in the eighth, but Rogers snared Zunino's line drive back to the mound and doubled up Robinson Cano at second to end the threat.  The bullpen did a nice job,  Molitor said.  We got a little fortunate with the line drive that Taylor somehow was able to react to, and then Kintzler getting three outs and getting us back on track.  The Twins' Jason Castro snapped a scoreless tie with two outs in the fourth inning, hitting a solo homer to right field off Mariners starter Christian Bergman (3-3). Castro extended his hitting streak to 10 games. The Twins made it 2-0 in the fifth. Cano, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner at second base, was charged with two errors on one play. With two outs and Ehire Adrianza at second, Joe Mauer hit a slow roller to the right side of the infield. Cano, who was playing in shallow right field as part of a defensive shift, had to charge the ball and bobbled it, allowing Mauer to reach safely. Adrianza rounded third, and Cano tried to nab the runner as he scrambled back to the bag. However, the throw was errant and got past third baseman Kyle Seager, allowing Adrianza to trot home.  Errors happen, no matter how great the players are,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Cano's two miscues on the same play.  He bobbled the ball, and then the throw skipped on him. It's an uncharacteristic play.  The Mariners got one run back in the bottom of the inning. Jarrod Dyson led off with a triple into the right field corner and scored on Ben Gamel's sacrifice fly. With two on and two outs, Cano hit a liner to center field that Byron Buxton originally charged, then had to quickly retreat on. Buxton made a leaping catch while falling backward, finishing with a backward roll on the ground.  That ball that Cano hit to center field, that's an easy misread because the ball really had a lot of carry,  Molitor said.  With (Buxton's) athleticism, he was able to get back there and make the play.  NOTES: Seattle DH Nelson Cruz missed his second consecutive game due to a right calf injury. ... The Twins conclude their 10-game trip with a three-game series in San Francisco, starting Friday. RHP Ervin Santana (7-3, 2.44 ERA) is scheduled to oppose Giants LHP Matt Moore (2-6, 5.22). ... The Mariners will wrap up their 11-game homestand with three games against Toronto. Seattle RHP Sam Gaviglio (2-1, 3.13) is set to start the opener against Blue Jays RHP Joe Biagini (1-4, 3.31).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED699M1HY2"},

The 10-year cash JGB yield shed 1.5 basis points to 0.050 percent, after rising as high as 0.075 in the previous session, its highest since mid-March. The front-month 10-year JGB futures contract added 0.13 points to finish at 150.60. Investors' main focus remained squarely on overseas events, as British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a general election and cast the country's politics into turmoil, potentially disrupting Brexit negotiations. Prices of U.S. 10-year Treasury futures rose in after-hour trading after exit polls suggested May's ruling party would fail to secure a parliamentary majority. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note was at 2.188 percent in Asian trading, down from its U.S. close of 2.194 percent on Thursday. In the superlong zone, the 20-year JGB yield shed 2 basis points to 0.560 percent, while the 30-year JGB yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.825 percent. They had hit highs of 0.585 percent and 0.845 percent respectively on Thursday, their highest since mid-May. Yields were pushed higher on Thursday after a media report said the Bank of Japan was considering how to communicate its eventual exit from monetary stimulus to markets. However, later on Thursday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank still has far to go to reach its 2 percent inflation target, though its ultra-loose monetary policy has helped stabilise public inflation expectations. In its regular purchasing operations on Friday, the BOJ offered to buy 280 billion yen of one- to three-year JGBs, 300 billion yen of three- to five-year JGBs, 200 billion yen of 10- to 25-year JGBs, and 100 billion yen of JGBs maturing in more than 25 years.

It comes down to executing your game plan and the conditions,  Lendl told reporters on Thursday.   Andy has been putting in great work. If you have three illnesses and an injury which take you out for some time, it's very difficult mentally for the player...  But now he is healthy and he can put the practices in.  Murray, who has a 21-7 record this year, said his indifferent form earlier in the season had made him question things but he had been able to just focus on playing in recent matches, which had made a huge difference.

In a statement, the Amsterdam-based company said it planned to put forward Ursula Burns, former chairman and chief executive of Xerox Corp from 2009 to 2016, and one of the world's most high profile female corporate leaders. It also named Guy Laurence, the British telecoms industry veteran who left last year as CEO of Rogers, the C$13.7 billion dollar Canadian telecoms and media group. He had previously held a string of executive roles at Vodafone. Adding two seats brings the total number on the supervisory board to 11. LetterOne Investment Holdings, which owns roughly 48 percent of VEON shares and is controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and his partners, holds three seats. Telenor, whose holding was a little under 20 percent in April, holds two seats. The Norwegian mobile operator, which has been in open conflict with Fridman for control of VEON, has previously said it plans to sell all its stake that once stood at 33 percent. (reut.rs/2kYH742) The other four seats are held by independent directors including Stan Chudnovsky, a Facebook Messaging executive, to Julian Michael Horn-Smith, an early Vodafone executive and architect of its global strategy.  I'm delighted that VEON has nominated both Ursula Burns and Guy Laurence to join the supervisory board,  Fridman said in a statement.  Their arrival further demonstrates our commitment to pursue the transformation of the company, building VEON to be a major digital company.  VEON, the Russian and emerging markets operator formerly known as Vimpelcom, has overhauled its mobile network business in the past year to focus on a free messaging app, from which it aims to make money via web partnerships. It has also sought to expand its shareholder base with a recent listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange in addition to its existing listing on Nasdaq.

The agency has also affirmed Lodha's outstanding USD200 million senior unsecured notes due in 2020 at 'B' and Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The outstanding US dollar notes are issued by Lodha's wholly owned subsidiary Lodha Developers International Limited and guaranteed by Lodha and certain subsidiaries. The notes are rated at the same level as Lodha's IDR as they represent the company's unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The affirmation of Lodha's IDR reflects the company's healthy presales and cash collections in the fiscal year to 31 March 2017 (FY17) in spite of weak domestic demand for real estate, and Fitch estimates that the company is likely to continue to maintain leverage (as measured by net adjusted debt/adjusted inventory) below 80% over the next two years. The Negative Outlook continues to reflect the near-term risks to the company's credit profile, in particular refinancing risk associated with sizeable maturities, including financing for its London project, over the next 12 months. Although Lodha has access to domestic funding sources, the company has not yet communicated a detailed refinancing plan for its upcoming maturities. This risk is coinciding with challenging operating conditions and new regulations governing Indian homebuilders that limit their ability to move cash across projects as freely as before, all of which could complicate proactive refinancing initiatives. A revision of the Outlook to Stable would be contingent upon an improvement in Lodha's liquidity and a lengthening of its debt maturity profile. KEY RATING DRIVERS Healthy Presales, Cash Collections: Lodha's presales improved to INR69.2 billion in FY17, from INR64.3 billion in FY16, amid weaker domestic demand for property, especially against the backdrop of India's currency demonetisation on November 8 last year. Surprisingly, demand for Lodha's projects were somewhat less impacted in the December quarter compared with most of the other large Indian homebuilders that Fitch tracks. Lodha's presales bounced back strongly in February and March this year, which we attribute to the advanced stage of completion of many of its large projects, as well as the view that the adverse effects of demonetisation on large homebuilders appears to have passed. Strong sales in FY17 were also supported by the company's Palava project, which benefits from the government's push on affordable housing including the announcement of its infrastructure status, and tax and interest-cost incentives to buyers. Cash collections improved significantly to INR76.2 billion, from INR60.7 billion over the same period, as more of Lodha's projects are being completed. We expect the company's presales to remain broadly flat around INR70 billion in FY18 after factoring in its project completion status, which should enable Lodha to sell its inventory faster, and our view that demand for Indian property is likely to remain muted in the near term. Regulatory Risks, UK Elections: Fitch believes that the implementation of India's Real Estate Regulation Act of 2016 (RERA), which came into full effect on 1 May 2017, would restrict property developers' ability to move cash freely out of construction projects. Meanwhile, its London projects could face weaker demand from any increased political uncertainties stemming from the UK elections, as high-end property is more sensitive to investor confidence than mass-market housing. London Project Risks Evolving: Lodha needs to convert the short-term project debt of around GBP225 million (INR20 billion) at its prime residential Mayfair development in September 2017, and secure construction financing to fund an estimated balance cost of around GBP197 million. Its Mayfair development was formally launched in May 2017 and to date GBP80 million has been sold. Lodha expects to sell this project over a prolonged period in order to potentially benefit from higher profit margins. Demand for prime property in Mayfair has been less affected than other prime areas in Central London since the Brexit vote last year, and this may support Lodha's ability to secure construction financing for this project. Lodha was able to secure 30-month construction financing of GBP290 million for its smaller residential project in London earlier this year, with a bullet repayment of principal. Fitch believes this would reduce the need for Lodha to continue to fund its London projects using cash flows from its India business. The company indicates that to date it has lent around INR17 billion to its London projects in order to meet cost shortfalls. Lodha launched sales of this project, which is the smaller of the two, in April 2016, and has sold around GBP120 million to date. DERIVATION SUMMARY Lodha's 'B'/Negative rating compares well against peers Indiabulls Real Estate Limited (IBREL, B+/Stable) and Xinyuan Real Estate Co. Ltd. (B/Stable). Lodha has a stronger business profile compared to IBREL with nearly twice the operating scale, and a better track record of sales and execution over the last three to four years. However Lodha's leverage is considerably higher than IBREL, which drives its lower rating. Xinyuan is a small regional developer in China that has weaker business risk compared to Lodha. A key weakness for Xinyuan is its need to constantly replenish its land bank amid rising land costs. However Xinyuan's substantially lower leverage compared to Lodha balances out these risks. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Presales of around INR70 billion and INR90 billion in FY18 and FY19 - Cash collections of around INR75 billion-80 billion annually in FY18-FY19 - Construction cost of around INR4.5 billion-5 billion in FY18 RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Fitch may consider revising the Outlook to Stable if the company is able to address its near-term domestic debt maturities, and secure sustained financing for its London project. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Limited progress towards addressing the significant contractual maturities of domestic debt falling due in FY18 - Leverage (net adjusted debt/adjusted inventory) sustained above 80%, or annual cash collections/gross debt sustained below 0.5x (FY17 Fitch estimate: 0.4x-0.5x) - Inability to secure sustained financing for its London project - Increasingly onerous terms from lenders on incremental financing raised LIQUIDITY Refinancing Risk: As of 31 March 2017, Lodha had more than INR16 billion of approved but undrawn credit facilities and estimated readily available cash of around INR3 billion, compared to around INR37 billion of contractual debt maturities in FY18. Lodha indicates that it has already secured refinancing for around INR7 billion of these maturities, and indicates that it is currently in discussions with lenders to refinance around half of the balance INR30 billion. Lodha says that it has a further 3,000 acres of unencumbered land in its Palava project, which is valued at around INR150 billion (over USD2 billion) based on land value, as well as an estimated INR40 billion of completed inventory by end-FY18, which the company can pledge to non-bank financial institutions in order to secure contingent liquidity if required. We expect Lodha to continue to generate negative FCF in FY18, for which we believe the company will be able to secure financing given its business risk profile as one of India's leading homebuilders.

Eight navy ships and sonar systems had joined the search for victims of Wednesday's incident, along with 20 civilian boats in stormy weather off the southern coast, the military said.  We have not received any information about survivors,  said Phyu Phyu Win, a regional social welfare and relief official.  Hopefully someone would survive.  Scores of soldiers gathered on standby to assist if more bodies were carried ashore in the fishing village of Sanlan, about 600 km (372 miles) from Myanmar's largest city Yangon. Twenty-three adults and eight children made up the tally of bodies pulled from the Andaman Sea near the coastal town of Launglon since rescue efforts began on Wednesday, the military said on its official page on social media site Facebook. Soldiers, family members and crew were on board when the weekly flight, from several coastal towns to Yangon, went missing. The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff, while at a height of 18,000 feet (5,485 metres) over the Andaman Sea, about 43 miles (70 km) west of the town of Dawei, the military said. An aircraft wheel, two life jackets and some bags with clothes - believed to be from the missing plane - were found on Thursday. Some patches of oil were also spotted, the military said. The cause of the incident has yet to be confirmed. State-owned China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation, maker of the plane, said it would assist Myanmar authorities fully in the investigation into the crash. Survivors are unlikely more than 24 hours after the plane lost contact, despite warm sea temperatures, experts have said. Many bodies had fragmented into several pieces and no victim wearing a life jacket has yet been recovered, said a member of the emergency team. Aircraft accidents, involving both civilian and military planes, are not uncommon in Myanmar. A military helicopter crashed last June in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel. Five were killed in February last year when an air force aircraft crashed in the capital, Naypyitaw, media said.

Governments across Asia - most notably Hong Kong and Singapore - have launched a raft of initiatives to grab a slice of the $100 billion invested in fintech globally but the regulatory hotch-potch is making it tough for firms to scale up, the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) said in a report on Friday.  The regulatory landscape is very fragmented and a lot of the initiatives, though well-intentioned, are not necessarily well thought through,  said Mark Austen, CEO of ASIFMA. The lobby group, which represents global banks and asset managers such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, has called on Asian regulators to coordinate better and to adopt a consistent set of best practices for fostering fintech in the region.  By not cooperating on fintech, Asian financial centres are putting themselves at a real disadvantage relative to the rest of the world: that traditional competitive dynamic and rivalry between the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore may actually in this case be a disadvantage,  said Hannah Cassidy, partner at Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong, which contributed to the report. Investors poured $19 billion worldwide into fintech - including P2P lenders, distributed ledger technology and crowdfunding platforms - in 2016 alone and thousands of fintech start-ups continue to proliferate, according to a February report by global regulatory body the International Organization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO). Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia have launched a range of special programmes to attract and foster fintech ventures, from incubators and grants, to temporary license waiver schemes, with competition fiercest between rivals Hong Kong and Singapore. While all these markets operate well-defined licensing and supervisory regimes for traditional financial firms including banks, brokers, insurance companies and funds, regulators are still struggling to establish clear and consistent regimes for fintech firms because they often operate innovative business models. Cryptocurrency exchanges, for example, are licensed as money changers and regulated by the customs authority in Hong Kong but they are licensed as online shopping malls, akin to clothes retailers, in South Korea. In Singapore, the central bank has proposed regulating bitcoin exchanges as payment firms. This makes it very expensive for fintech firms based in places with small domestic markets like Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia to expand into the broader region because they are more or less starting from scratch each time they enter a new country, said Aurelien Menant, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.com.  This is a very important issue for fintech firms in Asia,  he said, adding he would welcome tougher standardised rules for alternative currency exchanges across the region. The lack of regulatory clarity has meant some aspiring fintech firms have struggled to gain licenses in markets like Hong Kong, Reuters reported last year. (here)  We are open to cooperation with regional and global regulators on fintech,  the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement, adding it would be entering into new regulatory cooperations shortly, without elaborating. The SFC added it has taken a leading role in discussions around fintech within IOSCO and conducts dialogue with other watchdogs through a dedicated fintech liaison officer. The Monetary Authority of Singapore did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The poll also showed that the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged next week as the economy is growing modestly despite weak inflation and consumer spending.  Core machinery orders will be viewed as moving sideways. But we expect a trend of pickup will become clearer supported by upbeat corporate earnings,  said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  There is a high chance that core machinery orders in April-June will be better than companies' forecast of a 5.9 percent fall for the period.  Core machinery orders likely fell 1.3 percent in April from the previous month after a 1.4 percent rise in March, the Reuters poll of 15 economists showed. From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical equipment, rose 6.3 percent in April. While the data series is highly volatile, it is regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months.      Exports and factory output continue to be favorable due to the global economic recovery and a weaker yen, but uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy makes corporations cautious about domestic investment,  said an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. The Cabinet Office will announce machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT). As for the BOJ, analysts expect it will keep its short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent at a two-day policy meeting on June 15-16.  The focus next week will be BOJ Governor (Haruhiko) Kuroda's comment on what the central bank's stance on how to communicate with markets about an exit strategy,  said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.  The central bank is set to upgrade its economic assessment as early as next week to signal its growing conviction the recovery is gathering momentum, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters, reinforcing expectations its next move would be to tighten monetary policy. The poll showed the BOJ's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, grew 2.2 percent in May from a year ago, up for a fifth straight month partly boosted by oil price increases.

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards trading at 152.85/95 per dollar at 0541 GMT, unchanged from the Wednesday's close. The markets were closed on Thursday for a Buddhist religious holiday.  It's a very dull day and nothing much is happening,  a currency dealer said, requesting anonymity. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Friday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trade was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. The hospitality and manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said the aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said.

In the early Thursday attack, the Islamists overran a military base in Af Urur, a town about 100 km (60 miles) south of Bosaso, the capital of Puntland, one of Somalia's semi-autonomous regions.  Most of those killed were soldiers, a Puntland security official said, adding 18 others were wounded, with an unknown number also feared captured alive.  In a statement, President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo promised the Somali military would retaliate and avenge al Shabaab's attack.  We must show no mercy in dealing with Alshabab,”  he said. “We promise that Alshabab won’t get away with this. As of now, our troops are in hot pursuit of the enemy, they will pay for today’s attack.  The al Qaeda-linked Islamist group cited a higher toll in the attack, saying it had killed 61 soldiers. Numbers given by officials and al Shabaab often differ. Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia's central government and rule the country according to a strict version Islam's sharia law. They also want to drive out the African  Union peace keeping force AMISOM which is helping to defend the central government.  The group rarely carries out attacks in Puntland, where the security forces are relatively regularly paid and receive substantial U.S. assistance.

Three years later, production has yet to begin. But servicing the debt is cutting into overall profits at his Lustre Engineering, which also offers electrical services, and the 59-year-old may have to sell off assets to repay the bank. Patharkar says India's bureaucrats are to blame for denying contracts to small businesses like his, and has taken one state-run power company to court to challenge its tendering process.  Government has put in place a very good public procurement policy, but officials on the ground are not implementing it,  he said. Bureaucracy is only one of the more visible parts of a problem that is vastly more systemic since Asia's third-largest economy started to falter, burdened by $150 billion in bad loans, excess and idle capacity and stalled private investment. Private capital investments contracted 2.1 percent in the first three months of this year despite a surge in government spending, dragging economic growth to 6.1 percent, its lowest in more than two years. Signs for the current quarter are also not encouraging. According to CMIE, a think tank, new investment proposals in April and May were down by more than half from the same period in both of the last two years. The culprit is a so-called twin balance-sheet phenomenon: reduced new investment by stressed private companies, which account for three-quarters of India's total capital spending, and one of the highest bad-loan ratios among emerging economies. The bad loans have forced banks to curb overall lending growth and cut their credit exposure to industry, while the share of capital investments in India's GDP has dropped to below 30 percent from more than 38 percent a decade ago.  The motivation to invest into new capacities is falling,  said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at CMIE. Foreign portfolio investors remain bullish about India, pumping $19 billion into Indian stock and bond markets since January, lured by the country's relatively strong fundamentals. But the World Bank warned last week that prospects for developing economies like India were being undermined by weak investment. If the trend continues, it may thwart India's hopes of replicating the growth that dramatically boosted employment, reduced poverty and increased per capita income in China. Stress Widening, Deepening The downbeat mood is a far cry from the bullish sentiment among businesses three years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was running for India's top job. His reputation, built while running the western state of Gujarat, of speeding up implementation of infrastructure projects and promoting manufacturing raised hopes of a similar push at the national level. To be sure, his administration has spent billions of dollars on rail, road, port and power projects and pushed through a slew of steps to cut bureaucratic red tape and attract investments, the benefits of which, many believe, are still to come. But it has been slower to act on calls to write off loans and privatise state-run banks, which experts say are needed to revive corporate and bank balance sheets but will not sit well with bank labour unions or the taxpayers that will have to foot the bill. Stressed corporate balance sheets have taken a heavy toll on state-run banks. At least 13 of banks accounting for approximately 40 percent of total loans are severely stressed, with over 20 percent of their outstanding loans classified as restructured or bad loans. A study by Credit Suisse shows that around 40 percent of India's corporate debt is owed by companies with interest coverage ratio of less than 1, meaning they do not earn enough to pay the interest obligations on their loans. The stress on the corporate sector is not only deepening, it is also widening. In the telecoms sector, interest coverage ratios slid after the entry of Reliance Jio increased competition, prompting a major round of price-cutting. Since the second half of 2016, much of the rise in bank bad loans has come from small businesses hobbled by poor sales and profitability. But it isn't just small businesses like Lustre Engineering who have had to resort to asset sales. Saddled with $3.1 billion in debt, GMR Group, an infrastructure conglomerate, plans to sell its road, power and airport assets. It has also put all investment in energy and highway projects on hold for the next 12-18 months. A revival in consumer spending and goods exports should boost consumer demand and lift capacity utilization at Indian factories that is running below average, economists say. But that may not be enough for a big investment revival. R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer at industrial group Larsen & Toubro, expects Modi's infrastructure drive to start showing results by mid-2018. But he says more needs to be done to ensure swift execution of projects.  People are still required to go to multiple agencies for clearances,  Shankar Raman told Reuters.  Ease of doing business is still a work in progress.

With the majority of seats counted in the snap vote, British Prime Minister Theresa May had no way to win an outright majority in parliament. The shock outcome saw the pound shed 2 percent on fears the political turmoil could delay and confound talks on leaving the European Union, which are due to start in less than two weeks. Yields on 10-year gilts fell 3 basis points to 1.00 percent, but FTSE futures recouped early losses and turned 0.2 percent higher, perhaps on hopes that a weaker pound would help the economy. The damage was limited elsewhere, with E-mini futures for the S&P; 500 edging up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei added 0.5 percent and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were all but flat.  This is messy for the UK economy and its Brexit negotiations and hence is a negative for the pound and share market,  said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP.  But the UK is just 2.5 percent of world GDP and it's hard to see significant implications for global investment markets.  By 0555 GMT sterling had skidded to $1.2697, having carved out a two-month trough of $1.2689. It was also down 1.8 percent on the euro at 88.18 pence. The rot started when an exit poll showed the ruling Conservatives could fail to win a clear majority when markets had expected a handy victory. The BBC forecast the Conservatives would hold a reduced 318 seats in the 650-member parliament, following a big swing to the left-leaning opposition Labour Party. For the latest updates, click. Betting agencies were already taking wagers on whether May would still have her job by the end of the day.  At this stage, there is no obvious way a formal, stable coalition government can be constructed, and therefore there is a high likelihood of a potentially prolonged period of uncertainty over who will be prime minister,  said John Wraith, a strategist at UBS. Yet he cautioned bears against chasing the pound much lower from here.  Today's result will in part be seen as a vote against a definitive break from the EU, and the market may soon begin to reassess the probability of a so-called 'hard Brexit'.  There was much less drama elsewhere, as the Japanese yen gave up early gains and eased to 110.20 per dollar. The euro was little moved against the U.S. dollar at $1.1209. The single currency had slipped overnight when the European Central Bank cut forecasts for inflation and said it had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying campaign, sending bond yields to multi-month lows. No Smoking Gun Overnight, Wall Street had seemingly judged the testimony of former FBI director James Comey was not life-threatening to the administration of President Donald Trump. Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 election.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here,  said Jefferies & Co money market economist Thomas Simons.  So it's not particularly impactful for thinking about... Trump's economic agenda to go through.  The Dow rose 0.04 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.03 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.39 percent. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.3 percent lower at $1,274.45 an ounce. Oil prices remained subdued with Brent having settled at its lowest since Nov. 29, the eve of an OPEC production cut deal. U.S. crude futures edged down 2 cents to $45.62 a barrel, with Brent crude flat at $47.86. (Editing by Kim Coghill)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL3N1J52JB"},

Twenty-one adults and eight children were among the bodies found in the Andaman Sea near the coastal town of Launglon by navy and civilian ships, the military said on its official page on social media site Facebook.  I only want to cry, I have nothing,  said a shaky-voiced Yuzana, 19, whose parents and younger brother were on the aircraft when it went missing on Wednesday. The weekly flight, from several coastal towns to Myanmar's largest city of Yangon, had been carrying the three to a planned reunion after a two-year-long separation.  My father said he bought a mobile phone for me. My mom bought a bag for my school,  Yuzana, who uses one name, told Reuters by telephone. Scores of rescue workers in the fishing village of Sanlan, about 600 km (372 miles) from Yangon, braved stormy weather to carry ashore the dead, wrapped in plastic, from a military ship. Many bodies had fragmented into several pieces and no victim wearing a life jacket has yet been recovered, said Hla Thein, one of those directly involved in the rescue.   More than a dozen relatives of those on board the aircraft gathered at a crisis center in an army base in the southern coastal town of Myeik, some weeping, pictures released by the military showed. Nine navy ships, five military planes and two helicopters, will keep up the search for survivors for a second day, assisted by civilian boats, the military said. The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff while flying at 18,000 feet (5,485 meters) over the Andaman Sea, about 43 miles (70 km) west of the town of Dawei, the military said. An aircraft wheel, two life jackets and some bags with clothes - believed to be from the missing plane - were found earlier.  Some patches of oil were spotted some 16 nautical miles (18 miles) from Dawei, the military said.  The cause of the incident has yet to be confirmed. Military soldiers carry dead bodies from a crashed military plane outside Launglon township, Myanmar June 8 , 2017.Soe Zeya TunBut survivors are  very unlikely  more than 24 hours after the plane lost contact, despite warm sea temperatures in the area, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, a coastal oceanography expert at the University of Western Australia.  Myanmar authorities might soon change their focus from rescue to salvage, aiming to collect debris and investigate the cause of the accident, he added.   Aircraft Accidents The plane was carrying 122 passengers, 108 of these made up of soldiers and their family members, besides 14 crew. Among the 108 were 15 children, 58 adults and 35 soldiers. Slideshow (7 Images)The military said the plane was operated by  seasoned pilot  Lieutenant Colonel Nyein Chan with 3,162 flying hours, two co-pilots and a flight engineer.  All military personnel on board are low- to mid-ranking officers, a passenger list released by the military shows.  It is the rainy season in Myanmar but a civil aviation official said the weather had been  normal  with good visibility when the plane took off.  The aircraft, bought in March 2016, had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. Nicknamed the  air camel  in Chinese, the multi-purpose aircraft was approved for production in 1980 and is still being produced by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation, a unit of state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China. The four-spoke turboprop is used in developing countries, including China and Sudan. If all 122 on board were killed, the incident could be the deadliest involving the Chinese model, said Chen Xiao, an editor at Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine.  Aircraft accidents, involving both civilian and military planes, are not uncommon in Myanmar.  A military helicopter crashed last June in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board.

Nixon,Robert Mueller III,Robert Swan Mueller III,Tim Weiner,Trump,US,WEINER,COMEY,COMMENTARY,Crime / Law / Justice,Elections / Voting,Russia,Europe,Government / Politics,United States","sector":"Blogs","content":"A smoking gun is extraordinarily rare evidence. Think about it: the gun has been fired, the smoke is curling from the barrel, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation can see the traces. But James B. Comey, dismissed as FBI director by President Trump a month ago, delivered one in his Senate testimony Thursday. It may prove injurious – possibly fatal – to the political fortunes of the Trump administration.  The famous “smoking gun tape” that doomed President Richard M. Nixon was recorded in the Oval Office in June 1972, the week after White House operatives were arrested breaking into Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. Nixon wanted the FBI to halt its Watergate investigation. The Supreme Court ordered Nixon to give up the tape, it provided a clear-cut case of obstruction of justice, and Nixon resigned three days later, in August 1974.  The tape gave the lie to Nixon’s famous protestation that “I am not a crook.” He was.  Comey’s testimony has made it clear that the FBI is on the case again – and that one of the crime scenes is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. One target is retired Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, the shortest-serving national security adviser in American history. It may come to pass that the president himself will fall under investigation for publicly declaring that he fired his former director over the probe into Russia. If so, Trump handed the smoking gun over to Comey all by himself.  MORE FROM REUTERS Comey says Trump fired him to undermine FBI Russia investigation Did Comey's testimony support an obstruction of justice charge? Comey laid down the outlines of a case of obstruction of justice that could be made by Robert Mueller III, his predecessor as FBI director and the recently appointed special counsel in the increasingly malignant case of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  The facts are straightforward but still shocking. Mueller and his investigators now have the meticulous memoranda of conversations Comey had with Trump. Why did the former director feel compelled to make them? “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” Comey said, “and so I thought it really important to document.”  We learned from Comey that Flynn was under criminal investigation, vulnerable to a charge that he lied to FBI agents who interviewed him about his contacts with Russian officials, well before he was forced to resign Feb. 13.  And that the following evening, face to face, one-on-one in the White House, Trump asked Comey to “let Flynn go” – to drop the case.  “Was General Flynn, at that time, in serious legal jeopardy?” asked Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican. “Do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice?”  “There was an open FBI criminal investigation of his (Flynn’s) statements in connection with the Russian contacts and the contacts themselves,” Comey replied. “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense.”  That might be count one if any charges emerge from the probe. This might be count two: “I take the president at his word -- that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Comey said. “Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve.” Firing Comey with the intent of derailing an investigation Trump has constantly called a hoax could also be construed as an obstruction of justice.  “You have the president of the United States asking you to stop an investigation,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. “What was the response of your colleagues?” Comey answered: “I think they were as shocked and troubled by it as I was.”  And, perhaps most disturbing of all, Comey said for the first time that the president’s conduct may fall within “the scope” of the FBI’s investigation. That means that Mueller and the Bureau might be looking at Trump as a potential subject of a criminal case. The law makes it a crime to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede an FBI investigation.  Which brings us back to what we might learn from the case against Nixon. The Justice Department almost certainly cannot indict a sitting president. But back in June 1974, two months before Nixon resigned, news broke that he had been named as an “unindicted co-conspirator” by the federal grand jury in the Watergate case. The defendants in that case included Nixon’s former attorney general, John Mitchell, and the men who had served as his closest White House aides, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. All three went to prison.  At that time, the House Judiciary Committee was weighing articles of impeachment against the president. The charges included obstruction of justice, which the committee defined as an abuse of power in violation of the oath of office he had sworn – to take care that the laws of the land are faithfully executed.  It is difficult – impossible, really -- to contemplate a Republican Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Impeachment looks like a legal proceeding, but it is at root political. An impeachable offense is whatever Congress says it is.  But that decision is ultimately in the hands of the American people. If they think that the man in the White House is a crook, they will have to vote to flip the House and the Senate from red to blue in November 2018. If that happens, the first order of business for the new Congress in January 2019 might conceivably be hearings on impeachment. In the meantime, Robert Swan Mueller III will be working in secrecy on the biggest case in the history of 21st-century America.  About the AuthorTim Weiner is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.

A grand jury in Harris County indicted deputy Chauna Thompson and her husband Terry Thompson each with murder in the May 28 death of John Hernandez in Sheldon, a suburb of Houston, District Attorney Kim Ogg said.   Today, we move one step closer to justice for John Hernandez,  Ogg said during a news conference on Thursday.  Chauna Thompson, who was off duty at the time of the incident, and her husband face five years to life in prison if convicted. The couple surrendered to police on Thursday evening and were each being held on $100,000 bond, media reported.   During the night of May 28, Terry Thompson went with his family to the Denny's where he confronted Hernandez outside the restaurant when he saw him urinating in public, police said.  The two men began fighting before Thompson's wife arrived to meet her family at the restaurant. Chauna Thompson called police for assistance before she helped her husband restrain Hernandez, according to police.  When Chauna Thompson noticed Hernandez was not breathing, she began CPR. He was taken to the hospital where he later died, police said.   A video purportedly showing the incident is on the internet. The footage shows a man on top of another man with his arm around his neck during a confrontation with a woman on her hands and knees next to them. The man on the bottom is kicking his legs and groaning, the video showed.   The video to me is almost by itself enough. You see a person on the ground who is completely immobilized and grunting and moaning. And you see a big guy on top of him choking him and he dies of that choking,  the Hernandez family attorney, Randall Kallinen, told an ABC affiliate in Houston.  Family members of Hernandez, a father of a 3-year-old girl, gathered at the restaurant on Thursday, a day after a march was held calling for justice.  We do not ask for the death penalty,  his aunt, Wendy Maldonado, said during a news conference.   They already took a life. That is enough. This family has a heart and we are filled with love and they are human too.

After two straight losses in Nashville, Pittsburgh blitzed the Predators with three goals in the first period to chase goaltender Pekka Rinne. Six different Penguins found the net as the home team seized a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven series, which shifts back to Nashville on Sunday. The Penguins will have the chance to become the first team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997-98. Sidney Crosby had three assists while Justin Schultz, Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin got on the scoreboard in the opening period.  I think we're just moving our feet,  Crosby told reporters.  When you're moving your feet and you're creating turnovers, you're quick to pucks - there's opportunities there.   I think just like everybody. We did a good job of that and got rewarded for it.

Both Crosby and Subban received minor penalties for holding. Justin Schultz, Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin got on the scoreboard in the opening period for the Penguins. Slideshow (8 Images)The home side added three more scores in the second where Phil Kessel notched his first goal of the Finals, with Conor Sheary and Ron Hainsey adding to the Penguins' tally.  I got lucky and got one,  Kessel said.  You just keep shooting and hopefully one goes in. Whenever you are able to put a lot of points on the board it's a good night.  Pens goaltender Matt Murray recovered from his tough time in Nashville to make 24 stops in the shutout.    Rinne was lifted after allowing three goals on nine shots, while his replacement Juuse Saros surrendered three on 15 shots.  You move forward here, you learn from it and we'll be a lot better in our home rink,  said Predators forward James Neal.  We have to be. We'll be fine.

With results showing May's Conservatives have lost their majority in parliament, party members blamed what one called a  just awful  campaign, training their ire on an election team that highlighted the 60-year-old's flaws by sticking doggedly to an agreed script instead of masking her weaknesses. Without the desired larger majority, May -- if she stays on -- will now be in the thrall of two wings of her party that oppose her plans to leave the European Union:  purists  who want a clean break with the bloc and  remainers  who are pressing for closer ties, two Conservative sources said. That throws into doubt the complex talks on Britain's departure from the EU that are due to begin in just 10 days.  We overestimated our match-fit status. We overestimated the campaign team at the top. We believed the polls and we were cocky,  said one senior Conservative source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Instead of betting on the size of the majority, party insiders were now putting money on when the prime minister would quit, less than a year after she was propelled into Downing Street following Britain's shock decision to exit the EU.  It will be interesting to see who is left standing. Cat fight deluxe,  the source told Reuters. Sure-Fire Bet In April, the political landscape was very different. After a holiday in Wales, May said she had reluctantly decided to bring forward the election by three years to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU, talks which will reshape Britain's role in the world and that of a bloc praised by many for ensuring peace after World War Two. Her decision, reluctant or not, seemed at the time to promise a sure-fire win for a leader who had never led her party into an election. Opinion polls gave her sky-high personal ratings and her party a runaway lead over the opposition Labour Party. They seemed to offer her a cushion to do something she rarely does: change her mind after weeks of vowing no early poll. Surprised by the U-turn, one former co-worker, Tony Smith, said last month that May must have  taken her time out and gone away to think about it  before making the decision.  Once she has, you won't find any prevarication there. I don't think you'll see in her memoirs 'Oh I'm not sure whether I should've called that election back then',  said Smith, the former head of Britain's Border Force who worked closely with May in organising security checks for the London 2012 Olympics. After winning her parliamentary seat, May said on Friday her Conservative Party would take responsibility for delivering stability if it won the most seats in the election.  If, as the indications have shown, and if this is correct that the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do,  May said, without explicitly mentioning her own role. But the outcome will have put paid to the image her aides sought to portray. The  bloody difficult woman  who promised to be  strong and stable  looks anything but.  Maybot  The senior Conservative source blamed the party's over-dependency on the tight messaging demanded by election guru Lynton Crosby for failing to endear May to voters weary of elections and rattled by two militant attacks in as many weeks. More geared to messaging than policy, Crosby, alongside business partner and pollster Mark Textor, wanted to bring strict discipline to the campaign, sticking to party slogans and attacking Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, sources said. They wanted the campaign to focus on May and a clear message that only she could be trusted. At first it seemed to work, but May's decision to introduce a new policy which would see people pay more towards their elderly care was a turning point. The policy went down badly with voters and was attacked by the opposition as an unfair  dementia tax . A local campaign manager in northern England complained that May's closest aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill  had never met a real person in their life  and had badly misread the electorate with the plan. With the Labour Party campaigning on policies such as ending university fees and boosting the police, the slide in the opinion polls for the Conservatives had begun. By the end of the seven week run-up, May had earned the moniker  Maybot  for her robotic performances, was openly mocked by audience members at a question-and-answer session and jeered during a tour of a London meat market. She ended her election campaign with a rally in a half-empty conference hall on the outskirts of Britain's second city, Birmingham. Her advisers said there were 800 activists cheering her on. A Reuters witness put the number closer to 250.  Corbyn ran a way better campaign, he got to more places and got more people to come out to his rallies,  said Labour supporter Alisa Hall outside the London building where Corbyn's votes were counted.  It showed. People weren't excited to go and see Theresa May at a rally.

Appearing in the Dalian Xigang People's Court on Friday, the three staff from Guo's Beijing Pangu Investment confessed in a four-hour trial to obtaining 3.2 billion yuan ($470.5 million) from the Agricultural Bank of China in 2010 by using falsified company contracts, official seals and receipts. The loan was repaid in full in 2014. Two of the defendants also admitted to the false purchase of foreign currency. In an online video posted on Friday, Guo said the facts were  completely different  to the charges, while suggesting any wrongdoing may have been due to his ambitious employees chasing higher pay and bonuses.  (They) want the loan to go through, want to impress their boss,  he said, adding that China's banking regulations sometimes forced people to do things that they wouldn't otherwise do. Guo has emerged in recent months as a political threat to the Chinese government in an acutely sensitive year, after unleashing a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials through Twitter posts and video blogs. The businessman has made it clear that he wants to disrupt a key five-yearly congress to be held this autumn. Guo, who resides in a sprawling $68 million apartment overlooking New York's Central Park, has provided scant evidence to back up his claims. But his standing as a former billionaire insider, and his close ties with one of China's most senior intelligence officials, the disgraced former state security vice-minister Ma Jian, have tantalized a large online following and made him a center of attention in Beijing political circles. While Guo was not named as a defendant in Friday's trial, he featured prominently in the prosecution's line of questioning, with the three employees repeatedly asked to confirm that Guo was the ultimate controller of Pangu and made all major business decisions, including to go ahead with the alleged loan fraud. Foreign Media Allowed Access The Chinese government has been engaged in a sustained effort to discredit and tighten pressure on Guo.  In a highly unusual move showing the Chinese government's determination in countering Guo's damaging allegations online, foreign media were granted access to watch a live feed of proceedings from a media room established in the courthouse. Often foreign media are barred from getting access to such events. Transcripts and footage of proceedings were also posted on the court's official Weibo account, an increasingly common practice used for politically sensitive cases where the government and party-controlled judiciary wants to get its narrative out. The trial on Friday is the first criminal case brought against his company since Beijing requested Interpol issue a global 'red notice' in April for Guo's arrest. One of Guo's chief demands has been that his employees, who have been held indefinitely since they were first detained in early 2015, be freed or at least have a trial in accordance with Chinese law.       As long as they given back their freedom, they can say they committed murder and arson that's fine, as long as they go home,  Guo told Reuters on Friday in a conversation through a messaging service, adding that new  leaders  handling the case had expedited the hearing.   It's practical, this long-term detention is too unfair to them.  The court prosecution summary said Guo would be dealt with  in another case .   Finances at the time were tight and we needed funds so Guo Wengui already contacted the bank, we were just instructed to prepare documents,  Pangu's former finance director Yang Yin told the court.  All the decisions are made by him.  In closing statements, the defendants expressed regret, pleaded tearfully for leniency, and spoke of the impact their lengthy detention had on their families. The court said a verdict would be handed down at an unspecified later date.       The head of Agricultural Bank of China at the time of the loans, Xiang Junbo, who went on to head China's insurance regulator, was investigated for corruption in April.  Guo has previously suggested that he has been engaged in  negotiations with unnamed Chinese officials, and has pointed to the fact his wife and daughter were allowed to visit him in New York as an outcome of those talks.  The legal backlash in the case has not just been felt in China. Other high-profile figures caught in the crossfire of Guo's online allegations have filed defamation suits against him in New York, including the Chairman of property developer SOHO China, Pan Shiyi, and prominent journalist and founder of Caixin Media, Hu Shuli. Australian designer Yuge Bromley also told Reuters she is considering suing Guo, after he said she was an illegitimate child of a senior Communist Party official.

Reuters calculations based on partial election results showed May could no longer win an outright majority, leaving Britain with a 'hung parliament'.  Below are details of what happens next: Who Gets Power? For the election to produce a majority government, the biggest party theoretically must win at least 326 seats of the 650 United Kingdom constituencies. In practice, the threshold for a majority is around 323, because the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party takes up no seats that it wins in Northern Ireland. As incumbent, May has the right to make the first attempt to form a coalition, though her tough stance on Brexit is likely to make finding a suitable partner difficult. Until a new government is formed, May and her team of ministers remain in charge and retain their full legal powers to act on behalf of the country, although by convention they would be expected to avoid taking major decisions.  Minority Conservative Government May signaled she could attempt to lead a government without commanding a majority, relying on her opponents for support in parliament on an issue-by-issue basis.  Speaking as results were still being counted, she said Britain needed a period of stability and that she would take responsibility for delivering it if, as forecast, she won the most seats. This will test the cross-party support for her pre-election pledges. While her hardline Brexit strategy is opposed by all other major parties, Britain has already started the clock ticking on leaving the bloc by triggering a two-year negotiation period with Brussels. It is unlikely she would agree to stopping the Brexit divorce. Nevertheless, May's plans still rely heavily on being able to pass legislation through parliament. Firstly to convert EU law into British law, and then to form new post-Brexit policy on issues like immigration and tax. Delays or outright blockages on this legislation would place doubts over how Britain would control its borders and trade with the EU after Brexit. May's fiscal agenda, including plans to balance the budget by the middle of the next decade through a continuation of existing austerity policy, would also be opposed by rival parties. Her domestic reforms on issues ranging from fox-hunting to cuts to social care and education funding would also meet substantial resistance and demands for change.  However, her plans to clamp down on executive pay, give workers a say on strategy and make it harder for foreign firms to take over British ones could win support in principle, although others would probably demand changes to the policies before agreeing to back them. 2010 Redux: Conservative-Led Coalition The Conservatives formed a coalition in 2010 with the centrist, pro-EU Liberal Democrats as junior partner. They governed together until 2015. The two parties are unlikely to be reunited in coalition without major compromises on the central principle of their election manifestos: Brexit. The Conservatives are committed to a complete break with the EU regardless of whether a satisfactory exit deal can be reached. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats have promised voters a second referendum on whether to accept a deal with Brussels. Electoral maths do not favor a second coalition. The Liberal Democrats were expected to hold around 16 seats, down  from 57 in 2010. This limits their ability to take May's support above the require threshold. The party is led by Tim Farron, 47, who began his campaign by telling Britons they should have the option of rejecting Brexit in a second referendum and remaining within the EU. The Conservatives' other coalition options are limited. They can traditionally rely on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which holds 10 seats. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which was forecast by media commentators to win 35 seats, are at ideological loggerheads with the Conservatives. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has argued that Scotland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU last year, should not be bound by May's plan to withdraw from the EU single market, and have the right to hold an independence referendum at the end of the Brexit process.  Labour-Led Coalition A hung parliament could play in Labour's favor even if it won less seats than the Conservatives because it is politically closer to smaller rivals on several issues. Labour has said it would try to form a minority government, and Corbyn has refused to discuss forming a coalition after June 8.  He is committed to heeding the results of Britain's EU membership referendum a year ago in which 52 percent voted Leave against 48 percent in favor of Remain. However, Labour has fought to water down May's Brexit strategy which could make it easier to reach a compromise with either the Liberal Democrats, which has ruled out any coalition, or the pro-European SNP, which says it wants to stop another Conservative government. Labour has said it will tear up May's Brexit negotiating priorities, instead focusing the talks on retaining the benefits of the EU single market and customs union. It has also promised to consult parliament more closely throughout the negotiations. Corbyn, who would be in charge of negotiating any coalition deal, has said he will ensure there is a deal agreed with the EU before Britain leaves, and give parliament a  meaningful vote  on whether to accept the terms of a final deal.  Labour has not defined what constitutes a meaningful vote, and this would likely be one area where pro-EU parties would demand the power for parliament to send the government back to Brussels to get a better deal - or even to halt the Brexit process altogether. Beyond Brexit, Labour plans a radical change in Britain's fiscal policy: raising taxes on large firms and the wealthy to pay for higher public spending on education, healthcare and police - an agenda that would fit with the anti-austerity SNP. Labour's finance spokesman and close Corbyn ally, John McDonnell, says he can achieve this while ensuring the national debt is reduced over the course of the next parliament. However, Labour has also committed to creating a 250 billion pound fund for investment in infrastructure which will be spent over a 10-year period, indicating it will be funded by borrowing. Economists expect a Labour-led government to substantially increase bond issuance, with the effect of increasing borrowing costs over the long term. In what has been described as one of the most left-wing Labour manifestos for decades, Labour has also promised to take on multinational corporations and what Corbyn has called  wealth extractors . Labour has pledged to raise corporation tax to 26 percent from 19 percent and impose higher taxes on the top 5 percent of earners.

Sterling was down 1.6 percent at $1.2761 after sliding to as low as $1.2693, down about 2 percent and the weakest since April 18. May faced calls to quit on Friday after her election gamble to win a stronger mandate backfired, leaving no single party with a clear claim to power just 10 days ahead of the start of negotiations on Britain's divorce from the European Union. For a graphic on the poll, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48 But reactions in other major currencies such as the dollar, euro and yen were limited, also having taken in stride testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which was initially expected to be the other big event of the week.  Britain's exit from the European Union will continue regardless of the political turmoil likely to be created by the election results. Other currencies, like dollar/yen, are not reacting much as it is a more domestic affair this time, unlike last year's Brexit vote,  said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.  The focus for the broader currency market will now shift towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.  The Fed ends a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates and the focus is on whether it would leave the door open for further monetary tightening in the months to come. The U.S. currency was up 0.2 percent at 110.210 yen. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.221. The index had retreated to a seven-month trough of 96.511 midweek when caution ahead of Comey's testimony and the British election drove U.S. yields to lowest levels since November. But yields have since bounced from the lows as risk aversion ebbed. Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine its investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. While this was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years and was approached by investors with caution, it did not offer fresh insight for the financial markets. The Nasdaq managed to close at a record high on Thursday. Sterling fell earlier to a seven-week low below 140.00 yen before clawing back to 140.69, down about 1.3 percent on the day.  There were many participants who wanted to take advantage of the volatility resulting from a key event like the British elections, which explains the pound's initial steep drop,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The swings in the pound have not spilled over into other currencies as the market was well hedged and prepared for a variety of election scenarios.  The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1204. It had risen to a seven-month high of $1.1285 a week ago as the dollar retreated broadly on weaker-than-expected U.S. employment numbers. But the common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. The Australian dollar shed 0.2 percent to $0.7533 as the greenback firmed. It edged away from a six-week peak of $0.7568 scaled on Wednesday after data showed Australia's economy continued to expand in the first quarter.

In a lecture to university students in Seoul, Bank of Korea board member Cho Dong-chul said the South Korean economy is walking a similar path to that of Japan in terms of demographic changes and nominal growth rate.  There is about a 20-year gap, but looking at population structure and nominal growth rate, South Korea is experiencing a similar situation with that of Japan,  Cho said, according to a speech text released by the Bank of Korea.  Cho also said South Korea's economy won't be able to sustain an annual growth rate of 3 percent for the foreseeable future as recovery in private consumption remains weak. To resolve structural problems in the economy such as low labor market productivity, Cho urged the government to undertake reforms to remove 'zombie companies' and reduce employee protections for the regular workers.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.4 percent, to 3,575.89 points by the lunch break, and was set for its best weekly performance in six months, with a gain of 2.6 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,152.45 points. Underscoring diverging fortunes, the SSE50 Index - dubbed China's  Nifty Fifty  index - jumped 0.6 percent to 17-month highs. In contrast, the start-up board ChiNext lost 0.4 percent, struggling near 2 1/2 year lows. The economy is under pressure from rising financial costs as Beijing steps up deleveraging, hurting smaller firms most. Chinese lenders are scrambling to raise cash ahead of the mid-year health check by the central bank, pushing up deposit rates and yields of wealth management products, local media reported. Higher funding costs are likely to push up lending rates. In a another sign of liquidity tightness, China's one-year treasury yields exceeded 10-year treasury yields on Thursday, an unusual phenomenon last seen in June, 2013. That liquidity tightness was a factor driving funds out of small-caps and into blue-chips, better equipped to handle an economic slowdown, signalled by producer price inflation easing for a third straight month.  In a slowing economy, investors are buying big caps for their earnings quality, visibility and cash flow,  Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International, wrote in a report on Friday. Hong Kong Hong Kong stocks dipped, after repeatedly hitting 23-month highs recently, with sentiment curbed by uncertainly stemming from the outcome of the UK election, as well as major risk events in the United States and Europe. The Hang Seng index dropped 0.3 percent, to 25,999.20 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.7 percent, to 10,581.15. An index tracking Chinese property developers dropped over 2 percent, correcting after rapid recent gains.  With the latest surge in the Hang Seng, our allocation model suggests that it is rapidly losing its appeal,  BOCOM International's Hong said.  While it is likely to push new highs, the easiest gains seem to be already in the bag.

The announcement by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain increases pressure on Qatar over allegations that it interferes in the affairs of its neighbors by supporting and financing Islamist groups. The small Gulf Arab state is a critical global supplier of gas and hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East.   The recent joint statement issued by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE regarding a 'terror finance watch list' once again reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact,  the Qatari government said in a statement.  Our position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement - a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authors.  Qatar said it led the region in attacking what it called the roots of terrorism, giving young people hope through jobs, educating hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and funding community programs to challenge extremist agendas. The four Arab countries named in a statement 59 people, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity.

The notes will have a maturity of up to three years and proceeds from the issue will be used to support the bank's business growth. 'A' National Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely repayment to a greater degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated category. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated at the same level as Bank Jambi's National Long-Term Rating in accordance with Fitch criteria. This is because they will constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of Bank Jambi and rank equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Bank Jambi's rating reflects Fitch's view that the bank is important to the regional government of Jambi province on Sumatra island. Bank Jambi is owned by the government of Jambi province (26.80%), and by the governments of various municipalities (17.39%) and governments of various regencies (55.81%) in Jambi province. Although Bank Jambi is a small bank in the Indonesian banking industry (0.1% of system assets at end-2016), it has a strong franchise in Jambi (around 20% market share by assets) and has an important role in supporting development in the region. Based on its regional significance, Fitch expects potential, albeit limited, extraordinary support from the central government due to its lower systemic importance compared with other larger banks in Indonesia. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any changes in the bank's National Rating would affect the issue rating. Downward rating pressure on the bank's National Rating may arise from a weakening of the central government's ability or propensity to provide extraordinary financial support to Bank Jambi. However, Fitch believes this to be a remote prospect in the near to medium term. Deterioration in the bank's standalone financial profile is unlikely to impact its National Ratings, as its rating is driven by expectation of support from the government. Upside potential for the bank's National Rating may arise if Fitch is of the view that the bank's importance to the local economy has increased, such that the central government has greater propensity to provide extraordinary financial support to Bank Jambi. Upside potential may also arise from considerable improvement in the bank's standalone profile, such as if it successfully closes the gap with its larger Indonesian peers in terms of the size of operations, assets and risk management, while maintaining sound asset quality, high core capitalisation and healthy profitability with predominantly low-cost funding base. However, Fitch views this as unlikely to happen in the near to medium term.

The best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(idn)' for National ratings in Indonesia.

The competitors of Ohio-based Spangler Candy Co have, over the years, moved their plants south to Mexico and beyond to gain unfettered access to the cheaper sugar supplies there. That was part of a shift in manufacturing out of the United States that President Donald Trump has vowed to reverse. Spangler's Chief Executive Officer Kirk Vashaw has kept the candy cane industry alive in the United States at his plant in Ohio, where his firm churns out 200 million candy canes a year.  But the new sugar supply deal will make things tougher still for Spangler, as an agreed rise in the minimum price for Mexican sugar will drive up Spangler's raw material cost.  To be honest, I'm just very disappointed that the Trump administration didn't do more to level the playing field, which is something they promised over and over again to do for the American worker,  Vashaw said in a phone interview with Reuters.  This was an opportunity to do that, and they didn't.  The firm is one of a wide range of food producers, drinks makers and cereal manufacturers across the country that will see sugar input costs higher by about $1 billion above government support prices, according to the Sweetener Users Association. Many of those companies, who oppose the government's support for the sugar industry, will have to consider whether to pass that rise in costs on to consumers. The additional cost is a fraction of the value of the packaged food industry, estimated at around $373 billion in 2016, according to data provider Euromonitor International. Food and beverage firms such as Hershey Co , General Mills Inc, J.M. Smucker Co, Mondelez International Inc will be impacted because they are all companies for which sugar is a key raw material. Hershey said in a statement that it was aware the agreement had the potential to increase sugar prices in the long term. Both Hershey and Mondelez referred Reuters to the Sweeteners Users Association, which in a statement described the pact as a  stealth price increase.  General Mills and Coca-Cola Co declined to comment. PepsiCo Inc, Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc and Mars Inc did not respond to request for comment.  This is putting America second,  said Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, where Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Sprüngli  has its U.S. headquarters.  It's a bad deal for American families and businesses that will raise costs for consumers and threaten jobs in sugar-using industries.  FILE PHOTO - Workers sit next to bags containing sugar at the San Francisco Ameca sugar factory in the town of Ameca, Jalisco, Mexico on February 18, 2011.Alejandro Acosta/File PhotoShaheen is a long-time critic of the sugar program and has pushed for changes.  U.S. sugar companies - which process beet and cane before selling it to food and beverage industries - got better terms out of the deal and yet will not be impacted by the price rise. Refiners were insulated from the impact of the higher raw sugar price by a greater increase in the minimum prices for refined sugar in this week's agreement, so will simply charge the companies and consumers that buy their sugar more. The U.S. sugar industry had asked for better terms after complaining the previous deal with Mexico squeezed refinery margins and starved them of supplies. Cozy Deal The new deal revised the previous 2014 pact and aimed to end years of dispute between the two countries. Larger sugar refiners will benefit the most, as the new terms make it harder for smaller competitors to import sugar from Mexico, which is the top foreign sugar supplier to the United States. That means the smaller sugar buyers will have to pay more for their supplies. Access to the 11 million-tonne annual U.S. sugar market is coveted by sugar exporters as price of the sweetener in the world's largest economy is higher than elsewhere. The market is protected by the government, prices are guaranteed and imports are rationed. The combined impact of those measures means that U.S. sugar buyers will pay about 60 percent more than global benchmark prices. For Spangler, which makes Dum Dum lollipops as well, the rise in prices for Mexican sugar will translate to an around 8 percent rise in what it pays, estimates Vashaw. Spangler opened a plant in Juarez, Mexico, in the early 2000s and now produces a little over half its candy canes there.   If it was all about money, we'd do it all in Mexico,  said Vashaw.  When your main cost driver just went up 8 percent and in Mexico it didn’t go up at all, it just makes any foreign confectionary supplier more cost competitive. That's why a lot of companies moved out of the United States.

The Nikkei business daily reported earlier that Japan's trade ministry would launch a panel as early as this month to revise the country's energy plan and consider building new nuclear plants or replacing existing plants in the future.  The government will keep its current plan, set up in 2014, to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy, according to the Nikkei report, but also says that keeping nuclear power at a minimal share of the overall energy mix would require the construction of new reactors.   At this point, we are not thinking of new construction or replacement at all,  Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters, dismissing the report as groundless.  Seko said the government is discussing the schedule for the revision of its basic energy plan, normally done every three to four years. No details for consideration have been set, he said.  If the government called for a policy that included building new reactors, such a move would face strong public resistance following Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world's worst nuclear calamity since Chernobyl in 1986.

The Australian Security and Intelligence Organization joined police in carrying out search warrants on five addresses linked to Monday's attack in Australia's second-largest city, Victoria state Deputy Police Commissioner Shane Patton said. Police shot dead gunman Yacqub Khayre, who they said had a long criminal history, on Monday night after he killed a man in an apartment block in a beachside Melbourne suburb and held a woman hostage for several hours.  Three police officers were wounded in a shootout at the end of the siege but the woman was unhurt. Patton told reporters a 32-year-old man was arrested after Friday's raids, however police later said they released the man without charge. A second man, 31, and his father were being questioned by counter-terrorism police, he said. The men were not suspected of militant activity but  they may be involved in the provision of firearms in this matter , Patton said. Police said they seized computers and mobile phones and an imitation shotgun, but no firearms or live ammunition. A Reuters witness saw five uniformed and plain-clothed police wearing gloves and breathing masks entering an apartment in a three-storey block and putting household items into plastic evidence bags.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Friday said state laws will be changed to stop any prisoner who has links to terror organizations being eligible for parole or bail.  Australia passed laws last year allowing the indefinite detention of anyone convicted of terror-related offences if authorities believed that person posed a threat after their release.  If you have someone who has terrorist sympathies and who has a propensity to violence, every day they are not on the street is a good day,  Turnbull told reporters.  I look forward to the first ministers today agreeing that there will be a strong presumption against bail or parole for persons who have shown support for, or have had links to, terrorism or violent extremism,  he said. Khayre was also acquitted of a plot to attack a Sydney army base in 2009.

Altuve hit a two-run homer as the Houston Astros sent 10 men to the plate in a five-run ninth inning to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-1 on Thursday night. Josh Reddick began the ninth with a four-pitch walk before Altuve connected. He did not want manager A.J. Hinch to put on the take sign before Kelvin Herrera threw a strike.  I think when a pitcher walks one batter with four pitches, he wants to come back to the zone,  Altuve said.  I was praying for A.J. to let me hit. He gave me the green light, and I hit a good pitch.  Lance McCullers' no-hit bid ended with one out in the seventh when he gave up a triple to Kansas City's Lorenzo Cain. After McCullers struck out Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas' single to right drove in Cain to make it 1-1. In the ninth, Altuve hit a Kelvin Herrera (1-2) fastball on a 1-0 pitch out to left-center to break a 1-1 tie. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at RoyalsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch It starts with the lead-off walk, which probably won't get talked about a ton,  Hinch said.  But Reddick set the tone. Jose hunted a heater after a lot of balls from Herrera.  The inning also included a triple from Carlos Correa, who scored on a Brian McCann sacrifice fly. Jake Marisnick drove in the other two runs with a single.  Herrera was just flat,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He struggled with his command. He threw five straight balls and got a pitch up to Altuve. He didn't miss it. He's a strong guy and he put it in the seats. Just a great game until the ninth inning and things kind of caved in on us.  Herrera's ERA jumped to 5.55 as he gave up four runs in one-third of an inning. Will Harris (2-1) picked up the victory with a scoreless eighth inning. Houston's Nori Aoki scored on a Jason Hammel balk in the sixth. Hammel allowed four hits and struck out four in seven innings.  Trust the process, have confidence in what you're doing and things will turn around,  Hammel said.  Two good ones in a row. Again, no walks and that's what I try to focus on. More ground balls this time than last time out, so it means we're getting to the bottom of the zone.  Hammel lobbied Yost to remain in the game.  I definitely wanted to go back out there,  Hammel said.  It's not my call to make. I tried to plead as much as I could. I felt like I put on a pretty good argument, but ultimately in that situation let the bullpen do their job. It's their job to finish up those late tight games like that.  I did my job tonight. I tried to go out and keep trying to do it because I felt good. Things are starting to head in the right direction, so obviously you want to keep doing that. We had a chance to win, so I can't be too upset about it.  McCullers faced the minimum number of batters the first five innings. He wound up pitching seven innings and yielding a run on two hits and two walks. McCullers struck out eight.  His curveball is better, but tonight his changeup was exceptional,  Yost said.  And he threw more of them tonight than he has been. He had a good one and he was using it.  The Royals' only early baserunner was rookie Jorge Bonifacio, who walked with one out in the first. He was instantly erased when Cain rolled into a 6-4-3 double play.

The Colorado right-hander gave up a first-inning home run and then little else, leading the Rockies to a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs in the opener of a four-game series.  He's got it in him to pitch a good, solid game,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  Tonight, the key was fastball location, especially down and away to their big left-handed hitters.  Charlie Blackmon went 2-for-3 with an RBI, and DJ LeMahieu added a three-run homer as the National League West leaders (39-23) won their fifth straight and sixth in seven games. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at CubsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchChatwood (6-7) pitched six innings and allowed one run on four hits. He walked two, struck out four and improved to 3-0 all-time against the Cubs. Left-hander Jon Lester (3-4) worked five innings of four-run ball for Chicago (30-29), which has lost two straight. Lester missed out on claiming his 150th victory and now has two losses and a no-decision in his last three outings. He is 1-3 all-time against Colorado.  We were a little out of the zone today,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  The thing about Chatwood was the sinker was that good today. Even though we might have been chasing a little bit low, the ball was really dive-bombing at the end.  Three Rockies relievers -- Scott Oberg, Jake McGee and closer Greg Holland -- took it the rest of the way, allowing just two baserunners and no runs in the final three innings. Holland pitched the ninth to collect his 22nd save. Kris Bryant's team-leading 14th homer of the season gave the Cubs a 1-0 first-inning lead. The Rockies replied with four runs in the top of the second -- all coming after two outs. Tony Wolters and Chatwood singled, and Blackmon doubled to shallow left field to drive in a run. LeMahieu then homered to right for a 4-1 lead.  That's a really good pitcher (Lester) out there, and luckily he threw one in and I was able to step in the bucket far enough that my barrel got to it, and it worked out,  Chatwood said.  Then Charlie got a big hit and then DJ hit a home run which was huge.  After Bryant's homer, Chatwood didn't give up another hit until Anthony Rizzo's single to right with one out in the fourth. Lester walked one and struck out five while throwing 94 pitches.  Jon was really good actually,  Maddon said.  They hit the one homer, but otherwise he had a pretty good outing.  The Cubs were without shortstop Addison Russell, told to take Thursday off in the wake of allegations of domestic abuse against his wife, Melissa, that surfaced on social media on Wednesday. Major League Baseball is investigating. NOTES: Colorado two took of three from the Cubs in a May 9-10 set at Coors Field that included a split doubleheader after a rainout the night before.

Sterling was down 1.5 percent at $1.2764 after sliding to as low as $1.2693, down about 2 percent and the weakest since April 18. An updated BBC forecast predicted May's Conservatives would win 318 of the 650 seats, eight short of a majority, while Corbyn's left-wing Labour would take 267 -- producing a  hung parliament  and potential deadlock. Such a shock result was expected to plunge domestic politics into turmoil and alter the nature of Brexit talks. For a graphic on the poll, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48 But reactions in other major currencies such as the dollar, euro and yen were limited, also having taken in stride testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which was initially expected to be the other big event of the week.  Britain's exit from the European Union will continue regardless of the political turmoil likely to be created by the election results. Other currencies, like dollar/yen, are not reacting much as it is a more domestic affair this time, unlike last year's Brexit vote,  said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.  The focus for the broader currency market will now shift towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.  The Fed ends a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates and the focus is on whether it would leave the door open for further monetary tightening in the months to come. The U.S. currency was up 0.25 percent at 110.275 yen. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.222. The index had retreated to a seven-month trough of 96.511 midweek when caution ahead of Comey's testimony and the British election drove U.S. yields to lowest levels since November. But yields have since bounced from the lows as risk aversion ebbed. Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine its investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. While this was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years and was approached by investors with caution, it did not offer fresh insight for the financial markets. The Nasdaq managed to close at a record high on Thursday. Sterling fell earlier to a seven-week low below 140.00 yen before clawing back to 140.69, down about 1.3 percent on the day.  There were many participants who wanted to take advantage of the volatility resulting from a key event like the British elections, which explains the pound's initial steep drop,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The swings in the pound have not spilled over into other currencies as the market was well hedged and prepared for a variety of election scenarios.  The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1200. It had risen to a seven-month high of $1.1285 a week ago as the dollar retreated broadly on weaker-than-expected U.S. employment numbers. But the common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. The Australian dollar shed 0.2 percent to $0.7536 as the greenback firmed. It edged away from a six-week peak of $0.7568 scaled on Wednesday after data showed Australia's economy continued to expand in the first quarter.

A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND VIABILITY RATING First Credit Union's IDRs and Viability Rating reflect a higher risk appetite relative to most other deposit taking institutions in New Zealand; this is likely to increase asset quality volatility through a cycle. The credit union's risk appetite partly reflects its customer base, which represents a part of the economy that is less adequately serviced by the country's banks. The credit union's rating also reflect its modest profitability stemming from a high operating cost base that limits its capacity to absorb higher losses from weaker asset quality. Conversely, First Credit Union reports strong capital ratios relative to peers and high liquid asset holdings. First Credit Union's higher risk appetite is manifested via geographic concentration and its loan portfolio split; about half of all loans at end-June 2016 (FYE16) were consumer loans, with the remainder being residential mortgages. Residential mortgages with a loan/value ratio above 80% made up about a third of all mortgages, a high proportion compared with New Zealand's banks and building societies. This loan split contributed to weaker asset quality relative to several peers; impaired loans were 2.8% of gross loans at FYE16. First Credit Union has low profitability relative to the nature of its business, limiting its ability to absorb higher loan losses and generate capital. This is partially due to its mutuality - where owners are also customers - with benefits returned to members through loan and deposit pricing. Limited economies of scale and a focus on customer service also weakened its operational efficiency relative to larger peers. Planned changes to First Credit Union's IT provider and the manufacturer of some products pose operational risks. Poor implementation that impairs customer service may negatively affect its franchise. However, successful implementation, including the establishment of a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, could support improved product offerings and profitability in the longer term. Fitch expects First Credit Union to maintain its capital and liquidity positions, which can offset some of these risks. Its capital ratios, both risk- and unrisk-weighted, have consistently been toward the top-end of those reported by domestic peers, although the absolute capital base is small. Cash and bank deposits made up over 40% of total assets at FYE16, with nearly 70% at call or maturing within three months. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR First Credit Union's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that support from authorities cannot be relied upon in the event of need. The existence of a bank resolution scheme, which allows the imposition of losses on depositors and senior debt holders to recapitalise a failed institution, indicates a low propensity for the sovereign to support financial institutions, despite the scheme not applying to First Credit Union. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND VIABILITY RATING First Credit Union's IDRs and Viability Rating are sensitive to a change in the credit union's risk appetite and earnings. Ratings may be upgraded if there is a sustained improvement in risk appetite, possibly through lower-risk underwriting or a stronger risk control framework, while maintaining strong capital ratios and high liquidity. Positive rating action may also occur if earnings become more commensurate with the level of risk assumed by First Credit Union. Alternatively, ratings are likely to face downward pressure if there is a weakening in First Credit Union's risk appetite, possibly due to a deterioration in underwriting standards that increases the risk of significant deterioration or greater volatility in key financial metrics. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to changes in assumptions around the propensity or ability of the New Zealand authorities to provide timely support to First Credit Union. The existence of a bank resolution framework means Fitch is unlikely to upgrade these ratings.

China said it was working to verify the claim. Armed men pretending to be policemen kidnapped the two language teachers in Quetta, the capital of the southwestern province, on May 24. The kidnapping was a rare security incident involving Chinese nationals in Pakistan, where Beijing has pledged $57 billion under its massive  Belt and Road  initiative to build rail, road and power infrastructure. China says Pakistan is a major part of its plans to build a modern day  Silk Road  network of land and maritime routes to connect Asia with Africa and Europe. Key parts of the infrastructure will be in Baluchistan, including the new port of Gwadar, which will be linked to western China under current plans. The killing of the teachers was claimed by Islamic State's Amaq news agency on Thursday.  Islamic State fighters killed two Chinese people they had been holding in Baluchistan province, southwest Pakistan,  Amaq said. A Baluchistan government spokesman said officials were in the process of confirming whether the report was correct. China's Foreign Ministry expressed grave concern.  We have been trying to rescue the two kidnapped hostages over the past days. The Chinese side is working to learn about and verify relevant information through various channels, including working with Pakistani authorities,  the ministry said in a short statement.  The Chinese side is firmly opposed to the acts of kidnapping civilians in any form, as well as terrorism and extreme violence in any form,  it said. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan's interior ministry or its foreign office. Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, said in an editorial on Friday China would never bow in the face of terror, but also said Chinese people should also exercise greater caution abroad, especially in more remote areas.  They also need to raise their ability to protect themselves, and as much as possible put distance between themselves and real danger,  it said. China has not formally identified the two teachers. Chinese media has cited foreign media reports as identifying the two as a man and a woman who worked for a private language school. The claim of the killings sparked anger on Chinese social media, with some strongly anti-Muslim comments. Islamic State, which controls some territory in neighbouring Afghanistan, has struggled to establish a presence in Pakistan. However, it has claimed several major attacks, including one on the deputy chairman of the Senate last month in Baluchistan, in which 25 people were killed. On Thursday, Pakistan's military published details of a three-day raid on a militant hideout in a cave not far from Quetta, saying it had killed 12  hardcore terrorists  from a banned local Islamist group and prevented Islamic State from gaining a  foothold  in Baluchistan. China's ambassador to Pakistan and other officials have often urged Islamabad to improve security, especially in Baluchistan. The numbers of Pakistanis studying Mandarin has skyrocketed since 2014, when President Xi Jinping signed off on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Consequently, any attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan would come as an embarrassment to Islamabad, which greatly prizes its relationship with Beijing. The two refer to each other as  all weather friends . Security in Baluchistan has improved in recent years, but separatists, who view infrastructure projects as a ruse to steal natural resources, killed 10 Pakistani workers building a road near the new port of Gwadar this month, a key part of the economic corridor. China has also expressed concern about militants in Pakistan linking up with what China views as separatists in the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have been killed in violence in recent years.

After a tough loss to the Boston Red Sox in the series opener, it was quite a bounce-back for the Yankees and their young sluggers. Judge had three hits -- including the hardest hit ball in the majors this season -- and Sanchez continued his personal success against David Price by homering in consecutive at-bats as New York rolled to a 9-1 victory over Boston on Thursday. Judge tied a career high with three hits, though the right fielder did not hit a long homer. His single in the sixth off Fernando Abad was clocked at 119.6 mph off the bat, though some teammates might have doubted the reading.  That's funny,  third baseman Chase Headley said with a laugh.  Gardy (Brett Gardner) and I were actually arguing about that. That's the hardest-hit ball I've seen from him all year? He's hit 15 balls harder than that. That's botched. I don't agree with that. Judge said he didn't hit that good either. I mean, he hits the ball really hard consistently.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at YankeesBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchJudge's latest hard hit occurred after Sanchez drove two pitches well over the fence. Sanchez slugged a three-run homer over the left field wall with one out in the third, then added a two-run shot with no outs in the fifth. Those homers gave the Yankees a 6-1 lead and marked the ninth multi-homer game for New York this season. It was Sanchez's fifth career multi-homer game and second in a week. He previously connected twice off Toronto's Marco Estrada. On Thursday, the right-handed-hitting catcher was in his second game after being moved to sixth in the lineup. He snapped an 0-for-11 skid and wowed teammates by improving to 4-for-7 lifetime off Price -- all home runs.  He's a great hitter,  Judge said.  I've seen that in the minor leagues for years now, and you saw what he did last year for two months (in the majors). I think he's starting to feel it a little bit now.   It's exciting. Every time that guy comes up to the plate, he's due to do some damage, and that's what he did tonight.  Beside the big nights from New York's young sluggers, Gardner had an RBI single and slugged his 13th homer. Starlin Castro drove in two runs with a run-scoring single and an RBI groundout as the Yankees outscored the Red Sox 17-1 in the final two games after Masahiro Tanaka allowed three homers Tuesday. The offensive explosion made things easy for Michael Pineda, who became New York's second seven-game winner. Pineda (7-3) rebounded nicely from a shaky start Friday in Toronto by allowing an unearned run and four singles in seven innings.  You're feeling good when you're seeing a lot of scoring in the game, and when you see the catcher hitting two homers, a great day for him,  Pineda said.  I'm happy.  Price (1-1) allowed six runs and eight hits in five innings during his third start of the season. Price's worst start since returning from a strained left elbow also occurred less than 24 hours after he got into a heated exchange with a Boston media member following Wednesday's game.  It was not tough at all to focus today,  Price said.  This is baseball. Stuff happens. It happens to the best of the best. It happened to me tonight.  Manager John Farrell said Price had a slight blister on his ring finger but did not believe it impacted his performance. Farrell also didn't think Wednesday's incident factored into the loss. Xander Bogaerts scored the only Boston run on a passed ball by Sanchez in the fourth. After Hanley Ramirez, Andrew Benintendi and Mitch Moreland homered off Tanaka, the Red Sox scored once in the final 22 innings of the series. NOTES: Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia (left wrist sprain) likely will be activated from the 10-day disabled list for the Friday game against the Detroit Tigers, manager John Farrell said. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi answered several questions about struggling RHP Masahiro Tanaka and reiterated that the veteran is still scheduled to start Sunday against the Baltimore Orioles, though GM Brian Cashman later said Tanaka could be pushed back a day. ... Red Sox LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee subluxation) played catch without difficulty after making throws from 120 feet Wednesday. ... New York 1B Greg Bird (bruised right ankle) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre and went 1-for-3 with two walks.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED699ERTTG"},

Following are comments from financial market analysts and traders as results come in.  For comment from politics and political commentators, click on Latest Comments  Sim Moh Siong, Fx Strategist for Bank of Singapore   The bigger picture here is that what the consensus was thinking about in terms of the smooth, phased-in, hard Brexit may now need a re-think. That means there could be a lot of volatility.  He said that sterling could eventually fall below $1.25.   Closer to $1.20, I still see sterling as a cheap currency, so there is value in sterling. But I think people are going to hold off for the time being and sterling is likely to probe to the downside.   Stephen Innes, Senior Trader for Oanda  It's puzzling. It really is. Everybody is looking for room to the downside on sterling on this move, but it's not happening. The banks are out there calling for 1.24. So tell me, who's on the bid here at 1.27 and supporting it? I think I'm going to stick to my guns and think it's going to drop.   Gareth Berry, Fx Strategist at Macquarie Bank in Singapore  It’s very hard to see Corbyn as PM based on the arithmetic so far. Tories are very likely to form the backbone of the next government. If Ulster unionists hold the balance of power, there will be no Brexit dilution at all.   Even in the unlikely case Corbyn becomes PM, questions about fiscal restraint under Labour (and economic policy more generally) may end up hurting sterling anyway regardless of Labour’s generally pro-EU stance. Admittedly, a Tory-Lib Dem coalition has a decent chance of securing a soft Brexit, but it is a very unlikely pairing given their Brexit stances seem  irreconcilable.  CLIFF TAN, EAST ASIAN HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKETS RESEARCH, MUFG   Investors shouldn't only focus on sterling as a way to play the election. Japanese equities may be vulnerable and could initially sell off due to the uncertainties of the poll.  The dollar continues to gain some ground, which suggests the UK results not only reflect Brexit sentiment but are also a judgment on domestic politics. We predict there will be a Nikkei sell-off until the London market opens. If we see the dollar continuing to rally regardless of sterling, we'll know the election is having an international impact.   Jameel Ahmad, Vice-President of Market Research at Fxtm  If the momentum of the votes begin to shift in favor of what the preliminary polls have suggested will be a hung parliament, the Pound will be at risk to retracing all of its gains that it has made since Theresa May unexpectedly called the election. This ultimately means that the Pound could drift to 1.25 within the next few hours if market uncertainty heats up.  Earlier Comments JASON WARE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT ALBION FINANCIAL IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH:     ​This is an exit poll... there is a lot to figure out over the next few hours. The pound is getting hit in the aftermarket and that's probably a symptom of uncertainty.   If there are any changes to Brexit it's probably a more globalized, softer Brexit which could be positive if anything. The biggest concern for markets last year when we went through Brexit was this could be the beginning of the end of the cooperation of the European Union and euro zone ... and that the UK could go into recession. But if we get more of a softer Brexit or more of a globalist stance from the UK...​its good for Europe, the UK and U.S. assets.  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER AT ALLIANZ, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF:   With initial exit polls pointing to the Tories losing seats and that Prime Minister May’s early election gamble is not paying off, markets are pricing in a more complex outlook for policy implementation, including Brexit.   JOE O'LEARY, SENIOR FX TRADER AT SILICON VALLEY BANK IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA  There's certainly some downside risk for the pound if the exit poll bears out. Theresa May's position as PM looks more uncertain than it did earlier today. Right now I expect mostly volatility. You think there would be some strengthening in the safe-haven currencies, but the dollar/yen have not moved much. It might just be because of thin trading and some skepticism about the exit poll.  PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO:  We could see probably a day or two of jumping around. We saw this with the Brexit vote - that was very unexpected. We got the selloff and the markets rallied back.  So initially it could be a negative but it also depends on the makeup of Parliament.   The political and the economic are separate here. While it's politically interesting, like Brexit, the French election, the U.S. election etc, it really is going to start to depend on what they're able to do economically and whether they're going to able to push through any legislation, change anything etc. And that we have no idea on.  STEPHEN SIMONIS SR., CHIEF CURRENCY CONSULTANT, FXDD GLOBAL, NEW YORK  It is vital to realize that this move happened at 5 p.m. NY time after markets have closed. This is an extremely illiquid time. And while one can understand why GBP would be lower on the Tories’ lack of a majority, this move seems extreme. Certainly, electronic stop losses were triggered along the way to further exaggerate the move.   Much lies ahead for England with the negotiations coming up and the recent terror attacks continue to be an ongoing issue. In the short term, the drop seems extreme and we expect a bounce back up in the pound; in the longer term we can see the pound pushing lower towards 1.2500.  Dean Turner, Economist at Ubs Wealth Management  Should the poll prove accurate, it is likely that the pound will give up the bulk of its post-election announcement gains. After this, retreating back to the low 1.20 levels versus the U.S. dollar is a very real possibility. Nevertheless, sterling has steadied following the initial sell-off and there are few signs that anxiety has spread into other markets just yet.  Samuel Tombs, Chief Uk Economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics  This exit poll is a thunderbolt that leaves only two outcomes realistically in play: a slender Tory majority or a hung parliament. The exit poll’s biggest error in the last two decades was in 2015 when it under-predicted the Conservatives’ seats by 14. We see the risks to the seat projection as evenly balanced, given that its estimate was slightly too high in the four previous elections.     Lee Hardman, Currency Analyst at Mufg  The market will be praying that this exit poll has got it wrong. Currency volatility is the best proxy for market fears.  If the Conservative ship is sinking then the market will be looking for a life boat.  ALAN CLARKE, HEAD EUROPEAN FIXED-INCOME STRATEGY, SCOTIABANK  There has got to be a good chance that (May) stands down as prime minister in this environment. The betting websites have Boris Johnson as 2:1 to be the next prime minister after Theresa May.  Paul Hollingsworth, Economist, Capital Economics   The economy looks set to face a period of uncertainty about the outlook for policy, Brexit and the possibility of another election. Admittedly, the exit poll could yet be proved wrong.   KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK  It wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility to see pound/dollar drop below $1.26 or even $1.25. All of the sterling crosses are down. All of that is significant.  Jordan Rochester, Fx Strategist, Nomura    This is the hung parliament territory, it's also what we had for the last election pretty much, but then the real numbers on the night came up with a majority, so it's not over yet, folks. But we possibly have the Labour + Scottish National Party + Liberal Democrat coalition possibility in play here. But it’s still hard to form a coalition with Labour + others here, given their total only reaches the same number more or less than that of the Conservatives.   Craig Erlam, Analyst With Brokerage Oanda in London  A hung parliament is the worst outcome from a markets perspective as it creates another layer of uncertainty ahead of the Brexit negotiations and chips away at what is already a short timeline to secure a deal for Britain.

Appearing in the Dalian Xigang People's Court on Friday, the three staff from Guo's Beijing Pangu Investment confessed to obtaining 3.2 billion yuan ($470.5 million) from the Agricultural Bank of China in 2010 by using falsified company contracts, official seals and receipts. The loan was repaid in full in 2014. Two of the defendants also admitted to the false purchase of foreign currency. In an online video posted on Friday, Guo said he was unaware of his employees’ actions concerning the alleged loan fraud. Guo has emerged in recent months as a political threat to the Chinese government in an acutely sensitive year, after unleashing a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials through Twitter posts and video blogs. The businessman has made it clear that he wants to disrupt a key five-yearly congress to be held this autumn. Guo, who resides in a sprawling $68 million apartment overlooking New York's Central Park, has provided scant evidence to back up his claims. But his standing as a former billionaire insider, and his close ties with one of China's most senior intelligence officials, the disgraced former state security vice-minister Ma Jian, have tantalised a large online following and made him a center of attention in Beijing political circles. While Guo was not named as a defendant in Friday's trial, he featured prominently in the prosecution's line of questioning, with the three employees repeatedly asked to confirm that Guo was the ultimate controller of Pangu and made all major business decisions, including to go ahead with the alleged loan fraud. Foreign Media Allowed Access The Chinese government has been engaged in a sustained effort to discredit and tighten pressure on Guo. In a highly unusual move showing the Chinese government's determination in countering Guo's damaging allegations online, foreign media were granted access to watch a live feed of proceedings from a media room established in the courthouse. Often foreign media are barred from getting access to such events. Transcripts and footage of proceedings were also posted on the court's official Weibo account, an increasingly common practice used for politically sensitive cases where the government and party-controlled judiciary wants to get its narrative out. The trial on Friday is the first criminal case brought against his company since Beijing requested Interpol issue a global 'red notice' in April for Guo's arrest. One of Guo's chief demands has been that his employees, who have been held indefinitely since they were first detained in early 2015, be freed or at least have a trial in accordance with Chinese law.  As long as they given back their freedom, they can say they committed murder and arson that's fine, as long as they go home,  Guo told Reuters on Friday in a conversation through a messaging service, adding that new  leaders  handling the case had expedited the hearing.  It's practical, this long-term detention is too unfair to them.  The court prosecution summary said Guo would be dealt with  in another case .  Finances at the time were tight and we needed funds so Guo Wengui already contacted the bank, we were just instructed to prepare documents,  Pangu's former finance director Yang Yin told the court.  All the decisions are made by him.  The head of Agricultural Bank of China at the time of the loans, Xiang Junbo, who went on to head China's insurance regulator, was investigated for corruption in April. Guo has previously suggested that he has been engaged in negotiations with unnamed Chinese officials, and has pointed to the fact his wife and daughter were allowed to visit him in New York as an outcome of those talks. The legal backlash in the case has not just been felt in China. Other high-profile figures caught in the crossfire of Guo's online allegations have filed defamation suits against him in New York, including the Chairman of property developer SOHO China, Pan Shiyi, and prominent journalist and founder of Caixin Media, Hu Shuli. Australian designer Yuge Bromley also told Reuters she is considering suing Guo, after he said she was an illegitimate child of a senior Communist Party official.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A day after controversy erupted regarding Derek Norris, his bat erupted for two home runs, lifting the Tampa Bay Rays to a 7-5 win against the Chicago White Sox on Thursday at Tropicana Field. Major League Baseball is investigating allegations from Norris' former fiancee that the catcher  physically and mentally abused  her. Norris denied the allegations in a statement Wednesday. On Thursday, he was ready to talk about his successful night on the field.  I've had a lot of at-bats on (White Sox starter Derek Holland) over the years, so I have a decent idea of what he's trying to execute,  Norris said.  First time he hung a slider over the middle of the plate, and on the second one he just lobbed a changeup in there.  Tampa Bay (31-31) took two of three against the White Sox to move back to .500. Rays starter Jake Odorizzi (4-3) went 6 2/3 innings and gave up three runs on eight hits. Alex Colome recorded four outs for his 17th save. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RaysChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchChicago (25-33) did its best to rally from a 6-0 deficit in the late innings. The White Sox finally got to Odorizzi in the top of the sixth when Avasail Garcia belted a three-run homer to left-center field to make the score 6-3.  Just an unfortunate sequence with three hitters,  Odorizzi said.  Two bad pitches to (Jose) Abreu and probably the worst changeup of the day to Garcia, and he hit it out. Otherwise I felt good to get into the seventh inning and throw over 100 pitches.  Todd Frazier added a two-run homer off reliever Ryne Stanek in the eighth inning to make the score 6-5. Tim Anderson followed with a double and stole third base with one out, but Stanek and Colome got the final two outs without any further damage.  We fought our way back,  Frazier said.  (White Sox manager Rick Renteria) kind of got in us a little bit in the dugout. We had a chance to even tie or win it.  Colby Rasmus provided an insurance run for the Rays in the bottom of the eighth inning with a solo homer to right field off Gregory Infante. The Rays took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Kevin Kiermaier's hit to center field bounced off Adam Engel's chest off the hop and was ruled a double. Tim Beckham scored on the play. Norris made the score 2-0 in the bottom of the third with his first home run, a solo shot to left field off Holland. The Rays tacked on a second run in the inning with an RBI bloop single from Evan Longoria that Peter Bourjos scored. Tampa Bay extended its lead with three more runs off Holland in the bottom of the fourth. Norris hit his second homer of the game, a two-run blast to nearly the same spot in left field. Bourjos followed with a solo home run, the eighth time this season the Rays hit back-to-back homers.  It started with (Norris), but then Bourjos, a really big home run,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  To be a good team, you have to have contributions throughout (the lineup). It's not always going to happen at the same time, but when other guys are quiet, somebody has to pick them up.  Chicago had opportunities early but failed to capitalize. In the top of the third inning, Willy Garcia hit a double to right center field and advanced to third on a throwing error. Beckham's throw to get Willy Garcia at third sailed over Longoria's head, but Bourjos fielded the ball and threw Garcia out at home. The White Sox had runners on second and third with one out in the top of the fifth inning but Odorizzi struck out Kevan Smith and retired Willy Garcia on a grounder to second to escape the jam. Holland gave up six runs on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings before being replaced by Juan Minaya.  Derek, obviously we tried to get him through five,  Renteria said.  They dusted him up a little bit. I think he just elevated some pitches over the plate again.  NOTES: Rays OF Kevin Kiermaier left in the fifth inning with a right hip injury after taking a fall during a close play at first base. He was on crutches after the game ... The Rays optioned RHP Jacob Faria to Triple-A Durham and activated OF Peter Bourjos (tennis elbow) off the 10-day disabled list before the game. ... White Sox RHP Jake Petricka (strained right lat) made his third relief appearance on his rehab assignment with Triple-A Charlotte on Wednesday. ... White Sox RHP Brad Goldberg was optioned to Charlotte after the Thursday game.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED699EJMSZ"},

The highly anticipated blueprint, presented to federal and state leaders, is expected to drive a compromise on carbon and energy policy, urgently needed to curb power price volatility and end outages that have hurt manufacturers. The energy security review was commissioned last October after tornadoes slammed transmission lines in South Australia, triggering a state-wide blackout that left homes in the dark for up to eight hours and crippled industry for nearly two weeks.  The lack of a transparent, credible and enduring emissions reduction mechanism for the electricity sector is now the key threat to system reliability,  the review said. The energy crisis has crept up on Australia, despite its rich endowment of coal and gas, as states have promoted rooftop solar and wind power in the absence of stable carbon policy at a federal level over the past 10 years.  More of the same is not an option, we need to aim higher,  Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, the head of the review panel, said in a statement. Finkel called for the government to set a clean energy target, designed to encourage investment in  reliable generation , including coal with carbon capture and storage or gas. It would also require all new generators to have  fast response  capabilities to deal with frequency fluctuations, which means variable sources like wind and solar farms would need to be teamed with sources like gas-fired power or energy storage. The report said large generators should have to give three years' notice before closing to avoid shocks to the market.  If we adopt a strategic approach, we will have fewer local and regional problems, and can ensure that consumers pay the lowest possible prices over the long term,  Finkel said. To help cut bills, consumers should be rewarded for cutting power use and for generating power from sources like rooftop solar, the report said. Defying state bans on gas drilling and green groups' calls for no new gas-fired power, Finkel said gas is essential for providing reliable electricity, and governments should work with communities to encourage safe exploration and production of gas.  For the short to medium-term the NEM (national electricity market) is likely to require higher levels of flexible, gas-fired generation to support (wind and solar),  the report said. Urgent action is needed not just to stabilise the grid, but also to cut carbon emissions. Based on the current energy mix and expected growth, Australia's emissions in 2030 are projected to be about 57 percent higher than its target of 290 million tonnes under the Paris climate accord, according to the nation's top research body.
